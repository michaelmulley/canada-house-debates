exclusive authority to make laws in relation to education but</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>That, notwithstanding any standing or special order, if at 9.30 p.m. on 
Monday, June 3, Government Order, Government Business No. 5 has not been 
disposed of:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The House shall continue to sit until the said business is disposed of;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. During the continued sitting, no member shall speak for more than 10 
minutes; in other words, no questions or comments;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. Any divisions standing deferred to the said date shall be postponed until 
the said business is disposed of;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. The House shall adjourn immediately after the completion of any such 
deferred division.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	For the benefit of our colleagues, it is because there is already a 
vote which was previously deferred and we would want to delay 
that vote as well until the conclusion of our business.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), I 
wish to indicate that all Liberal members of Parliament during the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3244"> 3244 </A></B>
<P>
debate on Government Order, Government Business No. 5, except 
for the lead off speaker, will be limited to 10 minute speeches.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the resolution invites the House of 
Commons to agree to an amendment to the Constitution of Canada 
which would give effect to certain changes in the manner in which 
denominational schools are administered and governed in the 
province of Newfoundland.
<P>
	The resolution is before the House pursuant to section 43 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. Perhaps it is best to start with an 
examination of that section in order to better understand the nature 
of our role and function on this occasion.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	As noted in the preamble to the Resolution, section 43 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982 provides for an amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada in relation to any provision that applies to 
one or more, but not all, provinces.
<P>
	This amendment may be made by proclamation issued by the 
Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada where so 
authorized by resolutions of the Senate and House of Commons 
and of the legislative assembly of each province to which the 
amendment applies. Therefore, it is up to us to consider the 
proposed amendment and to decide whether to approve it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This change relates only to the educational system in 
Newfoundland, which reflects a feature of our federation. Our 
Constitution starting in 1867 made clear that education is to be 
within the legislative authority of the provinces. Because by the 
time each of the provinces in its turn joined the federation and there 
were arrangements governing religious involvement in education, 
the Constitution protected and perpetuated those arrangements by 
its terms.
<P>
	In the case of the four original provinces section 93 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867 governed. In the case of those that joined 
Confederation after 1867, the terms of their union spoke to the 
question. In the instance of Newfoundland, which joined the 
federation in 1949, it was term 17 of the terms of union which dealt 
with denominational or religious education rights in the province 
of Newfoundland.
<P>
	In 1949 term 17 sealed into the Constitution, in the form in 
which it then stood, the arrangement between the religious 
denominations and the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador in relation to denominational education.
<P>
	And so we are asked by Newfoundland alone to make changes in 
relation only to the denominational school system in 
Newfoundland. We are asked to do so under section 43 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, which by its terms provides for a 
Constitutional amendment where that amendment affects only one 
province or more than one but not all, in this case just one, and 
which provides that such an amendment can be made bilaterally, 
between the province affected and Ottawa, the national 
government, through resolutions passed respectively by the 
provincial legislature and by Parliament, both the Senate and the 
House of Commons. That is why we are dealing with this issue 
under this section in relation only to that province.
<P>
	I will touch on the role of the House of Commons when invited 
to participate in such a bilateral amendment arrangement. No such 
amendment can be achieved without the concurrence of the House 
of Commons. In that sense we have a veto. We are an essential 
participant in the process of amendment.
<P>
	There have been at least three other occasions in the recent past 
when the House of Commons participated in such a bilateral 
change. The occasion that might spring most immediately to the 
minds of members involved the fixed link with Prince Edward 
Island, which required a change in the terms of its union with the 
federation.
<P>
	The role of the House of Commons when asked to participate in 
a bilateral constitutional amendment under section 43 is not simply 
to act as a rubber stamp or to reflexively agree to what is proposed. 
In my respectful view both the House and the Senate are required to 
form an independent judgment on the question of whether they 
should by resolution agree to such a change.
<P>
	It is also true that in forming that judgment the federal 
Parliament should demonstrate a decent respect for the resolution 
passed by the provincial legislature. We ought to give great weight 
to the action taken by the province in question but we must not 
automatically pass a resolution at its request. We must form our 
own judgment and be satisfied that it is in the public interest to do 
so.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	On the facts of this case, this government looked at the proposal, 
examined it on its merits and came to the conclusion that 
Parliament should act by resolution to effect the proposed 
constitutional change. I will touch briefly on some of the factors we 
took into account in arriving at our conclusion that this resolution 
should be adopted.
<P>
	We looked at the present term 17 and the manner in which it 
provides for the organization and administration of denominational 
schools in Newfoundland. We had regard for the fact that that 
arrangement is antiquated and reflects an age long past.
<P>
	We considered the factual arguments put forward by the 
government of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador with 
respect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3245"> 3245 </A></B>
<P>
to the cost and the quality of  education under the terms and 
conditions reflected in the 1949 constitutional arrangement. Quite 
apart from cost and the modernity of the school system, we also 
looked at other issues.
<P>
	We considered the question of whether the proposed change 
would adversely affect or would extinguish minority rights in the 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador. On that question we 
considered as well that there is in fact no majority denomination in 
that province. Unlike others, there is no single denomination which 
dominates numerically. Rather, it is plain that 95 per cent of the 
population of Newfoundland and Labrador is made up of those who 
adhere to one or another of the seven denominations whose 
involvement in the school system is constitutionally protected both 
before and after the proposed amendment.
<P>
	We also gave weight to the fact that each of the seven 
denominations is affected equally by the proposed change. We 
concluded on a fair reading of the amendment and on a balanced 
assessment of its effect that what is an issue here is really a change 
in the manner in which denominational rights are exercised, the 
manner in which denominational schools are administered. After 
the change, the circumstances prevailing in Newfoundland and 
Labrador will be roughly comparable to those in other Canadian 
provinces in terms of denominational education.
<P>
	We were much affected by the fact that even after the 
amendment there will still be denominational schools in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. They will still be constitutionally 
entrenched as an entitlement of the affected denominations.
<P>
	The government of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador 
has also tabled draft legislation by which it would be provided that 
unidenominational schools may be created where numbers warrant 
and where the parents choose that for their children.
<P>
	In light of all of that, we concluded that this is not an instance in 
which minority rights are being adversely affected by majority 
rule. The majority is composed of a composite of the separate 
denominations and there is no majority in that sense.
<P>
	We also had regard to the process in the province, that is to say, 
the manner by which this resolution emanated from the assembly in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. We considered the history of the 
matter.
<P>
	We learned that the nature and extent of the involvement of the 
churches in making administrative and economic decisions in the 
education system of Newfoundland has been a matter of 
controversy for generations. We learned that it was the subject of a 
royal commission which made recommendations that are reflected 
in the proposed amendment as recently as 1992.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	We learned that there have been extensive negotiations and 
discussions between the government of that province and the 
leaders of the denominations involved.
<P>
	We learned that there was a referendum in September of last year 
by which the province was asked its view on the question of 
whether this reform should take place. By majority vote, that 
proposition was approved.
<P>
	We learned also that as recently as last week that same 
legislature which last fall had adopted a resolution calling for the 
amendment by majority vote unanimously adopted a second 
resolution calling upon this Parliament to act urgently to give effect 
to the constitutional change.
<P>
	The premier of Newfoundland and Labrador was in Ottawa this 
week to remind us among other things that by modernizing the 
school system as proposed in this amendment, the province expects 
to save at least $27 million. This is money he says can be better 
spent to serve the people and the children of Newfoundland in an 
improved educational system.
<P>
	In all of those circumstances, sensitive always to the question of 
the protection of minority rights and carefully considering the 
background from which this resolution arises and the process 
followed in achieving it, the conclusion to which we came is that it 
merits the support of this Parliament.
<P>
	Quite apart from the particular circumstances in Newfoundland 
and Labrador, there are some who worry that if we act in this 
instance we might be establishing a precedent of interference by 
the national government in collaboration with the provincial 
government of the day to affect denominational involvement in 
education in a province, that a precedent would be set that would 
imperil religious education elsewhere. May I say two things about 
that.
<P>
	In many respects the Newfoundland and Labrador situation is 
unique. Precedents require like facts or like principles. I dare say it 
would be very difficult to find a future circumstance in a different 
province where the same principles and circumstances would 
prevail.
<P>
	The history of religious involvement in education in 
Newfoundland and Labrador dates from 1723, the first recorded 
instance of churches organizing schools for children. The practice 
grew up after the 18th century of schools being exclusively run by 
churches for the children of their adherents.
<P>
	In 1874 this practice first found expression in the law. It 
developed over time to the point where in 1949, the then six 
denominations had exclusive control over their own schools. That 
practice was entrenched in the terms of union of that date. There is 
no other province in Canada in which there are only denomination-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3246"> 3246 </A></B>
<P>
al schools and no public school system. To that extent, with that  
history and background, Newfoundland and Labrador is a province 
that is unique.
<P>
	Quite apart from the lawyerly argument that the circumstances 
and principles in this instance stand apart, there are still those who 
worry that we are establishing a precedent that would imperil 
religious education elsewhere. To that I say that concerns about the 
power of such a precedent ignore the right and the responsibility of 
Parliament to exercise an independent judgment in each instance to 
determine each request for an amendment on its own merits and to 
decide in any future case whether a proposed change to another 
province's system is in the interests of the public and of the 
children.
<P>
	Should another province come forward next month or next year 
with a proposed change to its terms of union or to section 93 to deal 
with the involvement of religious education in schools, it will be up 
to us to make our own assessment on the facts of that case, on the 
question whether minority rights are respected, educational quality 
is preserved and denominational involvement will continue.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	On the facts of this case I have explained our reasoning in 
concluding that we should proceed. In the facts of a future case it 
will be open to us to conduct the same analysis and to arrive at our 
conclusion. Parliament must not think that by acting in this 
instance we are creating a rigid rule which will bind us in all future 
cases to do the same. We shall make up our minds on the facts of 
those cases if and when they arise.
<P>
	I say to those who are concerned about the power of precedent 
from that perspective that they need not be. We shall be here, we 
shall be vigilant and we shall examine critically any future 
proposal on its merits. Should Ontario for example come forward 
with a proposal to change the arrangements entrenched in section 
93 of the Constitution Act of 1867, we shall examine such a 
proposal. If it does not meet the standards which we think are 
appropriate, we can decline to give our support.
<P>
	There are also those who worry more broadly about minority 
rights. They contend that if this change can be made by a bilateral 
arrangement between one province and the national Parliament that 
minority rights in a broader sense might be imperilled and might be 
subject to a similar change.
<P>
	There are those who are concerned about minority language 
rights in education in Ontario, in Manitoba and in other provinces. 
Concern has been expressed about aboriginal rights. It has been 
said that if we are prepared to act bilaterally to change the way 
school rights are exercised or administered for separate 
denominations, what is to protect the minority language rights in 
Manitoba or Ontario if the governments of those provinces come to 
Ottawa to ask our collaboration in a change?
<P>
	As I have just said, in any such instance the Parliament of 
Canada would make up its own mind independently. More directly 
and more importantly, minority language education rights cannot 
be changed bilaterally. They are governed by section 23 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. Any such change would require the broader 
amending formula to be applied. At least seven provinces with at 
least 50 per cent of the population would have to concur in such a 
change. It could not be carried out bilaterally. The instance we have 
before us is profoundly different from what would arise with a 
proposal to change minority language education rights entrenched 
and protected by section 23 of the charter.
<P>
	Similarly, by sections 25 and 35 aboriginal rights are respected. 
Those rights cannot be changed. The terms of those articles in our 
Constitution cannot be amended without the operation of the 
general amending formula requiring at least seven provinces with 
at least 50 per cent of Canada's population. There need be no 
concern arising from this resolution in relation to minority 
language rights.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, it does not affect official language educational minority 
rights in any way. These are constitutionally protected by section 
23 of the charter and nothing in this amendment will diminish that 
protection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I conclude by commending this resolution to the House. The 
Prime Minister has seen fit to direct that the vote be free. I invite 
members of this Chamber as they make up their minds on the 
question to look at the substance of the case and to meet the 
concerns which I have dealt with on their merits as well.
<P>
	This is a case in which a member of the federation has properly 
and validly invoked section 43. A legislature has not only adopted a 
resolution as required, but more recently has unanimously called 
for urgent action on our part. It is an instance in which minority 
rights are not extinguished, they are not eliminated and they are not 
defeated. It is a case in which seven specific denominations will 
continue to be proprietors of a school system, those denominations 
with entrenched rights and representing 95 per cent of the 
population.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	It is a case in which Parliament, by acting, will not be binding 
itself to automatic agreement with all future possible requests for 
change in the same field under section 43. It is a case in which the 
action under section 43 cannot and will not imperil minority 
language or aboriginal rights because they cannot be changed 
bilaterally. Last, this is in instance in which we can illustrate that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3247"> 3247 </A></B>
<P>
the Constitution of Canada is a living, flexible and responsive 
instrument which can meet and serve the needs of all provinces and 
all Canadians.
<P>
	With that I ask the House to support this resolution to modernize 
the school system for the children of Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak to the 
motion the justice minister has just tabled. This motion reflects 
faithfully the amendments requested by Newfoundland regarding 
its education system as set out under Term 17 of the Terms of the 
Union of Newfoundland with Canada.
<P>
	I think the minister spoke very eloquently of the concerns 
surrounding the consequences of the amendments, especially the 
sense of security this amendment may provide with regard to the 
situation in this province as it stands for minorities among others.
<P>
	As members of the Bloc Quebecois, a sovereignist party and the 
official opposition in this House, we will naturally consider this 
amendment to the Canadian Constitution in a broader context. 
Indeed, to understand what this amendment is all about, one has to 
look at the history of how Newfoundland joined the Confederation, 
under what terms it joined, and how it is now asking for these 
amendments, which are raising a lot of concerns and questions on 
the part of the people of Newfoundland.
<P>
	Everybody in Canada knows that Confederation has been in 
existence since 1867. Through the years, provinces and territories 
have joined Canada. In 1949, Newfoundland entered 
Confederation. How and under what terms?
<P>
	How? Through a referendum. Quebecers did not invent 
referendums, they have been part of the Canadian Confederation 
for many years. Therefore, on March 15, 1948, the government in 
the United Kingdom passed an act paving the way for the 
referendum process. It asked three questions and provided for a 
second referendum should none of the proposals made by the 
government receive the support of the majority during the first 
referendum. Of course, since there were three proposals, the one 
with the least support from the public would be dropped.
<P>
	Therefore, in 1948, there was a referendum on an extremely 
important issue: Would Newfoundland adopt a new constitutional 
status? Would Newfoundland enter the Canadian Confederation?
<P>
	It should be noted that neither Ottawa nor the other provinces 
which were already part of the Canadian Confederation intervened 
to choose a date, draft the question or dictate the rules. Moreover, 
the federal government even had reservations regarding the 
wording of the question. Even then, the federal government argued 
about the percentage required to come into the Canadian 
Confederation. Things never change, do they? We have the same 
concerns today about a province that wants to leave Confederation.
<P>
	Let us look at history, let us see what it tells us. In Britain, since 
Newfoundland was part of the United Kingdom in those days, they 
immediately recognized that 50 per cent plus one would be enough 
for Newfoundland to become part of the Confederation. We will 
see that Ottawa upheld that decision, and quite properly so.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	So Newfoundland held its first referendum on June 3, 1948. It is 
important to know about the three proposals to evaluate the impact 
of the amendment before us in an historical context. Let me briefly 
review with you those elements of history.
<P>
	The wording and the order of the questions in the referendum act 
were as follows. First, it proposed to the Newfoundland population 
a commission of government which was to govern for a five-year 
period; second, a confederation with Canada; and third, a 
responsible government, as it existed in 1933.
<P>
	Obviously, there were pros and cons for all three. Some 
criticized the text saying it was biased in favour of the commission. 
The federal government did not agree with the wording of the 
proposals and was very reluctant. Ottawa condemned the fact that 
nothing was said about Great Britain no longer being able to 
financially support Newfoundland. The Canadian High 
Commission said the terms of the question were ambiguous and 
equivocal. I feel I have heard that same comment recently, but that 
was in 1948. The high commissioner even wrote: ``The 
Confederation entered the battle with a great handicap and even if 
it were to win with a majority, it would probably be necessary to 
review the bases of the union''.
<P>
	All this goes to say that, according to Ottawa, the question 
submitted to the constituents on June 3, 1948 was unclear and 
ambiguous and nobody knew the ins and outs of the plan. There 
were reservations regarding the process.
<P>
	However, there were good reactions. On the whole, the media 
said that, yes, Newfoundland should join Canada under certain 
conditions. The Church played a very important role and that is 
why, today, we should look correctly at the amendments. It must 
also be pointed out that there were very strong sentiments against 
joining the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	In any case the campaign in Newfoundland, in June 1948, was 
democratic. Each side had a chance to express its point of view. It 
is not clear whether Ottawa got directly involved or not in the 
referendum debate in 1948, and it is not clear either whether 
Ottawa actually invested money in that debate. One thing is certain, 
agreements, with the Americans in particular, favoured the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3248"> 3248 </A></B>
<P>
federalist option, and in the end Newfoundlanders decided to join 
the Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	What were the results of the first referendum? For responsible 
government, 44.55 per cent; for Confederation, 41.13 per cent; for 
commission government, 14.32 per cent. As you can see none of 
the three options had the absolute majority recommended by the 
United Kingdom, that is 50 per cent plus 1.
<P>
	Therefore, a second referendum was held within 30 days. It was 
held on July 22, 1948. It was identical to the first one, that is to say 
that each party exposed its program and tried to convince voters, 
presented the pros and the cons, the reasons why Newfoundland 
should join Confederation or why it should choose a responsible 
government, etc. The result of this new referendum was: for 
Confederation, 52.34 per cent and for responsible government, 
47.66 per cent.
<P>
	What we should note today, and what might explain the fears or 
some points raised by various denominations concerning religion, 
with regard to the amendment to Term 17, is that 67.18 per cent of 
the people in the Avalon peninsula voted in favour of responsible 
government. At the time people in the Avalon peninsula, which is 
now part of Newfoundland, voted massively in favour of 
responsible government and not for joining the Canadian 
Confederation.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	If we look at Quebec today, it is roughly the island of Montreal 
voting no in a referendum and the rest of Quebec voting yes to 
Quebec's sovereignty. But, at the time, the Avalon peninsula voted 
by a margin of 67.18 per cent in favour of a responsible 
government. It did not want to join Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	The vote, when analyzed, seemed to follow denominational 
lines. That is why it is important to analyze what we have before us 
today. Note that the Avalon peninsula was for the most part roman 
catholic. In fact, the archbishop had taken position against 
Canadian federation.
<P>
	The results were interpreted different ways, of course. The 
people of Newfoundland decided to join Confederation by a margin 
of 52.34 per cent, and this was interpreted all sorts of ways. Some 
were even concerned about disturbances in Newfoundland because 
of the narrow majority margin. Yet, that was not the case.
<P>
	Government members, democratically elected people had voted 
against the project to join Canadian Confederation, but they went 
along with the wishes of the 52.34 per cent majority and worked to 
build Newfoundland within the Canadian Confederation. What I 
am saying is, if a 52.34 per cent margin is enough to join Canadian 
Confederation, I should imagine a 52.34 per cent margin-a 
minimum in any case-would be enough to leave it. At least in my 
view.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Avalon peninsula rejected Canadian 
Confederation by a margin of 67.18 per cent, and I want to 
emphasize that. Was there any mention of partition? Did anyone 
say the results were too low to have Newfoundland join 
Confederation? Was anything said about a two-tier democracy, 
public disturbances, instability, or even about two kinds of 
referendums in Canada, about different values in referendums? No, 
nothing was said about that.
<P>
	I have not checked, but I imagine that, at the time, in 1948, 
Canada, and Ottawa in particular, had a very responsible Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, because he did not challenge these 
results. No, the minister and the government acted responsibly 
because democracy had spoken. By a margin of 52.34 per cent, the 
majority had made its position known.
<P>
	What did this result lead to? To negotiations between the 
Government of Newfoundland and the Government of Canada on 
the terms of their union. Negotiations were held between October 
and December 1948 to finalize the terms of the union, which, 
among other things, resulted in Term 17 before us today through a 
government motion, a motion that faithfully reflects the 
Newfoundland government's position on amending, among other 
things, the school education system in that province.
<P>
	Everyone knows that Newfoundland joined the Canadian 
Confederation on March 31, 1949. But when Newfoundland joined 
Confederation in 1949, the clause on education in the terms of the 
union, which is part of the Canadian Constitution, specified that the 
Newfoundland legislature would not have the authority to pass 
legislation infringing on the rights or privileges of denominational 
schools as they were in 1949.
<P>
	There have been many changes since 1949. In order to save 
money, to modernize the school system, or for other reasons, the 
people of Newfoundland decided in a referendum to give the 
government a mandate to amend Term 17 in the Canadian 
Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	History is once again repeating itself. On September 5, 1995, a 
referendum was held in Newfoundland. In studying this matter, I 
became aware of the similarities between Newfoundland and 
Quebec, which hold periodic referendums to help their people 
move forward by seeking their opinion on some extremely 
important issues. I think education is extremely important, because 
our progress as a people and as a country is based on education, on 
the training of young people in our society. I think the amendments 
proposed by Newfoundland are worthwhile; they are not 
insignificant, as I read in the newspapers, but extremely important 
because they will have an impact on all future generations of 
Newfoundlanders. I think this needs to be said.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3249"> 3249 </A></B>
<P>
	But on September 5, 1995, the people of Newfoundland were 
presented with a referendum question, a question selected by the 
Newfoundland government and written by the Newfoundland 
government, asking them if they agreed Term 17 be amended so 
as to reform the education system.
<P>
	Only 52 per cent of Newfoundland voters participated in this 
referendum, which means that about half the population voted on 
deciding that future. So be it. That is democracy. There is nothing 
we can do about it.
<P>
	Of this 52 per cent, which represents approximately 201,710 
voters, 54 per cent said yes to the proposed reform, to give their 
government the mandate to reform the education system, while 
another 45 per cent said no. The Newfoundland government 
derived the mandate to submit constitutional amendments, which 
we are debating today, from a yes majority of 19,941. That is a 
rather slender majority. But the people have spoken, 
democratically. For the sake of argument, let us round off these 
19,941 votes to 20,000. With a 20,000 vote majority, the people 
have given the Newfoundland government the mandate to initiate 
amendments and reform the system.
<P>
	The question approved by the legislative assembly of 
Newfoundland was a legitimate question. It was selected by 
lawfully elected MPPs. Those who complained about the wording, 
those on the yes side and those who took issue with the question all 
participated in this referendum, each in support of their own 
position. In this case, 54 per cent of the people of Newfoundland 
who voted said yes.
<P>
	An information campaign was conducted. A proper referendum 
was held. The result was a democratic one.
<P>
	I read in the newspapers that some thought it was strange that the 
opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, would agree with the action taken 
by Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin. As a responsible official 
opposition in this House, we acknowledge the result, and we will 
act upon the wish of Newfoundlanders by supporting their request. 
We do not support the motion of the justice minister or of the 
government opposite, we support the motion tabled by the Minister 
of Justice as the spokesperson for Newfoundlanders regarding a 
decision they arrived at in a democratic fashion.
<P>
	Indeed, we support the motion before us because it reflects the 
wish of Newfoundlanders. In so doing, we are only acting like a 
responsible opposition.
<P>
	We would have liked to get absolute guarantees, including for 
French speaking minorities, because we have always protected the 
rights of francophones outside Quebec. No doubt about that. We 
would have liked to see the Government of Newfoundland provide 
full guarantees.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	We did not get such guarantees, but we got some assurance that 
these minorities would continue to enjoy the same rights, following 
the amendments proposed by Newfoundland to Term 17.
<P>
	We carefully reviewed the proposed amendment and we came to 
the conclusion, as did the Minister of Justice earlier, that this 
amendment, which we support, takes nothing away from 
minorities. Obviously, we would have liked to get more, to have 
things in writing, including things that do not currently exist but 
relate to the amendment. It goes without saying that such 
guarantees would have been beneficial.
<P>
	Newfoundland's education minister, with whom I met on 
Wednesday, gave me an assurance. He told me about the funding 
and management of French speaking schools by francophones. I 
trust him to be true to his word. We did everything we could 
possibly do. We defended the rights of francophones within the 
limits set by our jurisdiction. Let us not forget that this is the 
federal government. We, Bloc Quebecois members, are respectful 
of the various jurisdictions.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we read and heard comments in the newspapers, 
as well as here in this House and in the Senate with which we do not 
agree. We have to set the record straight. Some said the rights of 
minorities are sacred and must be protected when threatened by the 
majority. These people claim that the rights of the religious 
minorities will be challenged by the proposed measures to amend 
the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
	I have heard some people say and I have read in the papers that 
the amendment before us would stifle or rather threaten the rights 
of religious minorities. According to their arguments, we have to 
vote against the motion before us, nip this dangerous precedent in 
the bud, because if we do not, other religious and linguistic 
minorities will be threatened by all the referenda other provinces 
may hold on various issues.
<P>
	Their reasoning does not withstand close examination. These 
statements are unwarranted. The changes proposed to the education 
system in Newfoundland, however major or important they are, as I 
said earlier, do not threaten the fundamental rights of religious 
minorities, or for that matter linguistic minorities.
<P>
	In fact, the goal here is not to abolish the separate school system, 
but to no longer impose a school system on a majority that does not 
care for it anymore. I would urge the ultraconservatives and the tale 
spinners to show a modicum of intellectual honesty.
<P>
	Although I agree with the initiative he has taken, I would also 
invite the premier of Newfoundland to be fair, because from what I 
read in the newspapers about the meeting he had with the Leader of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3250"> 3250 </A></B>
<P>
the Opposition, where I was present, his account does not fully 
reflect the discussion we had.
<P>
	I think Captain Canada should put away his hero's attire when he 
meets the official opposition. When he wants to inform the public, 
he should put aside his political options and talk clearly about what 
was really said during these meetings, because he put words in the 
mouth of the Leader of the Opposition that the Bloc leader never 
uttered.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Also in attendance at that meeting were the Newfoundland 
premier, naturally, the Newfoundland leader of the opposition and 
the leader of the third officially recognized party in Newfoundland. 
This is to show you, Mr. Speaker, that when the people express 
themselves, everyone gets behind the victor to move democracy 
forward, to make the people progress.
<P>
	In the Newfoundland legislative assembly, the leader of the 
opposition and the leader of the third party were against amending 
term 17. On the 29th, the three leaders stood side by side to show 
their support of the democratic will of the people.
<P>
	This is exactly what will happen in Quebec. Some may have 
their doubts about this, but after a yes vote in Quebec, the leaders 
of the main parties will all stand by the decision of the people.
<P>
	We must remember that that meeting dealt mainly with two 
things: first, the recognition of the democratic process in 
Newfoundland and second, as I said earlier, the protection of the 
French minority.
<P>
	As I said, the people expressed themselves clearly. Even if a 
province wanted to challenge in court the decision made by the 
people of Newfoundland on this constitutional amendment, it could 
not do it. Even the Constitution itself could not stand in their way. 
The people decided to accept this amendment.
<P>
	To show how important democracy is, a Liberal member of the 
legislative assembly, Walter Carter, said that the wording of the 
referendum question was too complex. Even the opposition, as I 
said earlier, was against the question and the amendment. 
According to the Church, in Newfoundland, the wording was 
biased in favour of the yes side. The participation rate was not high, 
and that could raise questions.
<P>
	But the wording of the question was decided upon by the 
democratically elected representatives of the people. Everyone was 
able to make himself or herself heard. This was a legitimate 
initiative and we, as members of the House of Commons, must 
accept it, period. The people of Newfoundland have spoken and we 
must accept the verdict wether we favour pluridenominational 
schools or not. Is my time up, Mr. Speaker? I still have points to 
make.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I believe you do have a lot of 
points to make, and you will have the opportunity to pick up where 
you left off after question period.
<P>
	It being eleven o'clock, the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I consider 
it a privilege to announce that today is National Transportation Day 
and next week is National Transportation Week in Canada.
<P>
	Celebrations are being held today in Vancouver and in cities 
around the country next week. Over the last three years, the 
government has worked hard to modernize Canadian 
transportation. It has reduced subsidies, commercialized services 
and updated transportation policies and regulations. However, it 
cannot all be done from Ottawa.
<P>
	Canada's transportation system is really a network of 
interlocking systems. We need the active participation of all 
Canadians. Canada's urban centres are particularly important. 
Every day more than 145,000 Canadians travel between cities by 
bus, rail or air. Every day, trains, trucks and ships move almost 2.3 
million tonnes of freight to market.
<P>
	That is why the theme for National Transportation Week 1996 is 
the Urban Connection. I am pleased to have this opportunity to 
recognize all the men and women who plan, build, operate and use 
our transportation systems, who ensure that trade relationships and 
tourism industries can rely upon safe, secure transportation.

made in this House by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, supported by the Prime Minister, show once again 
the contempt of these two men for those who do not share their 
opinion.
<P>
	Many new Quebecers who voted yes in the last referendum came 
from countries where freedom of expression no longer existed. By

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister for Human Resources Development noted 
earlier this week that Canada's persistently high unemployment 
rates are a puzzle to him and that most European countries face the 
same problem.
<P>
	What the minister neglected to mention is the United States has 
very low unemployment rates. He also failed to note the OECD 
studies which have identified generous social programs as the main 
cause for the persistent high unemployment rate in Europe and 
Canada. I wish the minister had mentioned these facts.
<P>
	We need in Canada a dialogue over the trade-off between 
unemployment and the generosity of social programs. We may 
wish to keep the present system intact but we should do so with a 
full understanding of the trade-offs involved.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
some time ago, the government announced its intention to 
withdraw from the area of manpower training and to transfer that 
responsibility to the provinces.
<P>
	Right now, several francophone communities have access to 
training programs in French. It is a right that is essential to the 
development of the language as well as the community. I think it is 
imperative that the government fulfil its obligations under the 
Official Languages Act when it enters into negotiations with the 
provinces.
<P>
	We have a responsibility toward these communities not only to 
maintain training services in the minority language but also to 
improve these services where necessary. I am pleased to see that 
the government has made such a commitment.

Minister of Human Resources Development at my colleague, the 
member for Bourassa. The minister's remarks smack of a 
deep-rooted and invidious attitude that advocates intolerance and 
encourages aggressiveness towards anyone who is not a genuine, 
old stock Canadian.
<P>
	The member for Bourassa is a model citizen, who is keenly 
interested in making his own individual contribution to the life of 
his adopted community. So it does not matter whether the minister, 
who does not share his political ideals, likes it or not. It is 
disgusting, not to say shameful, that an hon. minister would make 
such remarks.
<P>
	The least one could do, in such a case, is first to make a public 
apology, and then, without delay, to step down and offer one's 
resignation.

	Vancouver waterfront workers have to bear the brunt of federal 
inaction. They receive safety training from the province where 
modern standards and up to date regulations prevail, but B.C. 
regulations are unenforceable because these workers are still 
subject to ten year old federal health and safety laws. Union 
negotiators were so concerned for the safety of their members they 
won the right for injured employees to be treated by provincial 
occupational first aid attendants.

employment needs and opportunities. This information will be 
used to provide a report to the ministerial task force on youth and 
ultimately to develop a national youth strategy to be unveiled this 
fall.
<P>
	In Cumberland-Colchester my staff has met with students from 
many schools across the riding to gain insight on what can and 
should be done to alleviate the problem of high youth 
unemployment in the Atlantic region. Both my staff and I were 
very impressed with the thoughtful and intelligent ideas our youth 
had to share.
<P>
	It is my hope the ministerial task force on youth will seriously 
consider and act on suggestions made by these bright young minds. 
Canada's youth must be our priority. They are the future of the 
country and their opinions must weigh heavy in our policy 
decisions.

Mr. Speaker, in today's fast paced world it is easy to lose 
perspective. However, things come quickly into focus when we 
look at the challenges overcome by a very special constituent of 
mine, Ms. Tonya Schweigert.
<P>
	On July 2, 1993, four days before her 16th birthday, Tonya was 
in a car accident that nearly took her life. Rushed to the children's 
hospital in London, she was treated for serious head injuries. Later 
she developed  reoccurring, life threatening complications. 
However, through her tremendous motivation and determination, 
Tonya was released from the hospital only four months after the 
accident.
<P>
	While her balance and co-ordination are still a bit inconsistent, 
that does not stop Tonya from riding her horse or being a successful 
figure skater.
<P>
	Presently Tonya is working with 11 other special young 
Canadians who have triumphed over adversity. In conjunction with 
the Children's Miracle Network they are raising funds for children 
across Canada and the United States.
<P>
	I salute these resilient Canadians who possess a willingness to 
fight the odds. They are role models for all of us.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, training 
our young people for success in the competitive economy of the 
21st century is the most important investment Canada can make in 
its future. Over the past month, in conjunction with the ministerial 
task force on youth, I have held round table meetings in Trepassey, 
Mobile, Mount Pearl and St. John's to discuss the obstacles facing 
our young people as they make the transition from the classroom to 
the job market.
<P>
	Young people are sometimes hindered by outdated curriculum 
and a lack of practical experience. They are hindered by a system 
which encourages a lack of confidence in themselves and in their 
abilities. Young people have the energy, drive and potential that all 
employers value. They simply need a foot in the door and a chance 
to prove themselves. Given such an opportunity youth quickly 
learn how to apply their knowledge in the workplace.
<P>
	Government, educators and business leaders all have a role to 
play in the education of our youth. If each sector can do its part, 
Canada will reap a fine profit from its investment in young people. 
Government must provide the environment so that educators and 
business leaders can do the rest.

This is a excellent opportunity for Quebecers to get to know and 
become more aware of the numerous barriers persons with 
disabilities have to overcome if they are to participate in 
mainstream society, both socially and in the workplace.
<P>
	It is fortunate that Quebec and other provinces have decided to 
celebrate National Access Awareness Week, because the federal 
government has clearly abandoned these people since the end of its 
national strategy, on April 1. Since they came into office, the 
Liberals have managed to dismantle the office of the secretary of 
state for disabled persons, restrict the admissibility to the tax credit 
for disabled persons and cut the funding for advocacy groups.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal government would have Canadians believe crime is falling. 
I have two words in response: hog wash.
<P>
	Violent crime and offences committed against Canadians have 
increased by an appalling rate over the past 30 years. In 1962 there 
were 221 violent crimes per 100,000 population in Canada. Current 
statistics show the violent crime rate is now well over 1,000 
incidents per 100,000 population and the property crime rate is 
three times higher than in 1962.
<P>
	In overall terms the average Canadian stands a 99.9 per cent 
chance of being victimized by crime at least once in their life. So 
much for falling crime.
<P>
	The only issue in decline is the credibility of a government 
which has praised itself for making our streets safe when clearly 
the opposite is true. The Canadian voters will not be fooled. The do 
nothing Liberal government is soft on crime and Canadians know 
it. Watch out Liberals-

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1986, the governments of Quebec and Canada signed a 
framework agreement on vocational training for a duration of three 
years. Since that agreement came to an end, negotiations have not 
led to its renewal, and the $130 million paid to Quebec has never 
been indexed. This has been the situation for seven years now.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Is this present government offer, again limited to 
three years, not likely to have an identical outcome, since Ottawa 
still controls the employment insurance fund?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the offer made to 
all of the provinces and territories of Canada is as follows. We 
wanted to ensure that there was  some element of certainty, if ever 
we were able, as I hope we will be, to reach some agreement that 
would last a minimum of three years. We wanted to be sure that it 
lasted at least three years. That is not the maximum, nor the set 
duration.
<P>
	In this way, we hope to be able to show our good faith, our desire 
to find a new way of doing things, assuring the provinces and 
territories that any agreement concluded would last at least three 
years. This is not merely a question of revision; for as long as 
agreement continues thereafter, once the three years are over, we 
ought to be able to continue these agreements for an indefinite 
period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it would also be worthwhile to set some guidelines, as in 
the case of the agreement on immigration, because the agreement I 
am talking about has not always proved entirely successful.

	For the last ten years as well, the federal government has been 
paying $130 million to Quebec from the consolidated fund. 
Yesterday the minister admitted that his government would be 
withdrawing from the manpower field within three years, with no 
compensation.
<P>
	Will the federal government continue to invest in this sector the 
funds it was previously paying to the provinces, such as the $130 
million Quebec was, and still is, receiving under the 1989 
agreement? If so, is this not proof of its continuing to be involved 
in this area, despite its avowed intention to withdraw?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to suggest that we 
will not manage to sign any agreements, but even if it happened 
that no agreement was reached, we are already committed to 
withdrawing from the field of manpower training. Our decision in 
that connection was made months ago. As far as the estimates and 
appropriations earmarked for manpower training are concerned, it 
was our intention, and continues to be our commitment, to 
withdraw totally from manpower training.
<P>
	This means the budgets will drop to zero. We will not be 
getting back into that area again; we have absolutely no 
intention of doing so.
<P>
	As for the agreements we hope to negotiate, however, there is no 
doubt that for active measures, if the provinces so desire-and it 
will be of their own choosing-they will no doubt be able to do 
certain things in the occupational training sector which they 
consider to be legitimate and worthwhile.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there would appear to be a number of clarifications 
needed in this area; we have been told that the federal government 
is headed toward elimination of the funding allocated to the 
provinces. There is reference  to a zero budget within three years. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3255"> 3255 </A></B>
<P>
The money itself will not, however, disappear. It will not go to the 
provinces, but neither will it disappear.
<P>
	What we need to know is what the federal government intends to 
do with that money. This strikes me as a good question, and one 
that we will certainly be getting back to, for at some point I would 
like to have a response.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Taking a different tack on this same subject, in his recent budget 
the Minister of Finance announced that he would be freeing up 
$315 million over three years for the young people of Quebec and 
Canada, to help them break into the work force.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Human Resources Development indicate to 
us why this vital program is not part of the proposal made to the 
provinces, since it is quite obviously a manpower program? Even 
more important, it involves not only today's work force, but 
tomorrow's as well, the work force of the future.
<P>
	Why not integrate this project announced a few weeks ago by the 
Minister of Finance with the offer made to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this is obviously a highly 
complex matter, this entire area of training and active measures.
<P>
	The hon. member is right, there are other departments in 
addition to my own with responsibility in these sectors with which 
we have long been involved. I wish to assure my hon. colleague, 
and particularly the governments with which we are going to 
negotiate, of our desire to ensure that these active measures, 
tailored to the specific needs of the provinces, are delivered by 
them.
<P>
	As far as our withdrawal from manpower is concerned, the hon. 
member indicated that the money we do not spend on training will 
still be there somewhere, but that is not the case. As you know, 
despite the valiant efforts of the Minister of Finance, we still have a 
deficit in Canada.
<P>
	It is not as if there were money left over somewhere. When 
budgets are cut, or when we pull out of one or another sector, the 
unspent moneys are reflected in the government's overall financial 
plan, and it is in that context that we have already committed 
ourselves to decreasing our expenditures year after year. This has, 
moreover, already been done already for some time; when we are 
no longer involved in manpower training, the budgets will have 
been totally used up as well.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Yesterday, in responding to a question in the House, he refused to 
say whether he would make public the  report on the inquiry sought 
by his department on the assistant deputy attorney general's 
interference with the chief justice of the federal court. The minister 
agreed to make public only the action he would be taking at the end 
of the inquiry.
<P>
	Why is the minister refusing to make public the complete report 
of the inquiry by Mr. Dubin on such a serious case of undue 
interference in the legal system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry my position was not 
made clear yesterday. In response to the hon. member's question, I 
intend to table Mr. Dubin's report when it is finished.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, such a 
serious error by a senior public servant demands quick action on 
the part of the government.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to table the report of the inquiry sought 
by his department by the end of the present session and not in the 
summer when no one is here?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have only one hesitation in 
committing myself to that. I will table Mr. Dubin's letter to me or 
his report, whatever he produces. The House should see that. He 
has expressed concern about doing that before the motion pending 
in front of Mr. Justice Cullen is resolved.
<P>
	Mr. Justice Cullen of the Federal Court has a motion before him 
to stay these three revocation cases. Mr. Dubin is concerned that 
producing his findings and his advice in advance of Mr. Justice 
Cullen coming to a conclusion might not be proper.
<P>
	There is no question that I will make the advice of Mr. Dubin 
available to the House. My only hesitation in saying that I will do it 
as soon as I receive it is that the matter may soon be pending before 
Mr. Justice Cullen. If it arises after the House adjourns, I will mail 
a copy to my friend as soon as I properly can.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Assistant 
Deputy Minister Ted Thompson's letter to Chief Justice Isaac, 
dated March 1 states: ``Further to our meeting this morning in 
which I advised that the Attorney General of Canada is being asked 
to consider taking a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada to 
determine some preliminary points of law, primarily because the 
Federal Court trial division is unable or unwilling to proceed with 
the subject cases expeditiously''.
<P>
	Who asked the justice minister and what was the basis on which 
the minister was asked to consider taking these revocation cases 
from the hands of Justice Jerome and referring them to the 
Supreme Court of Canada?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3256"> 3256 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Department of Justice is 
organized in such a way that recommendations would come from 
what is called a litigation committee. Senior litigation lawyers in 
the department meet regularly to consider the conduct of cases that 
are before the courts.
<P>
	At the time the letter was written, it is my understanding that the 
litigation committee was considering whether to recommend to me 
that these issues be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada so that 
they could be moved along more quickly. They had not yet come to 
a conclusion and I had not by that date received any 
recommendation.
<P>
	In fact, I spoke about this matter with Mr. Dubin yesterday. He 
interviewed me over the luncheon hour. I have every expectation 
that the report or the advice he eventually provides will deal with 
the chronology of events. He is interviewing all the relevant 
people, so I hope all these matters will be matters of record when 
he completes his work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier this 
week the justice minister was asked if he was prepared to lay a 
complaint against Chief Justice Isaac with the Canadian Judicial 
Council. He said no, claiming it was not up to him to order the 
council to investigate the irresponsible actions of the chief justice.
<P>
	Section 69(1) of the Judges Act explicitly gives the federal 
Minister of Justice the responsibility and the authority to order an 
inquiry by the judicial council into inappropriate behaviour by a 
federally appointed judge.
<P>
	Why did the minister not fulfil his responsibility by following 
the appropriate course of action? Why did he not order the inquiry 
by the judicial council?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, subject to being corrected, I think 
it is section 63(1) that provides-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is 69(1).
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> All right, it is 69(1), that provides that I may direct an 
inquiry to be held under the Judges Act. However, on the facts as I 
know them, at least at present, I do not believe this is a case that 
warrants that kind of inquiry. We had one in the case of Judge 
Bienvenue which is now before the judicial council.
<P>
	The other thing that is important is the judicial council has 
already acted in relation to this matter. I told the House yesterday 
of the information that I have, that the judge who chairs the judicial 
conduct committee of the council, Chief Justice McEachern of 
British Columbia, has invited Chief Justice Isaac to explain what 
happened so that the committee can consider it and decide whether 
further action is warranted.
<P>
	It is not as though nothing is happening on that front. The 
council is looking at the conduct and will respon  appropriately.At least in my judgment at this time, on the basis of the facts as I 
know them, I do not believe it is an appropriate case for the kind of 
formal inquiry that is contemplated by the section to which my 
hon. friend has referred.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
concerned that the justice minister is not considering this to be an 
important issue.
<P>
	Yesterday the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> stated: ``Judge Isaac's actions 
constitute one of the most serious erosions of judicial 
independence in Canadian history''.
<P>
	My final supplementary question is this. The Minister of Justice 
admitted yesterday that he learned of the judicial interference 
involving his deputy assistant one week after the March 1 meeting. 
Why did he wait almost three months to make a ministerial 
statement in the House? Why did the minister not immediately 
reveal to the House and Canadians the inappropriate actions of Ted 
Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first in relation to the extent to 
which I consider this matter serious, when I spoke on Monday, I 
made it clear that I consider this a very serious matter and that I 
take it seriously. It is for that reason that I brought in a person of the 
stature and independence of former Chief Justice Dubin to look at 
the facts and provide advice on what should happen.
<P>
	Second, as to what happened after March 1, I believe when Mr. 
Dubin recounts the chronology, it will disclose that within a week 
or two after March 1, this incident came to light within the 
department. Ted Thompson acted on his own initiative in having 
the meeting and in having the correspondence. Then it came to the 
light of people in the department.
<P>
	As soon as that happened, we ensured that copies of the 
correspondence and particulars of the meeting were put in the 
hands of the lawyers acting for the three parties in the Federal 
Court. Then they brought motions in the court based on that 
correspondence.
<P>
	These events were the subject of news reports in April. The 
matter was entirely in the open. We did not try to hide or cover up 
anything at all.
<P>
	As to my ministerial statement being made last Monday and not 
in March, our first focus was on the court cases and responding to 
motions brought to stay those three cases because we believe they 
should go forward. After that was in hand, I then turned to internal 
matters in the department. I took advice from the deputy. We 
involved Mr. Dubin and I made my statement.
<P>
	The chronology speaks for itself. The matter is now in the hands 
of an independent party to look at the facts. I have already told the 
House that I will put his advice before the House for its 
information.

Speaker, my question is for the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, when Mr. Harris and Mr. Bouchard, the premiers of 
Ontario and Quebec, met, they together asked the federal 
government to include compensation for the harmonization of the 
GST on the agenda of the conference on June 20 and 21. On May 
27, the Minister of Finance relegated the issue to a meeting with his 
colleagues.
<P>
	Will the Acting Prime Minister confirm, given the importance 
accorded this particular issue by the premiers of the two largest 
provinces, that he will put the GST on the agenda of the June 20 
and 21 meeting?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the finance minister 
has already mentioned that it will be part of the agenda of the 
finance ministers' meetings some time next month.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the member did not understand my question and 
has certainly not understood the request by the premiers of 
Canada's two largest provinces that this be included on the agenda 
of the meeting of June 20 and 21.
<P>
	In response to the consensus forming among the provinces 
swindled by this agreement, will the Acting Prime Minister 
suspend all agreements and negotiations with the maritime 
provinces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this question is clearly 
part of the finance minister's meetings. It is a matter that the 
finance ministers will discuss at their meetings, which will very 
likely be next month. That is the appropriate place for discussions 
to take place.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that the agenda for the 
first ministers' conference has not been released yet, therefore I 
cannot comment on that.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOODSANDSERVICESTAX">GOODS AND SERVICES TAX</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as has 
been pointed out, the premiers of the two largest provinces have 
said that they are opposed to the new Liberal GST.
<P>
	They are looking for a 1.5 per cent reduction in taxes in Ontario 
and Quebec to compensate for the $1 billion payoff to Liberal 
premiers in Atlantic Canada. They believe that Quebec deserves 
compensation for harmonizing its provincial sales tax in 1992. 
Alberta has made similar requests.
<P>
	Will the government be acting on these requests? Will it 
continue to have one policy for its friends, the Liberal premiers of 
Atlantic Canada, and another policy for the other provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would remind the 
hon. member that the GST deal with the Atlantic provinces is 
available to all provinces that lost funds on that.
<P>
	It is interesting to look at the results from Quebec. Quebec 
benefited from harmonization. If one looks at the first year alone of 
harmonization, Quebec tax revenues increased by something like 
20 per cent after harmonization.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Since harmonization, Quebec has benefited by about $2.5 billion 
to $3 billion. Maybe we should be looking at that $2.5 billion to $3 
billion in increased revenues that Quebec gained from 
harmonization. Maybe Ontario should be looking at that as an 
opportunity for a better revenue performance of its own.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is trying to take credit for some economic growth and 
trying to pretend that there is not one set of arrangements for some 
provinces and one for others.
<P>
	This ill-conceived plan for harmonizing the GST has at least 
managed to bring about some national unity. We have had the 
uniting of the premiers of Ontario and Quebec, not to mention the 
Governments of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan in opposition to the federal government.
<P>
	Premiers Harris and Bouchard, who are not finance ministers, 
they are premiers, want the issue of GST harmonization, 
compensation and reduction on the table at the upcoming first 
ministers' conference. Will the GST be on the agenda of the first 
ministers at their meetings in June?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind 
the hon. member that I would be happy to take credit for the growth 
in the GNP in the early nineties. Unfortunately this party was not 
the government at that time. However, there was not very much 
growth if he will recall that time.
<P>
	As far as this being on the agenda for the first ministers' 
conference, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the agenda has not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3258"> 3258 </A></B>

<P>
	In 1980, the largest press baron owned 20 per cent of all 
Canadian newspapers. The then Liberal government, concerned 
about the situation, set up a royal inquiry commission, the Kent

<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague for his question.
<P>
	In fact, the director of the bureau of competition is aware of the 
buyout the hon. member has just mentioned. He has already made 
some representations and done a number of analyses, and I want to 
say that, in the past, every time there has been a deal involving 
newspapers, the government has taken action by introducing 
relevant legislation if necessary.
<P>
	In this case, the director informed us that the deal was legitimate. 
I would point out to my colleague that Canada's Competition Act 
ensures that fair competition can be maintained across the country, 
and that all Canadians can take advantage of it through a 
mechanism provided for in the act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to Quebec's main publishers, the future of the 
Canadian Press agency in Quebec is at stake, at a crucial time in 
our history. Will the government intercede with Southam and 
Hollinger to maintain a minimum of jobs in this organization? A 
minimum of jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I just 
said, the director of competition was informed of this transaction. 
We conducted a number of analyses and came to the conclusion 
that this deal did not significantly reduce competition in Canada as 
provided for in the legislation. Once again, I remind my colleague 
that the law is there to be used in accordance with the mechanism 
provided.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday I was pleased to meet with a number of people in 
Hamilton East. I was saddened, however, to hear the bad news that 
violent crime in the area has increased 187 per cent over the last 
eight years. In addition, criminal charges against young offenders 
jumped 37 per cent from 1994 to 1995.
<P>
	When will the minister admit the Young Offenders Act, 
including Bill C-37, is not working, it is a joke, as many young 
people profess.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the time Bill C-37 was 
introduced by this government, we described it as only the first step 
in dealing with the youth justice system in Canada. That bill has 
now been passed and became effective on December 1, 1995.
<P>
	The second step is work by the justice committee of the House of 
Commons. I asked that committee to travel the country looking at 
the evidence, speaking to parents, police, school principals and 
young people themselves and to come back to Ottawa with 
recommendations for change.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act has now been on the books for 12 
years. It is time to look at the fundamentals of the statute. The 
justice committee is now engaged in that work. Indeed, members of 
my hon. friend's party are well represented by hard working 
members on that committee.
<P>
	Next week the committee is going to be in metropolitan Toronto 
listening to evidence, looking at youth detention facilities and 
getting the facts so it can come back to this House with 
recommendations. I have already said that those are 
recommendations we will pay close attention to.
<P>
	By working together, we can improve the act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
January 1994 the minister asked for submissions from all across 
the country. I saw those submissions. I know what the people of 
Canada were asking for and so does he. He has done nothing since 
then.
<P>
	The most unhappy people are the young people themselves as 
the majority of victims come from that age. Too bad you people do 
not take this more seriously. When will the minister hear their 
voice, scrap the Young Offenders Act and make violent criminals 
fully accountable for their actions?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3259"> 3259 </A></B>

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

It is neither fair nor right for the hon. member to say that nothing 
has been done.
<P>
	Bill C-37, which became effective on December 1, introduced 
important changes to the Young Offenders Act. We doubled the 
maximum penalty for first degree murder. We said that 16 and 
17-year olds accused of crimes of serious violence will be tried in 
adult court unless they can satisfy the courts otherwise. The onus 
rests on them. We have provided for information being freely 
shared among police, school officials and others. Those changes 
are important and are already having an effect. As to further 
changes in the act, we will wait for the recommendations of the 
committee on which the hon. member sits.
<P>
	The other thing we have to bear in mind, which the hon. member 
forgets, is that as difficult a problem as youth crime is, it is not 
going to be resolved by changing the words in the statute. That 
alone is not going to be enough. Until the hon. member works with 
us in our efforts on crime prevention and getting to the causes of 
crime, we will never be able to make the streets of this country 
safe.

<P>

earlier, in Canada, a mechanism is provided under the Competition 
Act.
<P>
	We have experts at the competition bureau who have a great deal 
of experience in the field of competition and who know the 
economic market place well. Needless to say, we are keeping a 
close watch on all deals made from coast to coast. If the 
competition bureau notices a decline in competition on the 
Canadian market, it will take action.

	Otherwise, there is a mechanism available to all Canadians, 
which any six citizens from anywhere in the country can use to call 
for a review, if necessary.

We certainly hope, Mr. Speaker, that our experts are experienced. 
Otherwise, we would be in trouble.

this transaction, which will effectively transfer to two American 
companies the power to set the price of flour in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the risk 
of repeating myself, in 1986, Canada put in place a process to 
analyze mergers, buyouts and cases of unfair competition. This is a 
great and highly effective process. We have a bureau employing a 
number of experts called upon to analyze the market and its 
transactions. When they find that competition is declining, they 
take action; alternatively, individuals can use the mechanism 
provided for in the legislation.

position our industry strongly supports. It helps to preserve its 
export market into the United States. That in turn helps to 
preserve thousands of jobs.
<P>
	In fact, if an amount of lumber which is equivalent to the average 
over the last three years is exported, not a nickel in fees will be 
paid. It will be a free flow. Last year was a record year. The 
industry could go to over 90 per cent of the amount and still have it 
as a free flow. Any fees that are paid over that will be staying in 
Canada. They will not be going to the United States treasury.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the last two years the Liberals' explanation for 
cancelling the Pearson airport development contract was that the 
developer's profits would have been excessive. Now the 
government has admitted that the potential profits were far from 
excessive. In fact, the Liberals in a court of law are stating that the 
developer would have lost money on Pearson.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Transport please tell us which Liberal 
statement we should believe: the one which was made in the House 
that the developer would have made too much money, or the one 
which was made in a court of law that the developer would have 
gone broke?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
</B><B>Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is facing a lawsuit 
in Toronto on this issue. It would be entirely inappropriate for me 
to comment on the particulars of this case at this time, save to say 
that the plaintiffs in this case were claiming $172 million for lost 
profits. Then what happened? They upped their claim to over $600 
million in lost profits.
<P>
	The government has a responsibility to the Canadian taxpayer to 
test the validity of that claim. To that end, the government retained 
the experts who provided the government with the correct advice 
on the plaintiffs' case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Pearson Development Corporation was prepared to spend 
more than $800 million of private sector money renovating 
Canada's most essential airport. Instead what we got was a contract 
cancellation from the newly elected Liberal government. More 
than two years later, there is still no alternative development of 
those terminals under way.
<P>
	Now that the Liberals have admitted in court that the developer's 
profits were not excessive, will they admit to the House that the 
real reason they cancelled the Pearson contract was to cover up 
more misspoken election rhetoric?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a little behind 
the times. If he read the papers and paid attention to the news 
broadcasts he would understand that negotiations for the 
changeover from the federal government to a new local airport 
authority are proceeding ahead of schedule. In fact, the government 
expects to transfer the Pearson International Airport to a local 
airport authority in the very near future.
<P>

solemn question today for the Prime Minister or whoever is 
speaking for him.
<P>
	Integrity was the theme of the red book. Yet we have this case 
before us of the defence minister using split contracts to avoid 
tendering so that he can award his campaign workers. Senior 
officials at Treasury Board have said this is unacceptable, unethical 
and should be disciplined.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3261"> 3261 </A></B>
<P>
	If ever the ethics counsellor was needed to clear the air on 
behalf of Canadian taxpayers, this is the occasion. Will the Prime 
Minister call on the ethics counsellor to investigate this blatant 
abuse of public funds?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
explained this matter a number of times in the House.
<P>
	There are budgets for full time employees. There are budgets for 
people who are hired on a short term project basis. The one that has 
been referred to in the House was a short term project which 
obviously was extended because of the nature of the legislative 
changes that were made with respect to the War Veterans 
Allowance Act.
<P>
	The key thing here is that the arrangement followed Treasury 
Board guidelines. That was stated by the President of the Treasury 
Board. It has been stated by me in this House. It has been stated by 
my officials.
<P>
	The hon. member is giving the false impression that what was 
done in the case of those people whom I retained contravened 
Treasury Board guidelines. I would hope that the member would 
stop giving out this misinformation because it is absolutely false.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is getting 
absurd.
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised that we would have an 
independent ethics counsellor, yet that counsellor reports to the 
Prime Minister. Now we have this minister standing up in the 
House to say why he should not be investigated. Where is this 
going to lead?
<P>
	If it is the minister who is going to respond to these questions, I 
am going to ask him specifically: What did this individual do? He 
got contracts of over $100,000. It would take most people probably 
two or three years to earn that amount. What did this individual 
specifically do that would earn him this kind of money and how 
was that justified?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again this 
question has been answered.
<P>
	The individual concerned assisted with finding a solution to a 
very difficult matter and then implementing it. Certain individuals 
by an adjudicator's decision were given benefits to which they 
were not entitled under the War Veterans Allowance Act which was 
passed by this House in the 1920s. As a result there was an 
overpayment of nearly $30 million a year for 10 years. That was 
unacceptable.
<P>
	This government reviewed every single spending priority and 
found that we could not sustain this kind of expenditure because 
Parliament did not originally intend members of the resistance to 
get those funds. In fact Canada was the only country paying those 
particular individuals.
<P>
	The hon. member is so concerned about the administrative 
procedures within my budget but can he assure me that his own 
leader's budget is not being used in the same way? Can he assure 
me that his leader has not been making similar arrangements with 
people associated with the Reform Party? We know that at least 
three defeated Reform candidates are working for members 
opposite, including the leader of the Reform Party.

<P>
	I understand that an agreement has been reached with the 
province of Alberta on the issue of user fees in private clinics. I 
would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health to 
tell the House what this agreement will mean for Albertans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to report that an agreement 
was struck between the Minister of Health for Canada and his 
counterpart in Alberta.
<P>
	The agreement is essentially twofold. As of July 1 private clinics 
will no longer be permitted to bill patients for facility fees for 
insured services and at the same time bill the province for 
physicians' fees. The federal deductions in the transfers to Alberta 
will cease immediately upon this decision.
<P>
	For Albertans and Canadians everywhere, this means that the 
Canada Health Act does work and the principles are being upheld 
because of co-operation between governments. It means the

<P>
	As part of the restructuring of employment centres, the Granby 
CEC, which is located in the riding I have the privilege to 
represent, saw its staff cut to an extent that is unjustifiable if we 
compare it to cuts made at the Cowansville CEC, in the 
neighbouring Liberal riding of Brome-Missisquoi. The Granby 
centre will now have the same number of employees as the one in 
Cowansville, although it must serve twice the number of taxpayers.

<B><A NAME="3262"> 3262 </A></B>
<P>
	Although the minister has repeatedly said that the purpose of 
the restructuring was to improve services, can he tell us the logic 
behind a decision to allocate the same number of employees to 
both centres, when one of them serves a population twice as large?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the process of restructuring a 
department and changing service delivery to our clients, decisions 
are never easy.
<P>
	However I would like to explain to my hon. colleague, as we 
have already tried to do on numerous occasions, that we are always 
ready and willing to provide him with all the information and 
explanations, either through our director general for Quebec or 
through officials of my department and myself. We had to take 
decisions throughout Canada and Quebec, and these are always 
very difficult. They are never decisions that will please those living 
in the communities hit the hardest.
<P>
	As for the purpose of the exercise, we have only one criterion: 
that is to be certain that, at the end of the exercise, we can provide 
the necessary services to people. With yesterday's announcement, I 
hope that we will have strategies in the future that will perhaps 
improve the situation. But, for the time being, we believe we have

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

Quebec claims that since his province receives half of the refugees 
to Canada, Ottawa should pay for the services that Quebec provides 
to them. While many refugees are attracted to Quebec because of 
the high rate of acceptance of refugee claims in that province, the 
Quebec government fails to mention that almost half of the 
immigrants to Quebec leave that province within the first two 
years.
<P>

taxpayers will not end up footing the bill as the separatist forces in 
Quebec attempt to display some compassion for newcomers to that 
province.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not 
unusual for major ports of entry like Montreal to receive a large 
number of refugees. Much the same occurs in Toronto and 
Vancouver. It fluctuates among the ports of entry in this country. 
Immigrants come to all the large centres of the country. Once they 
are here there is freedom of movement in the country. We do not 
order people to stay where they have landed. They are allowed to 
move across the country.

problem of working with industry. We are encouraging it to appoint 
stakeholders in a common way to decide how those rural adaptation 
dollars will be used in order to benefit the industry.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before question period, I was saying that the  leader of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3265"> 3265 </A></B>
<P>
Bloc Quebecois and I met with the premier of Newfoundland and 
with the Leader of the Opposition and a third person, the leader of 
the third party in the Newfoundland legislature, to discuss the 
proposed amendment to term 17 in the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	This meeting was held May 29. We discussed two issues: first, 
the recognition of the democratic process and, second, the 
protection of francophone minorities. I think no one will be 
surprised that we in the Bloc Quebecois have always been 
concerned about the rights of francophone minorities across 
Canada.
<P>
	We discussed in very broad terms the democratic process and the 
rights of francophones. We know how they proceeded in that 
province; we know that, when the referendum question was 
drafted, even some of the Liberal government members were 
opposed to its wording because, in their opinion, it was not specific 
enough, it was too ambiguous, it very much favoured the yes side at 
the expense of the no side. We also know that, when the referendum 
question was adopted by the Newfoundland legislature, the Leader 
of the Opposition and the leader of the third party were against it. 
Furthermore we know that religious authorities in Newfoundland 
had major concerns about the wording of the question, which they 
deemed not specific enough. They thought the amendment would 
reduce their jurisdiction and powers. We are aware of the low rate 
of participation in the referendum. However we in the Bloc 
Quebecois simply recognize the democratic process, which was 
discussed at that meeting.
<P>
	For us, the question was legitimate since it was chosen by duly 
elected members of the legislature. This referendum was also held 
in accordance with good practice, in that both the yes side and the 
no side agreed to express their views and to work to publicize the 
approach they favoured in relation to the amendment of Term 17 in 
the Constitution. This was a legitimate project, a very clear process 
in that province.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	We, as members of the House, must acknowledge that. Whether 
or not we support denominational schools, whether or not we 
approve the proposition made by the Government of 
Newfoundland, the population has rendered a clear verdict: 54 per 
cent of Newfoundlanders said yes to the constitutional amendment 
proposed by their provincial government. In other words, the 
Government of Newfoundland had its political decision confirmed 
through a referendum, and this is sacred for the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	We must not interfere with the democratic process. This is why 
we support the proposed amendment to Term 17 of the Terms of 
Union of Newfoundland with Canada. Following our meeting with 
the Newfoundland premier and the others I mentioned earlier, the 
Bloc Quebecois leader immediately sent a letter to the premier, to 
inform him of our support.
<P>
	I will take the time to read this very short letter. It is, of course, 
addressed to the Hon. Brian Tobin, Premier of Newfoundland.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Honourable Premier,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government is about to table in the House of Commons your 
province's request to amend Term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland 
with Canada, so as to restructure Newfoundland's school system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your government proceeded by way of a referendum and a majority of voters 
supported the amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Bloc Quebecois has decided to support Newfoundland's decision, since 
it was made in compliance with recognized democratic rules.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, we are concerned about the inadequate school rights of 
Newfoundland's French speaking minority. Therefore, we strongly hope that 
your government will take the opportunity provided by the restructuring of the 
school legislation to give francophones in your province, through legislative 
and administrative means, full responsibility for the management of their 
schools.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This letter accurately reflects the discussions that took place 
during the meeting with the Premier of Newfoundland.
<P>
	As you can see, this is a far cry from the issues referred to by Mr. 
Tobin regarding this meeting, as reported in various newspapers, 
including <I>Le Devoir</I>, in its issue of Thursday, May 30, 1996. I was 
stunned when I read the article in that newspaper, since I was 
present at the meeting.
<P>
	The title read: ``Constitutional amendment for Newfoundland: 
Tobin pleased by the Bloc's position. According to him, the 
sovereignist party recognizes the rule of law under any 
circumstances in Canada''. I do not know where the premier got 
such information. This issue was certainly not discussed during the 
meeting. As I said, we talked about the democratic process, the 
referendum and the fact that the population had clearly expressed 
itself through that referendum.
<P>
	A bit further on, we also read: ``The Bloc Quebecois and, by 
extension the sovereignist movement as a whole, shows that the 
rule of law must prevail in Canada, whatever the circumstances, 
according to Brian Tobin''. There is even an allusion to the fact 
that, since the Bloc Quebecois endorses the approach that the 
Government of Newfoundland wishes to take, it is even saying that 
the Canadian federation is working well, that it is far from being a 
prison, that it is possible to amend the Constitution.
<P>
	These topics were not discussed, as I said earlier. And, by the 
way, how do you expect that we in the Bloc Quebecois, we who 
represent the people of Quebec, can recognize the rule of law of a 
Constitution that we never signed? Has everyone forgotten that 
Quebec did not sign the Constitution Act of 1982. Mr. Tobin must 
be aware of it. If not, I hope he is listening today, but I am sure he 
knows it full well. I am sure he was just trying to score  political 
points on an issue that is nonetheless very important.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3266"> 3266 </A></B>
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois have not stooped to this sort of 
political trick. We have simply bowed to democracy, which 
expressed its view of Term 17.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I will conclude as follows. If Mr. Tobin and the Government of 
Newfoundland's approach works, it is no thanks to the 
Constitution, but rather to the fact that the people of Newfoundland 
spoke democratically and that certain responsible members of the 
House of Commons are acting accordingly.
<P>
	The person making irresponsible and inflammatory remarks and 
acting like the warder of the Canadian Constitution is not a member 
of the Bloc, he is none other than the Prime Minister of Canada. If 
the supreme Constitutional gaoler, the source of Canadian truth, 
listens to the democratic expression of the people, this precedent 
does not mean that the Constitution is flexible and effective, but 
rather that the democratic choice of a people in a referendum is 
decisive and irreversible.
<P>
	The history of Newfoundland is and will be useful to us in 
Quebec. As I said at the start of my speech, the people of 
Newfoundland became Canadians in 1948 with only a small 
majority, with only 52.34 per cent in the second referendum. 
Today, in 1996, with only 54 per cent, the government of 
Newfoundland will throw the whole system of education into a 
state of upheaval, thereby causing fear, anxiety and questions.
<P>
	The best part of the democratic process is when Newfoundland 
taxpayers spoke, their decision was heard. Newfoundlanders have 
changed this fear and anxiety and these questions into a coalition 
among themselves aimed at meeting challenges.
<P>
	Elected officials worked, as they did in 1948, as responsible 
statesmen, independent of party affiliation-I saw it when I met the 
premier of Newfoundland with the two other party leaders-and 
will work in the future to advance the people of Newfoundland and 
to improve their future.
<P>
	I truly hope that the Bloc Quebecois' action in this matter will 
inspire the view taken by certain individuals of the democratic 
choice the people of Quebec will make in the very near future, I 
hope.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
Reform Party's critic for intergovernmental affairs it is my 
responsibility to respond to the government's request to pass a 
constitutional resolution on Term 17 of Newfoundland's terms of 
union in Confederation.
<P>
	The terms of union were established when Newfoundland 
entered Confederation in 1949. Generally, the provision of the 
terms covered a wide range of issues, including education, social rograms and such things as the margarine trade, which were of vital 
importance to the new province at the time of Confederation.
<P>
	Specifically, Term 17 guaranteed powers to various religious 
denominations for the administering of education in the province 
of Newfoundland and Labrador. There was, prior to Confederation, 
a long tradition of denominational education in the province.
<P>
	There have been some changes to the system over the years. In 
1969, on their own, several Protestant denominations consolidated 
their efforts by creating what is known as the integrated school 
board. In 1987 Parliament and the Newfoundland legislature 
specifically amended Term 17 to grant to another denominational 
group, the Pentecostal Assemblies, the same rights and privileges 
that were in the original terms of union that we are debating today.
<P>
	Nevertheless, in spite of these changes, today there remains a 
large number of school systems and school boards in the province 
of Newfoundland. There are no fewer than four school systems and 
twenty-seven school boards throughout what is one of our smaller 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	In 1992 the province of Newfoundland and Labrador appointed a 
royal commission to look into education issues. It recommended 
changes to the structure of the current system. For several years 
deliberations have been ongoing between the denominational 
school boards and the provincial government to negotiate changes. 
Unfortunately a final agreement on all matters has not been 
reached.
<P>
	The motion before us will allow the Government of 
Newfoundland to proceed to make some changes without 
additional lengthy, difficult and possibly fruitless discussions. 
Nevertheless I want to add that as parliamentarians representing 
other provinces we regret that the Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador has not been able to resolve this matter and bring it to 
a satisfactory conclusion among all the parties.
<P>
	Section 43 is being invoked to pass this amendment. The House 
will know that section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982 requires 
constitutional amendments affecting only a particular province to 
be passed by the assembly of that province, in this case the 
Newfoundland Assembly, and also the federal Parliament, both the 
House of Commons and the Senate, although the Senate's power 
over this is only of a suspensive nature.
<P>
	As parliamentarians representing not Newfoundland in this case 
but other parts of the country, the Reform Party takes the role of 
Parliament in the section 43 amendment procedure very seriously. 
It is not in our view our job to merely rubber stamp constitutional 
change because it comes from one particular province. We are 
entrusted with a job to examine the impacts of  the changes and 
decide what course of action is best from the federal perspective. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3267"> 3267 </A></B>
<P>
so doing, the Reform Party caucus has examined the wide range of 
issues and interests involved in this question.
<P>
	It is not our intention, nor is it our desire, to see the federal 
government or federal political parties run the education system in 
Newfoundland and Labrador or in any other province, particularly 
when we all know that the administering of these systems are and 
will require in the future very difficult decisions to be made locally.
<P>
	Instead, as parliamentarians, we have focused our attention on 
two issues. First, was sufficient effort made by the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador to obtain democratic consent for the 
changes that are being proposed today? Second, are the questions 
of rights protection and minority rights-we are talking about 
denominational or faith based education-being done in a way that 
would be broadly consistent with or acceptable to other parts of the 
country?
<P>
	These are difficult questions, all the more so for those of us who 
believe very strongly in the importance of separate and religious 
education in Canada and who recognize the central and important 
role, and I think very beneficial role, that is made up education 
today by Catholic schools and Catholic education in particular 
across the country.
<P>
	As Reformers we have been very serious about the fact that 
governments, in particular when it involves constitutional change, 
should make broader efforts to encourage democratic participation 
and consensus in major government constitutional decisions. We 
believe this is important to increase the legitimacy and acceptance 
of our foundation constitutional documents but also that broad 
participation of the public in such decisions improves the quality of 
those decisions.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that under section 43 of the Constitution 
Act, the Newfoundland government was not required to go beyond 
a mere vote of the legislature in order to resolve this issue or to 
present it to this Parliament. All that was required was a resolution 
of the Newfoundland House of Assembly. In fact, the 
Newfoundland House of Assembly has held at least two votes. It 
held a vote on the main resolution we are presented with today, a 
vote in which the major parties allowed freedom of expression and 
in which there were dissenters in each of the major political parties. 
Nevertheless the vote passed in the legislature by a clear majority. 
As well, there has recently been a unanimous resolution asking the 
governments of Newfoundland and Canada to proceed with these 
changes.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Although it was not required by the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador by constitutional law, the government 
did hold a referendum on the issue of constitutional change with 
respect to term 17. That  referendum was held on September 5 of 
last year. At that time the people of Newfoundland voted in favour 
of revising term 17 along the lines proposed by the government by 
a majority of 54.7 per cent, although admittedly the turn out for 
that referendum was low.
<P>
	Newfoundlanders are familiar with referendums. A referendum 
got them into Confederation in the first place. There were two 
referendums, one on June 3, the other on July 22 of 1948, in which 
Newfoundlanders were asked to determine their future. This led to 
an eventual decision to join Canada. The eventual decision was 
also by a narrow margin.
<P>
	In our examination of the procedures followed in Newfoundland 
the majority of our caucus is satisfied that Newfoundland held the 
referendum in good faith in accordance with normal electoral law 
and referendum practice that would be acceptable in other parts of 
the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With regard to the use of referendums and the position of the 
Bloc Quebecois, I have one comment to make. Some separatists 
believe that the willingness of the Canadian government to accept 
the result of the Newfoundland referendum means that the same 
should apply to Quebec after a future referendum on sovereignty. I 
must point out that the premier of Newfoundland and his 
government have abided by the legal process and recognized the 
specific role of the Canadian Parliament in this matter. We expect 
the same from the Quebec government and its premier. So far, it 
has been exactly the reverse, they have been acting unilaterally, 
even illegally.
<P>
	The Reform Party will not accept this constitutional amendment 
and the referendum result as a precedent, unless the Quebec 
government is willing to accept the rule of the law and the 
constitutional process, the role of the Canadian government and 
other legislatures and, in so doing, the rights of all Canadians, as 
did the Newfoundland government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a totally different situation, particularly in the attitudes of 
two governments, in the attitude of the Government of 
Newfoundland compared with the Government of Quebec on its 
own constitutional agenda.
<P>
	I turn to the second consideration, denominational education, in 
particular whether what the Government of Newfoundland is 
proposing is consistent with national standards and the rights of 
practices across the country.
<P>
	Section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 established basic 
protection for minority religious education, at that time largely 
Catholic education in the three English speaking provinces and 
Protestant education in the province of Quebec. As various 
provinces have been admitted to Confederation there have been, in 
most  cases, equivalent terms established in the Constitution Act 
for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3268"> 3268 </A></B>
<P>
section 93 in all of the provinces. There are terms established for 
Alberta under the Alberta Act.
<P>
	Across the country there are over five million students enrolled 
in full time elementary and secondary schools. They are served by 
over 15,000 schools according to figures from 1990-91. The 
Constitution Act, 1867 placed education exclusively under the 
control of each provincial legislature. This was later confirmed by 
the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	Canada therefore has 10 provincial education systems plus those 
of the territories. There are considerable differences among them 
and there are some similarities. In particular, there is the broad 
rights protection provided under section 93.
<P>
	Funding required by school boards for provincial or territorial 
coffers varies widely. For example, as a percentage of total school 
board revenues the portion provided by a province varies from a 
low of 40 per cent in Ontario to a high of 100 per cent in Prince 
Edward Island and New Brunswick.
<P>
	Several provinces provide tax support to school boards 
organized on a denominational basis. School acts in Quebec, 
Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories give 
such support for elementary and secondary education in both 
public and separate, or in the case of Quebec dissentient, school 
boards.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	A non-sectarian public education system operates in Manitoba, 
British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Price Edward 
Island. I note the British Columbia government does provide some 
funding to religious schools and denominational education does 
exist. In Yukon both public and Roman Catholic schools receive 
tax support.
<P>
	In the view of the majority of the Reform caucus the revisions to 
term 17 do not destroy the rights to religious education in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. As I just mentioned, in comparison 
with other provinces and territories, the changes to term 17 will not 
create a situation out of line with the other provinces. That is very 
generous considering the practices in some provinces.
<P>
	From section (a) of the new term 17, let me quote: ``That except 
as provided for in the new administrative structure, schools 
established, maintained and operated with public funds shall be 
denominational schools, and any class having rights under this 
term as it read on January 1, 1995 shall continue to have the right to 
provide for religious education, activities and observances for the 
children of that class in those schools, and the group of classes that 
form when integrated schools system by agreement in 1969 may 
exercise the same rights under this term as a single class of 
persons''.
<P>
	Section (b) of the proposed term allows for the establishment of 
new schools on both a non-denominational and a denominational 
basis and the provision of these schools to receive public funds.
<P>
	Section (c) provides for the right to religious education in all 
aspects of denominational schools, including not only religious 
education but a say in the religious element of the curriculum in 
other aspects of the program and control over teaching staff in 
these areas.
<P>
	Section (d) provides for non-discriminatory allocation of public 
funds among denominational groups on a non discriminatory basis.
<P>
	Section (e) allows that on the new school boards to be 
established by the government, two-thirds of the representatives 
will be denominational representatives or representatives elected to 
represent specific classes of persons, although the overall school 
board will be organized on a multi-denominational basis or on a 
uni-confessional basis.
<P>
	Where does the new term 17 differ enough from the practices 
that went on before? From all indications Newfoundland and 
Labrador will continue to have denominational schools; broadly 
speaking, a denominational school system within the larger 
framework. The right to religious education is in no way removed.
<P>
	The doubts about these changes happening to term 17 occur 
where the wording states ``subject to provincial legislation that is 
uniformly applicable to all schools specifying conditions for 
establishment or continued operation of schools''.
<P>
	Education in every province and territory is subject to provincial 
legislation. This clause does not make the issue exceptional but 
instead makes it rather ordinary in terms of the practices of other 
provinces.
<P>
	I reiterate the official position of my party on these two 
questions, both the democratic consent and the process by which 
Newfoundland adopted this position and also the general standards 
of rights and freedoms to denominational education as we know it 
across the country. In evaluating those two positions the clear 
majority of the Reform caucus is in support of this amendment and 
is supported as the official position of the Reform caucus.
<P>
	As this is a sensitive and controversial issue that involves a wide 
range of conflicting interests, interpretation of specifics and 
questions of conscience, the Reform leader has made it clear this 
will be subject to a free vote when it is voted on in Parliament. On 
ordinary business of Parliament Reform MPs enjoy substantial and 
unprecedented latitude in expressing and voting their political 
views and those of their constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3269"> 3269 </A></B>
<P>
	I am glad to see that in both Newfoundland and in the position 
taken by the Liberal government, the government is finally 
showing some movement in this direction not only toward free 
voting in the House but toward accepting the practice of consulting 
the people and having referendums on constitutional change.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the debate concerns 
chapter 5 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which is addressed to 
constituent power, the ultimate source of constitutional power in 
the state.
<P>
	It is an area in which there is an absence of compelling or 
binding precedents or practice. It is proper therefore for Parliament 
to attempt to lay down constitutional ground rules as to what is 
involved and what is not involved.
<P>
	The first of these, of course, is that what Parliament says in a 
constitutional debate, unlike the position Parliament views in 
ordinary legislation, amounts to travaux préparatoires, 
authoritative sources regarding what Parliament intended, which 
are controlling on the courts in their approach to that matter.
<P>
	Whether this is, as presented, a section 43 matter involving only 
Parliament and one other province is a matter for Parliament to 
decide, not the province, and that it is judicially reviewable as such 
by the courts.
<P>
	Further, it is a mandate to Parliament in the sense of both 
chambers under chapter 5 of the Constitution, not to the cabinet, 
not to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I have argued, as members would be aware, for the attrition of 
the Senate's powers over the House as an unappointed body in 
other areas, but it is difficult to deny in the case of an act adopted as 
recently as the Constitution Act, 1982 that the Senate does not have 
full power equal to that of the House in this matter.
<P>
	I reiterate that Parliament is not a rubber stamp for a proposal 
submitted by a provincial legislature. It is no mere ministerial one 
to follow up the wishes of provincial legislatures. Parliament has 
full political discretion in exercising its role to accept, to reject or 
to send back to the province with suggestions of desirable 
amendments that the province should make to obtain Parliament's 
approval.
<P>
	I stress again that Parliament in approaching its role is aware of 
the principle of economy in the use of power which is applicable as 
much to constitutional matters as to military matters.
<P>
	There is an obligation on a province approaching Parliament to 
exhaust the ordinary political processes within the province before 
escalating to a constitutional amendment which it would ask 
Parliament to adopt.
<P>
	Parliament in this case is limiting itself to the facts presented by 
the provincial legislature of Newfoundland.  It is a Newfoundland 
situation, and Parliament's decision to approve or not to approve 
the project of resolution should be understood in that context.
<P>
	In particular, it should be taken in the context of chapter 5 of 
whole of the Constitution Act, 1982. It sets out various procedures 
for amending the Constitution with different degrees of difficulty 
in the procedures of amendment which are intended to correspond 
to the seriousness or otherwise of the proposals concerned.
<P>
	Since section 43-based amendments are limited to the province 
or provinces actually approaching Parliament, Parliament in 
responding and carrying forward a proposal for an amendment is 
limiting itself to those provinces. What we are saying is no 
precedent in constitutional legal terms is created from this 
disposition that might apply to other provinces not represented as 
parties to the action. Section 43-based constitutional amendments 
have no application to any other than the particular moving parties 
concerned.
<P>
	I suggested earlier when the matter first arose in political arenas 
that there might be merits in obtaining an advisory opinion from 
the Supreme Court that would address itself to the issues on which I 
have spoken. However, an advisory opinion can of course be a prior 
opinion, or a subsequent one if questions of doubt or interpretation 
arise. After the adoption of the present resolution, they could 
properly be referred to the Supreme Court for an advisory opinion.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	In approaching this matter I am very sensitive to the principles 
of federal comity, that is to say the particular obligations of good 
faith and mutual trust and respect that link provinces and the 
federal government in a federal system such as ours.
<P>
	I have already spoken of the prior obligation of a province to 
exhaust the ordinary political processes before approaching us for a 
constitutional amendment. The federal Parliament, in responding 
to a provincial request, will bear in mind what the late Mr. Justice 
Frankfurter of the United States Supreme Court said about the duty 
of the federal government, in exercise of federal comity, to defer to 
a province even if on particular facts the federal government might 
have chosen to act otherwise in the legislation that is involved.
<P>
	It is in that spirit that we approach this resolution. I have taken 
note of the fact that representations have been made to many 
members of the House by individual voters in Newfoundland on 
this question. We do take in mind the fact that the premier of 
Newfoundland has met with us and has given assurances that he 
will, in the application of this resolution of amendment, if it is 
adopted, negotiate and deal with people within his province.
<P>
	Federal comity works two ways. It is a reciprocal obligation, and 
we take very seriously the assurances given by the premier of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3270"> 3270 </A></B>
<P>
Newfoundland who is well known and respected as a distinguished 
former member of the House.
<P>
	I am acting on the basis of these assurances, and also my 
awareness that the application under section 43 cannot, in 
constitutional law terms, extend beyond the project submitted by 
the province of Newfoundland that it does not constitute a 
constitutional legal precedent for other cases and that, in particular, 
it can have no constitutional application to parties not represented 
before the Parliament in this proposal. It cannot touch fundamental 
rights or other matters. It would require other amending procedures 
with extraordinary majorities and processes not present in the 
relatively simple section 43 application.
<P>
	Therefore, it is on that basis and having expressed these views 
which, as travaux préparatoires, do indicate an intent of Parliament 
and which we would expect the courts, as a co-ordinate institution, 
to respect that I am prepared to support the resolution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with a certain sadness that I rise on this motion we are discussing 
and on which we will have to vote very shortly. It seems to me we 
are dealing with and debating a fundamental issue.
<P>
	We are changing the constitutional rights acquired by minorities 
in exchange of their promise to join Canada-so it was an 
exchange-without their consent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Changing the rights of minorities without their consent, 
particularly when they were given to Newfoundlanders in exchange 
and as part of the package for joining Canada and especially since 
they were broadened in 1987, is something I take very seriously 
and needs to be thought about very carefully. That is my principal 
and major concern in this debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are other aspects that puzzle me and that I must absolutely 
talk about. There were other alternatives, other options.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What were those other options or alternatives? I guess it would 
have been a bold stroke of leadership to have come forward with an 
amendment which would have responded to the rights, hopes, 
dreams and aspirations of all of the key stakeholders. That is what I 
would have preferred. Then it would have gone through the House, 
probably unanimously.
<P>
	There was another one. Why not proceed with the 
implementation of the changes that were supposedly required now? 
Some of them are happening today. Senior administrators have 
received notices that they will no longer be working as of August 
31. Obviously, some movement is occurring. Later on, if it had 
been necessary to bring forward the amendment, it could have been 
used then.
<P>
	I am told from very reliable sources, including both government 
and others who oppose, that an agreement has been reached, at least 
in principle-and one could quibble about that-on the number of 
school boards there would be, on funding of capital expenditures, 
on the viability of schools, busing and a construction board. Those 
are major issues that had been discussed and, at least, agreement in 
principle had been reached.
<P>
	Why could this agreement not have been turned over to the court 
of appeal of the province or the Supreme Court of Canada in order 
to see whether it is consistent with Term 17? That would have been 
another alternative, besides the other two I have mentioned.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some people maintain there will be no effects on education 
elsewhere or on minority rights in other areas. If we look at this 
issue from the legal viewpoint, they are absolutely right. We do not 
even need to debate the issue. But will links be made? Of course.
<P>
	Already, Newfoundland francophones are asking the following 
question: ``Why is there no concern for our rights to manage our 
own system at this time when we are discussing the rights of other 
minorities?'' This is a question that has been asked before. I am 
told there will be no impact, legally speaking. There will be no 
legal impact. It will not change everything overnight, but there 
will, of course, be an impact.
<P>
	The Federation of Newfoundland Indians said this: ``What about 
our rights that have not yet been recognized? Why not recognize 
them now?'' Some public school commissioners were quoted in 
Ontario newspapers as saying that something like this proposed 
amendment was needed in Ontario.
<P>
	You are totally right in saying there will be no legal impact. I 
fully agree with you. However, it is not quite the case when we look 
at the links that will be established.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There has been some significant discussion with respect to 
lobbying. The Roman Catholics and the Pentecostal people 
performed all kinds of lobbying. I commend them. However, there 
was lobbying on the other side. In fact, I had more lobbying from 
the government side than I did from the other side which 
supposedly was doing a lot more than the government. Of course 
the resource base was not at all equal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3271"> 3271 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us put that aside very quickly. I do not know if I was a 
fortunate MP who got more attention from government than 
others, but I have to tell the House that there was lobbying from 
both sides.
<P>
	Much has been said about the academic achievement of 
Newfoundlanders. Some people have suggested that because the 
system is as it is, the achievement is not what it ought to be. Listen 
to what the department of education of Newfoundland and 
Labrador had to say: ``The general level of education among all age 
groups in Newfoundland has risen dramatically since the 
mid-1970s to where the gap with the rest of Canada has all but 
closed''. Does that suggest a large gap? Hardly.
<P>
	The former minister of education said: ``The gap in higher 
education between our province and the rest of Canada is becoming 
a myth-Our university participation rates are higher than the 
national average. If the present trend continues, Newfoundland and 
Labrador will soon have educational levels equal to the rest of the 
country''.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I could have found another half dozen to a dozen quotes from the 
department of education, bureaucrats and elected officials but I 
chose those two just to make the point. Let us not exaggerate that 
situation.
<P>
	The other point that needs to be mentioned is that the 
government is the one that has complete authority on curriculum, 
text materials, numbers of teachers, funding, teacher education and 
performance standards. The government has the responsibility 
now. If there is poor performance who are we going to blame? Of 
course I have shown that there is not necessarily poor performance.
<P>
	Some people have spoken about the referendum as an ideal, a 
model mechanism. Referendums can be useful but they can also be 
extremely dysfunctional. This referendum by the way was held on 
September 5. It was preceded by the summer months which is not a 
great time for substantive debate on an important question.
<P>
	I wonder who had more resources at their disposal in order to 
make the point. Let me share with the House the question. This is 
what the people of Newfoundland were asked to vote on: ``Do you 
support Term 17 in the manner proposed by the government to 
enable reform of the denominational educational system?''
<P>
	With a question like that one could expect to get 50 per cent even 
with no debate. Ask the question in any province or territory: ``Do 
you support reform of education?'' Ask parents whether or not they 
support reform. Yet the turnout was 52 per cent and 54 per cent in 
favour of such a question.
<P>
	Was that an appropriate tool to use to legitimize what the 
government wanted? Frankly, I would have preferred no 
referendum. Now in a sense we have a benchmark. Again, it has no 
legal basis but do we really believe that  someone is not going to try 
to use this to advance a political agenda? It has already been done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
It was done in the House of Commons here in Ottawa not too long 
ago, and it will happen again.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me share just a couple of points very quickly. I contend that 
schools are at the mercy of provincial legislation. I want to quote a 
bit of the legislation. It reads: ``Subject to provincial legislation 
that is uniformly applicable to all schools specifying conditions for 
the establishment or continued operation of schools''. This is 
subject to provincial legislation so the constitutional right has been 
lost. Someone could be premier today, later another premier and it 
is subject to that provincial legislation.
<P>
	Further it states in part: ``and to direct the teaching of aspects of 
curriculum affecting religious beliefs''. The idea was to ensure that 
those groups that were affected would still have something to say. 
To direct is not to determine. It does not give a policy decision 
making capability. It limits involvement.
<P>
	Why could we not at this time bring forward an amendment to 
the amendment that would respond to those legitimate concerns 
which would respond to other concerns that have been voiced that 
are legitimate, that really strike at the heart of the concerns which 
have been expressed here.
<P>
	I know that I have but a few seconds left, and I want to finish on 
this note. It seems to me that we need to hear more about this issue. 
As I said before there are other alternatives: a reference to the 
courts, an amendment that would respond to the needs of all people 
or proceeding with the changes and then coming with the 
amendment. That would prevent us from having to address this 
whole issue of a changing of constitutionally acquired rights of 
minorities given to them as part of a package to join Canada. If we 
can find a rationale in this situation, why can we not find one in 
another situation that is convenient to us in the future?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I could have said much more on this whole matter, but I would 
simply like to say, in closing, that if this amendment is passed, I 
think Canada will survive. On the other hand, I am convinced 
reference will be made to how a referendum was used in this 
situation. I am also convinced that some people will make other 
attempts to erode the rights of minorities in other areas.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must compliment the hon. member for St. Boniface on 
his excellent speech. I agree with what he said. I share his concerns 
about this amendment to the Constitution of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3272"> 3272 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to put a question to the member for St. Boniface, 
who, like me, has a great deal of experience in education. In fact, 
I gathered from his speech that the hon. member was once Deputy 
Minister of Education of his province. This means that whatever 
he may say on this subject is very important and that he speaks 
from experience. It is clear from what the hon. member said that 
some people have real concerns about this and that we should 
think twice before voting for the motion.
<P>
	I am concerned about French speaking minorities. I wonder why 
French-Canadians cannot run their schools in their own language in 
Newfoundland. The hon. member said other alternatives could be 
considered. In light of his experience, I would be curious to know 
what he has in mind.
<P>
	Instead of taking the major step of asking the Parliament of 
Canada to approve this amendment, what intermediate step could 
the Government of Newfoundland have taken before asking us to 
amend the Constitution?
<P>
	He raised another point that caused me some concern, and I 
would like him to clarify this for me. He mentioned that people in 
Ontario were interested in something similar in order to make 
changes to the education system in Ontario. As a French speaking 
catholic, both minority groups in Ontario, I wonder if he could 
elaborate on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
questions. It seems to me I clearly indicated that there were a 
number of alternatives, such as a reference to the courts to 
determine whether the agreement already reached meets the 
conditions of Term 17, or an amendment that would meet the needs 
of all those involved, or bring in changes, as was done before, and 
use the amendment later on, if necessary.
<P>
	These are at least three options. As for francophones in 
Newfoundland and the fact that they do not manage their own 
schools, I do not know. It must be recognized that progress can 
sometimes be very slow in some provinces. However, I do hope 
that the new premier, who made a commitment and who showed 
some openness, will be able to remedy the situation. I say this in all 
sincerity, and I applaud the efforts of Newfoundlanders in this 
regard. I am prepared, along with my French speaking colleagues, 
to try to help them.
<P>
	With regard to the comment made about Ontario, this is what I 
have been told. That comment was from a public school trustee 
who thought some savings could be made by somehow merging or 
restricting the powers or the authority of catholic schools or school 
boards.
<P>
	Let us not get carried away. I do not believe that, if the 
amendment is adopted, minority rights will completely changed, 
whether in the education sector or in any other one. I suggest that a 
lot of questions will be raised. Debates will take place and they will 
not necessarily  promote unity, whether at the community, 
provincial or national level.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak after the hon. member for St. 
Boniface, whose speech I really appreciated. I know he has always 
shown great concern about all the French speaking Canadians from 
sea to sea, whether we agree or not, as is the case with the Bloc 
Quebecois, with that. I think however that we should point out to 
those who are listening that what we have before us is not a bill, but 
rather a constitutional resolution that has to be approved by this 
House and the other place, according to a very specific process, as 
described in our own constitutional regulations under section 43.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I will come back to the rights of French speaking Canadians, 
because it is of course an issue we are all concerned about, but I 
would like all those who take part in this debate to keep in mind 
that what we have before us, the starting point of the motion before 
us, was a democratic referendum held according to rules accepted 
by all of us. In a democracy like ours, we have the responsibility to 
recognize that the best choice is the people's choice.
<P>
	I am not among those who believe that when we do not agree 
with the option chosen by the majority in a referendum, we can 
take issue over the complexity of the referendum question, as some 
people have gotten used to do in Quebec. It is as if a province, 
whether it is Quebec with the self-determination issue or 
Newfoundland with the education system and Term 17, can go 
through a referendum, with all the rallying and the effort it 
requires, without the citizens getting all the information they need.
<P>
	There are two premises to my speech. First, that it is possible 
under our constitutional rules, the rules that we were in some 
respects critical of in Quebec, since we did not sign the 
Constitution Act, 1982, but it must be recognized that, in this 
Parliament, under the existing rules, it is possible under the terms 
of section 43 for a province to ask the federal government to sign a 
bilateral agreement to amend certain provisions of specific concern 
to it. This is certainly the case for the conditions of admission into 
Confederation of Newfoundland in 1949.
<P>
	You will recall that, on three occasions in recent years, we have 
seen, particularly those who have more experience than I do in this 
House, an amending process under section 43. I want to remind 
those listening today of this so that there is no confusion.
<P>
	Under section 43, there was a constitutional amendment putting 
Newfoundland's Pentecostal schools, one of eight religious 
denominations now recognized, on an equal footing with the seven 
others in 1987. This meant that they were recognized as full 
managers in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3273"> 3273 </A></B>
<P>
the  educational system, with all that that implies in the allocation 
of resources.
<P>
	There was a second, more recent, constitutional amendment in 
1993. In fact, members of the Bloc Quebecois took part in the 
debate at that time, but not yours truly. The 1993 amendment 
sought to guarantee the linguistic equality of French and English in 
the province of New Brunswick, which, as a result, became the 
second officially bilingual province in Canada, after Quebec.
<P>
	The third amendment, I remember it well, I took part in the 
debate, dealt with the erosion of the insular nature of Prince 
Edward Island which was to be linked to the mainland by an 
interprovincial bridge. Therefore, in recent history, the possibility 
of amending the Constitution was given to Parliament on three 
occasions.
<P>
	I have not been feeling very well these past few days, but nothing 
will prevent me from taking part in this debate. We must start from 
the premise that a referendum was held in Newfoundland. We are 
not in a situation whereby authority has been usurped. There was a 
referendum and the issue has been discussed in Newfoundland for 
some time now. It has been the subject of official talks since 1992.
<P>
	A referendum was held under the auspices of the province; I am 
somewhat surprised that, except for the justice minister, none of the 
speakers taking part in the debate since this morning has taken the 
time, for the benefit of the viewers, to read the question.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	I do not think, on the face of it-and I will read the 
question-the wording of the question was particularly clear, 
particularly enlightening.
<P>
	The question read as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Do you support revising term 17 in the manner proposed by the 
government to enable reform of the denominational education 
system?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There was no beating around the bush, the question mentioned 
solely Term 17 regarding the denominational education system. 
This is what brings the Bloc Quebecois to support the resolution. 
We have two good reasons. The first one is the fact that there was a 
referendum. A referendum is a consultation tool which is called for 
by the Reform Party, which is recognized by government and 
which is sought by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The referendum-and I think it is important to remember 
that-allowed the people of Newfoundland to say what they 
wanted. We note that only 52 per cent of registered voters exercised 
their right. Of course this is not very much when you compare it to 
the extraordinary exercise in democracy in Quebec a few months 
ago,  where more than 90 per cent of the people exercised their 
right to vote.
<P>
	But again, in a democracy, the best choice is always the one 
made by the people. And 54 per cent of the people of 
Newfoundland who were eligible to vote according to the rules said 
they preferred a review of the education system. That is why the 
Bloc Quebecois supports the motion. We support it because there 
was a referendum whose results may not have been spectacular, but 
did yield a majority opinion. And, once again, every scheme and 
trick can never make us forget that, in our rule, in international law 
as well as within Canadian boundaries, when there is a referendum 
and when there is a general election, the rule that must apply is 50 
per cent plus one.
<P>
	So, as far as legitimacy is concerned, those who do not wish to 
have this amendment agreed to cannot in any way challenge this.
<P>
	Second, what we are talking about here is a matter under 
provincial jurisdiction. It deals with the way the province that was 
the last to join Confederation wants to organize its school system. 
Of course, it has connections with minority rights. But it seems to 
me this is also a distinct issue, because minority rights, particularly 
the right to public services, is inscribed in section 23 of the 
Canadian charter.
<P>
	It is certainly not I who will tell you today that I consider Canada 
to be a model of services towards francophones outside Quebec. 
We are well aware that there are some difficulties in the western 
provinces. I spent the week before last in British Columbia, and I 
know very well that, in British Columbia as well as in 
Newfoundland, people are far from being well served in terms of 
the education rights in the language of the minority. That is what I 
believe makes Canada, in its present configuration, a most unlikely 
country. But the fact that certain minorities have difficulty 
obtaining services, and particularly having their right to education 
in their own language, cannot be negated by the fact that, as we 
speak, in 1996-and this should be first and foremost in our 
thoughts-not one single school in Newfoundland is not a 
denominational school.
<P>
	Can you imagine, in our modern world where education must be 
connected with the labour market and with our plans as a society, 
not having one single secular or non-denominational school in a 
province like Newfoundland, one of Canada's gateways? In 
Newfoundland, school organization is still based on 
denominations.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Personally, I think it does not make any sense, in a society, to 
organize the provision of educational services on the basis of 
religious conviction. I am by no means inferring that I am not a 
God-fearing man myself or that religion does not have its place in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3274"> 3274 </A></B>
<P>
schools, but I do  believe that no school system should be organized 
on the basis of religious affiliation, whatever the denomination.
<P>
	What is going on in Newfoundland in particular is an aberration. 
It is incredible that such a situation still exists. For the benefit of 
our listeners, I would like to point out that it has not been so since 
the beginning of time. There was a commission of inquiry on this. 
It seems to me that when there is a board of inquiry, it means that a 
public debate takes place, that experts give their opinions and that 
the public can be heard.
<P>
	The board, which started its work in 1992, came to the 
conclusion, understandably so, that Newfoundland could not 
modernize its structure unless its school system underwent major 
changes. The proposed review seeks to eliminate a structure with 
four different school systems managed by seven religious 
denominations. How could one not be concerned? How could one 
not have questions about the fact that, in Newfoundland, seven 
denominations, and I will name them, coexist through four 
different school systems, with all the confusion and duplication 
that this situation implies?
<P>
	Just imagine. A young schoolboy gets up in the morning and gets 
on a school bus that drives by three schools, but they are not his 
school. He has to travel further away because the school system is 
based on denominational and not on secular criteria.
<P>
	The seven denominations include the Church of England, the 
Pentecostal Assemblies, the Presbyterian Church, the Roman 
Catholic Church, the Salvation Army, the Church o the 
Seventh-day Adventists and the United Church of Canada.
<P>
	I am convinced that all those denominations have a value system 
that are quite be beneficial to kids. I am convinced as well that 
people in the school system are profoundly dedicated and very 
much involved, but it does not make sense from the point of view 
of resource duplication, and it is not a modern way of structuring a 
school system.
<P>
	Who better to address this issue in the House of Commons than 
the Bloc members, especially those representing the Montreal 
region. As you kow, I am a member from Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Me too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> The hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies who sits right behind me is also a 
member from the Montreal area. We have the same situation in 
Montreal. We have the Montreal Catholic School Commission 
which co-exists with another type of school organization, and 
again, not only do we have a duplication of the structure, but this is 
not the right way or the modern way to set up a school system, 
especially with the changes we will need to face the new 
millennium.
<P>
	You could say: ``Yes, but what does it mean ultimately in terms 
of management?'' This is the most questionable aspect of our 
school system, the impact of a denominational school system, 
because it creates links within the management process that have 
no justification. It means that these denominations and their school 
commissions have some powers over which teachers are hired and 
fired. They have some powers over the building and maintenance 
of the schools. They have some powers over the way the education 
and school operating budgets are spent and, of course, over the 
creation of school districts and especially boundary adjustment.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Members, no doubt, have all received a letter from the premier 
of Newfoundland. I think I can say his name since he is no longer a 
member of Parliament. We have all received a letter from the 
premier of Newfoundland, Brian Tobin. His main theme is the need 
to review the education system in order to integrate it into only one 
multidenominational structure.
<P>
	The premier of Newfoundland, based on the findings of the 
commission of inquiry, has determined that the province of 
Newfoundland can save as much as $17 million. Of course, $17 
million is not the end of the world, but it is a considerable amount, 
given the population of Newfoundland.
<P>
	We are extremely supportive of what is going on in 
Newfoundland. This reminds us of the use of referendums as a 
means of consultation. We will not be able to forget it, and the hon. 
member for St. Boniface is right in saying that he is concerned with 
the precedent that could be set by the interpretation. I believe that 
he is right in reminding us that in a democracy, on a Canada-wide 
scale or in a Quebec-only context, it is obvious that there cannot be 
two interpretations.
<P>
	If, as parliamentarians, we recognize that 54 per cent of 
Newfoundlanders voted for a profound reform of their school 
system, when 52, 51 or 54 per cent of Quebecers decide in a 
democratic referendum held according to the rules adopted by 
Quebec's national assembly to become sovereign, we hope that the 
Canadian Parliament will show the same generous and democratic 
disposition toward Quebec as it is now showing toward 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	Even if there were no debate on Newfoundland and no debate on 
Quebec's right to self-determination we, as the official opposition, 
would still say exactly the same thing we are saying today, which is 
that Newfoundland, following the results of its referendum, has the 
right to ask this and the other House of Parliament to examine a 
constitutional resolution allowing the province to proceed with a 
complete reform of its school system. We would say exactly the 
same thing and, moreover, we think that this is an important 
democratic step.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3275"> 3275 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me conclude, since I see that my time is running out, by 
reminding members that, from what we heard from the 
Newfoundland government, with the proposals put forward by 
premier Tobin and his education minister, it will still be possible 
for parents to send their children to a unidenominational school 
if they make such a request and if there is a sufficient number 
of students. It is very similar to section 23.
<P>
	I think that the Newfoundland government obviously believes 
that this system will be less popular and that the great reform which 
will be proposed will lead to more and more multidenominational 
schools. We want to salute such an initiative.
<P>
	I think we would not have much credibility as parliamentarians 
if, in a debate such as this one, we started to ignore the validity of 
the democratic processes put in place by the provinces.
<P>
	In closing, I urge all members of this House without exception to 
give their warm, enthusiastic and positive support to this resolution 
from the Government of Newfoundland.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and I thank 
him and his party for their participation in this debate.
<P>
	I have observed two positions in the discourse of members of the 
Bloc Quebecois. The first is support for the results of referendums, 
particularly in this case, and the second is almost unconditional 
support for the rights of francophones outside Quebec. I must 
examine both these positions.
<P>
	If there is a referendum outside Quebec on the status of French 
or the rights of francophones, and the result is in favour of change, 
will the Bloc Quebecois accept the results of this referendum or 
will it say that referendums affect only the rights of others and not 
those of francophones?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I forget the member's 
riding, but I would like to congratulate him on his excellent French. 
If I understood his question, he wanted to know whether I would 
accept the results if there were a referendum outside of Quebec on 
the rights of francophones that was not organized by the National 
Assembly and concerned the rights of francophones and therefore, 
necessarily, the rights of francophones outside Quebec.
<P>
	I would say yes right off, but I would ask him to remember two 
things. The first is that no member of the Bloc Quebecois would 
say in this debate that francophones outside Quebec had sufficient 
rights. We are very aware, from what we read in reports on official 
languages, that the situation of francophones outside  Quebec in all 
provinces, from British Columbia to the maritimes, is of great 
concern.
<P>
	We are well aware of that and have urged this government to 
expend additional resources and to ensure that the provinces accord 
francophones the same rights as those enjoyed by the anglophone 
minority in Quebec. I hope the member is aware that no province in 
this country treats its minority with as much regard, generosity and 
resources as Quebec treats its anglophone minority.
<P>
	Second, I am beginning to know the member, one of the brightest 
in his party-the member for Outremont is, of course, but I am 
talking about the Reform member. We must never forget that what 
is sacred about the future of Quebec is its right to 
self-determination. The member has his own ideas on the matter. 
We have had debates and we will have more. A referendum is the 
right process for the people of Quebec to decide their future. When 
I speak of the people of Quebec, I mean all the component parts, 
including the first nations and the anglophone community along 
with the several hundred other ethnic communities in Quebec.
<P>
	I say to him, however, that the only legitimate and acceptable 
way for Quebec to acknowledge the results of some future exercise 
of the right to self-determination is for Quebec itself to decide 
under the law of the National Assembly and the conditions set out 
in the Quebec Referendum Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, being aware, as 
we all are, of how members feel about beginning a speech only to 
have it interrupted by the Speaker for one reason or another, I 
wonder if we might agree that I see the clock as being 1.30 p.m. Is 
it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-224, an act to amend the Criminal Code (arrest without warrant), 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to state at the outset that I have 
mixed feelings about presenting my private member's Bill 
C-224 today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3276"> 3276 </A></B>
<P>
	On one hand I am honoured to have the opportunity to present 
what has been asked of me by the police officers of this country. 
In my travels across Canada I have met with many police officers. 
All have stated that in order to make society safer, they need more 
power to enforce the law. Bill C-224 addresses this need.
<P>
	On the other hand I know that after today it will be the end of the 
line for this issue. After today there will be no further discussion, 
no further debate and worst of all, no vote. Certainly there will be 
no new legislation to help our police forces. I feel I have failed 
them in their request. I can only blame our legislative process.
<P>
	I stand here today with yet another example of how our private 
members' business is in desperate need of massive reform. So far 
in this 35th Parliament there have been no private members' bills 
passed with regard to reforming our criminal justice system. There 
have been many proposed bills from all parties which would have 
made our streets safer. Yet the committee with the authority to 
decide what is good for us decided behind closed doors to turn 
down these proposals by deeming them not votable.
<P>
	There are currently 59 private members' bills on the Order 
Paper. Sixteen of them deal with reforming our criminal justice 
system. This has to send a signal to the government that there is a 
need for reform which the government is not meeting.
<P>
	One of the more important bills was proposed by the hon. 
member of York South-Weston, a bill to prevent murderers from 
applying for parole after 15 years. This bill has been before the 
justice committee for the past two years with no movement toward 
making it law. The bill would scrap section 745 of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	Of the 59 private members' bills, nine have received second 
reading but many of these were done away with last week. The 
whole process is a disaster and a sham. It all comes down to the 
standing committee on House management which makes the final 
decision in determining which of the items added to the order of 
precedence are to be put to a vote in the House.
<P>
	The committee's track record of picking bills which it feels 
should be voted on is suspect. The only private members' bills that 
have been given the go ahead and have been passed into law have 
been mostly uncontroversial bills that will not rock the boat. For 
example, there was a bill on whether to make lacrosse or hockey 
the official national sport.
<P>
	I was sent here to represent the people of Wild Rose. I promised 
them I would try to make their country a little more safe. I have 
found this is nearly impossible within our present system, with the 
government having free rein in making decisions behind closed 
doors.
<P>
	My private member's Bill C-224 first and foremost would have 
helped our police officers. It addresses their needs by stating that if 
a person fails or refuses to comply  with the condition of their 
parole or of an unescorted temporary absence or who on reasonable 
grounds the peace officer believes has breached or is about to 
breach such a condition, the peace officer may then have the power 
to arrest that person without a warrant.
<P>
	A frequent example of this is when a person has been told they 
are in violation of their parole conditions because they have visited 
a bar or an establishment that sells liquor. In many cases the police 
know who is out on parole in their jurisdiction. While patrolling 
these establishments they may spot an individual who is violating 
these conditions. The situation now is that the police have no 
authority to arrest the person. They have to contact the suspect's 
parole officer and wait for the processing of a warrant in order to 
arrest the individual. This could take many hours and the person 
could be long gone by that time.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	If my bill had been votable and was accepted, it would have 
restored power back to the police to arrest the individual on the 
spot. In many cases this would prevent the individual from 
committing a further crime or endangering society in any other way 
which has happened on many occasions.
<P>
	Another frequent incident where this bill would be effective is in 
the case of those who are out on parole and are stalking an 
individual. Criminal Code sections 264(2) and 264(3) define what 
criminal harassment is and the punishment for this crime. The 
government's new Bill C-27 addresses the case of death occurring 
during criminal harassment. In both of these measures, there is no 
prevention in place. Prevention is something this government has 
talked about on a number of occasions.
<P>
	There are examples every day of an ex-husband who has 
threatened to get revenge at any cost. In many of these cases these 
people are out on parole. Even though they are violating their 
parole order, the police must once again wait for a warrant in order 
to arrest them. If the police had proper authority as provided in this 
bill and they found the individual in the vicinity of the ex-wife and 
the individual was breaking the condition of parole or unescorted 
temporary absence pass, then they would be able to arrest him right 
there and then. This would ultimately protect many women in their 
fight to survive. This is another issue that has been talked about by 
government members, but only talked about.
<P>
	This bill could have saved lives and should have been made 
votable. In order that the people of Canada and the police officers 
who asked me to do this can understand the issue, I will discuss my 
private members' bill in a different manner. I will present the 
discussion in the context of the criteria the standing committee 
responsible for private members' business sets for the selection of 
votable items. I want the Canadian people to be the judges and to 
see, as I do, that this bill certainly meets the guidelines, remember-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3277"> 3277 </A></B>
<P>
ing that the only reason it was  stopped was that one committee 
behind closed doors decided to stop it without any explanation.
<P>
	The first criterion is that the private members' bill must be of 
national, regional or local significance. It cannot be highly 
contentious or controversial, trivial or insignificant.
<P>
	This bill has national significance since it affects the Criminal 
Code of Canada. In no way is this bill contentious, controversial, 
trivial or insignificant. It essentially enhances the safety of all 
Canadians by increasing the number of people who are able to 
monitor those individuals who are out on parole. The bill will allow 
our police officers and our parole officers to patrol the streets. This 
would ultimately increase our frontline workers. It would reduce 
crime and save lives.
<P>
	The members of the Canadian Police Association have agreed 
with the importance of this bill. After they looked at it carefully, 
they liked it and they offered their support for it. They stated it 
would make their difficult job of peace officers that much easier 
and hoped it would be successful.
<P>
	The second criterion is that the bill must not appear to 
discriminate or be in favour of or against a certain area or region in 
this country. In no way does the bill do that. This bill would apply 
across the country. The police have been calling for this authority 
from coast to coast in order to effect safety for all Canadians.
<P>
	The third criterion is that the bill cannot concern electoral 
boundaries or constituency names. Obviously it has nothing to do 
with boundaries or constituency names.
<P>
	The fourth criterion is that the bill should not require obvious 
amendment because it is substantially redundant with the law, is 
fundamentally ineffective to implement its own intent, is unclear in 
its meaning or otherwise defective in its drafting. I have been 
assured that Bill C-224 is not redundant with the existing laws nor 
is it ineffective in its intent and meaning nor is it defective in its 
drafting.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	The fifth criterion is that the subject of the bill should be 
different from specific matters already declared by the government 
to be on its legislative agenda. This bill does not affect the 
government's legislative agenda. If anything, this bill is providing 
further clarity to section 733.1 which was outlined in the 
government's Bill C-41 that was passed last June. The bill did not 
address the expansion of powers to police officers. My private 
members' bill would rectify that situation.
<P>
	The sixth criterion, depending on the context of political issues 
and events, the number of times the topic has appeared in the 
House may be of significance. In our debates in the House of 
Commons we have seen on a week to week basis many examples of 
how the police could have made a difference if they had had more  
authority. This topic has occurred in the House on a regular basis 
and is of great significance to Canadians.
<P>
	In the seventh criterion, all other factors being equal, lower 
priority should be given to motions which deal with matters which 
the House could address in some other way or through another 
procedure. All in all this bill should have received high priority 
since this matter cannot be dealt with through another procedure. 
The government has just completed significant amendments to the 
Criminal Code in Bill C-41 and is now proposing further 
amendments in Bill C-27. It is unlikely this issue will be back 
before the fall session. Now is the time to deal with this bill.
<P>
	The eighth criterion is that motions couched in partisan terms 
should not be selected. This is not a partisan bill. This bill is about 
the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	The ninth criterion is that bills will be set aside in the selection 
process if they are clearly unconstitutional in that they infringe 
upon provincial legislative authority, the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms or other entrenched constitutional rules, or if 
they impede or are contrary to normal federal-provincial or 
international relations. In no way does this bill infringe upon 
provincial legislation or provincial relations.
<P>
	The terms of parole are set by court order, while cases of 
unescorted temporary absence orders are deemed by the federal 
parole board. This bill will work as a means of carrying out both of 
these agencies' orders by giving police officers the authority to 
oversee their judgments. In addition, this bill will enhance 
federal-provincial relations by giving the provincial and municipal 
police forces the powers to effect enforcement in our society.
<P>
	The tenth criterion is that bills relating to a question that is 
substantially the same as a question already voted on by the House 
in the session should not be selected as a votable item. This issue 
does not relate to any question that has been voted on in this House 
in this session, not at all.
<P>
	The eleventh criterion is that items relating to a question that is 
substantially the same as a question contained in an item already 
selected as a votable item in the session should not be selected. 
Once again, no bills on criminal justice reform were chosen as 
votable items. Therefore this is not infringing on any other item.
<P>
	This bill certainly meets the criteria and then some. It would 
have affected everyone in the judicial process. Ultimately it would 
have given our frontline workers the authority they need in order to 
make our streets safer and to save lives in the process. This will not 
happen because of a select few who behind closed doors deemed 
that it was not important enough to give our police officers the 
power to fight against crime.
<P>
	The problem with our justice system is perfectly expressed in a 
Mackenzie Institute occasional paper entitled: ``Streets of Fear: 
The Failure of the Canadian  Criminal Justice System''. It states: 
``One of the principal functions of organized society is the 
protection of all members from physical harm. Over long centuries, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3278"> 3278 </A></B>
<P>
western societies struggled to establish the supremacy of the rule of 
law. The state was to enforce the law on behalf of the law-abiding, 
thus protecting the individual and giving him the freedom to live 
and work in peace. The surest measure of any government is how 
well its criminal justice system serves the citizen. By that criteria, 
the Canadian government is a failure. This government certainly 
does not serve our citizens by giving such measures as this bill any 
credibility in our discussion on crime''.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Having looked at all the criteria and realizing the criteria are 
written out, they say quite plainly to each and every member that 
when we prepare our member's bills they are to meet these criteria 
in order to be votable. I have been assured by all the experts that 
my bill has certainly met all the criteria and yet it is deemed not 
votable.
<P>
	I ask that we do not deny the Canadian people to have a voice in 
this decision or in many others, as far as that goes. We do not deny 
them by giving them a vote. We give them a vote through their 
members of Parliament. That is democracy. That is something the 
Canadian people have been asking for a long time, to have a 
stronger voice. We are their voice. Let us express it through a vote.
<P>
	The bill meets all the requirements as written by the government. 
It has passed the test. I ask for unanimous consent to make this a 
votable item.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the House give its 
unanimous consent to make Bill C-224 votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I had 20 
minutes and I put forward that motion before my 20 minute period 
was up. I would like to have the opportunity to finish my speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Regrettably, when a member 
puts a question to the House and in so doing retakes his seat, for all 
intents and purposes that intervention is completed. We make the 
request to the House based on the original request of the member.
<P>
	If there is a bit of time left at the end, from time to time under 
right of reply members have had the opportunity to make a closing 
statement about their bill, particularly when it is not a votable item. 
Should that be the case later in the hour and if the hon. member 
wishes to avail himself of that privilege, the Chair will deal with it 
at the appropriate time.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the House on private member's 
Bill C-224, an act to amend the  Criminal Code with respect to the 
arrest without warrant provisions.
<P>
	The hon. member has spoken, as is his wont to do, with quite a 
bit of passion about the bill. In reality his bill does two things, one 
of which was done a long time ago in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	He is trying to set out in section 495 of the code the authority of a 
peace officer to arrest without warrant someone who on reasonable 
grounds is believed to have breached or who is about to breach a 
condition of probation. Second, he wants to amend the same 
provision to give new authority to the peace officer to arrest 
without warrant an offender who on reasonable grounds is believed 
to have breached or who is about to breach a condition of parole or 
unescorted temporary absence.
<P>
	What is interesting about this is that while public protection 
from conditionally released offenders is a matter of very serious 
concern to the government, an area where we have already made 
several legislative and practical improvements, there are some 
misconceptions which have to be cleared up.
<P>
	With respect to violation of probation conditions, I stress that 
section 740 of the Criminal Code, which the hon. member may not 
have directed his attention to, already authorizes a peace officer to 
arrest without warrant persons found to be breaching a condition of 
their probation. More specifically, his bill tries to put the same 
condition into another section, which is redundant. This provision 
defines breach of probation as a criminal offence, which is very 
important.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	Pursuant to Section 495 of the code, is the focus of this private 
member's bill, police have the authority to arrest without warrant 
any person who is caught in the act of committing a criminal 
offence. A breach of probation is a criminal offence.
<P>
	Nevertheless, this is an important public protection issue which 
the government has taken many steps to effectively address. I 
really would like to set the record straight on this.
<P>
	With respect to breach of a probation order the government has 
tightened the provisions in the code to promote stricter compliance 
with these orders. Bill C-41, which was opposed because of the two 
little words sexual orientation by the member who proposes this 
bill, comes into force in the next few months, allowing a breach of 
probation to be prosecuted, not just summarily but also by 
indictment, which means much higher penalties.
<P>
	This change means police will have the authority to arrest 
without warrant any person who on reasonable grounds is believed 
to have breached or is about to breach a condition of probation.
<P>
	This fully addresses the first amendment proposed by the hon. 
member, and quite frankly makes clause 1(1) of  his bill redundant. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3279"> 3279 </A></B>
<P>
Bill C-41 also increases the penalty for breach of probation on 
summary conviction to 18 months. The hon. member opposed that 
bill. In the case of an indictable conviction it increases it to two 
years. It actually goes much farther than Bill C-224 does.
<P>
	With respect to breaches of parole and unescorted temporary 
absence conditions, the current legislation provides authority for 
the National Parole Board and Correctional Service Canada to issue 
a suspension warrant for the offender's arrest by police. This 
authority for a suspension warrant is provided under section 116 of 
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act for unescorted 
temporary absences from an institution and under section 135 of 
the same act for breaches of parole.
<P>
	Both the correctional service and the parole board have the 
authority to issue suspension warrants for an offender on an 
unescorted temporary absence where grounds for granting the 
absence have changed or no longer exist or when new information 
becomes available that would alter the original decision.
<P>
	With respect to an offender on parole, Correctional Service 
Canada and the parole board can issue suspension warrants at any 
time when they believe it to be necessary and reasonable in order to 
protect society.
<P>
	I agree that some may reasonably question why the police do not 
have the same direct authority to arrest parolees as they do for 
probationers. There is an answer to that. It lies in the fact that a 
condition of probation is set out in a court disposition. It is the 
breach of that order or the expected breach of that order which 
gives the officer the right to arrest without warrant.
<P>
	A breach of probation becomes a criminal offence because it 
constitutes a violation of a court order or defiance of a court order. 
When a breach of probation occurs, police have the authority to 
arrest without warrant, as they would any other person committing 
a criminal offence.
<P>
	Parole and temporary absences, on the other hand, are not court 
orders. They are conditional release terms granted by the parole 
board or Correctional Service Canada which are designed to 
facilitate the reintegration of offenders into the community of 
law-abiding citizens. These conditions place limits on the freedoms 
of parolees while they are out of the correctional facility. They 
could apply to a variety of matters, conditions such as the 
requirement to return to a halfway house at a specific time, 
curfews, restrictions placed on the offender that assist the parole 
supervisor in managing him or her. Their mobility may be limited 
to a certain part of the country, their freedom of association and 
many other factors.
<P>
	Breaches of these conditions do not constitute criminal activity. 
Board members and Correctional Service Canada staff are people 
in a position to determine when they have to suspend.
<P>
	The real question the hon. member's bill raises is whether 
current police powers and correctional practices are sufficient to 
enable police to respond promptly to situations involving 
conditionally released offenders.
<P>
	There have been several initiatives to improve the flow of 
information from the correctional service and the parole board to 
police to allow the police to better manage conditionally released 
federal prisoners and to keep the parole board and the correctional 
service more efficiently informed in the event something like this 
does happen. These steps include a new correctional policy 
ensuring that the police are notified in advance about every 
offender who is being released. They include a requirement 
ensuring that police receive all relevant correctional information 
about any high risk offender being released at sentence expiry, and 
this is enshrined in law under the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Also included are a computer link that gives police direct access 
to information on conditionally released offenders, including the 
conditions of their release, and a national network of correctional 
officers that police can contact 24 hours a day whenever they 
suspect a federal offender has breached a release condition.
<P>
	Upon being advised by police of a breach or a potential breach of 
parole, the correctional officer can issue the suspension warrant on 
the spot to ensure the police can then respond as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	The act further authorizes the facsimile transmission of 
warrants, giving police officers the authority to arrest offenders 
without warrant on the knowledge that one has been issued. This is 
simply a case of the law catching up with technology but doing so 
for the protection of society.
<P>
	There have been amendments to the code to enable police and 
courts to better intervene in situations in which a person's conduct 
may be potentially threatening. Section 161.1 allows a court to 
make an order prohibiting an offender who has been convicted of a 
sex offence involving a child from being in the vicinity of a school 
or playground. Section 264 addresses the new offence of criminal 
harassment to cover stalking.
<P>
	Bill C-42 the government passed to make it easier for those who 
are victims of domestic abuse to seek conditions of a recognisance 
to keep the offender away.
<P>
	Through these changes, policy improvements and information 
mechanisms police officers have sufficient authority and the means 
available to promptly intervene whenever they observe federal 
offenders in breach of the conditions of their release.
<P>
	Although the hon. member suggests police are limited in the 
actions they can take or face unreasonable delays in taking that 
action, I emphasize he has brought no concrete evidence forward. 
In the absence of such  evidence, giving police broader authority to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3280"> 3280 </A></B>
<P>
arrest without warrant for non-criminal conduct runs the risk of 
being defeated by a charter challenge.
<P>
	The hon. member's bill draws attention to the important issue of 
better protection from conditionally released offenders. The 
government supports this objective fully and has moved on many 
fronts to ensure that police officers are well informed about the 
release of offenders and can intervene in a timely and effective 
manner whenever necessary.
<P>
	In considering new legislative initiatives, however, we have to 
be mindful that they address real gaps and rectify real problems 
that cannot be dealt with by other mechanisms. There is simply no 
basis and no foundation for the amendments proposed in this 
private member's bill.
<P>
	I will comment on the what the justice committee has done with 
respect to private member's bills and correct a couple of things the 
hon. member has said.
<P>
	At the present time there are four proposed amendments to the 
Criminal Code in that committee, not all from the hon. member's 
party; one from an independent member, two from the Bloc and 
one from the Reform Party. The committee, because of the new 
freedom in terms of government members voting freely on private 
members' bills, has put in place with the consent and the 
approbation of the Reform Party and the Bloc a procedure so that 
these bills cannot get buried in committee, that they will be treated 
with the respect they deserve. This bill, however, simply misses the 
mark.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
order to briefly discuss Bill C-224, presented by my colleague from 
Wild Rose, I propose a rather cursory, and somewhat simple, 
analysis. First, we shall analyze the difference between what 
should happen by the book and what happens in real life. Then, we 
shall attempt to address the problem in order to take some position 
on it, even though the bill is not votable at this time. There is, 
however, nothing to stop us from having an opinion.
<P>
	First of all, the question of arrest without warrant. Although it is 
a rather cursory way of looking at a bill, that is more or less what it 
comes down to. This situation is of enormous concern to us.
<P>
	Let us look at how things are done. A policeman arrives at the 
scene of the crime, and runs into an individual whom he suspects to 
be in breach of parole for instance. If there is some doubt in his 
mind, he can take the suspect to headquarters, question him and try 
to check out the situation.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	If everything checks out OK, he releases him, but if something is 
wrong, he can charge him. However, real life seldom goes by the 
book. Let us imagine the most common and most critical situation, 
perhaps the one that led to this bill.
<P>
	Same scenario. A police officer arrives on the scene of a crime, 
on a Friday night, and stops an individual. We know that parole 
officers who could inform the police work 9 to 5 weekdays and are 
off during the weekend. Very often, problems arise the night and 
police officers must wait till the next day. The thing is, on 
weekends, it means they must wait till Monday morning. The 
police officer stops an individual and, if he doubts his innocence, 
takes him to the police station.
<P>
	Police officers already have the power to detain an individual for 
24 hours without a warrant. They already can do that. Of course, if 
a crime-other than breaching the conditions of parole-is 
committed, the main crime takes precedence. A charge will be laid.
<P>
	Let us imagine that the only crime is a breach of the conditions 
of parole, as is often the case. I know because I worked for some 
time in this field. Let us say that this individual is forbidden to be in 
such and such a place and is seen there by the police. This is the 
main issue. The only crime committed by this individual is to be in 
this place.
<P>
	Since it is Friday or Saturday night, the probation officer cannot 
be reached. Even with the current 24-hour period, the police must 
release the individual since it is still not enough time to reach the 
probation officer who only returns to his office on Monday 
morning.
<P>
	I understand that, in order to solve that problem, correctional 
services have developed an emergency response system allowing a 
police officer to get a probation officer to fax him warrant in short 
order, thus enabling him to arrest a parolee who has violated a 
probation order or a condition of parole.
<P>
	A very specific and touchy situation was described. We realize 
that the issue has been somewhat simplified as regards what could 
go wrong. The computer-since everything is done by computer, 
fortunately-could break down, the communication system 
allowing us to check whether the individual is committing an 
offence could break down. In that case, the police officer would 
need a bill like this one. We agree on that point.
<P>
	Let us say there is a vote and the bill is passed, then arrests 
without warrant will be allowed. The Bloc Quebecois does not 
agree with arrests without warrant for very obvious reasons; 
tomorrow we might ask for searches without warrant. I think that 
people who must enforce the law want to protect the public and 
ensure its security. I think they have enough tools right now not to 
need this one.
<P>
	In my opinion, such a measure would open wide the door to 
taking certain liberties and maybe even lead to abuses much worse 
than those which might occur because this small detail is missing.
<P>

<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	The House will recall the famous firearms bill that was 
introduced. I do not remember the specific clause, but the initial 
bill specified, in terms that were almost clear, that police officers 
could, if they thought there were firearms in someone's home, 
seize them without a warrant. In the end, even the minister and 
therefore the government amended this provision because they felt 
it went too far. It went too far because quality of life is included in 
individual rights. There are ways to do things and, for a start, police 
officers must learn to do them right, with the tools they are given, 
of course.
<P>
	In my opinion, it is when these things happen on a weekend, 
returning to the example I gave at the start, that there is likely to be 
a major problem. Then it becomes a conflict between the parole 
officers' collective agreements and the government. Here, instead 
of creating legislation to deal with this problem, they are putting 
the cart before the horse, or however you might like to put it. 
Legislation ought not to be altered to compensate for shortcomings 
in collective agreements. Instead, the government should say: 
``One parole officer will be on weekend duty in such and such a 
region, because it has a higher incidence of weekend incidents''. I 
have no problem with its passing legislation to that effect, but 
legislation ought not to be altered because of flawed collective 
agreements. Instead, the collective agreements must be brought in 
line with the legislation. That is more or less the logic of this.
<P>
	Someone also mentioned overpopulation. As you are indicating 
that I have two minutes left, Mr. Speaker, I will not move on to the 
next topic, although I would dearly have loved to.
<P>
	I will conclude simply on this point by repeating that we could 
not have given our approval, even if this bill had been voted on, 
because it would permit arrest without warrant thereby opening the 
door to searches without warrant, which would be totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Finally, in our opinion, it is much more a problem of lack of 
availability of parole officers, and therefore a collective agreement 
problem, and a law does not adapt to a collective agreement, but 
rather the reverse.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of my colleague's private member's bill. It is a good bill. 
Therefore it is regrettable that it has not been deemed votable. 
When my hon. colleague from Wild Rose asked for the support and 
consent of the House, two people said no, the member for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River and the member for Windsor-St. Clair.
<P>
	We are very secure as we sit in this House. We have security all 
around us. We cannot go anywhere in this building without seeing 
the security. If we were threatened in any way in this House you 
had better  believe we would hasten to enhance the power of those 
people who provide for our security. Yet we are not prepared to do 
that for the people we represent which is absolutely regrettable and 
unacceptable.
<P>
	When I hear the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair, who sits as 
the chair of the justice committee, making the kinds of comments 
she made against the principle of this bill, of giving peace officers 
the right to arrest someone who they find in violation of their 
parole conditions, I cannot believe it nor can I understand it.
<P>
	During debate on Bill C-68 the justice minister said this: ``If you 
want to learn something or if you need information about health 
care, ask doctors. If you need to know something about law, ask 
lawyers. If you need to know something about policing, ask police 
officers''. Police officers were the motivation for this bill. 
However, the justice minister and his colleagues obviously only 
want the input of police officers when it suits them, not when they 
are making a recommendation which will help them to protect 
society.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	Back home in my constituency a person said to me: ``What we 
want you folks to do is to stop the fighting and just get on with the 
business. We need changes in our legislation in a number of areas, 
including the area of justice''.
<P>
	What is wrong with giving a peace officer the power to arrest 
someone at four o'clock in the morning who is violating the 
conditions of his or her parole? Why are these members prepared to 
deny the police the power to protect the abused wife, to protect 
children and to protect society from people who have demonstrated 
by their past behaviour that they can be a threat to society under 
certain conditions?
<P>
	When people are out on parole, the conditions of that parole are 
such that they must avoid sitting in a bar or being in the vicinity of 
a playground or children. Why is it that these members are not 
prepared to grant the police the power to take those people into 
custody when they have violated the very conditions which have 
allowed them freedom from prison? I cannot understand it.
<P>
	The mugwumps I have heard today have spoken against the bill 
which is surprising and disgusting to me. They pretend that they 
have the best interests of society at heart and they want to create 
conditions which will protect society from those who, for one 
reason or another, are a threat.
<P>
	I have seen the justice minister stand time after time in the 
House to say that he has done this, he has done that and he has done 
the next thing to make society safer, and yet a very simple 
amendment to the Criminal Code that would grant peace officers 
the power in the middle of the night to protect an ex-spouse, 
children and society is being denied. For what reason? It is 
regrettable.
<P>

<B><A NAME="3282"> 3282 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals campaigned on a promise to give backbenchers 
more weight in the government through added private members' 
bills. That was the promise. I suppose it was a bit like the GST 
promise, which they simply broke.
<P>
	By admission of the Liberal member for Mississauga East this 
promise has been broken. The government backbencher accused 
the Liberal dominated, four-member committee that determines 
which private members' bills will be votable of short circuiting 
controversial bills. The Mississauga East MP said: ``We 
supposedly have open government, but we have secret committees 
and I'd guarantee that no member of that committee would oppose 
the bill openly. They were just encouraged in secret. I'm not 
suggesting it's a kangaroo court, it's more like a cockroach court. 
You can't see them at work and they run''.
<P>
	My hon. colleague, who is the chairman of the justice 
committee, spoke about the four private members' bills that have 
made it through the House and now sit in committee. Where are 
they? The bill that would eliminate section 745 of the Criminal 
Code has been sitting there for a year and a half.
<P>
	I told the member in committee that I respect every member of 
that committee, but if that private member's bill is still lying 
dormant by the time Clifford Olson has the opportunity to spend 
between $200,000 and $1 million of taxpayers' money appealing to 
have his parole ineligibility reduced, I will be ashamed of the 
committee and its work. Those bills are there, but they are being let 
lie. Yet when Bill C-33 came along, it was rammed through the 
committee in eight days. I am wrong. It was not rammed through 
the committee in eight days; it was rammed through first, second 
and third reading, all stages in eight days.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	If we wanted to move on those four private members' bills that 
are languishing before the justice committee we would move on 
them. They are good bills and they should come back to the House 
and be considered by the members of this House. Why are we not 
moving on them?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you ought to sit with us in the steering committee 
that makes those decisions and then come back when the steering 
committee's recommendations come before the committee. We get 
our marching orders. I have said to the committee that when the 
people of Canada elect a majority government, it has a mandate. I 
do not debate the mandate. I do not challenge the mandate but I 
sure challenge the manner in which that mandate is used.
<P>
	I am not going to challenge our committee to push these private 
members' bills through. There is no point in doing that. It is 
incumbent upon us to move those bills through but they are not 
being moved. They should be back in front of the elected 
representatives of the people.
<P>
	Concerning the bill that deals with section 745, over 70 members 
of the Liberal Party stood and voted in this House on second 
reading in support of the bill. Why has it been almost a year and 
one-half and the bill still has not come back to the House?
<P>
	I can go along with the mandate of the government, but I cannot 
support the marching orders it seems we have in some of the 
committees. We set up a procedure. I acknowledge what the 
member for Windsor-St. Clair said. We looked at that and set up a 
procedure so that the bills would not languish. If that is the case, 
why are they still languishing? Why are they still there? That is the 
question everyone in Canada should know is being asked in this 
House and there is no answer.
<P>
	Why has the bill sat for a year and one-half? It is a bill that 
caused people to come to public meetings across the country by the 
hundreds and thousands because they are concerned. They do not 
want to see first degree murderers like Clifford Olson and Paul 
Bernardo given the opportunity to waste taxpayers' money in an 
attempt to reduce their parole eligibility after serving only 15 years 
of a so-called life sentence.
<P>
	What are we doing here today? We are talking about an issue and 
we do not have any hope of moving it forward. Number one, they 
would not deem this bill votable; number two, members of this 
House who are present here today when unanimous consent was 
requested, denied it. They denied it not only to the sponsor of the 
bill but also to the people represented by the bill in Canada: the 
police officers who know what they need to protect us, who know 
what they need in the middle of the night or on a weekend when a 
parole officer is not to be found as the hon. member from the Bloc 
pointed out.
<P>
	What do the police officers do? They see a person on parole who 
has committed dangerous and violent offences sitting in a bar at 
two o'clock in the morning contrary to the parole conditions. What 
does that police officer do to protect society, to protect that 
person's children or that person's ex-wife who may be in danger 
because of his intoxication? What does that police officer do? This 
bill would give the police officer the authority to arrest that person 
because he has violated the very condition he agreed to to get out of 
prison and to live a peaceful life. He has violated it.
<P>
	What has happened in this House today is disgusting to me. We 
will take this message into that constituency called Windsor-St. 
Clair. We will take it into Prince Albert-Churchill River. We will 
tell the people: ``This is what we tried to do but this is what your 
member refused to allow us to do''.

<B>(1420 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must say a few words in response to a number of the suggestions 
that have been put forward by the hon. member for Crowfoot.
<P>
	The member seems to take great exception to the fact that this 
private members' bill was not deemed votable. The bill went 
before a committee, as do all other private members' bills from all 
of the parties and all the independent members. That is where a 
determination is made as to whether or not these bills are votable.
<P>
	The committee determines in a unanimous fashion which bills 
are votable and which are not. This is not an unusual procedure. It 
is not a procedure that the hon. member is not familiar with. This is 
a procedure that has been followed and has been very successful in 
ensuring that the best private members' bills come forward for full 
debate and are voted upon by representatives of the people in the 
House. This government has done a great deal of work to ensure 
that private members' bills which come forward are debated. 
Individual members of Parliament have their say significantly 
increased.
<P>
	This government, for the first time, has made votable private 
members' bills free votes which allow each and every member to 
express their viewpoints either for or against the piece of 
legislation. There have been a number of other types of free votes 
in the House. There will be more to come. On this side of the House 
we are very supportive of that initiative, to give individual 
members of Parliament more access to free votes.
<P>
	Many of the bills presented by hon. members of the Reform 
Party with respect to criminal justice come forward. Many of these 
bills obviously have not been given very much thought. On the face 
of them they are not legal, they are inconsistent with other 
provisions of the Criminal Code, or they are in some other matter 
completely unacceptable, making a mockery of law making in this 
country.
<P>
	It is my view that when we put forward legislation, in particular 
criminal legislation, great care must be taken to ensure the integrity 
of the Criminal Code, the consistency within the Criminal Code. 
We must ensure to the best of our ability that changes 
recommended to the Criminal Code are to be for the betterment of 
the criminal law as a whole and not some superficial piece of 
politics simply designed to arouse emotions and not really get at 
the root of the problem.
<P>
	In addition, it just simply does not matter if these provisions are 
legal or not. A little more respect needs to be paid to the provisions 
of the Criminal Code of Canada rather than making it a political 
plaything for the purpose of political points.
<P>
	The justice system in this country is something we all hold in 
high esteem. Our purpose ought to be when we  see real problems 
to respond to the needs of the people. I must say in relation to the 
constant criticism by the Reform Party that the Minister of Justice 
has put forward more reforms and more significant reforms in the 
field of criminal law in this country than has been done in the 
history of any previous Parliaments. This is a tremendous 
accomplishment.
<P>
	Criminal law and criminal law amendment are not simple 
matters. We must on a continual basis be consulting with all the 
parties affected, whether they be victims groups, the crown 
lawyers, defence lawyers, the provinces, the provincial authorities 
who under the Constitution have the responsibility for the 
administration of justice. Each of these items and changes needs to 
be the result of extensive consultations. Not only has the minister 
brought forward many significant pieces of legislation, but in each 
case the proper consultations were undertaken.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	There was never such energy in the Department of Justice until 
the present minister took over. For instance, he has already taken 
steps to improve the Young Offenders Act by increasing the 
sentences for the most serious crimes and for reversing the onus on 
16 and 17-year-olds, making it more likely that they will be tried in 
adult court.
<P>
	He has left the further review of the Young Offenders Act to the 
justice committee which will be touring the country, hearing from 
stakeholders from coast to coast who are involved in the criminal 
justice system. As well, the committee will be working, in addition 
to the federal, provincial and territorial task force on youth crime, 
to make recommendations for appropriate further adjustments to 
the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	In addition to the above, many amendments have been made or 
are being proposed to the Criminal Code. The Minister of Justice 
has proposed that section 745 be toughened up. Provisions to 
ensure long term offenders are more appropriately dealt within the 
system are being introduced. These measures to deal with long 
term offenders will ensure there are significant community controls 
for up to 10 years after the individual comes to the end of a finite 
sentence to ensure that within the community the controls are in 
place.
<P>
	There is also the possible extension to the window for bringing a 
dangerous offender application, which will make these types of 
provisions more available. A flagging system has been introduced 
nationally to allow crown prosecutors to see which of the likely 
candidates could be brought forward for a dangerous offender 
application.
<P>
	There have been improvements to the gun legislation which will 
ensure there mechanisms in place to make our society safer. They 
will give the police mechanisms, with due process involved, to 
remove firearms from individuals who have committed or 
threatened violence.  All these types of measures have significantly 
improved the criminal justice system.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3284"> 3284 </A></B>
<P>
	Many changes have been introduced within legislation to 
enhance the role of victims within the criminal justice system. 
Many of these measures are designed to make our homes, 
communities and streets safer places. There are also changes to 
enhance the role of victims within the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Reform does a lot of talking and makes a lot of noise about safe 
streets, but every time these recommendations or laws are brought 
forward the Reform Party votes against them. All it can think about 
is caning and spanking people. We need a little more creativity in 
our criminal law than that. We need to ensure strong criminal laws. 
In addition, we need to ensure we are getting at the root causes of 
crime at an early stage so we can truly have a safer society.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, let me put this 
before you. I have three options. I do not believe the first option 
will fly, which is that we call it 2.30 p.m. The second option is that 
I look to the opposite side for someone to speak, keeping in mind 
the member under whose name the bill stands could take the last 
minute. Or I could go to the member for Calgary Northeast, who is 
seeking the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate being able to address this private member's bill, put 
forward by my colleague from Wild Rose. The purpose is to give a 
peace officer the power to arrest without warrant a person who is in 
breach of a probation order binding the person or a condition of the 
person's parole.
<P>
	I was a police officer for 22 years serving in the city of Calgary. I 
listened to the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister spout 
about the great laws we have in the Criminal Code and on our 
books. The unfortunate part about that is it has all been made up by 
lawyers, special interests. The people of this country have not been 
listened to.
<P>
	They desire to have safe streets and safe homes. The Liberal 
government, the justice minister, the solicitor general and the 
Prime Minister do not want that to happen. They are catering to the 
special interests, and that is the bottom line.
<P>
	I could cite all kinds of examples of individuals-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
considered of Private Members' Business has now expired. The 
order is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.31 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday, 
June 3 at 11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
