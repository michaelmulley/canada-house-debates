	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a question of privilege today because I feel my privileges 
as a member of Parliament were severely breached during 
committee proceedings last night.
<P>
	As the House knows, the Standing Committee on Human 
Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons was considering, 
clause by clause, Bill C-64, an act respecting employment 
equity. During debate on clause by clause my first amendment 
was ruled inadmissible by the chairman, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North, on the grounds that it was only available in 
English.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, the rules of Parliament state that a 
member may move an amendment in the language of his or her 
choice. This happens all the time. No notice is required and the 
onus is on the chairman and the clerk of the committee to 
provide the translation to members of the committee if needed.
<P>
	The chairman's ruling was immediately challenged by 
members of my party but overruled by the rest of the committee. 
In supporting a ruling on a matter over which the committee had 
no authority in the first place, the committee breached my right 
as a member of Parliament to move amendments to a very 
significant piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	I approached the chairman and the clerk to try to obtain an 
explanation of this obvious breach of my privilege. In a 
questionable justification of his ruling, the chairman explained 
his actions in an inconsistent manner, ruling my amendments 
out of order because I was ``not a member in good standing of 
the committee'', which the clerk immediately refuted. I was a 
member in good standing.
<P>
	The chairman's subsequent behaviour was reprehensible. 
Legitimate motions were tabled and immediately ruled out of 
order. Debate was cut off. The questioning of witnesses was 
curbed. The list goes on and on. On more than one occasion we 
were put in a position to challenge the ruling of the chairman. I 
believe the record, upon review, will speak for itself.
<P>
	As an example, the committee had agreed to adjourn at 
midnight. I brought to the attention of the chair that midnight 
had come and gone and he continued with the next motion. At 
the end of that motion, which was voted and carried by the 
government side, I again brought it up that it was past midnight, 
according to our previous agreement, and they passed a motion 
without a vote.
<P>
	I recognize that committees are masters of their own destiny, 
but democracy must prevail. I will quote from Speaker Fraser in 
his ruling of 1987, which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is essential to our democratic system that controversial issues should be 
debated at reasonable length so that every reasonable opportunity shall be 
available to hear the arguments pro and con and that reasonable delaying tactics 
should be permissible to enable opponents of a measure to enlist public support 
for their point of view.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Despite this, the members of the committee then proceeded to 
move time allocation, restricting the debate to five minutes per 
clause, and this after two hours of committee proceedings. Five 
total minutes was given for all parties on this clause by clause.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable. There were clauses last night on 
which not only was I not allowed to move an amendment, I was 
not allowed to utter one word of debate. I cannot do my job as a 
member of Parliament if I am not allowed to move amendments 
and debate amendments. It is just absolutely unacceptable. I do 
not know what I can do. I am a bit beside myself.
<P>
	In his conduct last night, the chairman of the committee, the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North, overstepped his authority.
<P>
	I ask, Mr. Speaker, that you rule on this very important matter 
and you suspend clause by clause consideration until such time 
as you do rule, because the committee sits as we speak. I am at 
your mercy. I know not what to do. I cannot speak and I cannot 
move amendments. I give up.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, don't give up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> No, I do not give up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12758"> 12758 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I know at least one other member wants to address 
this representation, there is a point of privilege.
<P>
	The first thing I want to submit to the House is that the 
committee has not yet reported. As per the conventions of this 
House, if a committee has not yet reported the House is in no 
position to rule as to whether or not there has been a prima facie 
case of privilege.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, even if the committee had reported to 
the House, the committee itself would be the master of its own 
business pursuant to the rules this House has established for the 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Do you call that democracy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Standing Order 108 and other standing orders 
of this House are clear in that regard. Therefore, it is my 
submission that the chair should not be ruling on this at this 
time. However, in the unlikely event that the chair does decide to 
rule on this issue at this time, I want to make representation to 
the Speaker in regard to the substance of the alleged point of 
privilege.
<P>
	First, there has been an allegation made today that there was 
some sort of an attempt to prevent the member from speaking on 
and studying this bill thoroughly. This bill has been the subject 
of study for five months. Yesterday alone, the committee sat for 
over six hours and adjourned at 12.05 this morning. This hardly 
sounds like an attempt by anyone to stifle debate.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	The next thing that is important to add at this point is that yes, 
it is true that an hon. member of the committee did propose to 
limit the time of debate per motion. That was not a government 
attempt. It was a member of the opposition. Therefore an 
accusation that the government is trying to stifle the opposition 
would not be totally accurate. In fact, the motion in question, 
which duly carried, was proposed by an opposition member and 
carried by the committee as a whole.
<P>
	On the issue of the motions, it should be noted that there were 
a number of amendments proposed yesterday. As a matter of 
fact, I am told that some 40 amendments had been proposed 
prior to the committee sitting yesterday. And yesterday 
amendments in a stack several times thicker than the original 
bill were proposed by one member.
<P>
	At the first occasion on which the amendments were 
proposed, the member in question was not a duly signed member 
of the committee. Therefore all the amendments he proposed 
were out of order because the member had no standing before 
the committee. Later on the member was afforded an 
opportunity to become a duly signed member of the committee 
as per our rules. In other words, his whip signed him in. I 
understand at that point he was able to move the amendments.
<P>
	If I can speak to the issue of the amendments and the language 
for a moment, it is true of course that the House and its 
committees have permitted and will permit an amendment to be 
produced in only one of the two official languages. We have 
done that before. But it is equally true that a substantial 
document of the House must be, not only because of the 
Standing Orders but because of elementary courtesy, produced 
in both official languages, because our rules make it such and 
simply because of the volume, in order to enable all members to 
participate.
<P>
	May I suggest that when someone moves a stack of 
amendments several times thicker than the bill itself, that rule 
then must apply as well. In other words, several hundreds or 
dozens of amendments should be translated, again in order to 
accommodate all members of the House to participate. It is not a 
matter of one or two amendments where one member can listen 
to the interpretation system and hear the three or four words 
proposed to be amended. We are talking here of hundreds and 
perhaps thousands of words being amended in a particular bill. 
That courtesy was judged by the chair of the committee to be 
essential to the good functioning of the committee and 
ultimately of the House.
<P>
	I am told the chair did rule as well that some, if not a large 
number, of the amendments were not substantive but were 
dilatory in nature and nothing else. I am told, as an example, that 
someone wanted to exempt people working in restaurants from 
being obliged to hire people of different ethnicities and so on. 
Mr. Speaker, you have already recognized that is not even in the 
area of federal jurisdiction. An amendment such as that and 
several others, according to the committee, had little or no 
purpose other than to stall the process of the committee after 
five months of deliberations and six hours of sitting in one day. 
The purpose was not at all to amend the bill.
<P>
	Finally, the committee did adjourn nominally at five minutes 
past midnight. That was invoked as part of the alleged point of 
privilege. The House will know that adjourning five minutes 
later than the usual time when there is general agreement on the 
committee is not exactly something unprecedented in order to 
complete the business before the committee.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	After three hours of debate on one clause of the bill the 
committee judged it was for the betterment of the committee 
that a time limit of five minutes per clause was appropriate. The 
committee decided that by virtually unanimous consent, with 
the exception of one or two members. The committee did make 
that decision with full democratic principles in mind, as it had 
the wisdom and the right to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12759"> 12759 </A></B>
<P>
	The committee has not yet reported to this House. When it 
does report to the House, any member who was not a member of 
the committee-as is the case of the hon. member who proposed 
the amendments initially-is perfectly in order to produce 
amendments again at report stage, if the Speaker and his very 
able staff determine the amendments are in order.
<P>
	Therefore, in my view there is no point of privilege. Even if 
the points raised by the hon. member were valid-and I submit 
they are not-this would not constitute a point of privilege now 
but only at a later date.
<P>
	I believe hon. members worked very hard on that committee. I 
know the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and 
several other members have worked very hard. They stayed up 
very late last night to continue the work after five months of 
deliberation.
<P>
	Perhaps some people are not in agreement with the bill. That 
will not change by invoking points of privilege in this House, 
which are not really points of privilege at all, and even if they 
had been, they were not invoked at the appropriate time. I 
submit the chair of the committee ruled properly with the able 
advice of his clerk and staff, and did make the committee 
function to advance the legislation before the committee, as is 
the role of the chair. He did nothing different from the usual 
work of a committee chair. I am sure I speak on behalf of most 
members of this House when I say he is an outstanding 
committee chair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, may I add two clarifications so that my colleague will 
not keep the chair in the dark about certain facts. In accordance 
with common practice, the hon. member for Fraser Valley East 
was allowed to introduce unilingual amendments during 
proceedings.
<P>
	You should know that as soon as we started our proceedings, 
the committee clerk asked all participants several times to hand 
over their amendments, so that they could be translated and 
made available in both languages. What is at issue here is that, at 
the start of the proceedings, my colleague from Fraser Valley 
East was tempted to table some 30, if not more, amendments. 
Given this pile of amendments, we in the official opposition 
asked that they not be considered, since one basic element of the 
rules adopted by the Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure is 
that all documents and amendments tabled during proceedings 
must be available in both languages.
<P>
	I should point out to you that the Reform Party has 
representation on the Sub-committee on Agenda and Procedure. 
They supported these rules and I am concerned about the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East's lack of courtesy and respect for 
francophones. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that I 
mentioned during proceedings that-again, in accordance with 
common practice-we agreed to let the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East introduce handwritten unilingual amendments.
<P>
	You should know that we have always tried to co-operate and 
that the hon. member is quite brazen, to say the least, in claiming 
that his remarks were cut off, as a look at the time allocated 
shows that the hon. member for Fraser Valley East took up 
between 80 and 90 per cent of the time available for debate. It is 
only after a two hour filibuster based not on content but on form 
that we felt the need for consent, as part of committee 
proceedings, to suggest to the chairman that we should be able to 
call for a vote after spending five minutes on each clause under 
consideration.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	In a fit of generosity, the chairman proposed that 15 minutes 
be allocated, and you may be surprised to hear that my colleague 
from the Reform Party was opposed.
<P>
	So I am counting on the Chair to hand down a ruling that will 
respect the rights of francophones in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Fraser Valley East on the 
same point of privilege. I would ask the hon. member please to 
make his intervention at this point fairly brief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important to clarify several 
facts, as the Speaker was not able to be at our committee last 
night.
<P>
	One thing is that the member who made the intervention from 
the government side was not there either, but he may have been 
fed some wrong information.
<P>
	Originally I sat at the committee table and proposed a motion 
about calling more witnesses. It had nothing to do with clause by 
clause. At that time it was pointed out to me that I had not 
submitted my form to the clerk about being a member of the 
committee. I immediately gave the sheet to the clerk of the 
committee and to the chair so that I could take part in the clause 
by clause voting.
<P>
	After I had submitted my proper documentation to the clerk, 
and I am sure the Speaker will check with the clerk on this, then I 
moved my amendments. They were then ruled out of order and 
tossed away. I asked for them back and could not get them. I 
could not even get them. I had a stack of amendments. All of 
them were taken and they went into a black hole or wherever 
they go.
<P>
	We were not restricted to five minutes per motion which 
would have been bad enough. It was five minutes  per clause. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12760"> 12760 </A></B>
<P>
Even the government side had as many as three or four 
amendments per clause which were read out with an explanation 
and that was considered the total debate. It was not per motion, 
per amendment, or per subamendment. It was per clause. We 
passed entire sections, sometimes running an entire typewritten 
page in the bill, without a word of debate.
<P>
	It cannot go on, Mr. Speaker. It is going on right now. Clauses 
are being passed without debate. You cannot allow that. I do not 
know what to do. I could go back there and stomp on the table, 
but they are just passing clause after clause without debate. It 
cannot continue.
<P>
	My final point is it is interesting that the member mentioned 
that the committee did adjourn at 12.05 a.m. which is an 
admission that it did go past the hour of adjournment, not that it 
was not pointed out to the chairman. I brought attention to it in 
two different points of order that we had agreed to stop at 
midnight. The chair said we must continue with it. Another 
amendment was passed. I said that it was now really past 
midnight, it was five minutes after midnight. I said that I could 
not see that we could proceed. The chair hit the hammer and 
passed the amendment without even a vote. The amendment was 
passed without a vote.
<P>
	How can you pass an amendment without a vote? You cannot 
do it. To say that this is somehow speeding up the procedure, I 
guess it is. Speeding up procedure does not involve trampling on 
the rights of members of Parliament who want to debate the 
clauses and have the right to bring amendments in both official 
languages. If members on the government side think they are 
appealing to some unknown masses out there by running 
roughshod over the rights of members of Parliament who have 
the privilege of bringing forward concerns from their 
constituents, it is hypocrisy, it is dictatorship, it is despotism 
and it is out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Colleagues, I have listened to this 
question of privilege. I think I have enough information. I am 
starting to get the complete drift of what went on.
<P>
	Hon. members from time to time become frustrated in their 
work because things are not going one way or another. That is 
understandable. That is about par for being here in this place. 
Things do not always go the way we want them to go. I want to 
point out some of the similarities that hon. members have 
brought to the attention of the Chair.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley East said in his opening 
statements that indeed the committee is master of its own 
destiny. The reason for that is that with all of the standing 
committees that we have, if we had appeals from the committees 
to the House then the time of the House would be taken up with 
these appeals.
<P>
	Speaker Fraser in an earlier ruling has indeed said that there 
are exceptions to everything. From what I have heard here today, 
it would seem to me that the committee which is master of its 
own destiny by a democratic way of coming about it has decided 
to proceed in a particular way. If one, two or five members 
disagree, again the disagreement is noted.
<P>
	When a member asks the Chair to make a ruling, as an 
overwhelming rule the Chair has always waited for a report to 
come from the committee to the House. In this report the 
grievance that was brought up, if the committee decides to 
report it, would be brought to the House.
<P>
	Here, all of us together would have a chance to look at it and 
make a decision as the House because we, the House, are 
masters of our destiny. Speakers in the past most of the time 
have given great latitude to committees because of the far 
reaching importance of the work they are doing and have waited 
for them to come to the House.
<P>
	It is my decision at this point that I do not have a report from 
the committee in front of me. Therefore, I do not want to make a 
ruling until the committee as a body brings this report up. It 
could be that the hon. member will have a question of privilege 
to bring up at a future time. I do not discount that but it would 
seem to me that at this time I would rule that there is no question 
of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the same question of 
privilege but in a different vein-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I have ruled on the question of privilege. 
That question of privilege is now put to one side. If the hon. 
member has another question of privilege that he wants to bring 
up I will listen to it, but if it is on the same question of privilege I 
beg the House to accept the ruling of its Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I guess I need some clarification from you on one 
instance.
<P>
	I want to bring forward another very important issue. First of 
all my understanding of the standing orders is that a question of 
privilege must be brought forward at the first opportunity. How 
can we justify saying we have to wait until a report is given 
before a member can put forth a question of privilege when he at 
the same time must put forth a question of privilege at the first 
opportunity?
<P>
	My hon. colleague has brought forward what is a very 
legitimate question of privilege at his very first opportunity. I 
appeal to you on that basis.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to bring to your attention is that 
there are changes in the standing orders. This is the first 
Parliament in which these changes have been implemented. It 
may mean that a new precedent is being established and it may 
be very important for you to play a role in establishing a proper 
precedent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12761"> 12761 </A></B>
<P>
	When bills are submitted to committee prior to second 
reading, this House forgoes second reading debate. The House 
is sacrificing an opportunity to debate in the House so that 
would happen in committee. There are 180 minutes permitted 
of debate on a motion to submit the bill to committee prior to 
second reading. There really is no second reading debate. The 
vote on second reading is held without debate.
<P>
	Therefore, it is very important that a precedent be established 
to allow proper debate at second reading. The spirit of the 
agreement to change the standing orders was so that 
amendments could be brought forward at committee and that 
proper time could be taken to deal with the clause by clause 
study.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, on that basis I ask you to consider very carefully 
what precedent is being established here, whether or not the 
rights of members are protected under the standing orders as 
they now stand in light of this new procedure. I think it is very 
critical and may be repeated many times in the future in the 
House and in committee. I just want to make it very clear that we 
are concerned.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would accept the intervention as a point of 
clarification.
<P>
	Your Speaker is guided at all times by the rules decided upon 
by this House. If a member has a grievance, the member could 
appeal to the Speaker for clarification, if you will, but there are 
other avenues that a member can take for doing the same thing. 
Perhaps the member would want to bring it forth with the 
committee on rules and procedures.
<P>
	However, for your Speaker today, in this particular instance 
that was brought forward, I have listened to all interventions and 
in my view there is not a question of privilege. A point of 
privilege might be brought forward in the committee itself. Who 
am I to tell members how they should go about their business?
<P>
	As I am thinking here, I do not know that this was brought 
forth as a point of privilege in committee. I do not know that. All 
I know is what the members here have brought in front of me. On 
the basis of what members have said here today in this House, 
then I would rule that there is no point of privilege.

have the honour to present the 10th report of the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts. When the Auditor General of 
Canada tabled his report in February 1994, the issue of pension 
overpayments, which reached between $120 million and $200 
million, in the auditor general's estimation, was raised 
repeatedly.
<P>
	For the committee, behind the figures lay a more important 
issue: the department's ability to efficiently manage pension 
programs. This prompted the committee to meet twice with 
senior officials of Human Resources Development Canada and 
the Office of the Auditor General of Canada.
<P>
	In this report, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
makes a number of recommendations, which, for the most part, 
have an implementation deadline. The dissenting opinion of the 
hon. members of Chicoutimi and Joliette is appended to the 
report.

under the 1991-92 stabilization program and to the $79 million claim for 
expenses incurred during the events at Oka in the summer of 1990.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to 
discuss the motion. Before getting into the thick of things, I also 
want to thank my leader, the Leader of the Opposition, for 
asking me to table this opposition day motion. It is a sign of trust 
to have been asked to be the first one to speak on this motion, 
which gives an eloquent example of the way the federal system 
works.
<P>
	In the next 20 minutes or so, I want to explain why the official 
opposition tabled this motion today, and also what that motion 
means. Indeed, what are we talking about when we refer to the 
three issues mentioned in the motion, namely the claim for 
expenses incurred during the events at Oka, the refund of 
education costs for young aboriginals, particularly in the Cree 
territory located in Northern Quebec, as well as the payments 
under the stabilization program.
<P>
	I will try to explain not only the costs related to these claims, 
which are estimated at over $330 million, but also the costs 
related to this whole operation. This is why I said at the outset 
that this motion-and this is why we are tabling it today-very 
clear shows the flaws of the Canadian federal system.
<P>
	Sovereignists are often criticized on the grounds that they 
only rise in this House to claim more and more rights for 
Quebec. Indeed, we often hear the argument, from Liberal as 
well as Reform members, to the effect that Bloc members are 
always trying to get more for the Quebec government. The same 
comment is also made regarding the Parti Quebecois 
government by our federalist friends.
<P>
	This motion shows to what extent-I am not sure if I should 
use the word ``normal''-traditional federalism is flawed. I 
would even go so far as to say that, in this specific case, 
federalism works against Quebec's interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12763"> 12763 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> If the 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands gives me a moment, 
I will try to convince him, assuming this is possible, of the 
appropriateness of my comments.
<P>
	In fact, the $330 million claim of the Quebec government was 
presented and renewed by Quebec's intergovernmental affairs 
minister, Louise Beaudoin, this week, here in Ottawa, when she 
met with her federal counterpart to claim something that, in one 
particular case, has been owing for more than ten years.
<P>
	The motion refers to three issues. The first one is the expenses 
incurred during the events at Oka, in the summer of 1990. 
Everyone remembers what happened then, particularly these 
days, when there is a risk that these events could be repeated, 
because of some aboriginal people in Oka.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	We all remember that, in 1990, the Quebec government was 
faced with enormous costs for public safety, or for law 
enforcement, as a result of the crisis in Oka and Kanesatake that 
I mentioned a moment ago. Of course, given that public safety 
was at stake, and that the crisis related to the native issue, which 
is under federal jurisdiction, it was totally appropriate for 
Quebec to ask the Canadian government to pay the additional 
amounts associated with the need to call in the Quebec 
provincial police.
<P>
	A request for payment of $84 million was submitted. An 
amount of $5.3 million has already been reimbursed by the 
federal government, which leaves approximately $79 million 
still to be paid. The crisis goes back to 1990, but the bill remains 
unsettled. How did our politicians react to the request for 
payment, when a federalist government was in power in Quebec, 
during Mr. Bourrassa's, and then Mr. Johnson's Liberal 
governments? What was the federal politicians' answer to the 
Quebec government? In September 1993, the Minister of 
National Defence in the former government refused to 
reimburse the total amount requested, following the Oka crisis, 
because these events, he claimed, resulted from a situation 
related to public order, not public good.
<P>
	Such a position is totally ridiculous, and I submit that the 
present government, through its critics, is still making that 
claim. This is utterly ridiculous. I ask the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, the Minister of National Defence, 
the Minister of Justice and the whole government to talk to the 
people of Kanesatake and Oka, to check if their well-being was 
not affected during those events. The government should be 
ashamed of using such a ridiculous argument, and realize that 
this issue must be settled right away.
<P>
	A second issue deals with the education of young aboriginals 
in northern Quebec. This is a claim made under a 
federal-provincial agreement signed under the James Bay 
Agreement, which provided that the Quebec government and the 
federal government would pay the  costs relating to the 
education of young natives, especially the young Crees of 
northern Quebec.
<P>
	There is an outstanding account in the order of $119 million, 
the payment of which has been demanded for nearly 10 years 
now by successive Quebec governments and, I repeat, 
governments of federalist allegiance.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	I do not think any member opposite can deny that the 
Bourassa government wanted to get an agreement with the 
federal government at any cost.
<P>
	If the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has any doubt 
about that, he should confer with his colleague from Outremont, 
who was a member of the Bourassa government and made the 
same demands when she was the Minister of Education.
<P>
	I repeat that, under a federal-provincial agreement, both 
levels of government share the costs of education of young 
Crees. But the population has increased, more young Crees have 
registered for several courses or have decided to take more 
training, so that costs have been higher than forecasted. The 
federal government's position is that those claims are not 
justified, and that it has not been consulted. Therefore, it refuses 
to pay the claim for $119 million submitted by the Quebec 
government.
<P>
	At a time when the federal government's intention to set 
national standards concerning shared costs program such as 
post-secondary education and health is being discussed in this 
House, we should take a hard look at these issues. When we 
realize that agreements signed by both levels of government are 
not being complied with in day to day operations, are we to 
understand that the federal government will set its so-called 
national standards each and every time the Quebec government 
asks the federal government to assume its financial 
responsibilities? Will Quebec get the same kind of response: 
that the federal government was not consulted on each and every 
one of those expenses, that all the invoices have not been 
provided, and that a thorough examination is in order before any 
amount is reimbursed to the Quebec government?
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs' answer was that he will ask his 
officials to meet with those of the Quebec government in order 
to study the whole issue more thoroughly. The issue has been 
dragging on for ten years already. They are saying, in fact, that 
they will take the time they need, that they are in no hurry. As the 
minister said again this week: ``I do not want to raise the hopes 
of Quebec politicians by implying that this issue can be easily 
settled''. No, no and no, these things must take time. We have to 
ask our officials to meet, to discuss, to chat, in order to try to 
come to an understanding over an agreement signed-this bears 
repeating-more than 15 years ago.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12764"> 12764 </A></B>
<P>
	The last demand involves compensation of $137 million 
demanded not only by Quebec's current government but also by 
its previous governments. I repeat, these are not new demands 
brought forward by the current government of Quebec, Mr. 
Parizeau's government. These demands were first made 10, 5 
and 3 years ago by the previous federalist Liberal government.
<P>
	Stabilization payments are made under a very complex 
program that I will not even try to explain to you because I 
cannot make head or tail of it myself, but the program is 
designed to restore some kind of fairness in terms of the 
expenses the provinces must incur to fulfil their own 
responsibilities. The federal government has committed itself to 
review each province's tax revenues and to compensate 
provinces whose tax revenues are lower than expected for 
various economic reasons or because of the economic situation. 
The government seeks to stabilize provincial revenues through 
this program, which it set up on its own initiative.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Twice, the Quebec government asked for compensation and 
twice its demands were turned down by the federal government. 
The last time that demand was made by the current Minister of 
Finance in Quebec, the federal Minister of Finance replied: ``If 
you want to get compensation to the tune of $137 million under 
the stabilization program, your only option is to take us to 
court''.
<P>
	After hearing all about progressive federalism, or progressive 
status quo as our colleagues opposite like to call it, now we have 
courtroom federalism. In other words, when we want the federal 
government to respect programs it has introduced, we have to go 
to court to obtain justice. It is the new way of doing things of the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Minister of 
Finance, who say: ``Let us go to court''.
<P>
	With all due respect, this reminds me of what a Quebec 
humorist, père Gédéon, not to mention any names, used to say: 
``We will go to court even if we lose, and we will go all the way 
to the Supreme Court''. The Liberal government's attitude is 
somewhat similar. It admits that it owes money to the Quebec 
government, but to drag things out, to make sure the matter takes 
years to settle, it says to the Government of Quebec: ``Go to 
court''.
<P>
	In conclusion, I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that 
this was a good example of the way federalism operates. I also 
said that I wished to underline the costs that this entails. We are 
speaking, of course, about a justified and recognized claim. The 
government's officials acknowledged that the amounts 
mentioned are correct.
<P>
	Can anyone imagine the human and financial costs generated 
by all these discussions on these three simple claims?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> It is fear mongering.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Do we 
know how many civil servants, and the member for Outremont 
could perhaps look into this, at the federal as well as the 
provincial level, met, talked on the phone, exchanged letters and 
piles of documents? All these costs for the taxpayer must be 
added to the claim of $333 million.
<P>
	If we had this money, if Quebecers could realize the enormous 
costs of federalism, I am convinced that they would at once 
choose to become sovereign. They would do it because the day 
we are able to assume our own responsibilities, the day we are 
able to make our own decisions concerning our collective 
future, we will not have to listen to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs say to us: ``Go to court; let us ask our 
civil servants to get together''. We will be able to make our 
decisions, and this is what the motion tabled by the official 
opposition is all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened very carefully to the 
last speaker. Unfortunately, I did not sense in his speech the real 
human dimension of the problem faced by natives in Quebec 
and, let us be frank, in all areas of Canada.
<P>
	The debate revolves around a ten-year old dispute between 
Quebec and the federal government. And I would point out that 
the federal government has already paid out a considerable 
amount of money.
<P>
	However, I will leave it to my colleagues on this side to make 
speeches that will undoubtedly be brilliant and informative for 
the opposition.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	What I find unfortunate in the statements of the opposition is 
the fact that they did not speak about the social, human and 
economic situation in which Quebec's natives live. I think that it 
would have been more humble, more humane for the opposition 
to focus more on the means of helping these people to improve 
their lot. This has been a point of contention for several years 
now.
<P>
	I remember that in 1981, under the PQ government, 1,000 
police officers invaded-that is the word, invaded-the 
Restigouche reserve. That was unfortunate and I think that that 
is when the relations between natives and Quebecers began to 
deteriorate. I believe that we do not do enough for natives. I 
think that we should encourage dialogue instead of resorting to 
fear mongering, threats and statements like: ``If it had been up to 
Quebec, we would have solved the problem long ago''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12765"> 12765 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask the official opposition to make a proper evaluation of 
the situation and not to confuse the issue with sovereignty and 
with the upcoming referendum debate. I think that the first step 
should be to consider the economic and social situation of 
Quebec's natives as well as their problems. I think that that 
should be the real subject of the debate. It is not a money issue, 
but a human issue that we should address in a co-operative 
fashion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks, but I feel 
compelled to remind him of certain facts. I do not want to give 
him a history lesson, but I think that there is no relationship 
whatsoever between the events in Restigouche and the matter we 
are discussing today. I am sure that, if my colleague takes the 
time to consult his history book, he will recognize that these two 
matters are not related.
<P>
	However, I agree with him when he talks about the need to 
deal with the real problems facing native populations. I wish the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine would 
convince his colleagues to adopt a similar position because, in 
recent years, it is exactly what every Quebec government, 
whether federalist or sovereignist, has done in relation to the 
James Bay agreement, especially in relation to the matter we are 
debating, that is the $119 million claim for the education of 
young natives in northern Quebec.
<P>
	The government of Quebec has striven to offer quality 
services to native people and to meet their needs, which means 
that when there is an increase in the clientele, there must be an 
increase in spending on health care or education, as is the case 
here. That is what the government of Quebec has done over the 
past ten years, and it is the federal government which has been 
tight fisted with its money. If the government of Quebec had 
waited for the federal government to honour its commitments, 
natives in the north would never have had the level of services 
they are getting today, thanks to the Quebec government.
<P>
	So the point raised by my colleague for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is most interesting. I ask 
him to convince the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
the Minister of Finance to contact the Quebec Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs immediately to settle the issue. We 
agree on this. Quality services have been delivered and now the 
time has come to pay the bill. Unfortunately, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs will do the same thing he did in the 
case of the Charlottetown referendum in 1992: he will first lose 
face, then he will change his mind and agree that he must 
reimburse the government of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, if we are going to talk about 
amounts, it should not be forgotten that the  federal government 
paid out close to $450 million for Northern Quebec natives.
<P>
	However, I would have another question. The point has been 
raised of Quebec's historic dispute with the federal government 
over the last ten years. We were not in power during this period, 
but I know that a certain Leader of the Opposition, here today, 
was a member of that government.
<P>
	Yesterday, in fact, we learned, because we asked the question, 
that he was never aware, at the time, of the claims that were 
made by the province of Quebec. It is regrettable that the least 
fortunate members of society are being used to generate 
propaganda, to engage in grandstanding, as well as to promote 
sovereignty and independence at whatever cost.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Leader of the Opposition where he has 
been for the last ten years and why he did not, when he was a 
member of the government in power, do something about the 
Quebec government's claim?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I hope that we are not going to spend the entire day 
listening to this sort of nonsense. It just shows how few 
arguments the government can find to reject the legitimate 
demands of the government of Quebec. Responding with 
references to the former government, and specifically to the 
Leader of the Official Opposition, who was a member of that 
government over six years ago-having left it before the Oka 
crisis-shows, in my opinion, just how few arguments they can 
muster.
<P>
	I hope that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs will 
come up with something more serious. As someone familiar 
with the workings of federalism, surely he will be able to 
convince us, with copious arguments, that he is right, without 
spouting the sort of nonsense we have just heard.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Madam Speaker, I will vote against the motion presented by the 
hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, for a very 
simple reason.
<P>
	The federal government is not late in making the payments 
referred to by the hon. member, and this includes Quebec's 
demands with regard to the education of young Aboriginals in 
the Quebec North, compensation under the 1991-92 
Stabilization Program and the claim for expenses incurred 
during the events at Oka.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member will withdraw his motion after 
hearing the government's point of view. In fact, if Quebec's 
demands were so legitimate, I think, with all due respect for the 
hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, that his 
leader, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, would have 
presented the motion himself.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12766"> 12766 </A></B>
<P>
	Monday I had a chance to discuss the matter with Mrs. Louise 
Beaudoin. It was a cordial meeting during which we reviewed 
the cases mentioned in the opposition motion and discussed the 
mechanisms available to us to deal with these matters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, Mrs. Beaudoin and I met earlier this week to 
discuss these matters. Our meeting was productive and focused 
on the substance of the issues and on finding ways to solve these 
issues in the best interest of Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We both agreed to continue discussions on these matters 
through existing mechanisms. We both agreed to make every 
effort to find the right solutions without wasting any time.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	In the process, I want to ensure that the outcome is fair to both 
parties, including Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	I will be brief, but I will take the time to explain the 
government's position on each of the demands mentioned in the 
motion. First, the claim for expenses incurred during the events 
at Oka. Quebec submitted a bill for $130 million under the 
disaster financial assistance agreements and estimated the 
federal government's contribution at $84 million.
<P>
	The federal government found that only $5.3 million seemed 
to meet the criteria for this program. The rest of Quebec's claim 
was not, in our view, covered by the program. We were not 
convinced it was up to the federal government to pay the cost of 
overtime-this is an understatement-accommodation and 
transportation for officers of the Quebec Police Force, for which 
the Quebec government was claiming $58 million.
<P>
	I may recall that at the time the federal government had, at the 
specific request of the Quebec government, provided the 
services of the Canadian Armed Forces. In fact, federal 
expenses incurred by the use of the Canadian Forces at Oka 
totalled $122 million.
<P>
	Expenses covered under another program are not eligible, 
which explains why the Auditor General has been asked to take a 
very close look at Quebec's expenses. In other words, there are 
regulations that determine which expenses are eligible and 
which are not. In this case, considering additional claims made 
by the Province of Quebec which, we feel, are unjustified, we 
asked the Auditor General, a third party who enjoys credibility 
among all Canadians, including Quebecers, to check Quebec's 
additional claims.
<P>
	We are hesitant to pay the bills submitted by the Government 
of Quebec, not out of meanness, but because our goal is to be 
rigorous and fair in administering the public purse. Mrs. 
Beaudoin mentioned that the funds claimed are for Quebecers; 
however, our responsibility is to manage funds for all of 
Canada's  taxpayers, including Quebecers, and that entails 
ensuring that the bills submitted to us are justified.
<P>
	That is why we called on the auditor general, from whom we 
hope to obtain an impartial opinion. He has indicated that the 
results of his audit will most likely not be available until June or 
July 1995. In the meanwhile, he asked the federal government 
and the Government of Quebec to send him a detailed 
breakdown of all of the costs incurred and the related receipts, 
normal requirements for any in-depth audit. For our part, we 
have provided all of the information he requested.
<P>
	The federal government, therefore, is waiting to see the 
conclusions of his audit. That is what I said to my counterpart in 
Quebec, Mrs. Beaudoin, and this is clearly the fairest process to 
use, and we must let it run its course. All taxpayers expect their 
governments to rigorously manage public funds, and that is what 
we are doing.
<P>
	Now, what about the $135 million claimed under the fiscal 
stabilization program? Once again, the federal government's 
position is very clear. We will apply the program rules to all 
claims, be they from Quebec or from any other province. 
Nothing more, nothing less.
<P>
	Regarding the case at hand, the fiscal stabilization program 
was implemented to assist provinces whose revenues drop 
radically because of an economic downturn.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The claim of $135 million for 1991-92 is not valid in our 
opinion, because the Government of Quebec's loss of revenue 
that year was not related to the economic situation. The Minister 
of Finance has therefore determined that the stabilization 
program does not apply.
<P>
	However, the federal government has already paid an 
instalment of $125 million, that is, more than half the amount 
Quebec has claimed for 1992-93, because, in this case, we felt 
the legislation criteria were met.
<P>
	As I indicated to Mrs. Beaudoin last week, the legislation 
does not provide for arbitration. The only alternative for the 
Government of Quebec, if it does not share our viewpoint on the 
application of the legislation, is, clearly, to appeal our decision 
under the procedure provided in section 19 of the Federal Court 
Act to resolve disputes between governments. Differences in 
interpretation of legislation are matters to be decided by courts 
of law rather than by politicians. I have even said that, if 
necessary, our government would be prepared to help Quebec 
out in such an appeal by providing all the necessary information.
<P>
	Before going on to the third claim, I would like to draw the 
attention of the member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead to 
the fiscal stabilization program I have just been talking about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12767"> 12767 </A></B>
<P>
	I am a Liberal, and Liberal is spelled with a capital ``L'', 
which means I believe in the principle of solidarity and in 
sharing the wealth. I believe as well that government has a role 
to play in this. A program like the fiscal stabilization program 
enables us to express Canada's social solidarity in concrete 
terms.
<P>
	The public understands that these programs have criteria, 
naturally, in order to prevent abuse and to ensure that public 
funds are managed wisely and in their interest. And the criterion 
of loss of revenue due to economic slowdown seems to me a very 
valid one.
<P>
	Now we come to the last matter, the claim for the education of 
young aboriginals in northern Quebec. This week, I told the 
Quebec minister that the federal government, far from dragging 
things out, was anxious to see this issue quickly settled. I say it 
again today and I would like to explain why it took so long to 
deal with this issue.
<P>
	Both governments have agreed, in the James Bay and 
Northern Quebec Agreement, to share the education costs of 
young Crees of the Cree School Board on a 75-25 basis, that is 
75 per cent for Ottawa and 25 per cent for Quebec. One of the 
reasons for that is that the Cree School Board serves a student 
population which varies from year to year and which includes a 
number of non-aboriginal students whose education costs are 
met by the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The agreement states that budgets must be approved by both 
parties since amounts to be compensated depend on the 
education budgets, including capital budgets, teacher salaries 
and the proportion of aboriginal students and non-aboriginal 
students in the student population.
<P>
	The Quebec government has always been reluctant to let the 
federal government play a role in budget approval, despite our 
repeated demands. Even though it never approved those 
budgets, the federal government already paid $464 million to 
Quebec. Therefore, we cannot be accused of being deadbeats. 
All they can say is that, since Quebec did not provide us with the 
information necessary to determine which amounts should 
ultimately be paid, we are protecting Canadians interests by not 
giving it a blank check.
<P>
	Since the federal government did not take part in the decisions 
regarding the education budget, it is important that we 
understand the basis on which those decisions have been made 
before we decide whether a supplementary payment is 
appropriate or not. We refuse to sign a blank check for amounts 
which may not be owed.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	This being said, and I conclude on that, the federal 
government always assumed its responsibilities towards natives 
and fulfilled its obligations under the James Bay Agreement.
<P>
	To conclude, the federal government is a reliable partner 
seeking co-operation, but managing carefully taxpayers' 
money. I am calling upon the sense of responsibility of the hon. 
member for Megantic-Compton-Stantstead and his 
colleagues from the official opposition, and ask them to 
understand that fact. I am convinced that it is what Canadians, 
including Quebecers, expect from us.
<P>
	We will continue to deal with real problems, the problems for 
which we were elected by the people of Canada, the problems to 
which we were asked to find solutions. The Government of 
Canada, our government, is an honest, open and reliable 
government. A government which deals with provincial 
governments in an equitable manner and looks at issues in good 
faith.
<P>
	We are always willing to work with provincial and territorial 
governments in the interests of Canadians. This is why I will 
vote against this motion and I urge fair-minded opposition 
members to do the same, in the interests of Quebecers.
<P>
	This is what we are doing and this is what will be done in the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to get back to some of the points raised by the 
minister who, a few months ago, was a keen advocate and 
defender of flexible federalism. Could it be that he is 
abandoning his lofty notions of flexible federalism to champion 
the cause of courtroom federalism? This is the conclusion one is 
inclined to draw from his speech.
<P>
	The minister says that it has not been proven, beyond any 
doubt, or close to that, that the sums being claimed were indeed 
spent on young aboriginals according to the James Bay 
Convention. And yet, his government did not show the same 
scruples last year when the press reported that every year native 
people in Canada receive $1.2 billion without a census to 
establish their exact number.
<P>
	And yet his government-I understand, I lay no blame-paid 
the money anyway although it meant that later on, it might have 
to make up the shortfall or withhold certain sums; it still took 
action. In the present case, I believe the minister is dead set 
against Quebec. He will not budge, no matter how legitimate the 
claims Quebec has against the federal government.
<P>
	I just came back from a committee meeting. We learned that 
in Canada there are 298 public sea ports, and the present federal 
government is unable to say whether they are indeed public or 
private. For years now, it has been guesstimating. Sometimes, it 
assumes they are public and sometimes not.
<P>
	Does the member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
know that, in his riding, there is a port in Chandler which is still 
being funded even though it is not known whether it is private or 
public? Ottawa keeps on acting as if it were public and belonged 
to the federal government. Funnily enough, scruples only 
happen when Mrs. Beaudoin makes claims  on behalf of Quebec. 
I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12768"> 12768 </A></B>
<P>
find this intolerable on the part of a man who prides himself on 
being responsible.
<P>
	The minister, if he was that honourable, could have agreed 
with Mrs. Beaudoin on a certain amount to pay. Even if we 
cannot come to terms on the final numbers, we know that not 
everything is free, including in James Bay. He could have acted 
in good faith and paid out an approximate amount, which he 
most likely owes, even though it would have meant he might 
have to make up the difference or withhold part of the money to 
be paid some time in the future under the same convention or 
program.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I am not surprised that the minister intends to 
vote against our proposal, but I will ask him to refrain from 
saying that he is doing it in all good faith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy to see that the main 
objective of the opposition member is for the federal 
government to manage taxpayers' money with justice and 
honesty. I agree with him entirely. That is why, in the case of the 
Oka claim, even though we had already paid $122 million to 
Quebec under the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements, 
when we decided that we did not have to pay anything else, 
instead of just saying: ``No more, we owe you nothing more'', 
we went to the extreme courtesy of naming a third party to audit 
the books once again in order to give the province of Quebec 
another chance.
<P>
	It is also the reason why we asked the auditor general, who is 
certainly the most credible reference in the matter of fairness 
and good management of public funds, to go once again over all 
the invoices, to try to determine if we still owed something to 
Quebec. If the report says we still owe certain amounts to 
Quebec, if we owe money, we will pay up.
<P>
	As far as fiscal stabilization is concerned, I mentioned earlier 
that we have reviewed all the payment criteria and have come to 
the conclusion that no amounts were owing. Quebec is not the 
only province in this case. The situation is the same for 
Saskatchewan. This province also presented claims which, in 
our judgment, were not in accordance with the established 
payment criteria, so the amounts requested were not paid to 
Saskatchewan either.
<P>
	In the present case, the opposition will, once again, have to 
congratulate us because we chose not to pay amounts that were 
not owed. But, to be perfectly fair, we came to the conclusion 
that we had to allow Quebec, as well as all the other provinces, 
to appeal our decision and our interpretation of the criteria. 
Clearly, the provincial government should not appeal to us, 
since we concluded that there was no money owed as far as 
stabilization was concerned, but to a court of law since it is the 
interpretation of the law which is being challenged.
<P>
	In the third case, our friend from the opposition suggests that 
we at least give an amount corresponding to expenditures as a 
whole and hammer out the adjustments later on. But what have 
we done so far? In fact, in all these years, we have given $464 
million to the province of Quebec for the education of aboriginal 
people. However, as the province of Quebec did not fulfill its 
responsibilities according to the James Bay agreement, we were 
not able to verify if there were other amounts that could be 
owed. Once again, to be as fair as we could, we proposed that a 
group of civil servants study the amounts given, the school 
board budgets, their capital budgets, the make-up of the student 
population, to see if other amounts were owed.
<P>
	I say again, if we come to the conclusion that we owe some 
money, we will pay up. I conclude by saying that not only did we 
pay our fair share, but also we went the extra mile to give the 
province of Quebec every recourse possible and to ensure its 
claims are reviewed.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	In this case, if opposition members are fair-minded about 
this, if they try to see just how well the federal government has 
managed the taxpayers' money and to understand the fairness 
principles involved, I am pretty sure that they will vote against 
their own motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to tell the minister that 
I find his comments rather insulting, especially when he said 
that, in his view, I was not important enough to move such a 
motion in this House. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
suggested that the Leader of the Official Opposition is the one 
who should have done so. I do not know if he thinks the same 
about members speaking for the Liberal government, because 
that would mean that only the Prime Minister has the right to 
speak in this House.
<P>
	As regards the very substance of the motion, I would like to 
say to the minister, who prides himself on being a Liberal with a 
capital L, that although the stabilization program precisely aims 
at helping the neediest provinces, these last few years, a 
province such as Alberta received $174 million in 1982-83, and 
Ontario, a rich province, according to government spokesmen, 
received $227 million in 1990-91 and $284 million in 1991-92 
while the Government of Quebec was denied the same 
conditions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Madam Speaker, I think that the hon. member of 
the opposition is confusing the equalization program with the 
stabilization program.
<P>
	The object of equalization payments is to give the have-not 
provinces the possibility of providing public services of a 
quality similar to those offered elsewhere. That is why 
equalization payments are not made available to the wealthiest 
provinces, but only to those less well-off. That is not the object 
of stabilization payments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12769"> 12769 </A></B>
<P>
	The object of stabilization payments is to stabilize provincial 
revenues. If your revenues, according to the criteria, are lower 
than before, the federal government offers a compensation. If 
they are not lower or if they are but because of something that 
the provincial government itself has done, then there is no 
compensation. That is what happened.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, Reform members will be splitting their time.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to participate in debate on the 
Bloc opposition motion before the House concerning additions 
to the long list of Quebec demands again laid before the House 
and ultimately the Canadian taxpayer. I have a hard time 
denouncing the federal government's tardiness in the face of 
these spurious and ongoing demands. It is heartening to see the 
government and particularly the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs exercising some prudence and caution in doling out 
resources the government does not have.
<P>
	I suspect the Quebec intergovernmental affairs minister, 
flushed with success from her 1994 coup in Ottawa when she 
pried $37 million out of the federal coffers for the referendum 
on Charlottetown, felt this trek to the capital would immediately 
result in the payout of $333 million.
<P>
	Today we have the Bloc shilling for Quebec's 
intergovernmental affairs minister and solely as usual for the 
province of Quebec by way of an opposition day motion. Unlike 
September 1994, this time others have a chance to participate in 
the Canada-Quebec sweepstakes.
<P>
	The motion calls on the House to denounce the federal 
government for not paying an additional $119 million which 
Quebec claims is the unpaid federal share for educating Indian 
and Inuit children in northern Quebec over the past nine years. 
Federal officials contend that some $450 million has been paid 
in this spending envelope and that conditions set forth under the 
James Bay and northern Quebec agreement and northeastern 
Quebec agreement have been contravened as a consequence of 
overspending by the Quebec government.
<P>
	Who is right? Has the Quebec government sought approval 
from the federal government to do so? Who knows? A Bloc 
motion and a trip by a provincial emissary are not good enough 
for me.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	The 1995-96 estimates for Indian affairs indicate spending of 
over $825 million on all elementary, secondary and 
post-secondary education for natives. On the post-secondary 
side it indicates an increase of $34 million over 1994-95. In the 
1992-93 fiscal year departmental spending in education was 
$711 million. This year's estimates indicate a $114 million 
increase over a three-year period, or roughly what the province 
of Quebec is asking for by way of its alleged shortfall.
<P>
	No one is denying any person access to a complete education. 
In the instance of aboriginal education certain comprehensive 
funding agreements or alternative funding arrangements have to 
be met. Political posturing and using the current political 
sensitivities by way of an implied threat will not get my party to 
support another $119 million being anted up, no matter how 
charming the messenger.
<P>
	Allow me to turn to the second demand of the motion as 
orchestrated by last week's trip by the provincial 
intergovernmental affairs minister. In this instance the House is 
being called upon to denounce the federal government for not 
reacting to Quebec's demand for the government to apply the 
federal fiscal stabilization program and help out Quebec during 
these difficult fiscal times to the tune of $135 million.
<P>
	Quebec claims drastic drops in revenue and thus qualifies for 
support from the emergency program. The provincial minister 
and the Bloc have good memories, since the claim for the 
payment of $135 million goes back to 1991. What was the 
revenue shortfall in Quebec in 1991? What was the emergency 
situation? These seem like reasonable questions. Since the Bloc 
was not in power in 1991 it is nice to see the Bloc carrying the 
can in Ottawa for Robert Bourassa.
<P>
	Under the fiscal stabilization program certain conditions 
must be met for eligibility to funding. In 1991-92 and during 
this recession five provinces were found wanting and received a 
total of $418 million. Quebec and Saskatchewan were found not 
to be eligible at that time. However, in 1992-93 Quebec 
received $125 million from the fund. If the Bloc feels so 
strongly about the case, why not follow the federal 
government's suggestion and go to court? Why would it ask 
Parliament to give carte blanche approval to meet this demand?
<P>
	We understand that the legislation and regulations of the 
Fiscal Stabilization Program Act were met and no favourites 
were played. However, because Quebec was involved and was 
turned down this was somehow considered suspect immediately 
and that we should go to arbitration. No way.
<P>
	The issue is simple. Everyone is aware that it is one of an 
overall separatist strategy to make taxes and tax sharing the real 
issues in the sovereignty referendum. The Quebec finance 
minister has already threatened Quebecers in his recent budget 
by claiming that a no vote would mean higher provincial sales 
taxes to offset federal cuts in transfer payments. The leader of 
the PQ claimed that the federal debt burden had been shifted 
solely on Quebec and that he could not talk seriously of a cost 
effective and flexible federal system.
<P>
	The Bloc has joined the bandwagon and continued the 
blackmail by way of this motion. It is interesting that neither of 
these two leaders will discuss budget projections or provide 
information on what a yes vote would do. We all know it means 
even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12770"> 12770 </A></B>
<P>
higher taxes for Quebecers. According to a recent Fraser 
Institute study  they would be a whopping 25 per cent higher. 
Whom are the Bloc trying to kid? This is rank amateur 
blackmail.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The motion calls upon the House to denounce the federal 
government's tardiness in meeting the Quebec government's 
claim of $79 million for costs of using the Sûreté du Québec in 
the events at Oka in 1990. The issue requires some historical 
perspective so I will trace the debacle largely instigated by the 
Sûreté du Québec, the police force for which we are being asked 
to cough up another $79 million.
<P>
	Some very strange decisions were made at Oka by the Quebec 
government. On July 11, 1990 Sûreté members stormed the 
Mohawk barricade a Kanesatake. In the ensuing gun battle a 
police officer was killed. As a result we had a standoff which 
lasted 78 days. Soon after the events of July 11, police began 
blocking food and medical supplies destined for Mohawk 
residents at Kanesatake.
<P>
	Widespread criticism led to a lifting of the blockade on July 
26. Talks began between the parties and on August 8 the Prime 
Minister appointed as mediator Chief Justice of the Quebec 
Superior Court Alan Gold. At the same time the Prime Minister 
said he would make the Canadian army available if Quebec 
needed it.
<P>
	On August 12, Justice Gold announced some agreement and 
two days later it was announced that the Quebec government had 
requested the Canadian army. A force of 2,500 soldiers moved 
in. The next day it was announced that the army would replace 
the Sûreté at the barricades. This was completed on August 20. 
Talks were going nowhere, and on August 28 the army was asked 
by the premier to remove the barricades.
<P>
	The motion is a one dimensional litany of Quebec complaints. 
The Bloc is not truly displaying its position as official 
opposition. It would be better served devoting more attention to 
national issues and less time on purely political posturing to 
serve one province.
<P>
	I cannot support the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. 
member and I am somewhat surprised by his paternalistic 
attitude regarding the claims that are being made.
<P>
	The claims made by the Quebec government at this stage are 
about adjustment and correspondence to criteria and things of 
that nature. We are not here to question the way governments 
have acted. In that regard, I think that the hon. member's 
attitude was more or less appropriate when he asked if the 
gouvernment had acted in a relevant way and when he suggested 
it should act in such and such a way in another situation.
<P>
	However, as regards fiscal stabilization, I believe this raises 
an important substantive issue. We are told that the Quebec 
government should go to the courts since it received an 
unqualified refusal from the finance minister. Should we not 
question the relevancy of a fiscal stabilization agreement in 
which the federal government is both judge and judged? Indeed, 
the government will give the money if the claim is considered 
justified, but the government is also, through the finance 
minister, the final authority allowing the disbursement.
<P>
	Should such an agreement not be considered as a form of 
domineering federalism where the father decides what is good 
for his children? As if the provinces were the children of the 
federal government. Should we not ask ourselves something?
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Should there not be, for this type of agreement, an 
independent body which could decide on the relevancy of claims 
in cases of disagreement between the federal and provincial 
governments? This way governments could be spared legal 
battles which entail useless expenses and necessarily lead to 
political claims, like the ones the Quebec government is 
making, when one of the parties involved refuses to agree to a 
claim considered to be justified by the Quebec government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Madam Speaker, in terms of the fiscal 
stabilization issue, I have a lot of problems with the issue in a 
broader sense. We have an equalization arrangement that was 
reaffirmed for five years last year in Parliament. It was based on 
government and on party discipline voting. The agreement is 
one whereby the fourth most prosperous province, the province 
of Quebec, is receiving something in the order of 40 per cent of 
equalization payments. That has created some major contention 
in other parts of the country.
<P>
	In terms of the actual question of dealing with whether the 
judge and jury on arguments within that framework should be an 
independent body, I have some sympathy with the argument. 
Otherwise it is very prone to political manoeuvring whether it is 
from a provincial jurisdiction or the federal government.
<P>
	That is the rationale for including the courts in the process but 
perhaps there is another way to do it other than through the 
courts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is stimulating for me to rise today to address the Bloc 
motion which denounces the government for its tardiness in 
addressing Quebec's demands for outstanding payment in three 
critical areas.
<P>
	What does the Government of Quebec want? If we examine 
the request we see that the Parti Quebecois or the Government of 
Quebec says that it is owed $79 million for costs incurred during 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12771"> 12771 </A></B>
<P>
the Oka crisis of 1990. This bill is mainly for overtime paid to 
the Quebec provincial police. Quebec claims that Indian affairs 
is a  federal jurisdiction and the government has a crisis fund 
from which the money should be paid.
<P>
	On the surface it seems like a reasonable request and is 
reasonably justified. If we were to get into the details we might 
find room for argument. After all we all know that if the 
provinces request through their attorneys general the aid of the 
civil power for their police it is a provincial obligation to pay.
<P>
	In any event, Ottawa says that it has already paid $5.3 million. 
It has asked the federal auditor general to review the claims on 
both sides and propose a fair division of costs. This seems like a 
quite reasonable position which I submit should be given a 
chance to work.
<P>
	The second claim on the part of the Parti Quebecois or the 
Government of Quebec is for $119 million for moneys spent on 
the education of young natives in the James Bay region of 
northern Quebec. The spending of $119 million for the 
education of natives was very laudable and worthwhile.
<P>
	The PQ claims that the 1978 James Bay agreement contained 
provisions for Ottawa to pay a portion of the costs, but that since 
1987 it has refused to pay its full share. The response from 
Ottawa is that it has already spent $450 million over the past 
several years and that additional costs were incurred by the 
province of Quebec without federal approval. According to 
reports, Ottawa is quite willing to discuss this matter in further 
detail but Quebec is unhappy with the pace of the negotiations to 
date, if not the negotiations themselves.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I submit that the negotiation process should be encouraged so 
that a fair and equitable agreement can be reached on this 
important matter. It seems that in this play between the 
government and the PQ and even the BQ, Reform has almost 
taken the position of honest broker.
<P>
	The final claim of the PQ is for $135 million under the 
stabilization payment programs for 1991-92. The PQ says that 
richer provinces, including Ontario and my province of British 
Columbia, got money under the program which compensates 
provinces if they lose revenue because of an economic 
downturn.
<P>
	Ottawa's reply in this case is that the finance department 
analysed Quebec's application on the same basis as other 
provinces that applied that year and the application was turned 
down, as was that of Saskatchewan. If that is the case, then 
Quebec has no claim.
<P>
	Having looked at the demands and Ottawa's response to these 
demands, it is also very important for all of us to look at the 
motivation behind these claims. The Parti Quebecois is 
currently engaged in a campaign to separate Quebec from the 
rest of Canada. The PQ is calling it a sovereignty campaign but it 
is just that, a campaign to separate.
<P>
	We read in the polls that the campaign shows the separatist 
side is losing. We must ask ourselves the question: Could it be 
that the PQ and their BQ allies are simply looking for an issue to 
help buoy the sagging separatist cause? If we examine the theory 
we see that such a tactic could bring positive gains to the yes 
side.
<P>
	First, if Ottawa refuses to pay, the PQ and the BQ can tell 
Quebecers that Ottawa just does not care. That it is just another 
example of why Quebec must separate from Canada, because 
Ottawa cannot be trusted to live up to its commitments.
<P>
	If Ottawa gives in and pays what the PQ says it is owed, then 
the separatist forces can trumpet: ``This is a victory against 
domineering Ottawa''. Either way, the PQ and BQ can score 
political points. This is what troubles me about the bills being 
presented by the PQ and the motion presented by the Bloc today. 
It appears to be motivated by crass politics and is not a genuine 
desire to enhance the lives of Quebecers.
<P>
	At the same time I have to applaud members of the Bloc for 
their dogged determination to bring before the House issues that 
affect their constituents, the people of Quebec. They are very 
good at that. However, as I mentioned earlier, it is unfortunate 
that this determination is not based on anything more than 
achieving the Bloc's stated political goal of separation.
<P>
	I must also admonish the Bloc for neglecting its role as the 
official opposition. If the Bloc wants to maintain the role of 
official opposition, it has to widen its focus and begin to address 
the many greater areas of common concern in Canada. It must 
not be allowed to simply use its position to further its own 
agenda.
<P>
	Dedicating limited supply days to debating motions such as 
the one we have before us today means that the affairs of the 
nation as a whole are put on the back burner while we all address 
issues which affect just a limited portion of our society. That is 
the problem. To me it is an abuse of the parliamentary process 
and to a large degree an affront to the majority of Canadians, 
even to Canadians in Quebec who are tired of seeing themselves 
used as nothing more than pawns in the political games being 
played by the Bloc and its PQ allies in Quebec city.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	If the PQ and the BQ want to separate, then let them hold their 
referendum without delay and let Parliament get on with the 
business of running Canada for all Canadians. It is time for 
parliamentarians to demand the Bloc either fulfil its role as the 
official opposition or step aside for a party that is willing to do 
the job. The Bloc must not be allowed to hold Parliament 
hostage any longer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12772"> 12772 </A></B>
<P>
	It is within the power of Parliament to remove the mantle of 
official opposition from the Bloc and bestow it on a true 
opposition party. This has not happened to date because the 
Prime Minister appears unwilling to do it.
<P>
	Therefore I appeal to Canadians from coast to coast to coast to 
write the Prime Minister and ask him why he is an accomplice to 
these political games; ask the Prime Minister to allow the House 
to conduct a free vote on which party should be the official 
opposition.
<P>
	It is time for us all to move forward in the interest of all 
Canadians. The Bloc is hindering this process with the type of 
motion that is in front of us today. Canadians say enough, and I 
say enough, and enough to the motion before the House as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I suppose my colleague for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan got carried away, to have made such 
comments. I usually have great respect for what he says in the 
House. The speech he delivered in the last ten minutes shows 
how our friends from the Reform Party are unable to give any 
serious consideration whatsoever to the legitimate demands of 
the government of Quebec.
<P>
	I have two points to make. The member explained, during his 
ten minutes, that the tabling, by the Bloc Quebecois, of a motion 
asking the federal government to act properly and stand by 
agreements it made under the statutes governing our 
institutions, is nothing more than separatists bringing up a local 
problem for partisan purposes.
<P>
	I am sure my colleague cannot, in all conscience, maintain 
such an absurdity. He knows perfectly well that what the 
opposition is asking this morning, what the present Quebec 
government is asking, is what the Quebec has been asking for 
ten years in one case, five years in another case and three years 
in the last case. These demands date from the days of the 
Bourassa government. As I mentioned in my speech, Mr. 
Bourassa cannot be accused of thinking separatist thoughts.
<P>
	My second point is that I was surprised to hear such comments 
from a Reform member who is always asking the federal 
government to stop interfering, to let the provinces act in their 
own field. He is asking even more-he would like the powers of 
government to be decentralized. He would like us to have a 
smaller federal government.
<P>
	When the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, rises in the 
House on a motion that basically has the same goal, my 
colleague is blinded by partisan considerations and he lowers 
the level of debate to a partisan debate. I think there is no room 
for such behaviour in this House. I hope my colleague will take 
advantage of the few minutes he has left to refocus his thoughts.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma: </B>Madam Speaker, I must say that I partly agree 
with the hon. member's words. He is certainly right when he 
says that the Reform Party is against big government, against 
too much government and against too much control by Ottawa 
over the provinces.
<P>
	I agree that we would like to have decentralization as 
outlined. But at the same time, and I will repeat what I just said. 
I see in the Bloc's motion a totally political manoeuver to bring 
the separation issue into the debate today.
<P>
	I can say that I heard the Bloc previously describe federalism 
as dominating. I also agree with that. But we have to change the 
government, we have to change the system first. We need 
decentralization, but we do not have it yet. We must work in 
order to achieve it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I find it rather deplorable that some people will 
say almost anything to score political points in the House. I 
understand that the hon. member might be very interested in 
forming the official opposition, but an election will be held only 
after the Bloc Quebecois is gone.
<P>
	I would like to say to the hon. member that it is in Quebec that 
the Oka crisis happened. It is Quebec that has problems with the 
federal government with respect to payments for aboriginal 
education. It is Quebec that has problems regarding 
stabilization. That is why we are here, to defend Quebec's 
interests.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, of course they have problems 
in Quebec. Of course they must stand up and defend them, but I 
will come back to what it is I am saying.
<P>
	We want to be the official opposition and yes, we will wait for 
a byelection to have it happen properly. In the meantime, the 
Bloc is doing nothing more than being the advocate of 
everything in Quebec and is not acting as the official opposition 
for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure to rise at this stage in the 
debate, especially after a speech by the Reform Party on a very 
important motion tabled by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I think that we should put the cards on the table and look at 
what is really happening. The motion is very clear. It is aimed at 
denouncing the federal government's delay in paying the money 
it owes Quebec. This government owes Quebec $79 million as a 
result of the Oka crisis, $135 million under the 1991-92 
stabilization program, and $119 million for problems related to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12773"> 12773 </A></B>
<P>
the education of young aboriginal people in northern Quebec. 
The Minister of Indian Affairs and the federal government know 
that these amounts are owed, but they are not doing anything 
about it.
<P>
	It is normal for the Bloc Quebecois, for Quebec MPs elected 
by Quebecers to defend Quebec's interests in Ottawa, to table 
such a motion on an opposition day, because it is in the news. 
This week, a Quebec official met with her federal counterpart to 
claim the tidy sum of $333 million. You expect us to remain 
silent while this is going on? No way. We have been sent here 
with a clear mandate, which we intend to fulfil, and we will fight 
for this money because it is owed to Quebec. We will work to get 
it.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Again, this issue gives us the opportunity to show clearly that 
Quebecers made a very definite choice in the last federal 
election because, as you know, Madam Speaker, this issue has 
been dragging on for years. Let me take a minute to give you 
some background information. We did not make anything up. 
The Bloc Quebecois and the big bad separatists in Quebec had 
nothing to do with this. Once upon a time, there was a federalist 
government called the Bourassa government in Quebec; it was a 
Liberal government. In the last Liberal budget tabled in the 
Province of Quebec, the Bourassa government indicated that the 
federal government owed $300 million to Quebec.
<P>
	Is this something that big bad separatists made up? No, 
Madam Speaker. If the allies of our friends opposite, those who 
will share their platform in the Quebec referendum scheduled 
for this year, if the Liberals mentioned this $300 million in their 
budget-and we know that they are pals with our friends 
opposite-it is because this amount is really owed. It remains to 
be paid.
<P>
	I had a prepared speech but I think that I will set it aside and 
speak from the heart instead, because this is much too important 
an issue. I think you can push, but only so far. Our motion refers 
to three demands of the highest importance. Let us look at them 
one at a time.
<P>
	First, there is the Oka crisis. What was this crisis? Well, Oka 
is in Quebec. Certain Indians claimed a strip of land in that area 
in the 1990s, and the Quebec provincial police, as well as the 
Canadian Armed Forces, had to be called in. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said so himself. He reported having 
spent $122 million on these measures. And we are supposed to 
believe that these were not emergency measures related to a 
disaster, that, to use his own words, public order and public good 
are slightly different?
<P>
	If it were strictly a matter of public good, what was the army 
doing there? Why did the government spend $122 million? Can 
you tell me, Madam Speaker? Because there was an element of 
public order involved, which is directly covered by 
federal-provincial agreement in the definition of disaster. This 
may sound like a strange term, disaster, but that is what the 
agreement says, and letters were even exchanged by the two 
levels of government, in which the federal government 
recognized the events in Oka were a disaster under the terms of 
the agreement.
<P>
	Correspondence exchanged between the provincial Liberal 
government and the federal Conservative government at the 
time provides that the Oka crisis is covered by that agreement. 
An amount of $139 million was spent on that in Quebec. How 
did the federal government pay its debt? It gave $5.3 million. 
Then, it said: ``The federal government is acting in good faith. It 
would pay the total bill, but the issue relates to public good, not 
public order''. Such an interpretation can only be made in bad 
faith. When $122 million was spent because of the existence of a 
threat to the public, either the federal government pays the full 
amount or, if it does not want to respect its own agreements or 
thinks that it will not be able to fulfil its commitment, it should 
not sign such agreements with the provinces. This is what is 
deplorable.
<P>
	Governments, whether they are Conservative or Liberal, are 
all the same. In fact, whether we are talking about the 
Conservatives, the Liberals or the Reform Party, it is all the 
same when it comes to looking after Quebec's interests. They 
are all opposed to these interests. This is the case and we have a 
very good example of that here, where Reform, Liberal, and 
Conservative members are working hand in hand. They belong 
to different parties, but they all react in the same manner 
regarding this issue. They are all opposed to Quebec's interests.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	They put Quebec in its place. That is what federalists want to 
do, put Quebec in its place, and that is what they have been doing 
for 30 years. And then, they wonder why there is a sovereignist 
movement in Quebec.
<P>
	There is a very precise order to the events in the Oka crisis. 
All the ministers who dealt with that issue have that 
correspondence. They know that the $139.7 million Quebec 
spent on that issue was not money spent for a futile purpose; it 
was spent to maintain public order. There was a major crisis 
going on. Those events involved the death of one person, and 
there was the need to intervene. That is why that money was 
spent, through the Quebec provincial police force.
<P>
	It must be remembered that there is a provincial police force 
in Quebec. The province provides its own police services. What 
would have happened, say, if such a crisis had taken place in 
Manitoba, a province without a provincial police force? The 
events would have been monitored by the RCMP. Who would 
have paid? The federal government. Would the federal 
government have passed the $139.7 million bill on to the 
province of Manitoba? I doubt it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12774"> 12774 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look at what is going on now with federal-provincial 
agreements on law enforcement services between that province 
and the federal government. The federal government provides 
police officers, and pays them, but it cannot even pass on the 
bill to get full payment for the services it provides to that 
province. Some might think that the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm is putting forward figures without 
knowing what he is talking about, but those are not my figures. 
The Solicitor General of Canada is the one who pointed them 
out. The solicitor general has been saying year in and year out: 
``You cannot even recover all the costs of the RCMP services 
you are providing, and you should''.
<P>
	And then, we are told that in a case like the Oka crisis that 
could have happened anywhere in Canada, the whole bill should 
be passed on to the province. Madam Speaker, this could only 
happen here. It could only happen in Quebec. It is the only 
province that has to argue to have the federal government pay its 
bills. We should not forget the Charlottetown referendum. How 
many times did we have to raise the issue in this House in order 
to get the federal government to pay the $35 million it owed? 
Quebec paid twice for that referendum that was forced upon it. 
The federal government imposed that referendum, and we had to 
pay for it twice.
<P>
	It is only when the government opposite examined the issue, 
set aside its political interests and partisan considerations that it 
handed a $35 million cheque to Quebec, because that claim was 
indeed justified.
<P>
	The situation is exactly the same with the Oka crisis. Quebec 
is owed $79 million. Now, who is going to pay?
<P>
	I would now like to say a few words about the second claim 
concerning the education of young aboriginals. I am particularly 
pleased to do so when the minister is here. He will certainly 
confirm what I have to say.
<P>
	Is it not strange that, here again, we had agreements between 
both levels of government on the education of aboriginals? One 
point should be clear. Aboriginal affairs are a federal 
jurisdiction. When the federal government steps outside its 
jurisdiction, we take it to task. What we have here is exclusively 
under federal jurisdiction. Let the government abide by that nice 
Canadian constitution it so eagerly defends in the House. Let it 
honour its signature. Here again, we have a federal-provincial 
agreement under which the federal government is supposed to 
pay 75 per cent of costs and Quebec 25 per cent. The minister 
gave an excellent explanation earlier. A few young whites live 
on the reserve, and their education is a provincial jurisdiction. 
Therefore, Quebec should pay for their education.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	The federal government should also pay for the natives living 
on that reserve and on all the reserves in northern Quebec. 
Following the James Bay agreement, both levels of government 
reached an excellent agreement under which the federal 
government and the province of Quebec split some of the costs.
<P>
	Between 1978 and 1987, this approach worked very well. The 
federal always paid as soon as it received the bill sent by the 
Quebec government. In 1987, the federal government stopped 
paying. Why? Because it argued that the bill was too high and 
that the expenses had increased too much. Why had these 
expenses increased? Simply because the birth rate has increased 
on the reserve as well as the number of young natives, and more 
natives had gone back to school. The Quebec government was 
providing more education services and more classes to the 
natives. So, the federal government said: ``Oh no, the expenses 
have gotten out of hand; we will no longer pay''.
<P>
	Today, the minister had the nerve to say: ``Look, we are acting 
in good faith. We paid $450 million''. Yes, but they stopped 
paying in 1987. Is that what he calls acting in good faith? Is that 
what flexible federalism is all about? Is this the kind of 
federalism in front of which we should grovel like the members 
opposite? Without Canadian federalism, there is no salvation? I 
do not think so.
<P>
	In cases like this one, we will still be blamed for defending 
Quebec's interests, even if the federal government obviously 
owes us some money. And we are not talking about petty cash 
here, but rather $119 million. We should give up $119 million 
without saying anything. This is horrible. It is unacceptable.
<P>
	What is even more unacceptable is for some members 
representing Quebec ridings to rise and to criticize us because 
we are defending Quebec's interests and asking for the money 
owed to us. We want what is ours. This money is owed to us.
<P>
	These Quebec members will still rise to try to sweeten things 
up, to hide the truth and to tell us why they do not have to pay. 
However, all the documentation we have clearly shows that 
some agreements were reached and some promises were made 
by the various levels of government concerned.
<P>
	This only goes to prove that the system in which we live is 
awful and cannot work. There are two nations in this country; 
there are two countries in this country. We are totally unalike. 
How do you think we can agree when they cannot even respect 
contracts which they signed? Moreover, they invite us to settle 
our disagreements in court. ``We do not agree, so let us go to 
court''.
<P>
	We can do that with the United States. A great Canadian like 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs can say to his 
neighbours who do business with Canada: ``Listen, if we cannot 
reach an agreement, you can always go to court; that is what 
courts are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12775"> 12775 </A></B>
<P>
for''. But, to  my knowledge, as long as Quebec does not say yes 
to sovereignty, as long as Quebec is not a separate country, we 
are still part of the system.
<P>
	This is what the so-called flexible federalism is. Is this what 
the blind advocate of flexible federalism is going to offer us? It 
is scandalous. I think there is no better way to describe it than to 
say it is scandalous.
<P>
	The third claim, and not the least, is an amount of $135 
million for the 1991-92 stabilization program. If my memory 
does not fail me, it was not the big bad separatists who were in 
power then, it was the Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, the Premier of Quebec was the ineffable Robert 
Bourassa, a federalist well known by our friends opposite, and 
this man claimed $135 million. That tells you something. If a 
man like Mr. Bourassa put down in his books that the federal 
government owed Quebec the sum of $135 million, you need not 
look any further, it is a minimum. No matter how you calculate 
it, he was so afraid of displeasing his great federal friends, he so 
often groveled before the federal government, that if he 
submitted a claim for $135 million, you can be sure the federal 
government owed this money to Quebec. There is no need to 
look any further. We can make all kinds of complicated 
computations, we can make a balance sheet say what we want, I 
think everybody here agrees with that.
<P>
	The fact remains that, if federalists like Robert Bourassa and 
his cabinet, of which the present Minister of Labour was a 
member, claimed such an amount, then that was probably the 
amount due. I would like to hear from the Minister of Labour, 
who was elected to protect Quebec's interests, since she is very 
familiar with all the details of the claim. I would like to know 
what she says to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Does she say that that is the correct amount as she used to 
claim when she was a member of the Bourassa government? 
Does she say that Quebec's claims like the one for the Oka crisis, 
which she certainly knew all about as a member of the Bourassa 
cabinet, are well founded? Does she say to the 
intergovernmental affairs minister that the money owed for 
northern Quebec natives' education should be paid? She was 
once the Quebec Minister of Education. Does she say it should 
be paid? Will she rise in the House? I am anxious to see how she 
will vote tonight on the motion and to see if she defends 
Quebec's interests as we do because it was for that reason that 
we were elected. I am anxious to see her on her feet.
<P>
	The federal government made written and oral commitments 
to Quebec. It is accountable to the people of Quebec. Moreover, 
it is the source of some of the problems we are faced with today. 
The federal government should pay right away what it owes 
Quebecers. Do the honourable thing and pay what you owe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in such a delicate matter that 
concerns not only our native people but also Quebec's honour, 
we must not forget that, in 1990, the media in Europe, Asia and 
all over the world criticized us for the way this dispute with our 
native friends had been handled. It was not something that 
Quebec could be proud of.
<P>
	When I hear opposition members say that we, government 
members, are not protecting Quebec's interests, I would like 
them to tell me why they have decided to change their position 
with regard to the referendum. Now they want to have an 
association with the Canadian government even though they 
claim that it does not honour its fiscal commitments. Everybody 
knows that it is not true.
<P>
	I would be curious to know the opinion of small 
municipalities which have received funding for infrastructure 
projects thanks to their support, to the co-operation of the 
province and to the federal government's determination to put 
Canadians and Quebecers back to work.
<P>
	The members opposite say that the Canadian government has 
not responded to the Quebec government's demands, but it is 
absolutely false. It is the government of Quebec which called on 
the Canadian Armed Forces, and it is the federal government 
which spent $122 million. We must not forget that. You know, 
Madam Speaker, this bill will not be paid by the government of 
Quebec. It is through federalism, as it now stands, that we can 
share our resources. That is what gives our country its strength. 
The province of Quebec has a lot to gain by being part of our 
great Canadian family.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the fact that the federal government has paid $450 
million for the education of natives in northern Quebec has 
already been mentioned. I could talk some more about all the 
programs which have benefited Quebec, but it is absolutely 
wrong to say that the members opposite are speaking for 
Quebec. I am a Quebecer, a Gaspesian and proud of it, and if an 
opposition party which does not even represent the majority in 
Quebec in terms of the popular vote thinks it can tell me-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Not true!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to point out that 
they only captured 48 per cent of the popular vote, and that the 
Parti Quebecois only captured 44 per cent of the vote in the 
provincial election. If they had the honour, audacity and 
intellectual integrity to say to us tomorrow morning: ``We are 
going to hold a referendum and the question will be: Do you 
want to separate from Canada, yes or no?'', I assure you that 
they would be lucky if 30 to 35 per cent of Quebecers were to 
vote in favour.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12776"> 12776 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, I ask the members of the opposition why they 
decided to go this route, if Canada really is the deadbeat they 
make it out to be. Why would they still want to remain 
associated with Canada if, according to them, the Canadian 
federation is not worth the trouble?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, what a shame that the 
hon. member opposite cannot tell an apple from an orange. 
Understandably, both are fruit, but that is no reason to confuse 
the two. Although we are no longer on the subject of the motion, 
too much is at stake not to reply to the hon. member's question 
regarding why we have proposed an association with Canada.
<P>
	For one, we are not proposing an economic association with 
the federal government; we are proposing an economic 
association with the other provinces, with Canadians. It would 
be an economic association between peoples, not between 
governments. The federal government is the deadbeat; not the 
Canadian people. The federal government has acted in bad faith; 
not the Canadian people. The federal government is into petty 
politics; not the Canadian people.
<P>
	By asking this question, the hon. member has revealed just 
how clueless he is about the referendum debate in Quebec. I 
invite him to pay more attention to the debate on the 
referendum, which I can assure him will be held in 1995.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> I certainly hope so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> And I hope with all my heart that the great 
defender of this great country, none other than the Prime 
Minister of Canada, will join hands with the Conservative 
member of this House, the leader of the Conservatives, and with 
the Reformers too, because they all came out of the same mold. 
They will all try to sell flexible federalism to Quebecers.
<P>
	But we will also be on the scene to push our position. We will 
also point out that the federal government's first reaction is 
always to say no to Quebec. The hon. member made comments 
on my speech, that is his right. But I find it strange that he did 
not really talk about the important points I made in my speech. 
Was money spent during the Oka crisis, yes or no? Did the 
federal government consider it a catastrophe, yes or no? Did the 
federal government send the army because it considered the 
incident to be a catastrophe as defined under the accord, yes or 
no? Why did the federal government spend $122 million, like 
the hon. member said, if it had no business in Quebec, if the 
incident really was a purely provincial matter?
<P>
	Because Quebec asked it to? Of course. But that answers the 
question of whether or not it was a catastrophe. How odd that the 
hon. member did not talk about that. And regarding the $450 
million, yes the federal government did spend $450 million on 
education up to 1987. I would remind the hon. member, 
however, that Quebec paid its share, 25 per cent or around $115 
million.
<P>
	The sum we are demanding is for all of the years after 1987 in 
which the federal government did not want to pay, under the 
same accord, the accord under which the federal government 
had already paid in years past. We are asking for nothing more 
than our due. The same goes for the stabilization payments.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	How strange that the hon. member did not go into detail, did 
not explain why we were not entitled to claim these sums. No, 
instead, he accused us of comparing apples with oranges 
regarding sovereignty and would have you believe that we have 
charted a new course. Had he only really listened to the Bloc 
Quebecois since its arrival in this House, he would have realized 
that we did not do an ``about face''; we are just openly repeating 
things we have always been saying here. This is merely a 
synthesis of our thinking.
<P>
	The hon. members opposite can jeer all they want and call it 
an about face. For us, it is the next logical step on Quebec's path 
to sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as you know, it was very hard 
for Quebecers and for all Canadians to see this aggressive 
confrontation with the aboriginal First Nations, watched by 
millions of people throughout the world. I found it very 
troubling.
<P>
	And I think that this opinion, these feelings, are shared by 
thousands, even millions of Quebecers. It was very 
uncomfortable to realize that we did not get along with the first 
settlers of this country.
<P>
	That is now history. According to the opposition, it is time to 
pay the bills. According to the Disaster Financial Assistance 
Program, the DFAP, the government has paid nearly $210 
million in assistance since 1970, so that the bill we were sent by 
Quebec would represent nearly 40 per cent of the program's 
budget for the past 25 years.
<P>
	I agree the bill is pretty steep. It takes time, as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs explained, but the federal 
government always pays its share. We are ready to negotiate. We 
are ready to review. However, I do not think the opposition 
should politicize the issue like this, because we are dealing with 
Canada's First Nations, who arrived in this country long before 
we did. And I think we owe them something. That is why I ask 
the opposition to accept that 40 per cent of the federal program 
will be paid to the Province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, not 40 per cent but 75 per 
cent, according to the agreement. That is my first point.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12777"> 12777 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the hon. member is confusing the issue. Just compare 
what is happening in Quebec with what happens in other 
Canadian provinces. Aboriginal people are treated better in 
Quebec. I think that as a member from Quebec he should at least 
admit, here in the House, that we treat aboriginal people very 
well. And I think they would agree.
<P>
	Second, when I see a member rising in the House to say; ``Yes, 
there is a disaster assistance program but we think the bill 
submitted by the Province of Quebec is too steep, because then 
we would have no money left for anything else''-now I ask 
you, can we legislate disasters? Can we predict that we will not 
have more than three? No compensation for number four?
<P>
	I think it stands to reason that when the government sets up a 
program and provides assistance under that program, it should 
expect to foot the bill. Again, I urge the federal government to 
pay its debts, because this is money it owes to Quebec. Pay now 
and stop arguing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to 
address this motion today. Some very important issues have 
been raised.
<P>
	The hon. Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs has clearly 
set out why the government will be voting against the motion. At 
the same time it is important to understand this issue within the 
broader context of what the government is doing on aboriginal 
issues both in Quebec and in Canada as a whole.
<P>
	The government was elected on a mandate from the Canadian 
people to respond to issues of concern to aboriginal 
communities. In the 1993 election we addressed these issues 
head on in the famous red book. We stated quite clearly what a 
Liberal government would do and now we are fulfilling our 
commitments.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	One of eight red book chapters is devoted exclusively to 
aboriginal issues, in addition to references to aboriginal policies 
in other chapters. Never before in Canadian electoral history had 
aboriginal issues received such a high profile. The opposition 
should bear in mind that on the strength of bringing these and 
other issues to public attention we received a strong mandate 
from the Canadian people.
<P>
	In the red book we maintain that aboriginal people in Canada 
want two things: first, a new partnership with government based 
on trust, mutual respect and participation in decision making; 
second, a strengthening of their communities. In the red book we 
stated that our goal was a Canada where aboriginal people would 
enjoy a standard of living and quality of life and opportunity 
equal to those of other Canadians; a Canada where First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis people would live self-reliantly, secure in the 
knowledge of who they are as unique peoples; and, where all 
Canadians would be enriched by  aboriginal cultures and would 
be committed to bringing their fair share of their potential to our 
nation.
<P>
	Perhaps most importantly, the red book set out our goal for 
Canada where aboriginal children would grow up in secure 
families and healthy communities, with the opportunity to take 
their full place in Canada. This is our vision and I think it is 
everyone's vision in this House. We have been moving step by 
step to bring it alive. In the first year and a half of the 
government's mandate, we have already made considerable 
progress in Canada and in Quebec. I am not saying that this is the 
end-all or be-all, but we have made some progress which I think 
is significant, even though we have a long way to go.
<P>
	In the first 18 months as minister I visited Indian and Inuit 
communities across Quebec and I met with most Quebec chiefs 
and several Inuit leaders. I have talked to Ghislain Picard of the 
Assembly of First Nations; I have talked to Chief Max 
Gro-Louis of the Huron; I have talked to Matthew Coon-Come 
of the Cree; Jean-Guy Whiteduck; Brenda Gideon Miller; Joe 
Norton, Dennis Ross, Jerry Peltier of the Mohawk; Marcel 
Boivin; Bernard Jérôme; Simeonie Nalukturuk of the Inuit; 
Zebedee Nungak of the Inuit; and Remy Kurtness. Perhaps 
people are saying I am talking too much. They all tell me what is 
being done, what needs to be done and how we can do better 
things together.
<P>
	We forget. We deal with the aboriginal people almost from a 
point of ignorance. I was looking at the notes of Joseph-Elzéar 
Bernier, the Baffin Island explorer, when he first met the Inuit. 
This is from his own diary: ``After firing 19 shots, I instructed 
an Eskimo to fire the 20th, telling him, you are now Canadian''. 
That is how we started up there.
<P>
	We forget that in Quebec there are 10 First Nations, over 40 
communities and Inuit in the north. These communities are all 
over the place. They are a suburb of Montreal, they are extended 
along the St. Lawrence, they are in the interior and they are in 
the far north. We forget that when Cartier first landed he lost half 
of his people in the first winter. If it had not been for the Indians, 
who taught him to put bark and cedar needles and water together, 
they would have all died of scurvy. The Indians asked for 
nothing. They asked for nothing. And that is the start of their 
history.
<P>
	We came here with a certain amount of avarice in our hearts, 
telling these people: ``You've been holding this land for 5,000 
years for us. It is really ours and we discovered it''. We forget 
that they have a proud history. They had been here. They are 
nations, they were nations and they will be nations.
<P>
	Some 20 years ago the province of Quebec and Canada 
solidified an important relationship with First Nations as the 
first comprehensive claims in Canada, the signing of the James 
Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and the northeastern 
Quebec agreement, fostered a sense of pride throughout Quebec, 
and rightfully so. I must remind members of the Bloc that it was 
former Prime Minister  Trudeau who was on our side when this 
agreement was signed, initiated, worked on. It was the present 
Prime Minister, who had my job, who brought this agreement to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12778"> 12778 </A></B>
<P>
fruition. The heritage of the Cree and the heritage of the James 
Bay agreement is not only a proud heritage of our country, it is a 
very significant heritage in the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	These modern treaties mark a pivotal point in our relationship 
with aboriginal people, not only in Quebec but throughout 
Canada. Much has already been accomplished under these 
agreements, but given their extraordinary scope and complexity 
it is not surprising that much more needs to be done.
<P>
	When I visited the Cree communities in December I 
continued discussions with Grand Chief Matthew Coon-Come 
and Cree chiefs regarding implementation of the James Bay and 
Northern Quebec Agreement. As a result, work has been 
undertaken to continue our dialogue on several key areas of 
concern.
<P>
	I am pleased to report that under the first self-government 
legislation in Canada, the Cree-Naskapi of Quebec Act of 1984, 
significant progress has been made in bilateral talks on 
agreement on funding a five-year operation and maintenance 
budget for the regional and local governments.
<P>
	We also recently reached an agreement with Chief Billy 
Diamond of the Cree of Waskaganish for fresh water and sewage 
treatment. I am pleased to report that the construction of the 
community of Ouje-Bougougmou was written up in <I>National 
Geographic</I> and in articles throughout the world as the way to do 
things. I think every parliamentarian should go to 
Ouje-Bougougmou and see how it is done and when we work 
together how it can be done right.
<P>
	Chief Abel Bosum has been with us from the beginning there. 
He has lived with it. It is amazing. They took people from eight 
or nine scattered communities who were living in shacks. They 
met in a little house on a hill. They would come over in the 
evening and meet with the architect with suggestions. They were 
not just looking at plans. It was a living thing. They named each 
street after their traplines. If we could duplicate that in the 605 
First Nations across Canada, problems would be solved.
<P>
	I want to tell the House what Billy Diamond had to do when 
the Grand Council of Crees was started in 1974. Billy Diamond 
gave his health and his family. This is what he said on June 28, 
1971: ``This is our land. No one has obtained surrender from us. 
We never lost it in war. We never lost it in battle. We never 
signed a treaty. No one has taken it. And we are not allowed by 
the Creator to let anyone take it from us''. That is the way we 
started. They have only had three leaders: Billy Diamond, Ted 
Moses, Matthew Coon-Come.
<P>
	With the Government of Quebec and the Government of 
Canada working together we can put things together, not divide 
things or separate things. We can come up with the 
Ouje-Bougoumous. That is what we have today. It is easy to 
divide. It is hard to keep people together.
<P>
	In the area of policing, the department of the solicitor general 
signed a tripartite agreement on public security for all Cree 
communities. This illustrates a common goal for the Crees to 
govern themselves by assuming administration, management, 
and supervision of its own police force.
<P>
	We are also encouraged to see considerable progress made on 
reaching an agreement to establish a Nunavik assembly of 
government. Although primarily a negotiation between Inuit 
and Quebec, Canada has been invited by both parties to have 
representation at these negotiations and we have provided the 
Nunavik constitutional committee with funding for these 
landmark negotiations.
<P>
	Canada has other involvement with aboriginal groups in 
northern Quebec. We organized and participated with Makavik 
Corporation in the Inuit forum, a meeting held on a regular basis 
to examine progress and co-ordinate the application of the 
implementation of the JBNQA in terms of federal obligations. 
Canada signed the JBNQA implementation agreement with the 
Inuit in 1990, which provides for an amount of $22.1 million and 
various other commitments.
<P>
	The Naskapis are also being innovative in developing 
partnerships. We recently signed a five-year agreement on 
housing and infrastructure and are discussing in concert with 
other federal departments an employment creation strategy.
<P>
	Ninety per cent of the time I am in the field with the aboriginal 
people of Quebec they do not talk about self-government or 
about the referendum or about separation. They talk about 
education, infrastructure, water systems, housing, and their 
aspirations. This is what they talk about.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	We talk about separation here. The intellectual dilettantes are 
always talking about separation. The native people are talking 
about things that are important to them and their kids: food on 
the table, jobs, security. These are the things we were elected 
for. We were elected on jobs, fiscal responsibility, getting on 
into the future and that is why we are staying on that agenda.
<P>
	Following our 1990 implementation agreement with the 
Naskapi, I am pleased to hear Quebec is engaged in discussions 
and looks forward to resolving various issues related to the 
implementation of the northeastern Quebec implementation 
agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12779"> 12779 </A></B>
<P>
	Federal initiatives are not limited to northern Quebec. As I 
said earlier, the aboriginal people are throughout Quebec. For 
example, comprehensive land claims with the 12 Attikamek and 
Montagnais communities are of enormous importance to all of 
northeastern Quebec. I look forward to renewed and 
rejuvenated negotiations that will lead to a fair and equitable 
resolution of their outstanding and complex land claims.
<P>
	It was odd, when I heard the Bloc speak today there was no 
mention of the fact that David Cliche, whom I like, although we 
disagree philosophically-he is a separatist and I am a 
federalist-went to the Attikamek and Montagnais and offered 
$400 million. That is not ancient history; that was a few months 
ago. Nothing was said about this, but he presupposed that $300 
million of that was federal money. While Quebec was taking all 
the bows-I see the Bloc member smiling, but that is 
correct-and David Cliche was taking all the bows and Premier 
Parizeau was in the glow of this, $300 million of the $400 
million was our money.
<P>
	I remember one Bloc member standing up saying ``I am here 
to defend the taxpayers of Canada'', which is what they were 
elected for. They are not here to separate the country-they have 
said that themselves; they are here to do their jobs. I do not 
remember one Bloc member ever standing up and saying maybe 
we have too much money in there. I think this is the first time it 
has even been mentioned that $300 million of that $400 million 
came from the federal coffers. Luckily, in a way, the agreement 
was rejected.
<P>
	There are also important developments involving the 
Huron-Wendat First Nation right next to Quebec City. This is 
interesting about the Huron. At one time the Huron were the 
largest of the six nations and a profound part of our history. 
Through disease, war and what we have done, they now have 
only one reserve, which is near Quebec City at Loretteville. It is 
very sad when this happens. We read so much about the Huron in 
the books. There are a few in the United States, but only one 
reserve in Canada.
<P>
	I met with Chief Max Gros-Louis in November 1994. An 
understanding has been reached among the federal, provincial 
and Huron-Wendat negotiators to recommend the framework 
agreement for very important negotiations of the application of 
the Murray Treaty.
<P>
	I have several pages on the Mohawk, who we hear about every 
day. I will skip over that, because my time is getting short. I will 
mention that it is working. The Mohawk round table is not the 
end-all, but it works. We are now talking to the Mohawk. Judge 
Réjean Paul is there and Michel Robert is there. It works. This 
government came in, and there are no more Okas. We talked and 
negotiated and dealt fairly with the Mohawks of Canada.
<P>
	We are working with the Inuit, the Cree, the Naskapi, the 
Montagnais, the Algonquin, the Attikamek, the Huron, the 
Malecites, the Micmacs and the Mohawks in Quebec. I cannot 
remember a time ever in the history of the country when any 
government could say there was movement with all of these 
people. That is what is important, not the fact that the Bloc 
comes here today on behalf of the Government of Quebec and 
tells us there is money owing.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important for us to work together when it comes to 
aboriginal people. We can do a good job. As things are going 
now, this country is not going to separate so we had better start 
talking about the future. We had better not have such deep 
wounds that we cannot heal them. That could happen even here. 
We could create such deep wounds that we could never heal 
them. We have to decide what is important to us collectively.
<P>
	The Bloc member for Saint-Jean is out there in the field. He is 
probably one of the more knowledgeable, maybe the most 
knowledgeable person in opposition on what is out there with 
the aboriginal people. He brings the concerns of food mail to 
this House. He brings the concerns of aboriginal people across 
this country. He made one mistake by going door to door in a 
Mohawk village and almost got kidnapped by the Mohawks 
because they did not understand he was a member of Parliament, 
but these things come and go.
<P>
	We have to establish what is important to us and what our 
values are as people. If we do that, this country will survive and 
we will do a good job for the aboriginal people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
took the liberty of jotting down a few points while the minister 
was speaking. I must say he has given us an extraordinary lesson 
on aboriginal culture, and so we have not really completely 
wasted our time, since, let there be no doubt, we have a lot to 
learn from this culture.
<P>
	You see, our purpose today was not to talk about aboriginal 
culture, which has its merits, but to talk about the money the 
federal government owes the Government of Quebec. It is just 
money, nothing important. It is just money after all. It does 
create a few minor problems, however. It is easy enough to say: 
there was a crisis at Oka, which is in Quebec, so it is not a big 
deal; Quebec can pay the costs or take the matter to court. 
Whose responsibility was it to deal with the native people? The 
federal government's. Now if I have properly understood the 
minister, given that the native culture has so many fine qualities, 
if the native people got angry at some point, it was because the 
federal government had not done its job. If it did not do its job, it 
has to assume the consequences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12780"> 12780 </A></B>
<P>
	So you see the matter is a simple one. The minister says that 
federal money would be used to reimburse the Government of 
Quebec for what it paid out. Yes, but, there is a problem here. 
There is a fundamental error in logic. It is not federal money, 
it is taxpayers' money. While the Liberal government may have 
red on its banner, it is not wearing a Santa Claus suit. It does 
not print money. It gets its money out of the taxpayers' pockets. 
Try asking the Minister of Revenue to wait two or three or four 
years for his tax money, try saying to him: ``We will go to court, 
and it will get settled that way''. It could create a few problems 
for any taxpayer foolish enough to try.
<P>
	No, it is not federal government money, it is taxpayers' 
money. The shoe starts to pinch when Quebec taxpayers have to 
pay twice-once when they pay their federal share and once 
when they pay the provincial government. Who is supposed to 
pay the costs the federal government is responsible for? Good 
heavens, the logic is simple. It is the logic of integrity. It is the 
logic of honesty. It is the logic of ``I paid out money for you 
under an agreement, I sent you the bill for it, you agreed to pay 
it-well, pay it then''. What was the answer to this? It was: ``See 
you in court. We want all the details on these invoices''. Well, 
good heavens-I certainly could not talk about good faith here.
<P>
	I would be tempted to suggest to the Quebec Minister of 
Revenue that he set aside from the GST money he collects an 
amount equal to what the federal government is refusing to pay, 
in the form of a guarantee. Once the federal government pays its 
bill, the Minister of Revenue will release the money. If this is the 
sort of language we have to use, then this is the way we will have 
to put it: $300 million out of $400 million.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The minister says: ``Mr. Cliche, in Quebec, has offered 
aboriginals $400 million''. He forgot to say that $300 million 
came from the federal government, in fact not from the federal 
government but rather from the taxpayers. If the federal 
government is so broke that it has to squeeze tax dollars out of 
taxpayers and cannot afford to hand over that money to Quebec, 
then it should separate from Quebec. Quebec then would be able 
to pay $300 million out of those $400 million since it would save 
a tidy sum of $30 billion.
<P>
	The minister was very nice in his speech, very kind. 
Unfortunately, he did not address the motion before the House. 
To conclude, I have this question for the minister. In his speech, 
the minister said right from the start that they were going to vote 
against the Bloc's motion. Could he tell us therefore what we are 
doing in this place all day long? Is it an exercise in futility? 
Those people say from the outset that they are not going to 
listen, that they are going to vote against the motion. Are we 
wasting our time? No, we are not wasting our time because those 
who are watching us on television will know the truth and have a 
very good reason to resolve the issue this fall by  voting in 
favour of Quebec's sovereignty and making Quebec a winner.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to remind the hon. 
member that we spend $351 million a year in the Quebec region 
for aboriginal people. We spent $980 million on the Crees, $552 
million on the Inuit and $69 million on the Naskapi, for a total of 
$1.6 billion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We already gave Quebec $450 million for education.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Maybe I should not bother to mention it but $450 million of 
our money went to Quebec on education.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has expressed the 
problem we have. Quebec is saying that the Government of 
Canada owes 50 per cent but we have no say on the amount of 
money spent. We have no say vis-à-vis education with the 
province of Quebec. It will call the shots. That is not 
partnership. That is: ``I am doing it. I will send you the bill and 
you pay it''.
<P>
	At the same time, I wrote to Madam Beaudoin in April saying 
that I would put my senior officials at the table to see if there is 
common ground. We will count the various moneys owing to see 
if we can find a just solution. The Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs has done the same thing but he has gone further and has 
met with her. We are trying to do this in a practical manner.
<P>
	I tend to agree with the Reform Party on one point. There are a 
lot of games being played here today. The issue is not what is 
owing to Quebec, the issue is separation. No matter which way 
we cut it, this is it.
<P>
	The problem I am having is that the onus is not on this 
government to prove why separation is better. The Bloc is 
having a difficult time with it. It is having a difficult time 
explaining to Quebecers how they will be more sovereign if 
Quebec separates.
<P>
	The reality is that with GATT, with NAFTA, with what we are 
doing with aboriginal people and within the cultural community, 
there is more sovereignty for Quebecers under federalism. 
There is more. They are starting to realize that. The Bloc is 
failing in its argument. It is up to its members to put their 
argument and convince Quebecers, not us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
minister just said that they gave $450 million towards the 
education of native people in Quebec. They have already used 
this argument three or four times on the government side. But if 
the bill comes to $600 million, it must be paid in full.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12781"> 12781 </A></B>
<P>
	When I bought a car, and was told by the salesman that it 
came to $30,000, I did not stop paying at $20,000, saying that 
it would have to suffice, that it was too much. I had to pay the 
whole amount, and live up to my commitment.
<P>
	Earlier, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs talked 
about the principles of fairness and good management; he really 
laid it on thick. But last year, around the same time, when we 
asked for a royal commission on the Pearson deal, for the sake of 
good management and good administration of public funds, we 
were told that it was not possible because time was of the 
essence. The whole matter had to be settled quickly for the 
economy to keep going, and the country to function.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	One year later, what is the situation, Madam Speaker? We are 
not too sure. Bill C-22 is in limbo, floating around somewhere. 
What was supposed to cost $25 million, according to the 
transport minister himself, has now sky-rocketed to $450 
million. Why is it that today, when Quebec and Quebecers are 
asking for what they are owed, all of a sudden the government 
invokes these same principles it refused to apply to the Pearson 
deal, even though a Liberal inquiry recommended legal action?
<P>
	I would like someone to explain this to me. How could the 
minister change that much within a year to the point of being 
unrecognizable?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Madam Speaker, in the James Bay and Northern 
Quebec Agreement there are shared costs for instance for 
infrastructure, water, sewers and so on which we have paid. We 
are doing the accounts on that. It would be as inappropriate for 
us to send the bill to Quebec saying to pay it without question as 
I think it is inappropriate for Mrs. Beaudoin to say: ``Here is the 
bill. Don't let a senior civil servant field it. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and I will deal with it. We will just 
cut a political decision''.
<P>
	I do not think, when we are dealing with large sums of money, 
that we can do these things that way. There has to be proper 
accounting. Senior civil servants who have the expertise have to 
sit down and do the accounting. That is all this is, an accounting. 
We accept that. What we do not accept is the Bloc using it as a 
political ploy which it is. We accept it as accounting within our 
normal relationship with Quebec, or any province in Canada 
from B.C. to Newfoundland.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, as 
critic for indian affairs, I will speak mostly about two of the 
claims that are before us today. I could have chosen to get 
directly to the point, but I thought it would be useful to look at 
what Quebecers could do with $300 million, since this is 
approximately the amount of the claim submitted to the federal 
government which is now being discussed in the House.
<P>
	There are quite a number of things Quebecers could do with 
$300 million. The first one that comes to mind is probably, as 
Minister Paillé said, an investment fund with a greater accent on 
venture capital, that would give young entrepreneurs with 
creative ideas the opportunity to go into business. We could 
create 50,000 to 100,000 jobs with such a fund of $300 million.
<P>
	There is chronic unemployment in Quebec. The 
unemployment rate has always been higher in Quebec than in the 
rest of Canada, because of decisions made here, in this House, 
where we often choose to establish heavy industries and other 
important job creating activities outside Quebec. We are stuck 
with an unemployment insurance fund and we are being told: 
``You are lucky because we give you more money than you give 
us. We return more money to you in unemployment insurance, 
social assistance, and education transfers''. Listen, you do not 
build a society with unemployed persons and welfare recipients. 
These people are hard pressed right now, and we have to put 
them back to work.
<P>
	I think it is appropriate that we should question the 
government today, that we should introduce a motion which 
says: ``Listen, ladies and gentlemen, pay your bills. You owe us 
$300 million''.
<P>
	I will now move on to the Oka question. Originally, the bill 
was for $84 million, but the Liberal government finally paid 
$5.3 million in 1992. At that time, the government looked at our 
claim and said: ``We are paying $5.3 million, but the remainder 
is not eligible''. Why is it not eligible? There is practically no 
reason. I remind you that, at the time, the Quebec government 
was Liberal and federalist. The man in charge was our former 
Minister of Social Security, the ineffable Mr. Ryan, that 
everybody knows and who tangoed with the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	He danced the tango in step. Mr. Ryan kept complaining, and 
the federal government kept sending him letters saying: ``You 
are exaggerating, we will not pay that much, we will give you 
$5.3 million, but as for the rest, the $79 million, forget it.''
<P>
	Mr. Ryan kept dancing with the federal government, he kept 
exchanging letters with the federal government, and he kept 
wringing his hands in the federal government's headquarters 
here in Ottawa. He kept writing to ministers tearful speeches, 
saying you must resolve this for us.
<P>
	However, we never saw him demanding publicly the federal 
government to pay the bill now, as the current Quebec 
government is now doing after so much pussyfooting. We know 
the federalist mind of Mr. Ryan, as I said, the ineffable Quebec's 
Minister of Public Security at the time, and we understand that 
he was content to dance the tango privately with the federal 
government and never dared to do it publicly. So, we are doing it 
today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12782"> 12782 </A></B>
<P>
	Why do the expenses not qualify? We do not know, except 
that, with the Parti Quebecois' arrival in power in 1994, as early 
as December 1994, the then minister of public security was 
asking his counterpart for the reimbursement. What happened 
then is exactly what the minister wants to take us into today. 
``We will do it with the auditors and the high officials. I suggest 
that we meet''.
<P>
	For five years, it has been only meetings. For five years, we 
have been told that officials would get together to try and 
resolve the issue, that the auditor general would also be asked 
what would qualify and what could be paid.
<P>
	It was a disaster that happened in Quebec in 1990, a disaster 
that had an effect not only in Quebec and in Canada, but also 
internationally. Several courts, several international fora dealt 
with the Oka events. I think that Quebec qualified under 
agreements signed between the federal and provincial 
governments and providing for such a disaster.
<P>
	Was it a disaster? I think that I could talk about it for hours, 
because I certainly experienced the events, I saw them, I saw the 
federal government's negligence in the Oka crisis. From our 
point of view there definitely was a major crisis in Oka affecting 
not only native people but Quebecers also.
<P>
	It has become obvious that in the beautiful region of Oka 
located near the Deux-Montagnes lake, where I go on a regular 
basis, the tourist industry has been completely wiped out. That 
region has become a desert from a tourism point of view. No one 
goes to Oka any more. There are still events in Oka which prove 
the carelessness of this government which sits around idly and 
waits for things to take a turn for the worse. What is happening 
during that time? The economy of the area and surrounding 
areas is in bad shape, as a result.
<P>
	Some officers of the Sureté du Québec had to spend weeks in 
Oka at that time, far from their families. Who is paying the bill? 
The government of Quebec is paying the bill, at present. As I 
said earlier, there are agreements where in case of a disaster 
there has to be some sort of sharing. In this case, Quebec is the 
only one to pay the bill, except a paltry $5.3 million.
<P>
	This government is still showing carelessness today. Just a 
week ago a good friend of the Liberals, Michel Robert, was 
appointed to the Quebec Court of Appeal. This man is a close 
friend of the Liberals, the red lawyer par excellence, a man who 
was on all strategic committees of this House, including the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee.
<P>
	That man played a key role in the Kanesatake negotiation. I 
talk about carelessness because I also know the native people's 
philosophy. According to their philosophy, you cannot suddenly 
say that you want to negotiate, to set a timeframe and solve 
everything in three days. This is not the way things work with 
them. You need time to gain their confidence. I must say 
however that Mr. Robert is a very good and very competent 
negotiator.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	However, after only seven or eight months, as we were 
beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, this 
government appointed Mr. Robert to the Court of Appeal and 
there we are, back to square one. What I am saying now is that 
the federal government is controlling the pressure in Oka, as he 
did in 1990. It raises or lowers the pressure depending on the 
political context. Today, we are claiming $79 million, knowing 
that this government has not done anything since 1990 to settle 
the problem in Oka. In this context, I think the claim is 
legitimate. As I said, it is another example of the carelessness of 
this government.
<P>
	What were we supposed to do in Oka? The major part of this 
claim relates certainly to the presence of police officers there. 
What evidence is needed to convince the government? Maybe a 
videotape would do? They are quite in fashion. As was shown 
recently, the government opposite only reacted when they saw 
videotapes.
<P>
	I recall events in Oka when the Sûreté du Québec was 
systematically sandwiched between aboriginal people and their 
opponents. I saw police officers torn to pieces. I saw on video 
some of them, accompanied by friends, being carried out on 
stretchers, because they had tried to separate two camps which 
were trying to cut each other's throat, so to speak.
<P>
	Now we are told: ``You take care of that yourselves. Public 
security is Quebec's responsibility.'' We do not worry about the 
fact that we are the trustees of aboriginal people, that we pay 
them and that we give a certain amount to the Oka band council 
every year. We simply continue to pay. You, however, will 
continue to pay the bills when things go sour, and also when we 
decide that things are taking a turn for the worse.
<P>
	I think that Quebec's $79 million claim for these expenses is 
quite legitimate. And I think that the Quebec government did the 
right thing during that crisis by putting the Quebec provincial 
police between the two factions that wanted to have a go at each 
other.
<P>
	They always fall back on the argument that things will be 
monitored by the auditor general, that senior officials will sit 
down together and keep an eye on things. I think that the 
problem is on the federal side. We should appoint an auditor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12783"> 12783 </A></B>
<P>
general who is above everyone and can check on the conduct of 
this department, which not only increases or eases the pressure 
as needed, but also perpetuates through dilatory tactics the 
financial confrontation between Quebec and Canada. That is the  
problem. The federal side does not want to settle the problem.
<P>
	Whenever we present them with a bill, it is quite normal for 
them to tell us, ``Let us sit down together and look at this with 
our officials''. What Ms. Beaudoin wanted was a political 
settlement. She wanted to meet with the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and settle this bill once and for all. 
However, the minister's solution is, as always, to perpetuate the 
problem. He says that the matter will be considered, that his 
senior officials, his faithful servants, will meet with us, but he 
refuses to settle the problem. The federal government will not 
settle the problem. So we are always caught in an ongoing 
financial confrontation with the government, and this 
confrontation may go on if a motion like this one is not adopted. 
Today's motion has launched a broad debate in which we are 
trying to convince the people opposite that they must pay their 
bills and settle their accounts.
<P>
	I now move on to James Bay. We know about their open 
mindedness. The minister gave us a very good presentation on 
what is happening in Quebec in terms of culture. I could give a 
presentation, but I would rather answer the questions of 
Quebecers waiting for $300 million from the federal 
government. I could talk about the Naskapi, the Cree, the Inuit 
for hours, but that is not the subject of today's debate.
<P>
	Neither is the fact that we always have to wait for 
money-taxpayers' money, of course, as my colleague pointed 
out earlier-from the federal government. We cannot say that 
the federal government does not give any money. It must give 
some. Because they are the trustees of Canada's aboriginal 
people, they must provide these people with a minimum 
standard of living. I do not deny that the federal government has 
given money for that purpose. So has the Quebec government.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Let me quote statistics showing that, as far as education is 
concerned, the Quebec government did not rely on the federal 
government. Otherwise, I think the James Bay Cree would have 
been in a really bad position.
<P>
	How does it work up there? There are three school boards; the 
Cree, the Inuit and the Naskapi each have their own. Costs 
sharing was on the basis of a gentleman's agreement.
<P>
	Here is how costs were shared at the time. I have the table 
before me. I read that, for the Cree-Naskapi, the Quebec 
government was to pay 25 per cent of the costs involved, and the 
federal government, 75 per cent. For the Inuit, the percentages 
were reversed, with the Quebec government paying 75 per cent, 
and the federal government, 25 per cent. We, in Quebec, care 
about native education. I cannot give you the exact figures, only 
the conclusions drawn from these statistics.
<P>
	In terms of language retention, the Cree, Inuit and Naskapi do 
better on average than natives in the rest of Canada. By 
language, I do not mean French or English, but their native 
tongue, which is Cree. Their language retention rate is clearly 
higher than in the rest of Canada and we have Quebec and the 
James Bay agreement to thank for that, for this agreement is a 
model in Canada and several aboriginal nations used it as a basis 
for negotiating with the federal government. I might add that the 
federal government often refers to this agreement because, as I 
said, it is a model.
<P>
	Enrolment rates are also higher than for other native groups in 
Canada. As for health, because they are more educated-this is 
an important consideration-aboriginal people have an infant 
mortality rate lower than the Canadian average. The life 
expectancy in these three groups is higher than in the rest of the 
native community in Canada. We can say that as far as the Cree, 
the Inuit and the Naskapi are concerned, the Government of 
Quebec has taken its responsibilities.
<P>
	The government never accepted to sign the agreement-it is a 
gentleman's agreement-and things went well until 1987. 
Starting in 1987, the basis of calculation changed drastically. 
Indexation was introduced, but without taking into account the 
birth rate, which, incidentally, is twice that found in the rest of 
Canada. Aboriginal peoples are currently a very strong drain on 
the budget. The problem is easy to understand. The aboriginal 
population is growing twice as fast as that of the rest of Canada.
<P>
	With regard to adult education, it was found that a whole 
generation-and that is true everywhere in Canada-of 
aboriginal children were removed from their families and taken 
far away, in an attempt to make them forget their culture and 
their language. A whole generation, the one which preceded us, 
of aboriginals completely missed the boat in terms of their 
culture, their language, their recognition as a people and, of 
course, their education.
<P>
	There is some catching up to do regarding adult education in 
Quebec's far north, and these people are working on that. There 
is also an increased demand for services such as daycare, etc. 
Aboriginal people in the far north have access to the latest 
technology and knowledge, which allows them to have very 
adequate education conditions, compared to the rest of Canada.
<P>
	What is the federal government's reaction? It says that it will 
pay back, but based on an indexation criteria, instead of 
complying with the terms of the convention in effect at the time. 
This government does not intend to pay its share in the current 
year.
<P>
	The finance minister's budget does not allocate any money to 
repay the federal government's share under the James Bay 
agreements. Earlier, the minister said that the government gave 
$450 million. I want to correct him. He made a small mistake. 
The amount is in fact $465 million. The government gave more 
than the minister  said it did. The problem is that if the original 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12784"> 12784 </A></B>
<P>
agreements had been respected, the federal government would 
have had to pay $584 million. This shortfall of $119 million is 
what we are claiming today.
<P>
	I would like to quote another minister of the Quebec Liberal 
government of the time, who is now the Minister of Labour in 
this government.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	With three minutes left, I have just enough time to explain 
what the education minister of the Quebec Liberal government 
was doing back then. She too was waltzing with the federal 
government. She took over from Claude Ryan, her colleague 
responsible for public security, and sent her deputy ministers to 
Ottawa with this message: ``Listen, this does not make any sense 
in the education sector. You have to pay us back''. A number of 
meetings were held but, of course, the federal government did 
nothing.
<P>
	My conclusion is what could Quebec do? What could the 
Quebec government do, given the federal government's 
negligence and inertia? Should we follow the example of the 
Blood Indians and the Blackfoot nation I visited in Central 
Canada and tell young aboriginals: ``Sorry, we do not have the 
money this year, so you will not be sent to school''. We did not 
do that. Even if the federal government is not paying its share, 
Quebecers have decided to support the rights of native peoples 
in Quebec, and young aboriginals are going to school.
<P>
	Lack of funds will not prevent a single child in northern 
Quebec from going to school. The Quebec government has 
decided to take on this responsibility. What were we supposed to 
do in Oka? Withdraw all police forces and let people fight? We 
had a ethical vision of our responsibilities, and the Quebec 
provincial police assumed a commendable attitude throughout 
the crisis, trying to prevent such fighting. Having said that, I 
would ask the federal government to abide by this gentlemen's 
agreement. Up to now, this side of the House has behaved in a 
gentlemanly way. I hope members opposite with the same 
mindset will keep their promise and pay what they owe to 
Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank you for giving me a few minutes to reply and 
maybe put a question to the member opposite. While listening 
not only to that member of the official opposition but to all the 
members of the official opposition today, I kept wondering if we 
were living in the same world. I must tell you that, sometimes, I 
think I am dreaming.
<P>
	Today, these people are really speaking against Quebec's 
interests. They claim they want to protect the interests of the 
province of Quebec, but in fact they are trying to fool the people 
in Quebec, who are mature enough not to fall into the totally 
partisan trap the Bloc Quebecois has set.
<P>
	The official opposition is asking the federal government to act 
irresponsibly, but this could have serious consequences at the 
political level. As the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
said clearly this morning in the House, he has to manage the 
public funds, a good part of which comes from Quebec 
taxpayers. As a Quebecer, I am entitled to expect governments 
to efficiently manage public funds and also to maximize their 
benefits and manage them in the best interests of the population.
<P>
	This is exactly what the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs is doing. He oversees the sound and responsible 
management of the public funds in the best interests of the 
Canadian population and also, needless to say, in the best 
interests of the people of Quebec. The minister told us this 
morning that he did everything he could. He helped Quebec as 
much as he could by providing advance funds. Basically what I 
would like to ask the member of the official opposition is this: 
From what I understand in the motion before the House, would 
he rather see the federal government act irresponsibly and 
foolishly and waste the taxpayers' money? I do not think that 
would be in the best interests of the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	When we look a little more closely at this motion tabled by the 
Bloc Quebecois, we find once again, and it could not be any 
clearer, that the members of this party are not defending the 
interests of the people of Quebec in general, but that they 
are-and I will have the opportunity to come back to this later 
today-putting forward their own agenda, which is the 
separation of Quebec.
<P>
	I believe that the situation or the problem is clear: we have a 
responsible government versus people whose aim is complete 
negligence. When we look at the situation, and I am a Quebecer, 
the answer is clear. It is obvious that I support the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs whose aim is, first and foremost, 
sound management of the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague for Outremont 
is probably dreaming. He said so himself. I think it is just 
wishful thinking. As for us, we are having a nightmare listening 
to such remarks from a member who comes from Quebec. I 
would ask him to go back to his riding and ask his constituents, 
who also pay taxes to the federal government, if they agree that 
these services should be paid for by the Quebec government 
alone.
<P>
	Can his constituents and mine say that they will give Ottawa 
$300 million less to pay this bill? The present system does not 
allow it. Therefore, it is Quebec which must pay and which 
comes up short. I find it sad that a member from Quebec would 
make such remarks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12785"> 12785 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is really acting in 
the public interest. I think he is acting in Ottawa's interest and 
that, as a member from Quebec, he is forgetting that, when the 
people of a province pay taxes to the federal government, they 
are entitled to certain services in return. That is what today's 
debate is all about.
<P>
	We claim, with good reason, that Quebec was willing to 
honour this gentlemen's agreement but that the federal 
government has not honoured it. It owes Quebec $300 million 
and it must pay its bills. That is what it must do in the public 
interest. It has been five years in one instance and eight years in 
the other that all audits have been completed. Now the time has 
come to pay, and we are asking the federal government to do so.
<P>
	<B>	Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, today's debate covers a broad range of federal government activities, and this interjection shows how desperately the Bloc Quebecois is trying to bolster support for the scenario rejected by a 
<P>
	The Bloc is obviously hoping to discredit the federal 
government, but to no avail, for we are seeing a boomerang 
effect here again today. In fact, this debate provides an 
opportunity to appreciate the extent of the federal government's 
prerogatives and responsibilities.
<P>
	One of these responsibilities is addressed through the fiscal 
stabilization program created under the federal-provincial 
fiscal arrangements and Federal Post-secondary Education and 
Health Contributions Act. The purpose of the stabilization 
program is to provide protection to provinces in the event of 
extreme downturns in economic activity.
<P>
	More specifically, provinces faced with a year-over-year 
decline in revenues due to a downturn in the economy, such as 
the last recession, have access to financial assistance, subject to 
specific rules set out in the act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The compensation authorized by the stabilization legislation 
is based on the province's year over year absolute decline in a 
province's eligible revenues subject to three constraints. First, 
changes made by the province in the rate or in the structure of its 
provincial taxes must be factored out when measuring revenue 
declines. The program compensates for revenue declines due to 
business cycles and not for declines due to provincial decisions 
to reduce taxes arbitrarily.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Second, declines in resource revenues are subject to 
stabilization only if and to the extent that the annual decline 
exceeds 50 per cent. Third, since 1987-1988 the maximum grant 
payable to a province is limited to $60 per provincial resident. 
Assistance above that limit is at the discretion of the Minister of 
Finance and would take the form of an interest free loan. The 
litmus test in  assessing eligibility to the stabilization program 
is whether there is or was a drop in revenues due to general 
economic conditions.
<P>
	The stabilization legislation and regulations provide very 
detailed rules about how to measure provincial revenues and 
how to adjust for changes in taxation. It is these very same rules 
that were applied consistently in dealing with all provincial 
applications as the act requires us so to do.
<P>
	Stabilization is a program for exceptionally hard times, which 
explains why only three provinces have received federal 
stabilization payments up to 1990. British Columbia received 
$174 million for the fiscal year 1982-83; Alberta, $419 million 
for fiscal year 1986-87; and Ontario received $227 million for 
1990-91.
<P>
	In order to be considered for stabilization payments, a 
province must make a claim to the federal Minister of Finance 
not later than 18 months after the end of the year to which the 
claim should be applied.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last December 7, the Minister of Finance, Paul Martin, 
announced payments totalling $782.4 million in response to 
applications from the provinces under the stabilization program, 
including $418 million for fiscal year 1991-92.
<P>
	These were final payments for 1991-92 in the case of seven 
applications, and interim payments for 1992-93 in the case of 
five applications.
<P>
	Despite all the insidious and unfounded insinuations of the 
Bloc Quebecois, these applications were processed according to 
the letter and the intent of the fiscal stabilization program 
legislation. All provinces were put on the same footing.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has implied that the federal government 
used delaying tactics in settling Quebec's claims.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member who moved the motion before the 
House today to ask his own leader about the meaning of the term 
``delaying'', since he is an expert on the subject.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With regard to the 1991-92 fiscal year, the Minister of 
Finance made final payments to five provinces: Newfoundland, 
$3.1 million; Nova Scotia, $55 million; Prince Edward Island, 
$5 million; Ontario, $284.4 million; and Manitoba, $42.9 
million.
<P>
	The claims made by two additional provinces, Saskatchewan 
and Quebec, were found not valid under this rule set out in the 
act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12786"> 12786 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Quebec's application for 1991-92 was not approved because 
there had been no decline in revenue due to the business cycle, 
which meant that according to the regulations, there could be no 
compensation. That is all.
<P>
	There was no question of unfair treatment, political intrigue 
or partisanship.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance also has the authority under the 
legislation to make interim payments to a province where 
applications are supported by currently available data.
<P>
	For instance, on December 7, 1994, the finance minister 
announced that interim payments be made to five provinces 
based on fiscal year 1992-93, which included $125 million for 
Quebec. In this case Quebec's application was valid, and the 
federal government paid.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I dare the Bloc Quebecois to make the same fuss about the 
payment made to the Government of Quebec for 1992-93 that it 
made to discredit the federal government concerning payments 
for the fiscal year 1991-92.
<P>
	In concluding, decisions by the Minister of Finance on all 
provincial applications for stabilization are made in accordance 
with the legislation and regulations. Furthermore, they treat all 
provinces in a manner that is consistent and fair. These decisions 
are final.
<P>
	The stabilization legislation does not provide for arbitration 
mechanisms. If Quebec wants to challenge the legality of the 
federal decision, it has one recourse: to appeal before the courts.
<P>
	Those who call this courtroom federalism do not know what 
they are talking about. This year, the Government of Canada will 
pay about $11.7 billion in federal transfer payments to the 
Province of Quebec. That is what I call constructive and positive 
federalism.
<P>
	I will vote against the motion of the Bloc Quebecois because it 
denies the facts and adds absolutely nothing constructive to this 
debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, we are speaking today on the opposition motion of the 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead regarding 
Quebec's financial demands. This should not be the greatest 
surprise we in the House have ever had when speaking to a Bloc 
supply motion on Quebec's financial demands, especially for 
those of us who come from Alberta, British Columbia or Ontario 
who have been well versed in Quebec's financial demands for 
quite some time.
<P>
	The motion we are debating is at the core of discussions 
concerning why the Bloc is in Parliament in the first place. It is a 
sad situation. The vast majority of Canadians look to Canada as 
a home and a federation of 10 provinces because we are 
Canadians. We do not boil the reasons for being Canadian down 
to the bottom line on a balance sheet asking what is in it for us.
<P>
	Many times when members of Parliament are debating in 
committee the Bloc Quebecois-in fairness it is doing exactly 
what it said it would do-is thinking solely about any policy or 
law as it directly relates to Quebec. The question for them is 
always how to protect what we have already while at the same 
time perhaps getting a little more, wanting complete 
independence but ensuring we get all the support we have had in 
the past and what we may want in the future.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	To be spending a day of debate in the House on this motion is 
not a major surprise. The Reform Party came to Parliament with 
basically one overriding priority, to put the financial affairs of 
the nation right. The overriding priority of many people who 
supported the Reform Party and I am sure the government and 
the Bloc as well was to get our financial affairs in order.
<P>
	That should still be the number one priority of Parliament. It 
must be the number one overriding priority of our colleagues 
from the Bloc.
<P>
	When I say financial affairs I mean everyone in Canada 
including in Quebec. Unless we get our financial affairs in order 
what will we be left with? What is the point of having an 
independent bankrupt Quebec? There is absolutely no point in it. 
The whole notion of splitting the country and expecting the 
haves to have the same critical mass and to be as successful as 
we are as a combined unit is crazy.
<P>
	There are areas which would benefit right off the bat, for 
instance those parts which have through equalization payments 
been pouring billions of dollars eastward, much of which found 
a home in Quebec for many years. We are not talking about 
sovereignty association, we are not talking about splitting up the 
marriage but retaining bedroom privileges. We are talking about 
a new house, a new street, the whole shebang. Would the people 
of Quebec think for one minute that equalization payments or 
transfer payments from the rest of the country would continue to 
flow into Quebec? Of course not.
<P>
	Conversely, all the benefits Quebec brings to the country 
would also be denied the rest of the country. That is how we 
would be hurt dramatically by this notion of our colleagues and 
friends from the Bloc who would want to take Quebec out of 
Canada.
<P>
	I have been talking about the financial implications because it 
is the gist of the Bloc's motion, the financial implications of 
Quebec in Canada. The bias of the motion, the bias of the Bloc is 
it wants to make darn sure it will get more out of it and not lose 
anything even if it splits.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12787"> 12787 </A></B>
<P>
	If we go beyond the bottom line on the balance sheet and talk 
about what will happen to the country if Quebec takes a hike, 
the costs will be far more than financial. It will cost us a tonne 
in terms of our own sense of self-worth. It will cost us 
dramatically in terms of what it means and what it is to be a 
Canadian, the culture we share together. That we have been able 
to nurture in an island the French fact in North America in a 
sea of almost 300 million people, that we have a vibrant, strong, 
successful, exciting Quebec and French culture here in our 
midst would be lost.
<P>
	A separate Quebec would find itself very quickly becoming 
far more worldly in its outlook and far more accommodating to 
speak the language of whomever would come in to spend money.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	Since I have been living part time in Ottawa I have, as often as 
possible, taken the occasion to vacation and spend weekends in 
Quebec, particularly in Montreal. I have come to cherish the 
time I spend there. A couple of weekends ago one of my sons 
visited from Vancouver. I am trying to persuade him to go to 
university in Montreal. I want him to have a sense of what our 
country is all about. Quebec and the French fact and the 
Quebecois are so vitally a part of our collectivity as a nation I 
feel if he did not partake in that he would be losing something in 
his life.
<P>
	He lives in Vancouver. We went to Montreal and he had some 
trepidation because although he has taken French in school for 
about nine years he cannot speak a word of French. If we do not 
use it we cannot learn it. He wondered how he would be received 
as an English speaking Canadian. He is 17 and he was a little 
nervous about it. Every experience he has had and I have had has 
been one of complete comfort. People bend over backwards to 
be accommodating, kind and generous.
<P>
	That weekend in Quebec turned his mind around. I wonder 
how many unilingual French speaking people in Quebec who 
have travelled to other parts of Canada have been treated with 
the same compassion, understanding, care and politeness. I 
wonder if we could get more people to look beyond the balance 
sheet of what it is to be a Canadian and to look at the value of 
what English Canada and Quebec bring to this united body.
<P>
	I ask Bloc members to consider what I have said as this great 
debate unfolds.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
federal government is about to invest $20 million in public 
funds to give Winnipeg a new arena, just to keep the Jets in 
Winnipeg. Unfortunately, Ottawa has never shown the slightest 
interest in getting involved to keep the Nordiques in Quebec 
City. Once again, the double standard rears its ugly head.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister use the Infrastructure Program to 
justify paying $20 million to the Winnipeg Jets, when according 
to our information, more than 90 per cent of that money has 
already been spent or committed, leaving only $6 million in the 
bank?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have an infrastructure program, and any decisions 
made under this program are made jointly by the municipalities 
involved and by the provincial government.
<P>
	When we introduced the first Infrastructure Program, the 
Quebec government and Quebec City decided to build a 
convention centre in Quebec City, and the federal government 
invested $26 million. At the time, people said they might need 
an arena. The mayor of Quebec City, as reported in the media 
this morning, said no, Quebec City's priority was a convention 
centre.
<P>
	In the case of Winnipeg and the Government of Manitoba, $15 
million had not been allocated, and they asked us to allocate 
them for the building an infrastructure in Winnipeg, an arena.
<P>
	There are several precedents in this respect. In Alberta, the 
government decided to invest $5 million in the arena in 
Edmonton and $4 million in the arena in Calgary, all federal 
money.
<P>
	We respect provincial jurisdictions. We make the money 
available to the various governments. A total of $15 million 
comes from the Infrastructure Program. As we all know, the 
Pan-American Games will be held in Winnipeg two years from 
now, and they need certain facilities, so they want to combine 
the facilities for the Pan-American Games with the possibility 
to build an arena. So if the city and the province want a new 
infrastructure, they can take the money that is there. There is no 
new money for this program. This is money allocated to 
Manitoba which had not yet been distributed.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the Prime Minister confirm that the $20 million Ottawa will give 
in direct assistance to the Winnipeg Jets is well in excess of what 
is available under the Infrastructure Program and will impinge, 
as he himself said, on the budget set aside for the Pan-American 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12792"> 12792 </A></B>
<P>
Games, although none of the disciplines at these games  will 
require a coliseum or an arena of the kind that is going to be 
built, and that the money will also come from the Western 
Economic Diversification Office headed by his minister, the 
member from Winnipeg?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just made it very clear that the $15 million comes out 
of the money allocated to the Province of Manitoba. The 
province decides, as was the case in Quebec and Ontario. 
Ontario built a brand new convention centre; it also built a new 
cultural centre in Mississauga; Vancouver used all the allocated 
money for a new water treatment system. All these decisions 
were made by the provincial governments.
<P>
	In the case of Manitoba, the province decided to use the 
money available to build a new infrastructure, a new arena, just 
like Edmonton and Calgary decided to invest substantial 
amounts in improving the arenas in Edmonton and Calgary.
<P>
	There is no double standard here. There is only one standard; 
this money comes out of the budget. We respect the preferences 
of the provincial governments. In the case of Quebec City, 
Mayor L'Allier made it clear that he was not interested in an 
arena. He wanted a convention centre, and they will get their 
convention centre.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, people 
remember how the Minister of Industry insisted on a business 
plan when the time came to invest money in MIL Davie in 
Quebec City. And how he insisted!
<P>
	Before the government-which is broke, in any case-invests 
more than $20 million in public funds in the Winnipeg Jets, 
could the Prime Minister tell us whether his government insisted 
that the Winnipeg Jets submit a business plan, to ensure this 
money is not wasted, and that the Jets provide guarantees that 
they will not leave within the next three years?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with the provincial government and the municipal 
government, we are investing in an infrastructure which is an 
arena. We are not investing any money in the hockey team, 
certainly not.
<P>
	The private sector in Winnipeg has decided to raise funds to 
buy the hockey team. We do not know whether they succeeded. 
In any case, the Premier of Manitoba and the mayor of Winnipeg 
decided that the money allocated for Winnipeg and for the 
Province of Manitoba would be used to build a new 
infrastructure, an arena.
<P>
	In Quebec City, they opted for a convention centre. In 
Vancouver, they decided to invest in a water treatment plant. We 
respect the priorities of the provincial governments, but we 
know that, if construction is going on, people are working, and 
that is money well spent. That is why we introduced this 
infrastructure program, which, by the way, has been a huge 
success in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if this money is not for the Winnipeg Jets but only for 
an arena, the Prime Minister will surely not tell us that it is for 
the free skating sessions on Saturday nights.
<P>
	The federal government has decided to provide a direct $20 
million subsidy for building this arena, for the sole purpose of 
allowing the city to keep the Jets franchise. This announcement 
came right after the Quebec Nordiques turned down the Quebec 
government's proposal.
<P>
	How does the minister explain the federal government's 
sudden eagerness to help the Winnipeg Jets, even taking money 
from outside the infrastructure budget, the day after the 
Nordiques' owners rejected the Quebec government's proposal, 
when Ottawa never expressed its intention to assist the 
Nordiques?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that, with respect to the Quebec government's 
proposal to the Nordiques, no one asked us to invest in an arena 
as we are doing in Winnipeg. Even back in January, the first 
project we approved was a convention centre for Quebec City, in 
which we invested $26 million and which led to accusations by 
the Reform Party that we acted too quickly for the benefit of 
Quebec City.
<P>
	Mayor L'Allier is reported in today's press as saying that 
Quebec City's priority is not an arena but a convention centre. 
And we respected the wish of Quebec City's separatist mayor. I 
wonder why the members of the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc 
Quebecois are against our respecting the wish of Quebec City's 
separatist mayor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, $5 million was taken from the Pan-American Games 
budget, even though Winnipeg maintained that it had all the 
facilities needed for these games. The situation seems to have 
changed overnight. The Prime Minister has just given us the 
reason: separatists. This always gets a rise out of the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	I would like the Prime Minister to admit frankly that the $20 
million aid package to the Jets had been planned for a while and 
that his government waited for the Nordiques' owners to reject 
the Quebec government's proposal to make a public 
announcement so that it would not have to provide the same kind 
of assistance to the Nordiques.

for land claim negotiations and aboriginal self-government at 
least for the province of British Columbia?
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not agree with the 
premise of the question. The issue of how much land, which is 
what we are talking about, will be provided to the First Nations 
is primarily a provincial responsibility since most of the 
available land is in the name of the provinces.
<P>
	The offer, or the leaked offer because I have not seen it, by the 
province of B.C. is a question of a quantum of land. When the 
aboriginal people of B.C. get the offer they will respond to it and 
we will respond to it. But right now we provide money, the 
provinces provide land and that is their provincial 
responsibility.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in its land claim negotiation paper the British 
Columbia government goes beyond land. It says that privately 
owned land will not be on the table. It says that aboriginal 
self-government will be restricted to municipal-like powers. It 
says that status Indians should lose provincial and federal tax 
exemptions once their land claims are settled.
<P>
	Does the minister agree with the positions being taken by the 
Government of British Columbia on these issues and if not, what 
is the federal position?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the issue of privately 
owned land, we have been consistent across this country to 
protect privately owned land and we try to compensate in those 
cases.
<P>
	On the issue of taxes I find it passing strange that a province 
would make an offer on what is clearly our jurisdiction. I have 
made it clear to the province that the matter of taxation has to be 
solved with the Minister of Finance, the Minister of National 
Revenue and Parliament at a national level.
<P>
	As far as the question of status is concerned, this is something 
we are always negotiating. The leader of the Reform Party must 
realize that status is very important to aboriginal people for very 
legitimate reasons.

	In an effort to reduce the debt of Canadian National, thus 
making it easier to privatize, the government is apparently about 
to buy this company's real estate assets, including the famous 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12794"> 12794 </A></B>
<P>
CN Tower in Toronto. These would be purchased at a price 
higher than their true market  value, to help CN bring its debt 
down from $2.5 billion to $1.5 billion.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Transport justify his government's 
decision to invest considerable public funds in buying real 
estate assets already paid for by Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's premise is completely wrong. It is 
not the government's intention to pay anything for the real estate 
assets of CN that will not be transferred at the time of the issue. 
We have said that with the Department of Finance we will 
negotiate an arrangement to give CN a credit for the market 
value of any residual real estate assets.
<P>
	The hon. member will know that the objective of the 
government is to try to put Canadian National railways out into 
the private sector in a condition that will allow it to operate in 
the same environment as Canadian Pacific. There will have to be 
some work done to reduce the $2.5 billion debt. I want to 
reassure my hon. friend that whatever the government does with 
respect to the sale of CN will be done in the very best interests of 
the Canadian taxpayers, both now and in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Minister of Transport confirm his 
government's intention not only to use public funds to buy 
assets already paid for by taxpayers, but also to buy these assets 
for more than their current market value?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated to the hon. member, but I understand he 
had his supplementary written down before he listened to the 
answer, there is no intention on the part of the government of 
giving any credit to CN that is in addition to any prior market 
value that would be identified.
<P>
	The sale of CN is a major undertaking. We understand the 
opposition has agreed to it in principle. We hope we can 
demonstrate that on a business basis this will be done in the best 
interests of the Canadian taxpayer. Any evaluation of assets, 
real estate or otherwise, will be done on the very best basis of 
business and ordinary commercial practice.

<P>
	The problems in Winnipeg and Quebec could be and should be

are risking their lives on unsafe roads?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

Speaker, the infrastructure program, as I think the Prime 
Minister has pointed out, is based on local needs and local 
priorities to create jobs, strengthen the infrastructure of our 
communities so that we can attract additional investment dollars 
and provide more jobs.

also provides facilities for hockey players. He has supported 
infrastructure projects in his province.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
arena in Barrie was never supported by this member of

Barrie, Edmonton or Winnipeg never were infrastructure, in any 
way.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry has stated in this House that this 
level of government will no longer continue to subsidize 
business. Yet his western counterpart, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, is attempting to bail out another local 
industry, the Winnipeg Jets.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister indicate what the policy of this 
government is? Is it the status quo pork barrelling of the western 
minister, or is it the let business thrive on its own policy of the

it?

looking at the Liberals across the floor, one would think we were 
at the Winnipeg arena.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Transport. The minister is 
about to privatize one of the most important federal crown 
corporations, without restricting foreign ownership. CN, which 
was established at a cost of billions of dollars in public moneys, 
is an invaluable asset for Canada and Quebec. Should it come 
under foreign control, it might not fully serve the interests of 
Canadians.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that, by overrating CN's assets, so as 
to increase the market value of the corporation, he is in fact 
using Canadian taxpayers' money to give foreign buyers an 
indirect subsidy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am truly moved by the hon. member, who is 
concerned about CN's future as a Canada-wide venture, from 
Halifax to Vancouver. At one point, I thought the member felt 
our government had decided not to restrict foreign investments, 
precisely to allow people like him, who want to achieve 
independence, to have an interest in that company.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond

<P>

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is true. Put that in your pipe and 
smoke it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> On another topic, and I hope to get an 
intelligent answer, will the minister agree that it is possible for a 
group of foreign businesses controlled by the same shareholder 
to buy a majority of CN's shares, thus making it impossible for 
the minister to ensure that CN remains under Canadian control?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the experience of Canadian Pacific which has been 
operating as a private shareholder driven company since the last 
century is such that there is no indication of any interest to the 
extent that we should be concerned about foreign ownership.
<P>
	What I am far more worried about and what the government is 
concerned about is in order to have a successful issue of this 
size, we are of a mind and of the advice we have received both 
domestically and internationally that the issue is just too big for 
Canadian investors to take up. We feel that protection for the  
future of CN is really far more important in the context of our 
restriction on 15 per cent ownership for any individual or 
corporation.
<P>
	The important thing here that everyone should keep in mind is 
this is going to be the single largest transaction of its kind in 
Canadian history. We are trading on a global basis. This railroad 
has to be competitive in the global economy. We think that 
restricting foreign ownership would not give the kind of signal 
that we believe is important, that is, that Canadians want to do 
business with everybody around the world. We are confident 
that as is the case with CP, CN will be retained in a majority way 
in Canadian hands.

my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has just told us that $15 million of the $20 
million promised for the Winnipeg Jets will come from the 
infrastructure program in Manitoba. Information in official 
Treasury Board documents, however, reveals something quite 
different.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister say, on January 24, that in book 3 
of the Treasury Board Estimates, only $6 million remained for 
the infrastructure program in Manitoba and talk today about $15 
million? Where did the extra $9 million come from?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as regards the allocations for Manitoba, certain 
projects were left undeveloped, and $12 million is available at 
the moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> So now it is $12 million. The figure is 
changing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Twelve million dollars is 
currently available, according to the President of Treasury 
Board. The Government of Manitoba decided to reallocate 
certain approved projects, cancel them and replace them to 
create an additional $3 million, bringing the total to $15 million.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, the remaining $5 million will come from the 
money allocated for the preparation of the infrastructures 
needed for the Pan American Games. This adds up to the $20 
million approved by the government. It has nothing to do with 
the hockey team. It is a matter of giving the City of Winnipeg 
and the Government of Manitoba their choice of priorities.
<P>
	It is as if Calgary, Edmonton or the hon. member's city chose 
to have arenas. This was the choice of the City of Winnipeg. The 
mayor of Quebec City decided clearly, with the first project 
approved, to put all the money available to Quebec City and the 
region around it into a convention centre, which was already 
well under way. This was the local officials' priority, and we 
accepted it with pleasure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in the light of these latest rapid changes, how can the Prime 
Minister agree to reallocating $5 million earmarked for the Pan 
American Games to finance the Winnipeg Jets?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, clearly when you are holding the Pan American Games, 
you have to have the necessary equipment. The City of 
Winnipeg and the government of the province decided to use this

<P>
	Call it what you might, $20 million is being generated to 
rescue the Winnipeg Jets. If the government is to proceed with 
the rescue package would it at least consider taking an equity

an arena which is really a black hole?

of Winnipeg wants to proceed with this project, it is quite 
eligible under the infrastructure works program.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before question period I was speaking generally about 
Quebec's financial demands not being a new topic for the House. 
In the year and half I have been here Quebec's financial demands 
have been front and centre every day.
<P>
	It seems odd the Bloc would raise this as an opposition motion 
in the knowledge that Quebec has done very well by being a 
member of our great country over many years. It seems passing 
strange that it would want to leave.
<P>
	It is also a tragedy that most members of the Bloc seem to 
think the relationship between Quebec and the rest of the 
country is primarily financial. To the vast majority of Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12800"> 12800 </A></B>
<P>
the relationship between Quebec and the rest of the country is 
far more than a financial  arrangement; it is spiritual, a 
relationship among friends, brothers, relatives and family.
<P>
	I recently introduced my son to Quebec and invited the people 
of Quebec and in particular members of the Bloc to venture west 
and east to see for themselves that Canadians are welcome in all 
parts of the country. Quebecers are welcome in the rest of 
Canada and the rest of Canada in Quebec.
<P>
	Whether members of the House liked former President 
Reagan or not, they will appreciate that President Reagan was 
widely renowned for his masterful use of the media and his 
ability to express thoughts and put complicated thoughts into 
every day simple language. He was a master manipulator of the 
media. People have to admit that.
<P>
	It was passing strange that he had a portrait of Calvin 
Coolidge in the cabinet room. Calvin Coolidge was regarded as 
the president who had perhaps a most acerbic wit. He would 
never say in three words what could be said in one word and was 
generally regarded as a man of very few words.
<P>
	President Reagan had a portrait of Calvin Coolidge in the 
cabinet room because of Coolidge's ability to put very pithy 
comments in very few words. I will deal specifically with what 
Calvin Coolidge had to say about people, about responsibilities 
and how we relate together as a society and what the role of 
government is.
<P>
	Calvin Coolidge said: ``The people cannot look to legislation 
generally for success; industry, thrift, character are not 
conferred by act or resolve. Government cannot relieve from 
toil. It can provide no substitute for the rewards of service. It 
can, of course, care for those who need care and recognize 
distinguished merit. The normal must care for themselves. 
Self-government means self-support''.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	If we were to extend that the country would benefit greatly if 
we would start to think in terms of self-reliance and 
self-support. All provinces, all regions, rather than looking to 
the federal government and asking what is in it for them should 
be asking what they can give to the common good of the country 
after they have looked after their own responsibilities.
<P>
	Unless we are first able to look after ourselves how can we 
presume to look after our neighbours? If we cannot first look 
after our own province how can we presume to look after other 
provinces? We need to be self-sufficient as individuals, we need 
to be self-sufficient as communities, we need to be 
self-sufficient as provinces. This will inevitably lead to 
self-sufficiency as a nation and to the further strengthening of 
the nation into the future; in my fondest dreams, desires and 
wishes, a nation united, with Quebec very much a part of the 
greater Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this morning, I listened to the beginning of the debate 
which opened with the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead who, as usual, made a very 
good and very interesting speech. But it had nothing to do with 
the motion before the House, it was a speech on separatism.
<P>
	For his part, as always, the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest made a very interesting and good speech. For the 
Reform Party, it was an excellent speech. He said he had a 
problem with the motion presented this morning by the hon. 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, which reads as 
follows: That this House deplore the federal government's delay 
in responding to Quebec's demands, with regard to certain 
matters.
<P>
	Does the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest agree with 
me that the only reason for the motion is not to complain about 
the delay, but to promote separatism and create 
misunderstanding between Quebec voters and voters in the rest 
of Canada? This is what is intended by the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead and his Bloc colleagues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for the question. I agree the underlying thought behind the 
motion is an opportunity to advance the cause of separatism in 
the House.
<P>
	It must be extremely frustrating for members of the Bloc to 
have come to the House resolved to work faithfully to taking 
themselves out of the House. The more time they spend here, the 
more at home and comfortable they feel. The more time the Bloc 
spends here, the more time the members representing the people 
of Canada in Quebec spend here, the more it is indicative the 
country is very welcoming to everyone.
<P>
	I have a great deal of empathy toward the members of the 
Bloc. Members of the Reform Party came here under much the 
same cloud as members of the Bloc. We were expected by 
members of the central Canadian media, by the people of central 
Canada, to be some sort of monolithic neolists with our knuckles 
dragging on the ground.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Members of the Bloc and members of the Reform Party were 
supposed to be fighting in the lobby. Much to everybody's 
surprise they found out that we probably have far more that 
unites us than separates us. The members of the Bloc came here 
and got involved in what they did out of frustration with the way 
the country is run. They felt left out of the affairs of the nation 
and the fact that nothing ever changed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12801"> 12801 </A></B>
<P>
	That is precisely the reason I am here today as well. As we 
have been here for the last year and a half we have come to 
know more about each other. We are going to be able to ask 
the big question that is going to come, that is going to be asked 
in Quebec.
<P>
	It is my wish, desire, hope and feeling that no matter how the 
question is posed in Quebec, its people will decide to remain 
with Canada. Those of us in the House will put it behind us. That 
is my desire, my wish and everything I do will be to that end.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am always 
surprised to hear the Reform Party or the Liberal Party treat us 
as if we were beggars, as if we are asking for some kind of 
charity.
<P>
	We are not begging for anything, far from it. We are only 
asking the federal government for what is rightfully ours, our 
part of the pie, the part that we sent to Ottawa. Through our 
taxes, we send enormous amounts of money to Ottawa. All we 
want is our due. Furthermore, we want the federal government to 
meet its commitments.
<P>
	The federal government does not keep its promises. A good 
example of that is the health care system. When we introduced 
the health care system in Quebec, the federal government 
wanted to meddle in, so they said: ``We want to impose our 
standards''. In order for Quebec to accept that, they added: ``We 
will pay 50 per cent of all the health care costs in Quebec''.
<P>
	Now the federal government pays only 30 per cent of the costs 
and we have to pay the remaining 70 per cent. It must be made 
clear that all the standards and structures were implemented on 
the grounds that the federal government would pay 50 per cent 
of the costs, not 30 per cent as it does now. Can you imagine 
what kind of management nightmare this creates for Quebec?
<P>
	All we ask is that the federal government accept its own 
responsibilities. We are not begging, we are not asking for gifts, 
far from it. We are just saying to the federal level: ``At least give 
us back the money we send to you''. We are only asking for 
justice. All we ask is that the federal government carries out its 
promises.
<P>
	This is why we have been saying for many years now: ``Since 
you will not fulfil your commitments, we will levy all our own 
taxes and we will send you whatever we see fit''. That is their 
attitude towards us, and that is why we want sovereignty. We do 
not want to be beggars, we want the federal government to keep 
its promises and it does not.
<P>
	That is what I wanted to convey to the Reform Party member. 
He seems to know little about history. He is trying to convince 
the Canadians that Quebecers are beggars. We are not beggars. 
We only want what is rightfully ours, and we want respect.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I left the impression with 
the hon. member that I thought the people of Quebec and the 
Bloc were here as beggars that certainly was not my intention. I 
do not think that is the case at all.
<P>
	Bloc members are hard bargainers. The people of Quebec 
have been very skilful in using their balance of power and their 
electoral might for many years in extracting far more than their 
just rewards from their association with Canada.
<P>
	The people of Quebec have done very handsomely by their 
association with Canada. The member speaks of the 50:50 cost 
sharing in health care. Let us talk about Canada assistance. The 
province of Quebec gets 70 cents of every dollar spent on 
welfare. Ontario gets 50 cents and Alberta and B.C. get 50 cents.
<P>
	How is it that the province of Quebec is considered a have not 
province when it does not factor in its great and magnificent 
resource of hydroelectric power? The petrochemical resources 
of Alberta are factored in. Last year the province of Quebec 
received $3.5 billion in equalization payments. Alberta has 
contributed in the last 40 years something in the area of $100 
billion toward equalization payments. Quebec has benefited by 
about that amount.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, for any member of the Bloc or any other member 
from Quebec or anywhere else to stand and say that Quebec has 
done poorly by its association with the rest of Canada is just 
denying reality.
<P>
	If Quebec were to decide, in its wisdom, to leave the 
federation, it would be hurt dramatically because every nickel 
that has been going to Quebec to subsidize and protect Quebec 
industry or in direct cash transfers would come to a crashing 
halt. The people of Quebec have to understand that. They have to 
be looked square in the eye and told that if they decide to leave 
this country we are going to leave our cheque book right here at 
home locked safely in the drawer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the motion before us today 
refers to three issues between the government of Canada and the 
government of Quebec. Indeed, the Quebec minister responsible 
for Canadian intergovernmental affairs raised them earlier this 
week with my hon. colleague, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs in Ottawa.
<P>
	This motion suggests that the government of Canada is using 
delaying tactics in its relationship with the Quebec government. 
That is not the case. In fact, what is going on here is totally 
appropriate. It is a normal and constructive process of 
relationship between two levels of government. And the Quebec 
case is no different from any other.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12802"> 12802 </A></B>
<P>
	Since he became Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 18 
months ago, my colleague has met with his provincial 
counterparts more than 20 times. Eighteen months in 
government, more than 20 meetings. He met with his 
counterparts in Western Canada, in the territories, in the 
Atlantic area, in Ontario and in Quebec.
<P>
	At these meetings, it is perfectly normal for provincial 
ministers to raise issues with the government of Canada that 
need to be solved. As usual, the government of Canada examines 
them and, with the co-operation of the province concerned, 
takes steps to find solutions agreeable to both parties.
<P>
	Also, the government of Canada sometimes identifies issues 
that it considers important. It then consults with the provincial 
governments and, together, they agree on measures, once again 
to reach fair and equitable agreements.
<P>
	This process is not peculiar to the Department of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. In the Canadian federation, this 
approach is successful because all first ministers, ministers and 
officials work closely together to achieve concrete and practical 
results.
<P>
	Our pragmatic federalism is based on a series of mechanisms 
and intergovernmental meetings that allow our governments to 
consult regularly and to solve their problems. These 
mechanisms come under various forms: we have first ministers' 
conferences, ministers' conferences, interprovincial meetings 
as well as a lot of meetings at the level of the deputy ministers. 
That is what makes our federation flexible.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	These various mechanisms and our flexible federation, as 
well as the co-operation we were able to get from the provinces 
and the territories, led to the following achievements. We were 
able to sign agreements with all the provinces under the 
infrastructure program; to reach an agreement to reduce 
interprovincial barriers to trade and free movement of 
individuals so as to reinforce our economic union; to sign action 
plans with eight provinces and two territories to reduce 
duplication and overlap; and to create Team Canada, led by the 
Prime Minister of Canada, to strengthen our position on 
promising new markets.
<P>
	The object of the national infrastructure program was to 
promote economic recovery by creating short term and long 
term jobs through local investments, while meeting the obvious 
need to renew and improve local infrastructures throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	Under this flexible program, municipalities, provinces and 
territories can take into account their own priorities. The 
completed projects for the most part have met the priorities set 
by the local authorities, in accordance with the national and 
provincial objectives and criteria and pursuant to the 
federal-provincial agreements underlying the program.
<P>
	The Agreement on Internal Trade provides for concrete 
changes, implementation schedules and a complete process that 
will help Canada become a real economic union characterized 
by freer movement of people, capital, goods and services.
<P>
	With the agreement on the reduction of duplication and 
overlap, we are seeking to rationalize operations in areas 
ranging from environment to small business support to tax 
collection. The final result will be a streamlined government, 
less regulation and bureaucracy and more efficient services 
delivered directly and at a lower cost.
<P>
	As for Team Canada's mission, it is an excellent example of 
what modern federalism can accomplish. It showed us that we 
can co-operate very effectively as a country to create jobs here 
and open up new horizons for all Canadians. Team Canada had 
quite an impact in the countries that we visited.
<P>
	Everybody was impressed by the co-operation between the 
private and public sectors and by the way the various levels of 
government work together in the national interest.
<P>
	These results are proof of our commitment to create jobs and 
to stimulate economic growth in our country, to build together a 
federation capable of facing international competition. That is 
what a good government is all about.
<P>
	But such results are possible only if governments negotiate 
openly and in good faith. However, that does not mean that 
federalism excludes any dispute. We know that.
<P>
	In Canada, we must continually find a balance between 
regional, provincial, cultural and language interests on one hand 
and national interests on the other hand in what we can call a 
state of constructive tension. I say it is constructive because it 
forces the parties to try and meet local needs while taking 
national priorities into account.
<P>
	The government of Canada does not favour any region or any 
sector of our society to the detriment of another. If a region is 
hard hit by desertification, by a crisis in the fishing industry, by 
difficult economic conditions or whatever, the federation can 
come to the rescue thanks to our collective resources.
<P>
	The name of the game is interdependence, and federalism 
makes the necessary compromises between the various groups 
and regions.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	As Alain Gagnon, a political science expert at McGill 
University, noted, federalism is considered to be the expression 
of democratic practices favourable to innovative policies and 
political choices at the territorial level. As Canada faces the 
future, it enjoys the clear advantage of being a federation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12803"> 12803 </A></B>
<P>
	We know that both Quebecers and other Canadians fervently 
hope that their governments will work to resolve the pressing 
problems facing us. The time has come to turn the page and 
set aside our political differences so that we can invest all our 
energy in a common cause: to build a strong and united country 
for the present and future generations.
<P>
	It is in this spirit that the Canadian government is negotiating 
with the Government of Quebec. We would like our opposition 
colleagues to understand that the Canadian government cares 
about Quebecers' interests as much as the Quebec government 
does. With regard to the three items included in the motion 
tabled by the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, the Canadian government has 
acted in good faith. In every case, the process used was proper 
and consistent with normal intergovernmental relations within a 
federation such as ours.
<P>
	I will certainly vote against the motion being debated today, 
because it goes against the principles underlying good 
federal-provincial relations in Canada. I know that every day 
since the 1993 election, every time they ask a question during 
Question Period, every time they make a speech in the House or 
ask a question during debate, my colleagues always come back 
to the issue of separation.
<P>
	Yet, after listening to Bloc members for 18 months, 
Quebecers have not changed their minds. Quite the contrary. If 
we do an analysis over a given period, we see that Quebecers 
have realized that they are better off staying in the Canadian 
federation. Earlier, the hon. member for Longueuil asked his 
Reform colleague a question about health care. He spoke about 
the various original commitments and what we are now paying.
<P>
	I am sure that the hon. member did not do it on purpose, but he 
failed to mention that how much the federal government 
invested in previous agreements, which were always negotiated 
with and agreed to by the various provincial governments, is not 
the only reference point. The federal government transferred to 
the provinces, in exchange for that money, a portion of the tax 
points it used to collect. Thus our responsibility has not 
changed.
<P>
	He is forgetting that, when this federation was born in 1867, 
the federal authority was responsible for 60 per cent of taxes. 
Yet today, it is the opposite. This federal system is constantly 
changing to fit the circumstances. Indeed, every country of the 
world recognizes that the federal system is one of the most 
flexible government systems ever to be devised and 
experimented. In fact, Europe has been trying to imitate it since 
1950 but is still far from having achieved anything like what we 
have. Of course there is room for improvement, but this is no 
reason to want to destroy the system and throw it away.
<P>
	I think that the past can vouch for it: thing always improve and 
will continue to improve. I am convinced that, try as they may, 
day after day, every chance they get in this House to convince 
the people of Quebec that Canada does not work, my hon. 
colleagues from the official opposition will fail and the people 
of Quebec will remain in Canada because this country belongs to 
them and that is a fact. That is one thing that my hon. colleague 
and I agree on. Canada belongs to the people of Quebec, the 
same way that Quebec belongs to Canada. We built this country 
together. It should not be destroyed and we will do our best to 
prevent its destruction.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	We hear people say that things are bad, that the federal 
government is not paying its bills and is acting in bad faith. We 
are talking about matters between two governments. Even in the 
private sector, there are explanations to be given, questions to be 
answered, before payment is made, and that is normal.
<P>
	In fact, as my colleague, the minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs mentioned this morning, in one case, we made partial 
payment and then said: ``Look, there is a problem here. We will 
refer the matter to the auditor general. He will check into it and 
report to us. We will do as he recommends''. We are still 
waiting. We hope to receive his report in the near future and we 
will abide by his decision.
<P>
	We have already paid $450 million for education in northern 
Quebec. We have nothing more to pay, but because the Quebec 
government wants more, we would like to know why it cost so 
much. No answer.
<P>
	This kind of interaction is normal. Instead of making an effort 
to discuss and find a way of creating jobs together, we gather 
here for an opposition day. And the opposition comes and tells 
us how we can go on wrangling and tearing one another apart to 
show Quebecers and drive in their heads that this system just is 
not working, that we do not pay our bills and so on. As the hon. 
member for Longueuil said: ``The only option we have left is to 
separate''. Not so, Mr. Speaker. I suggest that, with 128 years of 
experience, this system is a model for the whole world.
<P>
	There are thousands and thousands of people in the world who 
would give anything to become Canadian citizens, to come and 
live in this country, in spite of this so-called hardship our 
colleagues opposite are taking about. This is a valid experience. 
Our country is regarded as a model around the world and will 
remain a model because the people of Quebec and Canada have 
faith in this system that we built together and will maintain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just heard 
a carefully prepared speech, and indeed a very eloquent speech, 
from the hon. member, who said that Canada is the envy of the

debt is close to $600 billion, our situation is like that of some 
60 developing countries, and we are on the edge of the abyss, 
but we keep saying: Yes, it is a great country. Rather, it was 
a great country, but this is no longer the case, it is on the point 
of collapse. Why? Because the federal government insists on 
directing everything from the top, on centralizing all 
responsibilities in Ottawa.
<P>
	We are well aware that duplications cost between $2 billion to 
$3 billion. And that is not all, however. Just take, for example, 
our government's fascination with spending. It spent so much 
money, from the 1970s until 1989, that inflation was the result. 
The rate of inflation was jumping by 10 or 12 per cent per year. I 
recall that vividly.
<P>
	What actions did the government take, even if it was 
responsible for that inflation? In the 1980s, it had to raise 
interest rates up to 21 per cent, which killed the economy and 
created a terrible recession. A great number of small and 
medium-sized firms in Quebec went bankrupt. That is very sad.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Some lost their jobs and experienced a lot of problems. I know 
many business people who worked very hard and who still went 
bankrupt in 1981-82. Why? Because the federal government 
itself generated that inflation. It increased interest rates to such 
a level that they killed the economy.
<P>
	The federal government was the cause of that inflation and it 
was also responsible for the recession. All that happened 
because of its spending power. The federal government 
generated the inflationary spiral because it was intent on 
showing that it was indispensable, that it was giving money in 
every sector, including economic development and tourism.
<P>
	The same thing happened between 1984 and 1990. Again, the 
government was responsible for the inflation. It also brought on 
the recession in 1990. From 1990 to 1994, it increased interest 
rates and triggered a recession. Once again, a lot of Quebec 
entrepreneurs and small businesses suffered. Some of them 
work 15 hours a day to build their businesses. So, the federal 
government is the cause of the recession and all these problems.
<P>
	This is why we want some stability. Stability does not mean 
that the federal government must control everything and spend 
the way it does to prove it is indispensable.
<P>
	The problem with our current debt of 500 to 600 billion 
dollars is that people are no longer interested in investing in our 
country. They no longer want to invest because interest rates 
fluctuate by 10 per cent every decade, while the value of the 
dollar can be anywhere from 70 to 90 cents. How can an investor 
who wants to export in the U.S. be interested in settling here, 
when interest rates vary by 10 per cent over a five or six year  
period, and when the unemployment rate fluctuates between 10 
and 20 per cent?
<P>
	There are pulp and paper companies which do well and then, 
all of a sudden, they go belly up. Why? Because the value of our 
dollar fluctuates. And why does it fluctuate? Because the federal 
government does not know how to manage. Because it spends 
too much in the hope of proving, to Quebecers in particular, that 
it is indispensable.
<P>
	These are the reasons why we have decided to take control of 
our destiny. We do not want to fall in the same deep hole as this 
federation, which does not understand the need to decentralize, 
so as to improve our efficiency and ensure our success. Indeed, 
we want to become sovereign because we do not want to fall in 
the same deep hole of federation.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Léonard made very interesting 
comments. He had a nice speech prepared in advance by his 
friends. In fact, the Prime Minister himself probably told him 
what to say. I am convinced that the hon. member does not 
believe what he said, because he is an accountant. He 
understands my point very well, and I am convinced that he 
agrees with what I said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Longueuil. His remarks bear out what I was saying. 
He said that the federal government is to blame for everything.
<P>
	Is it the federal government's fault if Canada, in the 1980s, in 
spite of all its problems-like high inflation and interest 
rates-became a member of the G-7, a member of the seven 
most developed countries? Is it the federal government's fault 
if, for two consecutive years, the Organization of American 
States has said that Canada is the best country in the world to 
live in? Is it the federal government's fault if people do not want 
to invest money? Does the fault for Canada's political instability 
lie only with the federal government? We have been hearing 
about separation for 30 years. Is the federal government to 
blame for that?
<P>
	Last year, we had the highest economic growth among 
developed countries. Is that a sign of bankruptcy? Is the member 
completely cut off from the global environment and completely 
oblivious to what is happening in other countries? Does he ever 
make comparisons? Statistics and international reports the 
world over clearly indicate that we are a very good country. But 
we do have a political instability problem, precisely because of 
their ideas.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	As soon as they muster enough courage, instead of making 
policy shifts often enough to make heads spin, they should put 
the question clearly and squarely as to whether Quebecers feel 
like separating. Then, we could truly get rid of the millstone we 
have round our neck because of the separatists and, of course, 
still improve our situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12805"> 12805 </A></B>
<P>
	When the hon. member says that Canada is bankrupt, he is 
not aware of all the prestigious positions we hold in the 
international community at all levels.
<P>
	I would ask my hon. colleague to take that into consideration. 
I know he came here at the same time as I did, almost 11 years 
ago. Since he has had the chance to travel to most corners of the 
world, if he tried to remember the countries he visited and what 
he heard in his parliamentary travels, he would surely agree with 
me.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is barely two 
minutes left for questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, after listening to the last few comments of the hon. 
member, I cannot resist asking a question.
<P>
	When we travel abroad, we are frequently asked why 
Quebecers, with all their potential, have not yet decided to 
withdraw from the Canadian federation to be more independent 
like they are in Denmark, Norway, or Sweden. People in those 
countries control their own development, they know they pay 
taxes to only one government, and they can easily understand 
the reasons why they elect representatives.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that, just like members opposite, 
we have been elected by Quebecers. When we are told that we 
have not accomplished anything, I have to remind the hon. 
members that, in a period of two years, the Bloc was elected, 
which was an obvious sign that something is wrong with the 
Canadian federation, and a sovereignist government was elected 
in Quebec. If the federal Parliament cannot grasp that message 
sent by Quebecers, it must be because it is beyond reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, like the hon. member just said, I 
am proud to be a Quebecer, because Quebec is a modern society 
with a wealth of resources, and a society that is well recognized 
throughout the world.
<P>
	Since Quebec has been able to develop and come of age inside 
the Canadian federation, why should it sever its links with 
Canada? If it remains a part of Canada, as I am sure it will, 
Quebec will be able to go on with its development and have all 
its many talents recognized. If everything is so fine, why bring 
to a halt such a valuable experience, which is the envy of the 
world and which everybody would like to share in?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, even the hon. members opposite give good 
reasons why Quebec should remain a part of Canada. If the hon. 
member could ask the question, I am sure the answer would be 
that Quebec will indeed remain part of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to what my hon. colleague for Saint-Léonard, in 
eastern Montreal, had to say and I am always flabbergasted to 
hear him speak as if he built this country and almost as if he were 
the father of our vast and beautiful country.
<P>
	Earlier, we realized that it is almost pointless for us to make 
the demands mentioned in the motion before the House. The 
partisan determination shown by our colleagues opposite 
indicated early on that our efforts would be useless, that their 
minds were made up and that, even if we argued all night, it 
would not do us any good.
<P>
	Since I have nothing better to do then, I will try to disprove the 
nonsense uttered by the hon. member for Saint-Léonard. I want 
to give him a brief lesson in history. It would not hurt the hon. 
member for Edmonton Southwest to listen, since his knowledge 
of the history of Canada also seems kind of lacking.
<P>
	Towards the end of the last century, while 2 million 
Quebecers, about to starve to death, were forced to leave their 
country to go to work in the New England cotton mills, the 
Canadian government sent for Eastern Europeans to settle in 
western Canada. It gave them land, work animals, horses, 
chickens, the right to cut timber to build their houses and a lot of 
other things, and 50 per cent of these expenses were paid for by 
the people of Canada, half of which then was paid by Quebec. 
That is what they called profitable federalism. It remained a 
profitable enterprise for a long time, but it had been even more 
profitable in 1840, when the Union Act was signed. At that time, 
Quebec formed the majority within that famous union.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Our ancestors, not very well educated individuals who had 
been pretty badly treated less than 100 years before by the 
invaders who had come to strip them of everything they had, 
used the old sock. They stashed away their savings, they did not 
get into debt. The villages were not in debt. Quebec was not in 
debt at the time. But Ontario, which was a hive of activity, had to 
borrow large amounts of money in order to build infrastructures 
for its towns. All the lines were blurred. The two debts were not 
kept separate, with the result that the people of Quebec had to 
pay over half the debt of Ontario, to the exclusive benefit of the 
latter. This is yet another example the so-called profitable 
federalism, as the Liberals see it.
<P>
	I would say to the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine that the Gaspé Peninsula, 
where I was born, lost most of its inhabitants at that time. The 
member must have, like me, one or perhaps many ancestors who 
were forced to leave for the United States because they could not 
make a living in this so-called great country. So I find it hard to 
listen to people who have been here for something like 20 years 
say that they helped build this country. I am willing, of course, 
to acknowledge their qualities, their contributions, but many of 
them profited a lot more from Canada than our ancestors did 250 
and 300 years ago.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12806"> 12806 </A></B>
<P>
	And it boils down to the fact that we have rights in this 
country and that we want them to be respected, that is all.
<P>
	A lot has gone on here. A member of the Reform Party just 
told me that, after 18 months, he has discovered that we are 
alike. Frankly, I find that almost insulting. I resent it. Reform 
members are in favour of the death penalty, ``Hang them quick 
and do not waste too much rope, and then next, please''. That is 
the philosophy of the Reform Party. Fill up our prisons with 
whoever had the nerve to insult someone else. That is the 
right-wing policy of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I even heard a Reform member say in this House: ``My 
children are not educated, I forbid them to get an education. It is 
my belief and I adhere to it''. But if Canada needs an 
ambassador, that member is frustrated that the government will 
not give the job to his son whom he refused to send to school. 
That is the Reform philosophy. It seems to be quite popular in 
that region because there are quite a few of them in this House. It 
is something that I heard here.
<P>
	Anyway, Quebec is asking the federal government today for a 
certain sum of money for the natives in the James Bay area. It is 
time for the federal government to show off, as it has always 
done. When it came to paying $279 million to give a school 
board to a particular ethnic group in western Canada in order to 
show the greatness of Canada and of multiculturalism, it did not 
cut corners. It came up with the money. And when members of 
the same ethnic group in Toronto asked the government to give 
them the same thing it had given their friends in Vancouver, it 
obliged. It did not matter if the cost was $250 or $300 million, 
the government found the money. Quebecers did not complain in 
those days. On the contrary, 74 out of this gang of 75 chose to 
vote for those expenditures, in order to buy peace I guess.
<P>
	One thing leading to another, we ended up with a $550 billion 
debt. I wonder if Canada will not follow in the footsteps of Dow 
Corning, the breast implant manufacturer, and file under our 
Bankruptcy Act pretty soon. We are asking to be paid for the 
services we have delivered to native people for which the federal 
government is legally responsible. We gave them the same 
education we gave young Quebecers who lived in the area. I 
suppose it was a good education.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Now the time has come to pay the bill but the federal 
government is shirking its responsibilities. It is a bit like the guy 
who goes to eat in a restaurant, pretends he is going to the 
washroom after he finishes his meal, exits through the back door 
and avoids the bill. That is what the government is doing right 
now, or it looks like it.
<P>
	Why not face up to a situation that exists and that deserves to 
be dealt with, not because it concerns Quebec but because it is a 
matter of justice. There was an agreement. The Minister of 
Interdepartmental Affairs wants to refer this issue to 
committees and to  government officials, all that for a total 
claim of $333 million. Yet, it took the government only 20 
minutes to free up $20 million for the Winnipeg arena. Things 
did not drag on in this case.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not for the Jets. For the arena.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> For the Winnipeg Power Jets.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The jet set.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Yes. The Power jet set. In this case, they found $20 
million just like that. So, it is not so difficult to find $20 million. 
But when ask for five, six, even seven years to resolve the 
problem in Quebec, to settle Quebec's legitimate claims, they 
politely refer us to their civil servants. Even a Jesuit-and God 
knows that Jesuits are supposed to know everything-would 
lose his way in this complex maze of negotiations.
<P>
	I listened to the member for Saint-Léonard who praised this 
great country where civic rights and freedoms are recognized 
and respected. I will merely remind him of the 1970 War 
Measures Act, the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, the 
spying on political parties which was thought to have ceased in 
1970, although it was recently discovered that members of the 
Reform Party are still being spied on, and the same probably 
goes for us as well.
<P>
	These are the freedoms referred to by the member for 
Saint-Léonard. Some also spoke of transparency. I nearly 
choked. Transparency! As if the Pearson deal was transparent. A 
man named Nixon-we were not the ones who chose 
him-studied the famous Pearson deal. His conclusions were 
that there was something fishy. He recommended to the Prime 
Minister that an inquiry be conducted in this matter.
<P>
	I remember the Minister of Transport answering my questions 
in this Chamber, saying: ``Come on! Let us move forward. We 
do know that some individuals tried to take advantage of it''. He 
could not deny it, the Nixon report said so, but he was saying: 
``Let us move forward, and quickly. Let us settle this whole 
matter. It will cost a maximum of $25 million''.
<P>
	We can see how high the stack of bills is now. It is estimated 
that claims of all kinds for breach of contract will total $450 
million, and there are more to come. And yet, we demanded, we 
asked for a royal commission to get to the bottom of this. But no, 
it was urgent to proceed quickly and settle the whole thing, 
regardless of the cost. What openness! Examples of this kind of 
openness are legion. The heritage minister was not being very 
open while lunching in a room next to the one where the fate of 
the Canadian film industry was probably being decided.
<P>
	Once again, he lacked openness. This is another example of 
openness. For the first time, a CRTC decision is being reviewed, 
at the request of the cabinet; by a strange coincidence, which, I 
know, has a hand in a lot of things, it involves close relatives of 
the Prime Minister, who stand to gain a lot. This is happening in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12807"> 12807 </A></B>
<P>
this great  country which is so dear to the member for 
Saint-Léonard as are the underlying principles of federalism he 
described.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	I could perhaps talk about the underlying principles of 
federalism. They are nothing to write home about. Such noble 
principles.
<P>
	I remember reading, not too long ago, that when we joined 
this country in 1867, about 50 per cent of the population was 
French speaking in all four provinces and 50 per cent, English 
speaking. At the time, we paid 300,000 pounds sterling to buy 
the Northwest Territories, Rupert's Land, which today is 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta up to the Rockies. We 
bought that from the Hudson's Bay Company for 300,000 
pounds sterling at the time. Do not ask me how much it would be 
today, probably as much as the national debt.
<P>
	It remains that 50 per cent of the people who paid for that were 
Quebecers, and they gave it away, for nothing, to those who 
developed western Canada. Now they are telling us that we are 
crybabies, that we are constantly asking for things we have no 
right to. No matter what the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine might think, we paid for 
western Canada.
<P>
	If he wants to make some gifts, he should pay for them with 
his own money, not with other people's money.
<P>
	He said that people would give everything to live in this 
country of ours. Yet, after the Minister of Immigration 
announced he would be charging $900 to those who apply for 
immigrant status, there was an uproar. People do not want to pay 
even that much to come here. They think it is starting to be a bit 
pricey. When making speeches we sometimes say things which 
are far removed from reality. He almost said, at the end of his 
speech, that we were pretty lucky to be part of the G-7. For us, 
being part of the G-7 is as bad as being part of the Winnipeg Jets.
<P>
	Ross Perot said, in the United States, that we were beggars on 
horse back, that we had no business being in the G-7, given our 
structure, our wealth, our economic activity; that the only 
reason we were there is because the Americans needed our vote 
to support them, to support their proposals. It is for that reason 
that they put pressure on to get us in the game. However, we are 
part of the G-7. When we compare ourselves to the other 
member countries, we always come out seventh. Ross Perot said 
that we are there because of their goodwill.
<P>
	Some people lack the judgment to realize that it was, indeed, a 
matter of charity. They see that as an honour. He said, as if he 
were the one who created it, that Canada was beautiful. I like to 
think that Canada was created by the Creator, not by the Liberal 
Party of Canada.
<P>
	I could say that Liberals made much more nasty things than 
good ones. They should not try to take credit for the great 
accomplishments of the Creator.
<P>
	That being said, I think that Quebec's claims are justified, that 
Quebec must go ahead with them and that all of us, in this 
House, will always insit that what is Caesar's be rendered unto 
Caesar. The money coming from Canadian and Quebec 
taxpayers ends up in the federal treasury. Thirty seven cents out 
of every dollar go to service the debt.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> For the interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Only the interests on the debt. So, there is not 
much coming back under various forms. But that is not a 
problem. When there is not enough to pay back, the government 
borrows some. That still works. But the next year, there is more 
money going towards the payment of interests on the debt, for 
instance. And the government travels around the world, 
especially in the G-7 bus, and it says: It is going well in Canada, 
everything is fine.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	If it is going so well, why not respect its people? The natives 
in the James Bay area have received an education that is neither 
better nor worse than the one little Quebecers received in the 
same area. The teachers gave the same to both groups, who were 
often learning together in the same classroom.
<P>
	Why would the federal government say today that it is not 
sure that they were taught exactly what it wanted them to learn? 
Why would the federal government say that it did not make a 
decision on the quality of teaching, the condition of buildings 
and school transportation and that it should have looked at all 
that before paying?
<P>
	Considering how fast the federal government moves, little 
natives would be past university age and would still not have 
started school. The government is capable of ordering endless 
studies, and the more they cost, the more it orders them. What 
would our debt be if the Quebec government had not decided to 
act and had not stopped waiting so long for the federal 
government?
<P>
	There was also the aboriginal Oka crisis in 1990. At that time, 
nothing was too good. Quebec was sending its provincial police 
officers and they were working overtime, seven days a week. 
They had to put out the fires. It was becoming urgent, especially 
since the federal government was quite involved in the situation 
there, because it was its fault if the natives were rising up about a 
territorial issue.
<P>
	For almost 130 years, it had done nothing to understand them 
and to meet their needs. Again, when the time has come to pay 
the bill, it said that we should have submitted the menu served to 
policemen when they worked overtime-that maybe it would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12808"> 12808 </A></B>
<P>
have substituted an orange or a piece of carrot for the apple. The 
government is dodging and using delaying tactics, as the  
member for Saint-Léonard said, to flee through the back door.
<P>
	In closing, I must say we have no lesson to learn from these 
people. They seem to have made it a point of honour not to 
respect their commitments. The few times they did were when 
their candidates were defeated and they promised them a safe 
riding the next time. These are about the only times when the 
Liberal Party really honoured its commitments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was really shocked to hear 
the hon. member for Chambly referring to this member for 
Saint-Léonard as someone who arrived in Canada some twenty 
years ago, as if I did not have the right to talk about or to defend 
Canadian values.
<P>
	I know the hon. member and I am amazed that he not only said 
that but he even believed that. Though I was not born in Quebec, 
I nevertheless see myself as a real Quebecer and a real Canadian. 
I hope he will take time to think about what he said and that he 
will withdraw his words and change his thinking. I hope he just 
got carried away because what he just said is serious: it means 
there are two classes of citizens in Quebec, those who were born 
in Quebec and the others who were not.
<P>
	If this is what the hon. member thinks, I hope he will have the 
courage to admit it. If that is not what he meant, he should 
clarify his thought and withdraw what he said. Such allegations 
are serious and it is not the first time it happens in that party. I 
hope, no, I am sure that Quebecers have always been generous 
people, they have always welcomed people from other countries 
and have treated them as their equals.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I know the hon. member very well and I hope 
he just got carried away and that was not his real thinking.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I also know the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard.
<P>
	I remember that, not too long ago, during an opposition day 
like this one in this House, when we were talking about the 
proposed referendum in Quebec, the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria told me: ``So, as a francophone living 
outside Quebec, I do not have the right to participate in this 
debate''. I told her that no, she did not, but that the hon. member 
for Saint-Léonard did, because he is a Quebecer.
<P>
	If he is as honest as he claims, he will admit that I made that 
statement here in this House; you can even look it up in 
<I>Hansard</I>. No, that is not my intention. What I mean is that some 
members have the nerve to lecture us here today, telling us that 
they were the ones who built this country-at least that is how I 
understood it-because we Quebecers are just a bunch of 
``bums''. That is what the hon. member from the Reform Party 
told us  through his thinly veiled remarks. He suggested that we 
wanted money, that we wanted things, that we came here to get 
funds. That is what I meant. I meant that we francophones have 
been in Quebec for 450 years, that we also contributed to this 
country, that our contribution was at least as important as that of 
more recent immigrants to Canada. That is what I meant, as the 
hon. member for Saint-Léonard knows full well.
<P>
	Indeed, there are none so deaf as those who will not hear. That 
is so true. Particularly in debates such as this one, it is common 
for some people to twist what others have said. I am saying that 
Quebecers who have been here in North America for more than 
400 to 450 years on average also have the right to speak up, to 
decide whether or not they were wronged in the past and whether 
or not they paid more than their fair share, and to demand that it 
not happen again. That is what the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard should have understood, and I know that, despite 
his Mediterranean accent, he understands very well the French 
spoken here. That is to his credit, and I commend him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know where to start 
following the remarks made by the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	It is really a shame that, once again, qualifications are made 
as to who is a Canadian and who is not, who can live in Quebec 
and who cannot.
<P>
	It takes some gall to say that we are concerned only with those 
who settled here some 350, 400 years ago. I find it despicable 
that the hon. member of the opposition could claim that 
newcomers to Canada, and Quebec in particular, did not do well 
or contribute to the economic development of my province.
<P>
	We must recognize one thing, Mr. Speaker, and that is that 
ours is a country built on immigration. And the first to settle this 
land were, to use the terms of the opposition motion, the 
aboriginals. They are the real, original settlers. Next in line are 
the French Canadians, Canadians of French descent, the 
Bretons, the Scots, the Irish, the British and the Loyalists. Then 
people from other countries came to Canada and Quebec, and 
put their talents to good use in our country.
<P>
	In fact, if the hon. member of the opposition cared to check in 
his own ranks, he would realize that there are members who are 
not old stock Quebecers in his own party. There are newcomers, 
new Quebecers, not only within the Bloc Quebecois but also 
within the Quebec government. Are they not real Quebecers? I 
would like him to tell me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12809"> 12809 </A></B>
<P>
	All we are asking the hon. member of the opposition to do 
is to apologize formally in this House and withdraw his 
remarks. I think that the honourable man he is will recognize 
that the hon. member for Saint-Leonard and other newcomers, 
so to speak, people who left their country of origin to settle in 
Canada, have made an outstanding contribution to this country.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I personally have a great deal of respect for every newcomer 
who was admitted to Canada, who has elected to make Canada 
his or her home, to contribute to its development. One even had 
the qualifications and the courage to go before his peers and get 
elected, becoming a full-fledged member of the House of 
Commons. This gentleman was even appointed to cabinet. That 
is why I am proud to be a Canadian: I can see that, among us, 
there are people from various ethnic backgrounds, who are the 
pride and glory of this country.
<P>
	So, I ask that the hon. member of the opposition withdraw his 
remarks on newcomers to Canada, nothing less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, it looks as if the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine were dancing the 
cha-cha-cha in swinging doors. First, I never said that. I never 
allowed myself to decide who is a Canadian and who is not-and 
I never will. I will only say that I am not one.
<P>
	I never said who was a Quebecer and who was not. René 
Lévesque-a man whom I really appreciated and who came 
from a Gaspe community close to that of the hon. member who 
just spoke-once said something with which I fully agree, 
namely that Quebecers were those who lived in Quebec, 
regardless of their origin. Quebecers are those who want to live 
in Quebec. As for myself, it was never my intention to insinuate, 
either directly or indirectly, anything to the contrary.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to do politics on that issue for 10 or 
15 minutes, fine. I do not have to apologize to anyone because I 
did not insult anyone. However, I did want to point out to the 
hon. member for Saint-Léonard that he has my admiration and 
my respect. He knows that I was not referring to him and I think 
he understood it full well. Again, I want to convey to him my 
admiration, and that also goes for his family. That being said, I 
do not make apologies. The hon. member for Saint-Léonard has 
all my respect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
will understand that, before coming to the heart of the matter, I 
would like to join the hon. member for Saint-Léonard and the 
hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine in 
denouncing the remarks made by the member from the official 
opposition, as well as explaining my feeling of dismay-to put it 
mildly. These remarks are totally inconsistent with the values 
we have developed in this country, the values we share and the 
values we have in Quebec. The transcript will bear witness to 
this.
<P>
	I must say that, in addition to his personal attack on my 
colleague, the opposition member took on aboriginal people as 
well, saying that they were studying only because education was 
free. There was something fundamentally contemptuous in 
these remarks. They reflect the official opposition's deeply held 
feelings of contempt, a state of mind disrespectful of people and 
even more of the values they share.
<P>
	In that sense, you will understand that I join my two 
colleagues in asking, as a Quebecer, that the official opposition 
member withdraw his words that I find unfortunate, to say the 
least. That being said, I will now address the issue raised in the 
official opposition motion.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Anybody who cares to examine the wording of this motion, let 
alone its substance, will realize that, once again, the people 
opposite are basically trying to sell us a bill of goods. They are 
trying to pull the wool over Quebecers' eyes. That same attitude 
permeates all their policies. That can be said of the Bloc 
Quebecois, but also, and even more so, of its head office.
<P>
	Speaking of not being able to rise above petty politics, we can 
find superb examples not across the way, but with the Quebec 
government itself, a government whose concern ought to be to 
look after the interests of the people. This is a serious matter. 
What is at stake is the interests of citizens who put their 
confidence in a government, thinking that it would try to build a 
better society.
<P>
	Among the most telling examples of the partisan attitude they 
cannot shed, I should mention the finance minister's budget. It 
is a real gem. When you resort to such an important instrument, 
something so essential in any society, to engage in crass 
political propaganda, something is really wrong.
<P>
	Speaking to reporters, Mr. Campeau casually dropped these 
remarks: ``If you vote on the right side at the referendum, we 
may well live in an ideal world, and there will not be any tax 
increase. It will be some kind of Garden of Eden''. Such 
statements are a serious matter, coming as they do from the 
Minister of Finance of Quebec. Instead of indulging in petty 
politics, talking about the referendum, and trying to take Quebec 
out of Canada, he should be working hand in hand with the 
federal Minister of Finance in a responsible way to build a better 
society, a society our children will be proud of, if only we can 
tackle the real problems we were elected to settle.
<P>
	Let us take the issues mentioned in this motion. They are 
serious issues. When I say that these issues are serious ones, I 
hear members of the official opposition commenting, a big 
smile on their face, because they do not really care about these 
fundamental and contentious issues. When we talk about the 
demands made by a province, it is important. It is also important 
for us, the federal government, to seriously consider the de-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12810"> 12810 </A></B>
<P>
mands,  to treat them fairly and, as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said, to act responsibly.
<P>
	I must say that I have a lot of trouble understanding all the 
animosity and fury with which the official opposition is tackling 
these serious issues, because on this side of the House, as the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs pointed out earlier, we 
are doing everything we can to ensure that the decisions are 
made as soon as possible and in all fairness to Quebec and all of 
Canada.
<P>
	Since I do not seem to understand, would the official 
opposition tell me if they would like us to pay without looking at 
the bills, without checking if it is our duty as federal government 
to pay for these expenditures? I sincerely doubt, Mr. Speaker, 
that that is what the people in all the provinces expect from the 
federal government. What we expect is a federal government 
which does not waste the taxpayers' money and has a good hold 
on the purse strings, and that is exactly what we are doing.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	In fact, not very well hidden behind this motion is a 
pre-referendum political strategy. The official opposition wants 
to create a smoke screen. It wants the people in Quebec to rise to 
the bait. I think these members are basically scornful, and I am 
weighing my words.
<P>
	The three serious issues mentioned in the motion are being 
used for partisan purposes, for referendum purposes. I must say 
that I do not agree with that and I do not understand anything any 
more. They are trying to lay down a smoke screen, but this is of 
course premature. It is premature because, as we all know, the 
government has not made a decision yet. On the contrary, it is 
putting in place a procedure by which it will judge each claim on 
its merits. Also, instead of waiting for the process to end, the 
Bloc is trying to turn these fundamental claims of the people of 
Quebec into a purely political question.
<P>
	This proves that the Bloc does do not have the interests of 
Quebecers at heart, but that it is only interested in its own 
agenda, which is, at the risk of repeating myself, essentially the 
separation of Quebec.
<P>
	I believe that Bloc members should sincerely listen to 
Quebecers. As I often say in this House, we were elected 
democratically. We were elected for the promises we made to 
Canadians. It goes without saying that the members across the 
way are not fulfilling their promises. The government of Quebec 
is not listening to the people. We were elected because we 
promised that we would rebuild people's trust in government, 
that we would have an honest government. We were elected 
because we said we would deliver, because we said we would 
tackle the real problems. They elected us because we promised 
them we would be a basically responsible government. We were 
elected because people trusted us not to throw their money out 
the window. And I must say that the people of Quebec want 
exactly the same thing.
<P>
	I must also say that, by laying down a smoke screen, the 
Official Opposition will not succeed in making us react in an 
untimely or hasty way. On the contrary. In the best interests of 
the people, the best interests of Quebecers, we will follow a fair 
process to make sure that the hard earned money of the 
taxpayers of Quebec and Canada is well managed. We will 
certainly not fall into the trap set by the official opposition.
<P>
	Speaking about good government and what the people expect 
from their provincial and federal governments, I would be 
remiss if I did not say a few words about intergovernmental 
co-operation. People elected us to solve the debt and deficit 
problem, create jobs, restore economic growth, help Canada 
carve out a place in the new global economy, and develop a 
labour force of which our country could be proud, which would 
attract new companies and make Canada competitive not just 
nationally but internationally as well. Co-operation is the key to 
all of this.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	How can this co-operation exist when you have on the other 
side of the House and in Quebec-and it is unfortunate-a 
government which does not want the system to work? We do not 
have to go very far to find some rather striking illustrations.
<P>
	Let us take, for example, the last visit of the minister from 
Quebec who came to Ottawa to meet with the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. Quebecers have to wonder if the 
minister came to Ottawa to solve problems or to create 
problems.
<P>
	When we see the attitude of the members opposite and the 
attitude of the Quebec government and the minister who just met 
with our friend, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, I 
think that the answer cannot be any clearer. But the answer is 
also unfortunate because the actions of the Quebec government 
are far from being constructive. It is obvious that these actions 
are very prejudicial not only to Quebec and Canada today, but 
also to the future generations.
<P>
	I have visited Quebec extensively these past few months, I 
have talked to Quebecers and I can tell you that they are sick and 
tired of these endless debates. They are really sick and tired of 
seeing a government in Quebec that is taking steps but in the 
wrong direction. People want increased co-operation, they want 
a constructive partnership, they want fiscal consolidation. 
These are all reasons for us to all sit down together and try to 
solve these problems as soon as possible so we can start building 
our economy and create jobs.
<P>
	When I talk about misleading the people of Quebec, let us 
think about what happened eight months ago, when Quebecers 
placed their trust in a provincial political party which, you will 
remember, spoke of the other way to govern. It reminds me of a 
federal political party that spoke of the real power. According to 
the people I met, when they chose the other way to govern, they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12811"> 12811 </A></B>
<P>
wanted a responsible government, a government  which creates 
jobs, a government which is interested in what they have to say.
<P>
	Well, let us see what this other way to govern in Quebec 
turned out to be. It is simply a government that governs with its 
eyes closed and its ears plugged and with only one thing in mind: 
to achieve its own agenda. And everybody knows that the 
agenda is the separation of Quebec. It is just unbelievable. This 
reflects a lack of the most elementary respect for the public and 
is a denial of the mandate they received from the electorate.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	They are trying to give the impression in Quebec that there is 
something terribly wrong with the present federal system and 
that some problems cannot be overcome within that system. Of 
course, if you listen to them, you cannot get anything done 
within the present system. I say that, if you are prepared to work 
within the system, in good faith, there is much that can be done.
<P>
	If governments could get together for two seconds, there are 
some extraordinary things we could do in Canada today to help 
this country enter the new era of free trade and maintain its 
position internationally. There are some eloquent examples of 
this. When we talk about the real problems, those people on the 
other side of the House start shouting because they do not want 
to hear the truth. They do not want us to tell the people of 
Quebec that they are not acting in the interests of Quebecers.
<P>
	That is why you hear them shout like that when we, Liberals 
from Quebec who were elected as well, take the floor. Of course 
they do not see us as Quebecers because we do not share their 
philosophy, but we were elected in Quebec, and I am a proud 
Quebecer, and I believe that if we do a good job we can build a 
better and in fact exceptional Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	There are some outstanding examples like the immigration 
agreement, the agreement on interprovincial trade and the 
agreements concerning la Francophonie. Finally, there is a lot 
more we could do, but wasting our time on motions like the one 
before the House today is not going to help us work in the best 
interests of Quebecers and Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first off, I 
would like to call the hon. member for Outremont to order, 
because he accused the hon. member for Chambly of saying 
something that he did not say. I would also like to call the hon. 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine to order for 
doing the same thing.
<P>
	I think we have a good example of how members opposite 
play politics when they put words in the mouths of my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues. I simply wanted to say this for the record. 
What they said about my colleague for Chambly is entirely 
untrue.
<P>
	He also accused the Government of Quebec of shirking its 
responsibilities. I would call that sticking his nose into other 
people's business. We all know that the federal Liberal members 
from Quebec are not in the least bit, not even the tiniest bit, 
interested in the Government of Quebec. They are much more 
interested in making sure that Ottawa will control, manage and 
centralize everything. Because that is their outlook, they could 
care less about what is going on in Quebec right now. They have 
never had great faith in provincial governments, at any rate. For 
them, the only government, the only power in Canada, is the 
Canadian government.
<P>
	Forcibly, they can only consider the provinces as managers of 
sorts. They confirmed this in the Charlottetown accord when 
they gave all of the power to Ottawa and the right to administer 
to the provinces. That is why this accord was flatly rejected. 
They claimed that they were decentralizing and giving the 
provinces the opportunity to manage or administer things. That 
is not what Quebec wants. Quebec wants powers, not just the 
opportunity to administer. And that is not just my message, not 
just the Bloc Quebecois' message, it is the message of the 
Commission on the Political and Constitutional Future of 
Quebec, the Bélanger-Campeau Commission.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The Bélanger-Campeau Commission sure was a big 
production, one of the biggest since Confederation. Altogether, 
they received 600 briefs, heard 205 witnesses while 55 experts 
were studying the issue. They concluded that for Quebec's 
well-being, it had to be given at least 20 real powers, for 
example, education, tourism, economic development.
<P>
	And the federal government, with the support of the Liberals, 
hatched a proposal which purportedly met all of Quebec's 
aspirations. What hypocrisy!
<P>
	Charlottetown gave Ottawa even more powers, and Quebec, 
even more administration. They treated Quebec as if it were a 
province like any other, with no particular status and nothing 
distinct about it at all. Now, they butt in and would have us 
believe that the Quebec Minister of Finance, Mr. Campeau, the 
eminent Quebecer who co-chaired the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission, is botching his job. That complaint probably came 
from one disgruntled voter in Outremont.
<P>
	And they are absolutely right when they say that we are 
playing politics when we say that Quebecers will pay more taxes 
if they do not vote for sovereignty. The federal Minister of 
Finance decided to wait before adding to the Quebec tax burden. 
He will hit Quebec next year only. Yes, we are in for it, and we 
will end up sending our tax money to Ottawa, and the federal 
government will skim a good billion from it before shipping it 
back to Quebec. And it is very clear that, once again, the 
Government of Quebec will be caught in the squeeze to some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12812"> 12812 </A></B>
<P>
extent, because the federal government fails to live  up to its 
responsibility to give us back the money we send to Ottawa 
through our taxes. It gives us back less than we gave. It promised 
to keep paying. It made such promises. However, it does not 
keep them.
<P>
	So in all likelihood the Minister of Finance of Quebec will 
have to raise taxes, because the federal government does not 
assume its responsibilities, pure and simple.
<P>
	There was talk of jobs earlier. When it comes to jobs, we know 
that the job problem in Quebec is the federal government's 
problem. As I mentioned earlier in my speech, the federal 
government talks of political uncertainty, but political 
uncertainty does not take away jobs, economic uncertainty does. 
Top American experts, economists, American business people 
say so: they could not care less about politics when they are 
looking to invest in Canada. They say: ``The reason we do not 
invest in Canada is because of its economic instability''. This 
economic instability is the federal government's doing, as 
everyone knows. The Bélanger-Campeau commission report 
said so, and it was approved.
<P>
	So this fine speech by the member for Outremont seems 
completely out of date to me. He did not understand. He really 
has not grasped what is happening in Quebec. I do not know 
where he comes from, but he is not from the same place as the 
rest of us real Quebecers.
<P>
	No, what I mean, really, is that the real Quebecers are those 
who understand Quebecers. That is what I wanted to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not have to try too hard to 
rise above our colleagues today. I have just been told that I am 
not a real Quebecer. Come on. Let us have a little bit of respect 
for who we are, for the society we represent and the values we 
have in common.
<P>
	They have just proved that I was right when I said that they do 
not consider me a true Quebecers because I do not think as they 
do. They just said it, it is as simple as that.
<P>
	To get back to the member's comments, I will be kind and say 
that remarks verging on demagogy, such as what we just heard, 
do not deserve a response.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	However, on the subject of commissions-the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission was mentioned-I will say that 
the PQ regional commissions throughout Quebec were a clear 
example of democracy being stifled. The commissions were 
created with the idea that they were to draw the conclusion the 
PQ wanted to see, namely that Quebec must separate, but in the 
end it realized that this was not what people talked about. People 
reminded the commissions that what they wanted the 
government to do was to rethink the role of government, deal 
with the economy and create jobs. But, despite this reality in 
Quebec and throughout Canada, the PQ regional commissions 
offered in their conclusion solutions and recommendations 
which have nothing to do with the testimony they heard.
<P>
	When it comes to commissions, I believe that the PQ national 
commission is a telling example of a government which refuses 
to listen to the people, which wants to manage, to rule, and to 
govern with only one idea in mind. And we all know what that is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to reply to my colleague, the 
member for Outremont. I know you will not allow me to say that 
75 per cent of his comments were absolute lies, because I cannot 
say that, but I will say that 25 per cent of what he said is 
somehow related to truth and reality.
<P>
	I would like to reply on one point in particular. He spent a 
good part of his presentation discrediting the Parti Quebecois 
government. He said that if all these issues before us, the issues 
mentioned in the motion, are not solved, it is because there is a 
separatist government in Quebec. The member for Outremont 
devoted a good portion of his speech to that point.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois government has been in place for six 
months. In Ottawa, the Liberal government has been in office 
for a year and a half now. Why did they not settle these issues 
when they were dealing with obedient federalists, ready to 
accept any kind of compromise to come to an agreement with the 
federal government? They had one full year to settle issues that 
have been dragging on for ten years. They did nothing. It is easy 
to see that the member for Outremont is taking us for a ride. 
Does he really think Quebecers are all that gullible? He is trying 
to delude us. He has lost all credibility in my view. He should 
have chosen to face reality, talk specifically to the motion and 
demand that his government find solutions to problems that 
have been dragging on for ten years, as I said before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier, during my short speech, I 
explained quite thoroughly how the federal government deals 
with the claims. The public understands very well that we are 
acting as a responsible government. So I am sure you see why I 
will not reply to comments that seem to come from someone 
who was not even here during my speech.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I always wondered what Pontius Pilate looked like 
in the praetorium. I think we saw that this afternoon. I will say 
no more.
<P>
	We heard the hon. member making groundless accusations 
against us when he ought to have been defending Quebec. We are 
politicians in the House and our actions are political. We do not 
have to be ashamed of it, since we are paid for that. The hon. 
member boasts about the integrity of his government. It is not 
because one says that one is honest that one is, but because one 
acts honestly.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12813"> 12813 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	It is true that the population elected Liberals. Very often, it is 
because people did not have a real choice. When people had one, 
in Quebec, they elected the members of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Not everywhere.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata): </B>No, but they did 
have a choice. Sometimes, they had no choice, so they elected 
Liberals.
<P>
	What is important is the fact that this government has done 
absolutely nothing since it took office. That is why it is so 
popular. When one does nothing, one is not open to criticism.
<P>
	This government has simply introduced in the House the 
legislation the Conservative government left behind. Once the 
Liberals introduced these Conservative bills, they had nothing 
else to propose.
<P>
	One thing should be important for them. They have a new 
member who comes from Quebec and, as my colleague for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead reminded us, the federalists 
had one full year to resolve the problem with the federalists in 
Quebec. Now, the population was misled by the hon. member for 
Outremont who barely mentioned what the whole issue was 
about. I would like to give the facts about the issue before us.
<P>
	First, the motion. What does the motion tabled this morning 
by my colleague say? It says: ``That this House deplore the 
federal government's delay in responding to Quebec's demands 
with regard to the education of young Aboriginals in Northern 
Quebec amounting to $199 million, to the compensation of $135 
million under the 1991-92 stabilization program and to the $79 
million claim for expenses incurred during the events at Oka in 
the summer of 1990''.
<P>
	That is to say the federal government owes Quebec $333 
million.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not peanuts.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> That shows that this government which 
claims to be a good manager of public money is very bad at 
paying its bills. This government brags about reducing the 
deficit, but to do so, it shifts its problems to the provinces.
<P>
	We had already noticed it in the last federal budget, when the 
federal government announced a cut in health and education 
transfer payments. Now the government has decided it will not 
pay the $333 million it owes Quebec. Yet, other provinces 
received a positive reply and even got back what was owed to 
them. Quebec has to wait once again, and the federal 
government even suggested that it should not expect much.
<P>
	When Quebecers ask themselves who defends their interests 
in Ottawa, the answer is certainly not: the government of Jean 
Chrétien.
<P>
	Since we cannot count on government members from Quebec 
to defend the interests of Quebecers, I will explain in simple 
words the grievances of Quebec regarding the payment of $333 
million, which is owed to us, but which the federal government 
refuses to pay.
<P>
	As the motion already mentions, there are three amounts of 
money at stake. I will explain the $79 million, incurred during 
the native crisis of the summer of 1990, which should have been 
paid back to Quebec under the financial support agreements in 
case of disaster.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Nobody can deny the fact that the summer of 1990 was a 
disaster in Quebec, in terms of what happened in Oka and, above 
all, of the federal government sending in the army to deal with a 
catastrophic situation. That is why these $79 million were spent 
by the Quebec Ministry of Public Security and by the Sûreté du 
Québec to maintain public order and protect the residents of the 
affected area.
<P>
	The cause of the conflict was simply that a native group 
claimed to own the lands surrounding its territory. Natives are 
under federal jurisdiction. That is why the Canadian Army 
intervened in the Oka crisis.
<P>
	Bill McKnight, then Minister of National Defence, told 
minister Claude Ryan, in a letter dated January 24, 1991, that is 
six months after the conflict ended: ``The federal government 
has special responsibilities regarding the Indians''. In that 
letter, he also made a firm commitment to the Quebec 
government: ``In addition to the expenditures already approved, 
we will provide financial help to the province, in accordance 
with the guidelines on the implementation of disaster relief 
agreements''.
<P>
	This letter from the Minister of National Defence to the 
Quebec Minister of Public Security is as clear as it can be. The 
government admitted to having a disaster relief program and, 
therefore, it was obligated to reimburse Quebec's expenditures.
<P>
	In 1992, the government wanted to show what a good player it 
was, so it admitted owing Quebec $84 million and that it would 
give $5 million to the province, an action by which we think the 
federal government indeed recognized its responsibility in this 
issue. It still owes us $79 million. Why did the federal 
government change its mind afterwards? Why is it now refusing 
to recognize its responsibilities?

	The government used faulty reasoning to avoid paying. Let 
us look at three of its reasons. First, it claimed it was making 
a distinction between public order, that was supposedly in 
jeopardy, and public well-being, that was not. These are the 
sorts of nuances that the government is capable of invoking. 
Beyond the fact that this distinction does not appear anywhere 
in the disaster financial assistance arrangements, it is obvious 
that public well-being was threatened by this crisis that 
affected all Quebecers.
<P>
	Second, there was political interference in this issue. Indeed, 
it seems that the decision not to reimburse the expenses incurred 
by the Sûreté du Québec was taken in 1992 by the Treasury 
Board of Canada, despite an opinion given by its own experts 
and the Office of the Auditor General, who had recognized that 
at least a part of these expenses qualified.
<P>
	So, how can it be claimed, as the minister did the other day, 
that someone refused to open the books? If the Office of the 
Auditor General has already recognized that at least a part of 
these expenses ought to be reimbursed, someone must have 
looked at the books at some point.
<P>
	Third, the federal government gave as its criterion for 
refusing the amounts of money involved. The hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine used this argument this 
morning. Yet, the objective of the program is to help provinces 
or territories to face a disaster the costs of which would be an 
excessive burden on them. To accept the federal government's 
claims is to not only go against the spirit of the financial 
assistance program, but also to create a dangerous precedent.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	If we follow this reasoning, the federal government could 
decide to stop paying old age pensions or UI benefits to 
Quebecers, simply because it would cost too much this year. In 
return, people would not pay their federal income tax, because 
they would feel it is too high. One can see how such fallacious 
arguments could lead us to disaster.
<P>
	Let us be reasonable for a moment. There are laws and 
regulations providing for the payment of certain sums to Quebec 
under specific terms and conditions. Quebec citizens pay taxes 
to Ottawa and they have the right to recover part of them. 
Whether or not the Liberal government likes the legitimate 
government of Quebec or the official opposition should not be a 
factor. Our $79 million claim is only a matter of equity and 
fairness.
<P>
	I will now move on to the $119 million the federal 
government owes Quebec for the education of young aboriginal 
people. It owes us this money under the James Bay agreement. 
In this case, the federal government seems more open, as it does 
not deny having responsibilities in this area. However, it refuses 
to pay, because these amounts were spent without a prior 
agreement between the federal government and the province.
<P>
	Of course, the federal government does not appear eager to 
come to an agreement. It would then have had to pay its share. In 
this whole matter, the Quebec government acted in a perfectly 
responsible fashion. It acted like a reasonable man, as the saying 
goes. Instead of abandoning the aboriginal people to their fate, 
with no resources, to suffer from this wrangling between two 
levels of government, instead of closing schools for one, two or 
three years while this government negotiates an agreement, the 
Government of Quebec took its responsibilities, kept the 
schools open and kept young aboriginals in school, fulfilling its 
part of the bargain as well as that of the federal government.
<P>
	And it is still waiting. The Quebec government has been 
waiting since 1986 for the federal government to pay back what 
it owes the province for paying both the federal and provincial 
share of expenditures. Now, if Quebec had decided to close 
schools, the federal government would have dragged the Quebec 
government all the way up to the Supreme Court of Canada and 
the aboriginals would have gone to the United Nations to 
complain about it. We took our responsibilities, Now, there are 
bills to settle.
<P>
	I am baffled though. We have had consecutive governments, 
under Mr. Bourassa and Mr. Johnson for instance, that were 
federalist. Yet, and that is what amazes me, you were unable to 
come to an agreement among federalists and, as a result, the 
sovereignists now have to get up in this House to protect 
Quebec's interests.
<P>
	Finally, there is this huge amount, $135 million, owed to 
Quebec by the federal government under the 1991-92 fiscal 
stabilization program. Liberal federalists in Quebec had already 
put in a claim for this amount when they were in power. The 
Minister of Labour could certainly brief the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs on this issue.
<P>
	As for the Minister of Finance, he flatly refuses to make any 
payment. Once again, the government is applying a double 
standard, since provinces much better off than Quebec-namely 
Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia-already received 
payments under the same program. In this case, as in the other 
two, the amounts to be paid should be based on objective 
criteria. Yet, the federal Minister of Finance refuses to go to 
arbitration and settle the issue without seeking to score political 
points. Instead, the minister suggested that the Quebec 
government take its case to the Federal Court, and eventually the 
Supreme Court. So much for the brilliant ideas of this 
government. The government owes us money, but tells us: Take 
the taxpayers' money. We will do the same. We will continue to 
pay lawyers and go to court, even though we are perfectly aware 
that, under the existing regulations and agreements, we owe you 
that money. Is this the finance minister's idea of flexible 
federalism and friendly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12815"> 12815 </A></B>
<P>
administrative arrangements? We  can only conclude that, with 
friends like him, Quebec does not need enemies.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I am beginning to understand what government and federalist 
members mean by ``flexible federalism''. The expression refers 
to a vision of Canada whereby Quebec must always yield to 
Ottawa and English Canada. Let me simply tell you that the Bloc 
will never ask Quebecers to yield. Quebecers are proud. They 
want to take control of their destiny, and they will soon set up 
their own country, in the upcoming referendum, with or without 
those $333 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata while she kept hacking at 
federalism and the Canadian government. I would like to hear 
her criticize in the same way the threats made by the government 
of Quebec and its Minister of Education, Mr. Garon, to the 
university located in Rimouski, in her own riding.
<P>
	Some people dare to accuse the Liberal members and to 
accuse me, the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, an elected representative 
from grassroots Quebec, of not standing up for Quebec and my 
own area, and I find that totally unacceptable.
<P>
	In my riding and in the vast majority of rural ridings in 
Quebec, people are mostly concerned about the economy. They 
are concerned about jobs. We are thinking about our future, but 
we know very well that the federal government, the Canadian 
government, is a worthy partner for us. I think the federal 
government has shown in the last few weeks or the last few 
months, in fact in the 18 months since it has been in office, that 
we want to get Canadians and Quebecers back to work. We set up 
an infrastructure program. In fact, the current government of 
Quebec is glad to use it. It is glad to show that it can get some of 
the workers in smaller localities in grassroots Quebec back to 
work.
<P>
	By the way, on the native issue, I have not heard the hon. 
member say a word about their living conditions in Quebec and 
elsewhere in Canada. They did not tell us about how dismayed 
the whole world was when these unfortunate events happened in 
Quebec and what it did to the reputation of Quebec and Canada. 
True, I was not in Canada at the time, I was in Japan and, for a 
while, in France. But, believe me, all my friends, my associates 
and my acquaintances kept telling me about this problem with 
natives in Canada. And it saddened me to know that the 
government could not find a peaceful solution to the problem. 
But the Quebec government did call on the federal government 
for help. The premier of Quebec has the right to call on the 
Canadian army in a very difficult situation.
<P>
	That is what happened. It is Quebec that asked for the army's 
involvement, not the Canadian government. The federal 
government spent $133 million to send in the army and the 
RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian government spends millions of dollars every 
year to maintain the peace elsewhere in the world and to ensure 
that other countries will follow Canada's example. But I do not 
want to digress. About the natives, it is the federal government 
which takes on the responsibility of creating a healthy economy 
at the local level for these people. We build houses and even 
cabins for them. We do everything to help them.
<P>
	All we are asking of the government of Quebec is that it stop 
playing politics to the detriment of the most disadvantaged 
people. Everybody here knows that natives are not the most 
spoiled people in our country. Nevertheless, we hear the 
opposition and even some government members say that natives 
are treated differently. The claim that they are better treated than 
most Canadians is false. Suicide, alcoholism and all the social 
ills imaginable are more prevalent in aboriginal communities.
<P>
	I grew up one kilometre away from an Indian reserve. And 
believe me when I say that I saw with my very eyes how these 
poor people were treated. People were reluctant to give them 
jobs, to let them play on their hockey teams or to welcome them 
in our French Catholic schools. Unfortunately, I think we all 
should examine our consciences.
<P>
	Today's debate was an example of negotiations to come 
between a sovereign Quebec and Canada. We got stuck on tiny 
details: who owed who $333 million, $79 million, $125 million 
and for what, and how Quebec has been taken for a ride for the 
past 125 years. How will we ever manage to negotiate? Now I 
ask the people watching us on television, do you think that we 
will ever be able to orchestrate a separation if, today, all they 
could do was condemn the federal government for 
wrong-doing? And they want to divvy up the debt, and share our 
currency and passport? They just want to coast on Canada's 
prestige.
<P>
	The opposition should be told to go back to the drawing board. 
This new approach they are proposing to Quebecers is utterly 
unacceptable. They should just ask the question once and for all: 
``Do you want to stay in Canada, yes or no?''
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, what is surprising about these 
Liberal members of Parliament opposite is that they try to 
distract people's attention and talk about any old thing. I spoke 
of three specific matters: the federal government's debt to 
Quebec of $333 million. We are not talking about peanuts, this is 
a lot of money for a people that needs every penny to grow and 
develop.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12816"> 12816 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals call $333 million peanuts because they are used 
to wallowing in money with the Bronfmans and Power 
Corporation and because there are ministers in cabinet who are 
millionaires and who sail their boats under the Panamanian flag 
to avoid paying taxes in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. The hon. 
parliamentary secretary has risen on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member says I described 
$333 million as peanuts, what about the $2.5 billion we send to 
Quebec every year?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. With all due 
respect to my colleagues on both sides of the House, this was not 
a point of order, it was a matter of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1985, the government of Mr. 
Lévesque was the first to sign an agreement with the native 
peoples. It was this government that went the farthest and that 
accorded the most to the native peoples in 1985.
<P>
	In 1990, the October crisis unfortunately cast a shadow over 
relations between native peoples and the people of Quebec, 
perceptions changed.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	This crisis arose, once again, because of the indecision of the 
government of the day, a Liberal and a federalist government, 
led once again by Mr. Bourassa. Both times the army moved into 
Quebec, Liberal federalists were in power.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.15 p.m., it is my 
duty pursuant to Standing Order 81 to interrupt proceedings and 
to put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the 
business of supply.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45, the recorded division on the question now before the 
House stands deferred until Monday, May 29, at the usual time 
of adjournment, at which time the bells to call in the members 
will sound for not more than 15 minutes.
<P>
	The chief government whip has the floor on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would request unanimous 
consent to further defer division until 5.30 p.m. Tuesday, May 
30.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> To be sure the House 
understands, the government whip has requested a further 
deferral of the vote to Tuesday, May 30 at 5.30 p.m. Is that 
agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps you would find 
unanimous consent to commence private members' hour 
immediately, in other words consider it 5.30 p.m. and to do the 
same at the end of private members' hour, in other words finish 
10 minutes ahead of time at the end.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent to proceed to private members' hour?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.20 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
following initiatives for addressing the underground economy:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) an enhanced information campaign to educate the public and to encourage their 
participation in addressing the problem;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) a limited amnesty on interest and penalties otherwise payable when a taxpayer 
voluntarily declares income previously undeclared;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) a tax credit to taxpayers on home improvements and renovations to provide an 
inducement to create the essential paper trail and to serve as one of the primary 
vehicles for the information campaign.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the underground economy materially 
and adversely affects the lives of all Canadians and literally 
costs us billions of dollars of revenue each year as a result. That 
is why I submitted Motion No. 382 to the House for 
consideration.
<P>
	While the existence of the underground economy in Canada is 
an undisputed fact, estimates as to its size vary widely depend-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12817"> 12817 </A></B>
<P>
ing on the methodology employed to measure it. Estimates 
range from 2.5 per cent to 3 per  cent of GDP to over 20 per cent 
of GDP; in dollar figures $20 billion up to $140 billion.
<P>
	Even at the lower end of the range the revenue potential I 
believe warrants further initiatives to realize the potential and to 
contribute to the restoration of Canada's financial health.
<P>
	There are good reasons why we should act now. As the finance 
minister has said, everything is on the table. It is imperative that 
moving forcefully on the underground economy be part of the 
overall strategy to meet our financial targets. Now that the 
economy is growing we must encourage as many people as 
possible to integrate back into the legitimate economy of the 
country.
<P>
	The government currently has better tools to address the 
problem of tax evasion, but tax evaders are also becoming more 
sophisticated. Given this reality, it would be prudent to take 
advantage of new provincial information sharing and other 
initiatives before this new advantage is neutralized.
<P>
	There are some general assumptions about the underground 
economy I would like to note. There is the premise that once you 
are underground it is very difficult to come out even if you 
wanted to. That is primarily because people who are working 
underground generally have offered arrangements and deals to 
their customers and clients substantially below the otherwise 
market price. That means customers come to depend on them.
<P>
	In addition, once a taxpayer has evaded taxes and not reported 
that income and paid those taxes, there is interest and possibly 
penalties which grow over time and may grow to an amount 
which would be prohibitive as far as the taxpayer's being able to 
settle it.
<P>
	Most of the underground economic activity is very difficult to 
detect because there is no paper trail, no invoice which would 
verify such activity. That is one of the aspects I hope to address 
with Motion No. 382.
<P>
	Some of the arguments for dealing with the underground 
economy include the statement that if every Canadian paid their 
fair share we would all pay less. We must all do our part and 
fulfil our responsibilities and become part of the solution.
<P>
	Since the recession clearly added to the underground 
economy these new additions are the people we have to get back 
before their dependency becomes irrevocable. I believe focused 
efforts on certain segments will be most successful but a general 
initiative should still have positive results because the first 
wave of results will come from reminding Canadians of their 
legal and moral obligations.
<P>
	While the size of the underground economy is elusive, 
Canadians consider it large enough to warrant attention. There 
are a number of reasons people choose to participate in the 
underground economy.
<P>
	The first and most fundamental is basic greed, people taking 
care of themselves at the expense of others. The second is a 
belief in the myth that everyone is doing it and nobody is getting 
hurt, which clearly is not the case. Some feel it is easy to get 
away with because we have an honour system in our tax system 
of declaring income. There also is a perception that no major 
effort is being made to stop it. Some would suggest the income 
tax system is too complex and too cumbersome to operate 
within. We have matters such as the level of respect for 
government and politicians. It is a problem in today's society.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The objectives of the strategy to address the underground 
economy generally include to recover revenue legally owing to 
Canadians, to encourage voluntary compliance and to protect 
the interests of honest taxpayers.
<P>
	To educate Canadians on the facts about the seriousness of the 
underground economy and how we can help is extremely 
important. We need to demonstrate to Canadians the 
government is appropriately discharging its responsibilities in 
enforcing the law through tough but fair actions. We want to 
eliminate illegal activity which harms the Canadian economy 
and thus all Canadians.
<P>
	Tax evasion compromises the government's ability to provide 
essential social and economic programs. It leads to unfair 
competition to honest businesses and it places an unfair burden 
on honest taxpayers.
<P>
	I refer to the 1994 report of the auditor general in relation to 
the income tax system: ``The success of the tax system depends 
ultimately on the public's willingness to meet its tax 
responsibilities through voluntary compliance. This willingness 
is fostered by showing respect for the taxpayers and gaining 
their confidence through a proper balance between facilitation 
and enforcement''. Today I am tabling this motion and its 
proposals to address in part both of these aspects.
<P>
	In the tax act there are consequences for failing to declare 
income, to report a tax return. I will outline them very briefly. If 
a taxpayer fails to file a return he or she can be subject to a 
penalty of 5 per cent of the tax unpaid. In addition, there is an 
interest charge of 1 per cent a month to a maximum of 12 per 
cent. Failure to report income can get up to a 10 per cent penalty 
on the income if the person were shown not to have reported 
income in the previous three years. In all these cases interest is 
compounded daily.
<P>
	With regard to wilful tax evasion, the penalty prescribed is up 
to 50 per cent of the tax owing. If the individual is charged there 
can be an additional penalty ranging anywhere from an 
addition-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12818"> 12818 </A></B>
<P>
al 50 per cent up to 200 per cent of the tax plus imprisonment of 
up to five  years. Needless to say these penalties are very 
extreme and reflect the seriousness of the problem of 
non-compliance with the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I do not suggest the government is not interested or not taking 
appropriate steps with the underground economy. Much to the 
contrary, I believe the motion compliments much of what the 
government is now doing.
<P>
	As we all know, the government has entered into a number of 
provincial information sharing agreements to assist in 
detection, including joint audits, shared strategy and techniques 
and training. There have been increased investigations and 
audits, particularly in identified areas of high non-compliance. 
These include home renovations, construction, auto sales, 
restaurants and jewellery, as well as other service sectors.
<P>
	The government has also embarked on a program of higher 
publicity of prosecutions. It also has found that as a result of this 
increased publicity the amount of voluntary disclosures has 
doubled. Each year Revenue Canada handles 15,000 leads or 
referrals as a result of its audit activity. It is working closely 
with the key stakeholders, with businesses, professionals and 
with the provinces to deal with tax evasion, the underground 
economy and smuggling.
<P>
	To give an idea of the extent to which it has that co-operation, 
Revenue Canada has held consultations with more than 240 
groups representing a wide range of industry sectors, including 
the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Canadian 
Homebuilders Association, the Direct Sellers Association, the 
Canadian Jewellery Association, the Canadian Restaurant and 
Food Association, tourist associations and chambers of 
commerce.
<P>
	These initiatives have helped to refine our strategies, identify 
areas of non-compliance and explore initiatives for improving 
that compliance. I believe that Motion No. 382 complements 
these initiatives by placing a greater emphasis on the role of the 
Canadian public.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	I would like to suggest some general approaches which we can 
consider in addressing the underground economy. Certainly the 
information sharing agreements with the provinces will lead to 
enhanced opportunities for the traditional audit. The public, 
through an educational and information campaign should be 
assured that the agents of law enforcement will get appropriate 
support as well as become more effective. In fact in 1994-95 
Revenue Canada's enforcement activities and its underground 
initiatives are expected to add an additional $3.8 billion to its 
tax assessment. Other approaches must concentrate on labour 
intensive sectors and other high probability areas, some of 
which I have already mentioned.
<P>
	In launching a general information campaign to address the 
myth that everyone is doing it, we are going to go a long way in 
breaking the back of the underground economy. Most Canadians 
will think twice if they know there is a serious and substantial 
risk of being caught and that the consequences which I 
previously outlined are very serious.
<P>
	Tax evasion is a crime. It is not a victimless crime, as often is 
argued. All Canadians are its victims because tax evasion leads 
to among other things job losses and an increase in the deficit. 
Honest taxpayers are carrying more of the burden of taxation. 
Legitimate businesses are operating in an environment of unfair 
competition, often leading to their bankruptcy. We must stress 
the theme that people who evade taxes are in fact cheating 
honest taxpayers, including the poor, the needy and the 
disadvantaged.
<P>
	We need to publicize the number of investigations, leads and 
referrals which are received by Revenue Canada each year from 
Canadians who know tax evaders and are very concerned about 
the prevalence of tax evasion within our society. Many more 
Canadians would contact Revenue Canada if they only knew that 
those calls would be followed up. We must encourage and 
promote voluntary compliance as well as enlist the support of all 
Canadians. We have to ask them to just say no to tax evaders.
<P>
	The preferred approach to non-compliance is voluntary 
disclosure and voluntary compliance. That is why this motion 
emphasizes public education and incentives for compliance 
rather than some aggressive measures which others may 
propose. The taxpayer must ultimately be treated fairly and with 
respect.
<P>
	The underground economy permeates Canadian society for 
the benefit of some but to the detriment of all. Canadians must 
realize that underground economic activity makes victims of us 
all. Honest businesses are faced with unfair competition. There 
are job losses because many of those businesses go bankrupt. 
Health, education and other essential economic and social 
services must be reduced because of the reduced revenue. 
Honest taxpayers must pay more to make up for those who do 
not pay.
<P>
	Most Canadians have been faced with an offer to pay cash for 
a lower price. What we do not realize is that to accept a deal 
from a disreputable service provider is not only to condone the 
crime but also to promote tax evasion. When someone offers a 
lower price for cash but no invoice, not only do we lose the 
revenue but the consumer also gives up needed protection.
<P>
	In my experience we do get what we pay for. When we go 
underground to provide services, or particularly when 
consumers accept underground services, they can expect lower 
quality work and lower quality materials because those 
businesses do not have to comply and will not comply with the 
industry regulations. As well and most important, consumers do 
not get the protection and the  guarantee they would otherwise 
have if 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12819"> 12819 </A></B>
<P>
they had an authorized purchase order and/or an invoice. When 
the customer goes underground as well, he has no recourse and 
no protection.
<P>
	This motion also asks the House to consider a couple of very 
specific initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Members should be aware that in the United States 25 states 
have at one point or another attempted to introduce or have 
introduced amnesties of sorts where tax evasion is a problem.
<P>
	I am proposing a limited amnesty. It is not very specific in 
terms of its details, but is a limited amnesty of approximately a 
two or three month period on interest or penalties otherwise 
payable when a taxpayer voluntarily comes forward and 
discloses and reports income previously unreported. I would 
like to repeat that. The amnesty has to do with interest and 
penalties, not the taxes otherwise owing.
<P>
	Phase two of the amnesty would implement an enhanced 
effort to crack down by engaging more investigators on a 
contract or commission basis possibly. This phase would 
continue as long as there is a favourable pay back.
<P>
	With regard to ongoing efforts, we would report regularly to 
the public on the success of the program and consider an 
extension of the time frame as has been done with such things as 
gun amnesties. Our analysis of those who come forward will 
also provide information to the government which it can use to 
focus future efforts, thereby creating a ripple effect of the 
benefits.
<P>
	This particular aspect of a limited amnesty is merely a 
suggestion which may or not have merit quite frankly. It is the 
kind of thing however I am hoping that the House will give due 
consideration to in committee.
<P>
	The second specific new approach I proposed in this motion 
was an input tax credit. We must let the public know that when 
they patronize a supplier for the cash price without an invoice, 
they are actually condoning fraud. By refusing to do business 
with those who do not give invoices, they will become part of the 
solution.
<P>
	After some work that I had done with the finance committee 
particularly with regard to the hearings on the GST, one of the 
facts that came out clearly throughout that process of public 
consultation was the extensive admission of underground 
activity in certain sectors. That was readily forthcoming, 
particularly because honest businesses represented by these 
associations and organizations were hurting. They were going 
bankrupt. We were losing jobs.
<P>
	The construction industry particularly related to home 
renovations and improvements was found to have, based on the 
information from those associations, anywhere from 25 per cent 
to 40 per cent of its activity underground. That is over $1.5 
billion to $2.4 billion. There is a substantial amount of tax 
revenue lost to the  government because that business activity 
has not been reported by those businesses.
<P>
	The proposal therefore states that as an inducement for the 
public to be part of the solution, we offer a tax credit possibly for 
the GST paid on home improvements or renovations. The 
taxpayer would be required to submit an original invoice or at 
least keep one available for a review should they be subject to 
audit and submit it as part of their tax return or by a separate 
filing.
<P>
	The objective here is to create a real paper trail in an area of 
abuse with which most people are familiar. Their reward is a tax 
credit. Although that tax credit would reduce the revenues 
otherwise available to the government, it does mean that we 
generate reported income on which federal, provincial, 
corporate or business taxes are paid on which withholdings for 
payroll, health care and other source deductions that are 
matched by the government also would come into the system, 
thereby generating substantially more revenue.
<P>
	This initiative would also I believe constitute an excellent 
vehicle through which to educate the public on the problem and 
to discourage generally under the table economic activity. 
Finally, this initiative is basically geared to help support honest 
businesses that are prepared to provide an invoice.
<P>
	Consider someone who has been operating underground for 
sometime who approached a prospective customer. If that 
customer asked for an invoice, it is very likely that the business 
person would refuse to do the business simply because they 
would have to provide a piece of paper which would provide that 
essential audit trail and be a verification of the economic 
activity.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	Initiatives like this may assist us in terms of dealing with the 
underground economy.
<P>
	I have taken the opportunity to speak with members of all 
parties about the matter. I am finding across the House a very 
strong interest in this subject matter because of its importance to 
all Canadians.
<P>
	I am not very concerned with regard to the specific initiatives. 
The ultimate objective is for the House to adopt this motion as a 
vehicle to bring the underground economy as an issue of 
importance to all Canadians to committee. Then together we can 
explore methods in which we can address one of Canada's most 
serious problems, the underground economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak to Motion No. 382 
standing in the name of the hon. member for Mississauga South. 
When I read the motion and the accompanying material, I was 
pleasantly surprised by the hon. member's trenchant analysis in 
his short but very interesting paper. I must say he put his finger 
on a fundamental problem in Canada's tax system, and I am  
referring to the fact that a social contract between taxpayers, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12820"> 12820 </A></B>
<P>
individuals and even businesses and various levels of 
government has been broken.
<P>
	This situation is so serious and so widespread, so deeply 
anchored in our day to day lives that recently, when the premier 
of Quebec, Mr. Jacques Parizeau, was buying furniture for his 
residence, he was asked by the salesman: ``What do we do about 
the tax?'' When we get to the point where even the Premier is 
asked whether the tax should go on the bill, the problem is 
fundamental and requires our full and undivided attention if we 
are to find a way to deal with the underground economy and the 
problems it creates for the tax system in Canada, Quebec and all 
the other provinces.
<P>
	There are some very interesting ideas in the hon. member's 
document, and although the official opposition is not usually 
fulsome in its praise for Liberal members, and you must be 
aware of that, Mr. Speaker, when valid points are made, when we 
are offered an intelligent analysis of a problem, we are open to 
discussion, we are prepared to explore the best ways to deal with 
a situation, especially one that concerns public finances.
<P>
	Consider the three suggestions the hon. member for 
Mississauga South explored in his motion. One is to inform the 
public. Many taxpayers are not aware of the impact of certain 
decisions or do not realize the overall impact of the decisions 
they make every day as consumers. Here is an example. Before 
the dollar dropped to 73 cents, when it was still 81 cents or 84 
cents, people would tell us, and this was quite common: ``Last 
week I went to the United States. I went shopping in the United 
States, because it was cheaper''. That was not necessarily the 
case, but that is what they said. And those same people were mad 
as hell about the lack of jobs in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	The connection between what they do as consumers and what 
happens to the economy and employment is not always clear in 
people's minds. A campaign to educate the public about the 
underground economy and the impact of acts of civil 
disobedience, which is what we should call this today, might 
improve the situation in the future and make taxpayers more 
conscious of their obligation to contribute to the public treasury 
through their taxes.
<P>
	The second suggestion made by the hon. member for 
Mississauga South also deserves our support.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	A limited amnesty for income tax returns of previous years, 
not future years, should not encourage more people to evade 
taxes. On the other hand, a limited amnesty for the payment of 
interest and penalties on unreported incomes subject to federal 
or provincial income tax could encourage some people, who 
must feel ill at ease from time to time even if this practice is 
almost institutionalized, to pay what they owe. People may feel 
ill at ease by not fulfilling their civic duty to pay their normal 
share of taxes.
<P>
	The third option suggested is also very interesting. Every one 
knows and talks about the fact, even if there are no 
comprehensive statistics about it, that renovation and 
construction is an area where the underground economy is 
flourishing. This is why a tax credit for tax payers who do some 
renovation could be an interesting idea to explore.
<P>
	In short, the three proposals and the clearness of the analysis 
are such that we, as the official opposition, will support the 
proposal of the hon. member for Mississauga South because it is 
an intelligent and articulated proposal which deserves to be 
examined in depth by the standing committee on finance. I 
invite my colleague, who will have my support as a member of 
the committee of finance, to present his analysis and to suggest 
various options to the committee, as he did when he tabled his 
motion.
<P>
	I also congratulate him for the clear thinking he shows on 
page 1 of his document when he says: ``In the event of-this 
refers to the present context-cuts in social programs and a 
harsh budget-probably the last budget, and even the first one, 
both were hard on taxpayers, especially the poorest ones-the 
government will be blamed for not taking action in certain 
areas''.
<P>
	I congratulate him for having the courage to recognize that the 
context is very difficult due to the budget measures taken by the 
finance minister who is slashing transfer payments to the 
provinces for social assistance, post-secondary education and 
health, and is also taking, as of this year, $2.5 billion out of the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	My colleague for Mississauga South has the sense to 
recognize that the government could be blamed for not acting in 
the areas where it should. He thinks along the same lines as we 
do.
<P>
	For the past 15 months, as you know, we have been blaming 
the government for not taking action in certain areas-we seem 
to be exceedingly repetitive, but we will keep at it as long as it is 
not done.
<P>
	First, when Revenue Canada is not given the necessary 
resources to collect unpaid taxes, which, over the years, have 
grown to $6.6 billion, according to the auditor general, and 75 
per cent could be collected, in his estimation, with the proper 
resources, I agree with my colleague for Mississauga South, the 
government could be blamed for not taking action and for not 
immediately giving Revenue Canada the necessary resources to 
collect the amounts owing, amounts which are not even in 
question. We are not talking about avoiding taxes and the 
underground economy, we are talking about taxes that have not 
been paid because Revenue Canada does not have the resources 
to collect them. The government is to be blamed for this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12821"> 12821 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleague from Mississauga South said, and rightly so, 
that we are watching the goings on in government and that this 
is eroding our trust. Every day, we make new discoveries-so 
does the auditor general each year-regarding more wastage 
and lavish spending. We also are discovering places where the 
federal government failed to close tax loopholes. On this point, 
I agree with my colleague, who had the courage to say that his 
own government failed to do what it should have done.
<P>
	They have to practice what they preach. When we see that 
people in government are still spending extravagantly and 
wasting money, for example, the trip to the United States for 
members of the Canadian armed forces for a rocket launching 
competition, holidays for diplomats at the taxpayers' expense, 
and when we see that the government just brushes these 
questions off, I think we must all admit that the government is 
sitting idly by, when it should be in action.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at compliance with tax laws. This issue has been in 
the news for the past two weeks. Once again, contraband 
cigarette shops are opening up all over the place. It is obvious 
and the government is not allocating the resources necessary to 
ensure compliance with tax laws.
<P>
	Here again I agree with my colleague, the hon. member for 
Mississauga South. The government could be accused of not 
acting where it should. All this must be straightened out, as far 
as the tax system is concerned.
<P>
	I am not talking only about the federal government, but all 
governments. Restore confidence, make the public aware of the 
consequences of not contributing adequately to the tax base, and 
give a good example. I think these are the essential ingredients 
to restore the social contract and to improve public finances.
<P>
	I once again congratulate my colleague from Mississauga 
South. The official opposition will support his motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise tonight to address Motion No. 382, which calls on 
the government to adopt initiatives to bring people out of the 
underground economy and back into the legitimate economy of 
this country.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga South seems convinced that an 
enhanced information system campaign, a limited amnesty, and 
a home improvement tax credit will do just that. Here we have 
yet another Ottawa Liberal politician pushing for reactive 
legislation to a problem, which does not address the 
fundamental question of why people go underground in the first 
place. It is for reasons like high taxes and confusing, complex, 
and convoluted tax systems, GST administration and accounting 
costs and the list goes on.
<P>
	To set the tone of my speech I would like to read a quote that 
was made by Alex Doulis, a very successful third generation 
Canadian who like many has simply packed up and left this 
county. He states: ``I left Canada in 1989 because I began to feel 
powerless. I could not influence the direction of my life, which 
was increasingly in the hands of the Government of Canada, and 
the government was deaf. The problem with Canada is it has 
responsible government. I was giving them immense amounts of 
money and they used it to perpetuate their power so they didn't 
have to listen to me. They were responsible for me, but they did 
not have to represent me''.
<P>
	The current income tax system in Canada is outdated, overly 
complex, and overburdens Canadian taxpayers. Many people 
have lost respect for this system because they cannot understand 
it. They do not perceive it as fair and as a result they are quietly 
resisting paying taxes by both legal and illegal means.
<P>
	The underground economy is evaluated at between $10 billion 
and $100 billion. High taxes stifle economic growth in every 
sector of our society, decreasing private sector productivity, 
increasing unemployment, and above all tempting governments 
to keep spending at current unsustainable levels.
<P>
	That is why so many Canadians are angry at politicians and 
what politics and government have come to represent. For me 
personally, rhetoric, regulation, waste, and arrogance are just a 
few words that come to my mind when I think about the Liberal 
government and the opportunity it has to effect change.
<P>
	The reality outside this fish bowl is that some people grin and 
bear PSTs, GSTs, income taxes and sin taxes while others choose 
to go underground to increase their purchasing power. All these 
people have to do to justify breaking the law is pick up a daily 
newspaper and read one of the many stories of government 
waste on things like grants to study blueberry jam, 
parliamentary junkets, MP pensions for life, and the list goes on. 
It is this type of negative reinforcement that encourages many 
honest Canadians to pay cash for goods, negotiate deals or trade 
their services, anything to avoid paying excessive taxes to 
wasteful governments.
<P>
	These are not simply my views, but those reflected in one of 
the first speeches made by our Minister of Finance in 1994. He 
stated: ``The rise in the underground economy is what happens 
when the population of a country no longer believes it is heading 
in a direction where we all benefit. The underground economy is 
not all smugglers. It is hundreds of thousands of otherwise 
honest people who have withdrawn their consent to be governed, 
who have lost faith in government''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12822"> 12822 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	He is aware of that. What is he doing to change it? Nothing. 
They still spend $40 billion more than they bring in every year. 
Unfortunately, Motion 382 is an example that the Liberals have 
done nothing to restore a sense of faith, equality, and equity in 
our tax system.
<P>
	Not only are these people avoiding Canadian taxes, many are 
moving their capital completely out of Canada to invest in 
foreign countries. According to the Bank of Nova Scotia, in 
1993 unaccounted for capital that left Canada was estimated at 
$7 billion. The estimated figure for previous years was 
consistently around $700 million. It went from $700 million to 
$7 billion in just a few years. That is frightening.
<P>
	The former attorney general of Bermuda puts this into 
perspective. I read this in a book by Diane Francis, Underground 
Nation, where the attorney general of Bermuda is quoted as 
saying: ``People in huge numbers are hiding money offshore 
because they feel overburdened or feel so unfairly treated that 
they think there is no point in keeping their money captive at 
home. What is happening is that high tax rates in Canada and 
elsewhere are turning what used to be hard working honest 
businessmen into tax evaders. The feeling I get from Canadians 
and certain island institutions is that they are getting a lot of 
Canadian money invested outside of Canada which is not there 
legitimately''.
<P>
	Why will the government not wake up? The best way to solve 
the problem of the underground economy is by making cheating 
not worth while, similar to the smugglers' bill: take away the 
profit from the smugglers and get rid of that tax and smuggling 
will end. Lower taxes are the answer.
<P>
	When people see governments like this one blow their hard 
earned tax money, increased enforcement from a government 
standpoint is an exercise in futility. Motion 382 calls for 
voluntary compliance measures to bring these people back into 
the mainstream economy. Voluntary compliance measures will 
have little effect on people who truly feel they have been 
wronged by the government. It is human nature.
<P>
	Although I do not condone those who knowingly break the 
law, the reality is that if governments do not play by the rules, 
what incentives are there for their citizens to play by the rules? 
Why is there a double standard that when you are a politician 
you get a pension plan that is three or four times as good as that 
of the private sector? Do as we say and not as we do is fast 
becoming the new Liberal slogan, replacing jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	Although the Liberals campaigned on integrity and a new 
philosophy of governing, I along with many Canadians feel that 
we are watching the same play in the same theatre with different 
actors playing the same roles. The names have changed but it is 
the same old script.
<P>
	For example, with Motion No. 382 a member of the 
government is calling for additional tax dollars to be spent on 
advertising to inform Canadians of the importance, the 
incentives, and the obligations to pay taxes. Where is the 
importance and the incentive and the obligation of the 
government to justify how it spends money and to eliminate the 
waste in government spending? Why is that not addressed in the 
motion?
<P>
	If the government has to offer incentives to comply with its 
policies then there is something wrong with those policies. Like 
the Tories, however, the Liberals do not get it. Rank and file 
Canadians are protesting the tax system in Canada and their 
concerns are not registering with this administration. Surely the 
estimated size of the underground economy and nationwide tax 
protests should have sounded some alarm bells within the 
Liberal caucus. Apparently not. Motion No. 382, for example, 
has an amnesty clause to encourage people to come clean and 
pay taxes they have avoided without fear of punishment by the 
government. Where is the common sense logic in this 
suggestion? An amnesty will only get people to pay the taxes 
they refused to comply with in the first place. How is that an 
incentive?
<P>
	It is time for the Liberals to stop these nickel and dime, 
band-aid solutions for problems with our tax system and begin 
the long overdue process of tax reform and tax relief. Attack the 
disease, not just the symptom. The Reform Party understands 
the difference between the two. That is why we have committed 
ourselves to spending reductions and tax reform, including the 
development of a simple, visible, flat system of taxation for 
Canada. The single most important aspect of this system is that 
it would be fair, removing the incentive for many to go 
underground in the first place.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that Motion No. 382 is targeted at GST 
avoidance, which indicates that the Liberals have truly 
backtracked from the campaign promise to scrap the GST.
<P>
	Our whole process of tax reform and relief would come under 
the umbrella of spending reduction and restraint. A Reform 
government would legislate balanced budgets. We would 
protect taxpayers dollars by reducing the size of the federal 
House,not increasing it to 301 as this administration plans to do.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	We would pass more responsibility on to provincial 
governments as well as individual Canadians. The time has 
come to put money back into the hands of those closest to the 
problems facing Canadians and, most important, those who will 
spend it best.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12823"> 12823 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, a Reform government would mean effective 
government, a transparent government with full disclosure. We 
would introduce proactive legislation to clean up the fiscal 
mess in the country which many Canadians are doing their best 
to avoid.
<P>
	The Liberals on the other hand will continue to propose 
band-aid solutions like Motion No. 382. I have a message for all 
angry Canadian taxpayers out there when they come to the end 
of their financial rope: ``Tie a knot, hang on, a Reform 
government is just around the corner''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always so nice to follow the doom and gloom party.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to speak today on Motion No. 382 introduced 
by the member for Mississauga South. Basically the motion 
calls on the government to consider establishing initiatives to 
address the massive underground economy that exists in Canada 
today.
<P>
	The issue is of concern to me and should be of concern to all 
Canadians. I have even managed to address the matter while I 
was vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts. I had the opportunity to ask one witness, a deputy 
minister at Revenue Canada, about Canada's underground 
economy. He said that a lot of the situations which caused the 
underground economy were for elected representatives to 
discuss and address. This is what we are doing today. My 
colleague from Mississauga South has proposed ways to address 
the problem I spoke about before the committee.
<P>
	The underground economy has a great deal of strength in 
Canada. The exact size of lost revenue is unknown, with 
estimates ranging from $20 billion to $140 billion a year. What 
is known is that each time someone participates in the 
underground economy money to help pay for our programs such 
as health care or education is lost and will most likely never be 
recovered.
<P>
	It is safe to say that we are taking money from ourselves by 
being part of the underground economy. We must ask ourselves 
what is causing this type of economy, one the Minister of 
Finance does not want to see grow. It could be the threat of taxes. 
It could be the problems with the Department of National 
Revenue. It could be the perception that the system is bogged 
down in bureaucratic red tape. It could be a lot of things. Is it the 
hated GST? For whatever reason it is real. The underground 
economy is alive and well.
<P>
	I hear stories in my riding of Victoria-Haliburton about 
welding shops which have gone out of business and now operate 
out of a truck and only collect cash. I hear of car body shops that 
only deal in cash, buy their materials in cash and pay their 
employees in cash. It has been said that there are restaurants 
which pay students cash and tell them not to report it. Some 
people have told me of contractors who continually give two 
quotes, a quote for cash and a quote for the legitimate way. 
Furthermore, some people have actually removed their  business 
listings from the phone book so they can work in cash.
<P>
	I know a lot of these people were never tax cheaters in their 
lives, but they may have been forced into operating this way or 
feel they have to operate this way because they have been doing 
it for so long and penalties would be too harsh if they come out 
and operate honestly.
<P>
	One part of the motion is designed to address the situation 
precisely. The second part of the motion is designed to give 
some relief or limited forgiveness on interest and other penalties 
payable when a taxpayer voluntarily declares previously 
undeclared income.
<P>
	Be honest and you won't be punished is the message in the 
motion. Another part of the motion suggests educating the 
public about the problem and encouraging its participation in 
solving the situation.
<P>
	Our tax system is based on taxpayers voluntarily filing and 
paying their taxes. It is probably the least expensive way for the 
federal government to collect taxes owing. However there are 
some who do not pay which gives some businesses an unfair 
advantage. In the long run, if every Canadian paid their fair 
share, we would be further ahead. Most important, we would be 
paying in a far fairer way.
<P>
	Nothing is more frustrating for small businesses such as 
contractors bidding for a job to lose the bid because the 
competition put in a low bid and an under the table bid.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	Another part of the information campaign deals with ensuring 
people realize the federal government, in particular the 
Department of National Revenue, is addressing the problem of 
the underground economy. In the future more people will be 
exposed for contributing to the underground economy and once 
caught there are some serious consequences to consider. 
Furthermore the information campaign must stress that jobs are 
lost when the underground economy flourishes.
<P>
	Canada must begin to realize that doing things above board is 
in the best interest of everyone involved. At the same time this 
part of the motion calls upon us as a government to help to create 
an atmosphere in which doing things above board is acceptable. 
There are other ways to encourage people to do things above 
board and the third part of the motion touches on them.
<P>
	The third and last part of the motion deals with giving tax 
credits to people who are doing home improvements or 
renovations. The idea is to diminish the two-quote system 
which already exists. It also creates a paper trail that can serve 
as a primary vehicle for the information campaign I mentioned 
earlier.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12824"> 12824 </A></B>
<P>
	We as a government must make sure that society is not 
punished for being honest. We must create an economy in which 
hard work and dedication are rewarded. We do not want to send 
out a message that it is all right to operate in the underground 
economy because everyone else is doing it.
<P>
	One of our priorities when we were elected was to focus on 
jobs and growth. The motion helps to maintain that message and 
I urge all members to support the idea of the hon. member for 
Mississauga South.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak to both sides of the motion 
presented by the hon. member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	One positive side is that the member is looking for solutions 
to a problem. I endorse that. I encourage members to do that type 
of thing. The other positive side to the motion is that it reflects 
what many constituents are thinking. There are constituents who 
are saying that the present situation is unfair to legitimate 
business. There are other constituents who are saying that we 
can work our way out of it.
<P>
	I refer to a letter from a constituent who came to see me in my 
constituency office in Nanaimo some weeks ago. His name is 
Gary Chandler. His thoughts were to give each taxpayer a new 
deduction on income tax which would represent 5 per cent to 10 
per cent of taxable income for improvements to a principal 
residence. Canadians have more savings per capita than the 
people of most countries. The measure would free up enough of 
that money to reduce unemployment. It would also cut into the 
underground market as legitimate receipts would be required.
<P>
	When I read the letter and talked with the gentleman I thought 
it was an attractive idea, that it was something positive to 
undercut the burgeoning underground economy. I am not an 
expert in this regard so I decided to find out what my colleagues 
in the Reform caucus thought. I passed it on to them and the 
caucus financial committee discussed it. They went at it in some 
detail. However they found that they could not support it for the 
following reasons.
<P>
	First, they said the taxes that would be forgone by this type of 
exemption would make it quite costly. The next point they 
brought to my attention was that it would therefore be necessary 
to extend the same tax privilege to other areas such as car repair, 
small appliance repair and household appliance repair. All sorts 
of areas would stand in line and say: ``Us too''. Before we knew 
it we would have a whole series of exemptions that would affect 
the way we do business.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	The third reason they gave was that it would move us, 
certainly as a party, away from our proposal for a flat tax system. 
A lot of Canadians are complaining about the tax system. We 
have to make it simpler and easier to understand. The forms 
have to be simpler and so on. This type of exemption would 
move us away from that area.
<P>
	The final reason they could not support it was found when 
examining the reason for having the underground economy. This 
is the principal one. The reason we have an underground 
economy is the same reason my colleague pointed out a few 
minutes ago. The government's spending level is too high. 
Therefore the taxation level is too high. We keep pounding at 
that over and over again. We realize we have a $550 billion debt 
and it is growing. We have to do something about it.
<P>
	The government is now taking some small steps toward 
reducing deficit spending. We do not feel it is enough, but it is 
the basic reason behind the fact that we have an underground 
economy. Unless we tackle that first we will not solve the bigger 
problems.
<P>
	I compliment the member for Mississauga South for raising 
this initiative and for trying to solve the problems. While it is 
reflective of the thinking among constituents asking how to 
solve the problems, nevertheless overspending and the high 
taxation rate on the part of government must be overcome first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the member for Mississauga South for his interest in 
bringing this important subject to the House. There is absolutely 
no question our Minister of National Revenue and members on 
both sides of the House are very concerned about the direction of 
our underground economy. The issue has the focus of all 
Canadians and is very important to all Canadians across the 
country.
<P>
	The greater the activity in the underground economy, the less 
revenue there is for governments. Underground economic 
activity creates unfair competition for honest businesses. Jobs 
are lost and honest taxpayers are forced to pay more of an unfair 
system in taxes when the underground economy flourishes.
<P>
	For many individuals and businesses the underground 
economy has become a convenient way to avoid paying taxes, 
not to pay their fair share. When these people take their financial 
transactions underground they are failing to support Canada's 
social and economic programs. These people do not pay for the 
services they use. Instead other Canadians are forced to pay 
more. Other Canadians are forced to pay for those who 
participate in the underground economy.
<P>
	I am very surprised the member for Calgary Centre suggested 
and almost condoned the underground economy and gave 
reasoning for it. It is serious to all Canadians that no one 
condone the practice. It is certainly not morally sound or fair to 
Canadians.
<P>
	People who deal in the underground economy may feel their 
financial situation justifies the actions. It may be because they 
have not had a raise in several years. It may be because they feel 
the taxes are too difficult for them to comprehend. It may be just 
because of basic greed. They see it as cheating the tax 
department. It is not a simple matter of cheating a victimless tax 
department. It is cheating friends, the people who live next door 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12825"> 12825 </A></B>
<P>
and the people who do business in the community. It is  cheating 
every Canadian, forcing them to pay more in an unfair system.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	I ask members as well as all Canadians to consider the real 
cost of the underground activity. The cost is large. It shows up in 
reduced essential services, higher taxes than we would 
otherwise be paying, unfair competition and a reduced standard 
of living to the honest taxpayers.
<P>
	How does the underground economy affect the legitimate 
businessman trying to be competitive? The Canadian 
Homebuilders Association is concerned. Home renovators who 
evade taxes have an unfair advantage over other home 
contractors. Right from the start, honest businesses are at a 
competitive disadvantage because they cannot offer the 
consumer the same deal offered by someone who will not collect 
the taxes. The end result is that legitimate businesses face unfair 
competition and jobs are lost.
<P>
	We must not forget dishonest consumers. Dishonest 
consumers who take a lower price and pay cash are cheating the 
system. They are becoming party to the evasion of taxes. These 
same consumers benefit from a full range of government 
services but are not paying their fair share. All they have done is 
take part in the transaction which jeopardizes our health, 
education and other essential services. This is simply unfair and 
very short sighted.
<P>
	The motion before us suggests the government educate the 
public and encourage its participation in addressing the 
problems. I agree Canadians need to know the facts about the 
seriousness of the underground economy and what it is doing to 
hurt Canadians. I also agree governments cannot solve the 
problem alone. We all must take part and fulfil our 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The government has recognized solutions to this problem it is 
now facing are not in isolation by themselves. We must 
understand the problem and its consequences. It is for this 
reason that in November 1993 the Minister of National Revenue 
made education a fundamental element to address the 
underground economy.
<P>
	During this past year, officials of Revenue Canada have 
actively been consulting with individuals and associations 
across the country. Revenue Canada is seeking support of groups 
and individuals throughout the country. With the Canadian 
Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, the department 
established a working committee to investigate the causes of the 
underground economy, to examine audit techniques and identify 
training that would assist in tracking down unreported or under 
reported income and identify the opportunities for reducing the 
cost of the administrative burden for compliance for businesses 
and individuals.
<P>
	These groups are taking the message of the risks of dealing in 
the underground back to their memberships. Every citizen and 
every business has a role to play in eliminating the underground 
economy. Individuals can start by refusing to deal with 
businesses and trades people who ask for cash payments. 
Businesses can do their part by turning down demands to do 
work off the books by making sure that does not happen.
<P>
	To ensure everyone is aware the government is serious about 
prosecuting those who deliberately defraud the system, the 
Minister of National Revenue is publicizing convictions for tax 
evasion. The increased publicity has had a deterrent effect. The 
number of voluntary disclosures received by the department in 
which people have come forward to correct their tax affairs has 
doubled in the past year. In addition, the number of referrals 
received from people each year providing the department with 
leads on potential tax fraud has risen to about 19,000.
<P>
	I am confident we are making the right progress in dealing 
with the underground economy and I am hopeful all Canadians 
and all members of the House will applaud the efforts of the 
member for Mississauga South for stimulating this debate in the 
House.
<P>
	I urge members of the House to carry the message back to 
their constituents. I urge the members of the House to actively 
seek solutions for the underground economy and create a better 
and fairer nation for every business.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.20 p.m, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.20 p.m.)
