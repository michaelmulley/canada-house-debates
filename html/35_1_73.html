<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALLIBRARYACT">NATIONAL LIBRARY ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage) 
</B>moved that Bill C-26, an Act to amend the National Library Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to introduce a proposal for several amendments to the 
National Library Act. These amendments will enhance the 
effectiveness of legal deposit provisions for the collection and 
preservation of publications that are part of our Canadian 
heritage.
<P>
	I would like to start with a brief presentation on the problems 
arising from the existing legislation and the purpose of the 
proposed amendments.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	Basically, the legal deposit provisions oblige publishers to 
deposit copies of all new publications with the National Library 
of Canada. The purpose of these provisions is to constitute a 
complete collection of Canadian publications.
<P>
	Under the legal deposit provisions of the National Library 
Act, publishers residing in Canada are required to send the 
National Library, free of charge, two copies of every new 
publication. As a safety precaution, the National Library places 
one of the copies in a preservation collection, to be kept there for 
future generations. The library places the second copy in a 
reference collection for consultation by universities, 
researchers, public servants and the general public. Users may 
consult the collection at the National Library or through the 
Canadian interlibrary loan network.
<P>
	However, the act contains a provision whereby publishers 
need deposit only one copy if the retail value of the publication 
exceeds $50. This provision, which has not been changed since 
1969, and this has created a problem.
<P>
	In 1969, very few new publications sold for more than $50. 
This means that the National Library received two copies of 
practically all new publications. However, in recent years, the 
publishing market has changed considerably, and today, many 
publications cost more than $50. As a result, the number of cases 
in which the library receives only one copy is increasing 
steadily.
<P>
	However, in order to continue to preserve our publications 
and offer services, and thus fulfil its twofold mandate, the 
National Library still needs two copies of each publication, so 
that it is obliged to purchase the second copy it does not receive 
under existing deposit provisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments being proposed would eliminate completely 
from the act the exemption for second copies based on retail 
value. In its place is introduced in the book deposit regulations, 
which are made pursuant to the act, new and more limited 
exemption criteria that would still permit the deposit of just one 
copy, but only in instances where the deposit of the second copy 
would in fact represent a significant financial burden to the 
publisher.
<P>
	The book deposit regulations are being revised and will be 
ready for implementation when the bill is proclaimed. The 
regulations would permit publishers of limited edition 
publications, such as livres d'artistes, to deposit only one copy 
with the National Library.
<P>
	In an effort to encourage compliance with legal deposit 
provisions we are proposing the removal of the specific fine of 
$150 for non-compliance as is stipulated in the current act and 
replacing it with a provision stating that non-compliance is an 
offence punishable on summary conviction, rather than 
continuing to build into the act a precise sum that needs to be 
updated periodically. The maximum fine of $150 in the current 
act has not been an effective deterrent for non-complying 
publishers because often the value of new publications is 
significantly greater than the maximum fine of $150.
<P>
	I feel that the proposed penalty provisions would allow the 
courts to determine the appropriate penalty, as well as to impose 
a more substantial fine if it were warranted. The act would 
however explicitly exclude the possibility of imprisonment 
being imposed as a punishment or for default of payment of a 
fine.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4508"> 4508 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to point out that non-compliance with legal 
deposit is already a criminal offence punishable on summary 
conviction. The specific reference to a maximum penalty is 
being deleted in order to permit the imposition of a fine up to a 
maximum imposed under the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	In order to ensure the deposit of federal government 
publications with the National Library of Canada, we are 
proposing an amendment to the act that would specify an 
obligation on the part of the government to deposit with the 
National Library all federal government publications. Although 
the deposit of government publications is currently provided for 
through administrative policy, there is no clear legislative 
authority for the policy.
<P>
	There have been consultations with English and French 
language publishers representing key sectors of the publishing 
industry such as major trade publishers, text book publishers, 
magazine publishers, small presses, specialist publishers, 
microfilm publishers, and publishers of livres d'artistes. They 
have indicated the proposed amendments together with the 
regulations will not impose any significant financial burden on 
publishers.
<P>
	During consultations, particular attention was paid to Quebec 
publishers because Quebec has its own system of legal deposit. 
This means that Quebec publishers must deposit copies with the 
National Library of Canada as well as la Bibliothéque nationale 
du Québec. Quebec publishers who were consulted understood 
and supported the proposed amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, the Quebec Department of Culture and the 
Bibliothèque nationale du Québec were consulted and had no 
objections to the proposed amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed amendments will make the legal deposit 
provisions in the act much more effective as an instrument to 
support the mandate of the National Library. They will ensure 
the comprehensive collection of our published heritage to 
support the research and information needs of Canadians today, 
as well as the future. It is a collection which is an invaluable 
source of information on Canada's culture and our national 
identity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-26 entitled an Act to amend the National Library Act 
proposes to update the provisions in the legislation governing 
the legal deposit of books with the National Library of Canada.
<P>
	Consultations with several groups affected by the legislation 
have led us to conclude that overall, publishers are almost 
unanimous in recognizing the validity of the legal deposit 
process.
<P>
	Furthermore, almost all praised the positive relationship that 
generally exists between publishers and the National Library of 
Canada. Finally, all of them acknowledged that a country must 
take the necessary measures to safeguard its collective memory.
<P>
	Legal deposit is an important tool, one that ensures the 
preservation of Canada's heritage and ensures that taxpayers 
have access to it. Under the current act, a Canadian publisher 
must send a copy of any book published to the National Library, 
when the retail value of the book exceeds $50. The National 
Library of Canada may acquire, at its own discretion, a second 
copy using money from its purchase fund.
<P>
	According to our sources, the National Library would have to 
spend roughly $700,000 each year to acquire second copies of 
books. Like most government agencies and Crown corporations, 
the National Library of Canada must operate on a tight budget 
and it no longer has the financial means to purchase second 
copies.
<P>
	As for the crux of the matter, this bill would require 
publishers to deposit with the National Library two copies of 
any book published in Canada, regardless of the retail value of 
the book. Obviously, in this context, ``book'' is taken in the 
broad sense of the word. In the current act, a book is defined as 
follows: ``library matter of every kind, nature and description 
and includes any document, paper, record, tape or other thing 
published by a publisher, on or in which information is written, 
recorded, stored or reproduced''.
<P>
	The second amendment concerns the fines that apply when the 
legislation is contravened. The bill proposes to increase the 
maximum fine payable from $150 to $25,000, in the case of a 
corporation, and to $2,000, in the case of an individual.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	The office of the critic for National Heritage consulted a 
number of publishers and I would like to share with you today 
some of the comments that were made as part of this 
consultation process.
<P>
	The government could take the suggestions they made and 
concerns they expressed at that time into consideration in 
making the related regulations. Incidentally, I deplore that these 
regulations could not be tabled at the same time as the bill. They 
are crucial, in the case of art books among others, but I will 
come back to that later.
<P>
	The publishers whom the office of the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata spoke to pointed out of course, as I 
indicated earlier, the need to be involved in the creation of a 
collective memory. They also described the statutory 
requirement under Bill C-26 to deposit two copies of a book 
instead of one, no matter what the retail  price is, as an 
additional financial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4509"> 4509 </A></B>
<P>
burden on the publishing industry. I repeat: ``an additional 
financial burden on the industry''.
<P>
	Furthermore, this requirement will be particularly demanding 
on Quebec publishers who already send two copies of their 
books to the Bibliothèque nationale du Québec and will now 
have to send two copies of all their publications, whatever their 
retail value, to the National Library of Canada. The hon. 
secretary of state referred earlier to consultations between the 
two libraries. The government's attention should be called to 
this duplication.
<P>
	Based on the information provided to us in a departmental 
briefing session, the National Library of Canada is planning to 
save $400,000 in so doing. The government is transferring this 
financial burden onto an industry it is already depriving of 
substantial revenues through cuts in other programs.
<P>
	The government could have been more imaginative and 
looked for an approach that would have allowed publishers to be 
compensated for the new requirement to deposit two copies of 
all their publications with the National Library of Canada. The 
government could have considered, for example, giving them a 
tax credit equal to the retail price of publications sent to the 
National Library of Canada. This would have covered the losses 
incurred by publishers as a result of this bill.
<P>
	I stress that it is never too late to do some good and that the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage can still review this measure and 
have it implemented in the best interest of the industry he claims 
to be protecting.
<P>
	One word about art books. These books can be sold for 
thousands of dollars. I have been informed that their average 
sales price is $2,000 in Quebec. The number of copies printed is 
therefore limited. Some of them require the co-operation of 
master binders, poets and lithographers and are so elaborate that 
they are referred to as luxury books. For these craftsmen, the 
legislation is costly, and I hope that the Canadian regulations 
will take this reality into account.
<P>
	When the Quebec government reviewed the legal deposit 
legislation, it chose to restrict the two-copy deposit requirement 
to books whose total value does not exceed $250. Publishers of 
books worth more than $5,000 are not required to deposit them 
at the Quebec national library. That is why we are very 
disappointed that the regulations accompanying this bill have 
not been tabled today, thus preventing us from assessing, with 
full knowledge of the facts, the true extent of this bill.
<P>
	Microfilm producers are particularly concerned. Production 
costs of microfilms, weeklies and dailies are high and buyers are 
few. I have been told that a micropublisher sells two or three 
copies of his work and that the National Library of Canada used 
to buy microfilms. From now on, micropublishers will have to 
provide two free copies of their work for the National  Library of 
Canada and another two copies for the Quebec library.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	When one sells one copy of a microfilm and gives two away, it 
is understandable that the Canadian microfilm society 
denounces Bill C-26 as a disaster.
<P>
	In its May 20 letter to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the 
society wrote: ``We want micropublishers to be totally 
exempted from the legal deposit requirement. Without such an 
exemption, we will be forced to completely stop microfilming 
weeklies and dailies and selling the resulting reels of positive 
prints.''
<P>
	As you can see, this observation and this appeal are very, very 
serious. Since the regulations are unknown, I would hope that 
the minister will note the micropublishers' concerns, especially 
since the heritage minister is well placed to know because the 
Canadian Microfilm Corporation is now doing very important 
heritage work. This corporation is the one that microfilms the 
<I>Courrier de Laval</I>; the first eleven years of that paper were not 
microfilmed and were lost in a fire. Without appropriate 
regulations, all of the <I>Courrier de Laval</I> and our weeklies will 
disappear from our collective cultural memory because they 
will not be microfilmed.
<P>
	On another topic, the government could also have taken the 
opportunity to combine in one place the documents to be filled 
in for legal deposit. In the consultations undertaken by the office 
of the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, it was mentioned 
more than once that what irritates publishers is not so much 
legal deposit in itself but having to complete various forms for 
legal deposit in Quebec and in Canada and additional forms for 
copyright and publication notices, to name only these. So I leave 
this suggestion for the minister to work on and remind him that 
if he acts on it, he will have the co-operation of the industry, 
which is fed up with bureaucratic red tape.
<P>
	I cannot conclude these few remarks without mentioning 
duplication.
<P>
	As you probably know, in 1967, Quebec passed a law 
governing the legal deposit of all Quebec works, and rightly so, 
since culture is essential and is what defines us.
<P>
	It seems obvious to me that the federal government should 
seek to conclude an agreement with the Government of Quebec 
to turn over to the Quebec National Library the management of 
all documents collected by the National Library of Canada under 
the legal deposit provisions. This would be a good way to 
manage public funds.
<P>
	Furthermore, such an agreement could include tranferring to 
Quebec everything from Quebec that the National Library of 
Canada has acquired over the years. By investing $2.5 million to 
buy documents in Canada, the federal government is 
appropriating archives that were made in Quebec and bringing 
them to Ottawa. I think it is logical for these documentary 
materials, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4510"> 4510 </A></B>
<P>
which  will be used mainly by Quebecers, to stay in Quebec so 
that they are available in French.
<P>
	I think that such simple measures would help taxpayers regain 
confidence in their institutions and show that we take taxpayers' 
interests to heart and organize for maximum efficiency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-26, an act to amend the National Library 
Act.
<P>
	This piece of legislation appears to be a housekeeping bill that 
makes the legal deposit provisions of the act accurately reflect 
the contemporary costs of texts produced today.
<P>
	This debate demonstrates the willingness of my party to work 
with the government to implement legislation that has a positive 
impact on expenditure reduction. I want to state that again, 
expenditure reduction, because I will be addressing that 
particular aspect as I discuss the passage of this bill in my text 
today.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	It has always been the mandate of this side of the House to 
oppose government legislation for valid reasons justified by the 
commitment that we made to our constituents for responsible 
financial management. However, at the same time we also 
provide constructive alternatives for the government as we 
present our arguments. This bill is an example of a case where 
we can support the government and the proposed changes to the 
legislation.
<P>
	My office has spoken with the president of the Association of 
Canadian Publishers. According to that conversation there do 
not appear to be any concerns with this bill other than a minor 
cost to publishers which they have indicated presents them with 
little concern.
<P>
	Publishers are currently able to deduct from their taxes the 
wholesale costs of the books which they are required to submit 
to the National Library.
<P>
	Our previous speaker mentioned a tax credit at the retail level. 
This is just to reiterate that there already is an opportunity for a 
tax deduction of the wholesale costs. In effect, the only cost to 
be borne by the publisher is the opportunity cost of the sale of 
the book. This means that the cost to the publisher is the revenue 
it fails to receive on the books that it submits.
<P>
	I support the intent of this bill. It addresses in effect three 
outdated facets of the legal deposit provisions of the National 
Library Act, all of which were in need of bringing into 
contemporary terms.
<P>
	First, the government has recently been in the practice of 
submitting two copies of all of its publications. Bill C-26 now 
makes it a legislated requirement to do so. What is being done 
here is simply formalizing an already followed informal 
practice.
<P>
	Second, individuals and corporations are fined under the act if 
they do not comply with the legal deposit provision requiring 
them to submit copies of their publication to the library. The 
fines were originally listed in the act at $150 for individuals and 
$2,000 for corporations should they fail to submit.
<P>
	In many instances, and this has been pointed out previously, it 
was cheaper not to submit and pay the fine than it was to submit. 
In such instances clearly the fines were not effective deterrents. 
Bill C-26 recognizes this failure of the act and has now tied 
penalties to the Criminal Code summary convictions.
<P>
	This is a good idea for two reasons. It increases the fines 
making them effective deterrents. As well, the Criminal Code is 
regularly updated whereas the act is not. Therefore this will 
have the effect of addressing the issue of fines more readily and 
as needed.
<P>
	Third, prior to this bill a publisher was required to submit to 
the library only one copy of a book if the book was worth more 
than $50. However, given inflation most books currently cost 
close to that amount in any event. This bill would require 
publishers to submit two copies regardless of worth except when 
such a submission would cause an undue financial burden.
<P>
	The only potential problem with the bill is the vague 
discussion of undue financial burden. I too express my concern 
that the regulations were not tabled with this bill. I would hope 
that when we get to committee there will further and very 
specific discussion.
<P>
	The bill proposes to replace subsection 13(4) of the act which 
refers to non-compliance with any provision of the section or 
the regulations. The specification as to what constitutes undue 
financial burden will be included in the regulations and clearly 
understood when this bill is discussed at committee.
<P>
	It is important to acknowledge that publishers which publish 
extremely limited editions and works of art not be required to 
submit two copies of the publication. The regulations must 
protect against causing unreasonable financial burden to the 
publishers.
<P>
	Speaking of financial burden, at the departmental briefing on 
this bill it was made quite clear that by making these changes to 
the legal deposit provision, the National Library would not have 
to spend as much on acquiring copies of books. The director 
general of corporate policy and planning for the National 
Library stated that should Bill C-26 be passed the National 
Library could spend between $300,000 and $350,000 less on 
acquisitions next year. It is difficult, in fact inexcusable, not to 
support a measure that could save taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4511"> 4511 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Given that the library expects this bill to save it some 
$300,000 I will be recommending to the Canadian heritage 
standing committee that the government decrease the 
appropriations for the National Library by the amount this bill is 
expected to save and I would strongly urge the government to 
support this recommendation.
<P>
	We have a tremendous opportunity to set a precedent here by 
passing a bill recognizing that it affects next year's 
appropriations. However, if the appropriations for the National 
Library are not decreased by this amount then this bill will have 
the effect of giving it a $300,000 increase.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has been asking for constructive 
ways to trim his budget. Here is a great opportunity to cut 
$300,000 from the budget of the National Library. Most 
important, such a cut would have absolutely no effect on the 
performance of the library.
<P>
	While we are discussing how this bill could pay taxpayer 
dollars we should examine the mandate of the library, for such 
an investigation leads us to the conclusion that there are also 
other ways to save money with the National Library.
<P>
	In these times of fiscal restraint we should revisit the wisdom 
of having both a National Archives and a National Library. It is 
quite possible that the mandates of these facilities overlap to 
some extent and that the removal of such duplication of services 
would streamline their efficiency and save this government even 
more money.
<P>
	I can assure the government that this kind of proactive 
legislation would meet with hearty approval from my side of the 
House.
<P>
	While I recognize that the changes Bill C-26 makes are 
necessary-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>
	With all due respect to the hon. member, she has made liberal 
references to this side of the House and how it feels. I would like 
to bring to the attention of the Chair and to the hon. member that 
this side of the House does indeed include 26 members of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not really believe that 
is a point of order, but I am sure the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast could be more specific.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast)</B> Mr. Speaker, everyone 
knows my party and everybody knows which party represents 
the government in the House. I really feel that was a rather 
innocuous comment to make and I am not going to address it 
further.
<P>
	While I recognize that the changes Bill C-26 makes are 
necessary I am mystified why the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
is not tabling other substantive legislation. This is a 
housekeeping bill. We were informed that his department was 
going to be implementing phase II of the copyright legislation. 
However, there seems to be some lack of clarity as to which 
department will be bringing this legislation forward. Regardless 
of which department tables this legislation, its importance 
should bring it to the House sooner rather than later.
<P>
	As well, the Minister for Canadian Heritage has stated that he 
is in favour of partially privatizing the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation. Canadians are anxiously awaiting legislation that 
reflects these comments from the minister. As well, the minister 
has stated that the only reason he has not filled the vacancies on 
the boards of directors of his department's cultural organization 
is that he is awaiting a report recommending changes to the size, 
structure and appointment process for these boards.
<P>
	This is the kind of legislation for which the Reform Party on 
this particular side of the House is waiting. We are anxiously 
awaiting legislation that reflects recommendations in that report 
and that starts to address some of the concerns that the Canadian 
taxpayers in this country are waiting for.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, the safe passage of Bill C-26 through the House as 
well as the areas just mentioned demand immediate action by 
the Ministry of Canadian Heritage. I strongly urge the 
government to act, thereby identifying other opportunities in the 
department that will save money.
<P>
	Rest assured my side of the House, the Reform Party, will be 
there to help usher through the House any cost saving 
legislation.

do not know if appropriate attention was given earlier to the 
Official Opposition's answer, but I want to point out the 
financial burden which will be imposed on the cultural world 
because of this double deposit requirement.
<P>
	The secretary of state said that discussions had taken place 
between the National Library of Canada and the Bibliothèque 
nationale du Québec. Therefore, I want to ask her if the issue of 
double deposit, both in terms of books and related money, has 
been discussed and if the upcoming regulations will take that 
additional economic burden into account.
<P>
	This is my first question. With your authorization, Mr.

secretary of state on this.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Chairman, from what I 
heard, there has been a great deal of consultation with the 
Quebec minister of culture, and I think that the regulations will 
accommodate everyone, while also reflecting the interests of all 
concerned. I say this based on what I was told.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux:</B> Mr. Chairman, I do not know if the same 
problem exists in other provinces but, in the specific case of the 
Bibliothèque nationale du Québec and the National Library of 
Canada, will the parliamentary secretary provide a precise 
answer to the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata 
regarding the issue of double book depositing in two libraries, 
which also involves a double deposit of money? Will the 
Secretary of State provide a clear answer regarding this issue?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Chairman, based on what I was told, 
Quebec publishers were consulted. They clearly understood 
what we were proposing and they supported the suggested 
amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux:</B> Mr. Chairman, my colleague is right, they 
supported the amendments, but with one qualification. It relates 
to the regulations which have not been tabled along with the bill. 
They drew the attention of our critic to the fact that they will 
have a double financial burden. The parliamentary secretary is 
right, they support the bill, but they want to know what will be 
done regarding  the double legal deposit. Did you think of the 
burden for the industry?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Chairman, I believe that the regulations 
will satisfy Quebec as well as the other provinces. Quebec has 
its own legislation, but I believe that the minister did everything 
he could to satisfy Quebec in this regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux:</B> Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for her 
remarks, but what we have in mind particularly are the limited 
editions, the art books. You know very well that some artists 
produce major works as limited editions. The legal deposits 
could then exceed the sales. You should consider this. What we 
suggest is that the regulations provide for a tax credit.
<P>
	My last question deals with another problem created by 
having two levels requiring the same thing. We asked whether it 
was possible to consider a single-window proposition, since 
Quebec already has its library.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Chairman, from what I understand, 
widespread consultations with both English and French 
language publishers representing key sectors within the 
publishing industry including, as the hon. member mentioned 
the livres d'artistes, indicate that the proposed amendments that 
we are suggesting today will not impose any significant 
financial burden.
<P>
	The member's fears may be alleviated when the regulations 
are presented. I know the minister has given an undertaking that 
the proposed amendments will certainly assist and enhance the 
publishing industry's interests rather than impede them in any 
way.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Leroux:</B> Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for telling 
me that our fears will be alleviated.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I will say that I raised the issue of 
micropublishing and of the problems facing microfilm 
publishers. This is another very specific example of a very 
limited production. These publishers mentioned that their sales 
were very low and that the National Library of Canada was one 
of their customers. Under such circumstances, I would like their 
very specific concerns to be taken into account.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> I want to reassure the member that we will 
look into the matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Chairman, I have a 
question on subsection 13(4) of the act and the replacement of 
the $150 fine. In the case of corporations it is being increased to 
$25,000 if they do not send two books to the National Library.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4513"> 4513 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has indicated over many months its 
position on young offenders, but it seems the government takes 
far more seriously a book publisher that does not send two books 
to the National Library than young offenders who roam our 
streets and commit crimes. The government has a draconian 
attitude when it comes to increasing fines to $25,000 in the case 
of sending two books to the National Library.
<P>
	The speaker for the Reform Party mentioned that these books 
were now to be delivered free to the National Library and that 
there would be a savings of about $300,000 to $350,000 to the 
government. If it is a case of trying to raise some money, I am 
sure $25,000 fines to a few book publishers would raise that 
amount of money and more.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And reduce the debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> They are suggesting that they want to reduce 
the debt. If they want business to hand them something for free 
and wield one mighty big stick worth $25,000 over its head to do 
so, it sends the wrong message to business. We want businesses 
to create jobs in the country. They are already handing $350,000 
to government through the bill. I would suggest it should rethink 
the size of the fine it intends to impose.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Chairman, my understanding is that 
proceedings were initiated in only one case which actually went 
to court.
<P>
	I am a bit confused by what the hon. member is suggesting 
because the amendments we are proposing are meant to assist 
publishers. They do have provisions for recourse. I am pretty 
confident judges will take into consideration any financial 
burden we are asking these people to undertake.
<P>
	The National Library of Canada, we have estimated, will have 
savings of over $1 million over the next five years with the 
proposed legislation. Does the hon. member not feel that we will 
be assisting Canadians by making sure they have a National 
Library that is the pride of the country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Chairman, I am not suggesting the fact 
that the National Library gets two editions of every book 
published is not in the national interest. The point I was trying to 
make was that these books are being donated, not freely but by 
legislation. They are being donated by the book publishers of the 
country to the National Library and we are turning around and 
increasing the fine.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary already admitted there was only 
one particular case. Why are we increasing the fine from $150 to 
$25,000? We have heard about inflation but this is ridiculous.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	This stick it is now going to hold over businesses if they do 
not send two books to the National Library is far too draconian. 
Therefore it should be scaled back if the government would like 
the co-operation of businesses to achieve its particular agenda.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Chairman, the reason we have 
undertaken this specific initiative arises from the fact that when 
the act was first proposed in 1969 it became quickly obsolete as 
books exceeded the value of $50 or the fine of $150. We want to 
make sure that we do not have to revisit the issue every second 
week.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will concede that there are matters 
of pressing importance. I have every confidence that the act will 
be interpreted in the spirit it is meant rather than in the 
exaggerated case suggested by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Chairman, if the parliamentary secretary 
is suggesting that the fines should be increased an exorbitant 
amount to take care of inflation over the next unknown number 
of years as the finance minister tries to keep his books balanced 
and inflation may get away on us, who knows when we will be 
back revisiting this point?
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier I hope the government will apply the 
same attitude as it introduces other legislation, for example the 
Young Offenders Act, to ensure that fines and punishments will 
be equally severe to take care of it for the next number of years. 
Then we can be assured that we will not have to worry about 
crime on our streets as well as book publishers sending books to 
the National Library.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. member for 
his editorial, but I am not sure it really furthers the debate today. 
My understanding is that the provisions are being supported by 
his party. In the spirit of co-operation perhaps we can proceed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Chairman, I 
reiterate that indeed the Reform Party supports the legislation in 
spirit. Given the concerns expressed by my colleague in the 
Reform Party, I would like to add that it is imperative assurances 
be given in the regulations that this will not cause significant or 
undue financial burden for the book publishing industry.
<P>
	I have heard that term several times today from the hon. 
parliamentary secretary without many specifics. There is an 
expectation that when we go to committee we will be accepting 
on good faith the regulations that will go forward because we 
have supported the legislation in principle. However, if it is at 
all possible, the parliamentary secretary should be somewhat 
more specific when she makes the statement ``undue financial 
burden'' that indeed there will not be undue financial burden on 
our book publishing industry.
<P>
	It is unfortunate the regulations were not tabled or at least 
addressed a little more fully in the debate this morning.

consultations with all major principals in the publishing 
industry and to date none have expressed undue concern.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development)</B> moved that Bill C-30, an act to amend the 
Department of Labour Act, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-30, an act to amend the Department of Labour Act, 
proposes to reduce to 50 years the age at which fish plant 
workers affected by the Atlantic groundfish crisis may be 
entitled to income assistance payments under the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy.
<P>
	When the government announced the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy last month the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stressed 
the importance of listening to Atlantic Canadians and their 
concerns.
<P>
	We listened while developing the strategy. We will continue 
to listen to ensure that its evolution is focused, cost effective and 
meets the needs of those for whom it was designed.
<P>
	The massive adjustment being faced by many people formerly 
involved in the groundfish industry demands a relevant, fair and 
flexible response from government that recognizes the specific 
situations of those most affected by sweeping changes to the 
industry.
<P>
	A particular concern expressed by many Atlantic Canadians 
was the situation involving older fishermen and older fish plant 
workers who have made a significant contribution to an industry 
in decline and whose chances for new employment are in many 
cases not good.
<P>
	The Atlantic groundfish strategy therefore includes as a vital 
component an older worker adjustment program for fishermen 
under the responsibility of fisheries and oceans and a similar 
program for fish plant workers under the responsibility of 
human resources development which I will be addressing today.
<P>
	Like the other components of the strategy the emphasis is on 
pragmatic-

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
taking over the job the immigration minister has boasted about 
his new process for hiring Immigration and Refugee Board 
members. However, it is time that the boasting stopped and 
accountability began.
<P>
	Since this minister began making appointments, the 
acceptance rate for refugee claimants has skyrocketed. The 
definition of refugee has been expanded well beyond anything 
the United Nations intended. Canadians are all too clearly 
seeing the pattern of the IRB when it comes to overturning 
deportations.
<P>
	The minister of immigration has heard the calls from across 
the country that the refugee board represent a real cross-section 
of Canadians. Instead, the minister has stacked his board with 
immigration lawyers and refugee advocates. It is time for a 
public scrutiny of the minister's appointments.
<P>
	I call on the minister to have all prospective appointees 
screened before the standing committee on immigration. If there 
is a bias, let us get rid of it; if there is an agenda, let us expose it.
<P>
	Canadians want a real balance and that means balancing the 
needs of migrants against the need for integrity of our borders. 
Let us start by ensuring that the right people guard the gates.

<P>

<P>
	The Prime Minister called it hypothetical, saying: ``If my

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Acting Prime Minister. Quebec's 
health minister has strongly denounced the federal 
government's decision to ignore the provinces by refusing to 
invite them to participate in the National Forum on Health, 
which will study all health care issues, in particular the 
financing of health care. Need I remind you that the Constitution 
recognizes health as an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
	How does the Acting Prime Minister justify the government's 
decision to not directly involve the provinces in the National 
Forum on Health and what is his answer to the Quebec health 
minister who asked him: ``How can health care reform be 
contemplated without the participation of the provinces which 
are responsible for delivering the services?''
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the federal government maintains very close consultations with 
the provinces on the terms of reference and the membership of 
the National Forum on Health.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I want to add that the proposed forum will not be a 
decision-making body; its only mandate will be to advise the 
government. I think we will be able to make decisions on the 
forum in close consultation with the provinces. It is not our 
intention to exclude them from our consultations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the acting Prime Minister is talking about 
consultations, I would like to know whether he endorses the 
position given by a source from the federal Cabinet, namely that 
the provinces were not invited because the federal government 
sees them as nothing more than an interest group, just like 
physicians', nurses' or consumers' associations. Are the 
provinces put on the same footing as these associations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the provinces have a very important role in the field of health 
which is recognized by the federal government. That is why 
there has been and continues to be very close consultation with 
the provincial governments on the terms of reference and the 
membership of the forum on health which the federal 
government is committed to create.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4519"> 4519 </A></B>
<P>
	We certainly have in mind to continue these consultations 
both on the terms of reference and on the membership of the 
national forum on health. We should also bear in mind that it is 
not intended that this forum be a decision making body. If there 
are decisions to be made at the federal-provincial level there is 
an ongoing committee of federal and provincial health ministers 
for that purpose.
<P>
	Instead, the purpose of this forum is to look at medium and 
long term concerns with respect to our national health programs 
and systems and to give advice to both federal and provincial 
governments on how we can deal with these problems.
<P>
	I do not see why this in itself is a problem for the Bloc 
Quebecois. Surely the Bloc, as is the case with all other 
Canadians, wants to maintain and improve our health system. I 
do not know why as a result it is asking these questions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, for your information, the Quebec health 
minister is not a member of the Bloc Quebecois. She is a Liberal 
minister, a member of a federalist party, and she denounces the 
federal government. As usual, we hear two different tunes as 
federalists in Quebec and Ottawa have different interpretations 
of federalism although they both belong to a Liberal party. It is 
not only the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Can the decision not to directly involve the provinces in this 
debate not be explained by the federal government's refusal to 
hold a public debate with the provinces on the eventual 
reduction of health-care transfer payments planned by his 
colleague from Finance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to repeat that it is the federal government's intention to 
work with the provinces in having a better and stronger health 
care system for Canadians. That is why the federal government 
is consulting with the provinces both on the terms of reference 
and on the membership for the national forum on health care. No 
members have as yet been appointed to the forum. Before this is 
done there will be further consultation with the provinces on 
membership.
<P>
	As I have said before, the purpose of the forum is to give 
advice to federal and provincial governments on strengthening 
our health care system. That is the way we are going to proceed. 
Our objective is not to weaken the system but to make it better. 
That is why we think that the Bloc, as is the case for all the 
parties in this House, should be supporting the federal 
government in its efforts to create the system, and I am not 
referring to provincial members but to the Bloc, instead of 
asking questions which suggest that the Bloc does not have the  
same commitment as the Liberal government to having a better 
health care system for all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Health unequivocally 
indicated in this House that she refused to assume her 
responsibilities in the area of public health as far as Canadians 
infected with the hepatitis C virus through blood transfusions 
are concerned. An estimated 5,000 individuals were infected 
without their knowledge and now pose a threat to others.
<P>
	Does the Acting Prime Minister agree with the absolutely 
absurd and irresponsible remarks made by the Minister of 
Health who merely suggests that people see their doctor and 
refuses to take action to identify those who were infected?
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian blood supply is 
widely recognized as one of the safest in the world. It must be 
understood, however, that blood transfusions like other medical 
procedures cannot be entirely without risk. Hepatitis C infection 
is a case in point. It has long been understood to be a possible 
result of blood transfusions.
<P>
	In spite of progress to reduce its occurrence by means of 
improved donor selection and the introduction of a screening 
test, infection happens infrequently. The testing of donors for 
hepatitis C beginning in 1990 has dramatically reduced the rate 
of transmission of this virus through blood transfusions.
<P>
	The Ministry of Health encourages anyone worried about 
hepatitis C to discuss their concerns directly with their 
physician or, in the absence of their physician, directly with the 
Ministry of Health.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would have liked the Acting Prime Minister to 
give his opinion on this and I will direct my supplemental to 
him. This is a crucial issue, in fact a vital one.
<P>
	Does the Acting Prime Minister not recognize that the Liberal 
government is making the same mistake it made in the early 
eighties when the AIDS epidemic broke out and that it is being 
careless about the threat posed by hepatitis C, since those 
infected can transmit the virus to others if they are not warned?

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the past several months Canadians have told 
Reform members that any proposal to amend the Young 
Offenders Act must include the following three changes: That 
the age parameters be reduced from the current 12 to 17 years to 
a proposed 10 to 15 years; that repeat serious young offenders be 
automatically transferred to adult court and that the public has 
the right to know the identities of those involved in criminal 
activities in their communities.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. Yesterday the 
minister assured the House that the Liberal caucus is unified on 
the need to amend the Young Offenders Act. Can the minister 
today assure the House that the Liberal government is unified 
with Canadians and will introduce these three specific 
amendments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government too has been 
listening to Canadians about the Young Offenders Act. Indeed, 
when we arrived in Ottawa in November consultation with 
Canadians, launched by the last government, was under way. We 
extended that consultation until mid-January. We received 
hundreds of submissions from interested individuals and groups 
across the country, all of which we have taken carefully into 
account.
<P>
	We discussed the issues involving the act with the provincial 
and territorial ministers of justice and attorneys general in late 
March. We have also engaged in broad consultation outside the 
parameters of those meetings.
<P>
	I can assure my hon. friend and the House that the changes we 
will introduce will reflect those consultations and will address 
the needed changes in the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate that the minister has been receiving 
information. My concern remains that the proposed legislation 
may not live up to the expectations of Canadians. Members of 
the Reform Party have repeatedly demanded that these three 
specific suggestions outlined in my initial question be adopted.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice tell the House if these three 
specific changes to the Young Offenders Act will be included in 
his proposal?
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can tell the hon. member 
that in the course of our campaign for office last fall and in 
statements that I have made since the election we have made it 
clear that we believe the maximum punishment for the crimes of 
serious violence should be increased. We have said there is a 
need for greater sharing of information about those convicted of 
violent crime who are young offenders where community safety 
is at stake. We have also made reference to a variety of other 
changes which will be reflected in the bill we will introduce 
within the coming weeks in this House.
<P>
	We have also made it clear that some of the more fundamental 
questions about the statute will be the subject of study by the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. At the same 
time as we introduce a bill for immediate changes we will ask 
the committee, for example, to look at broader questions such as 
the age application of the act. It will come back to us after 
consulting with knowledgeable people on those issues.
<P>
	Some of the items the hon. member has mentioned will be 
covered in the statute that we are going to introduce to change 
the act in the short term and many other important questions will 
be addressed by the standing committee in its longer term 
analysis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think my concerns are being verified with the 
suggestion that perhaps age will not be dealt with promptly and 
that is of course a major concern of Canadians.
<P>
	The minister has said that he has received correspondence, 
and we know that he has a paper called ``Toward Safer 
Communities''. The minister has invited public submissions on 
judicial reform in this effort.
<P>
	I would invite the minister to table these letters before the 
House so that all members can review the suggestions that 
Canadians have offered to the Minister of Justice. Would he 
table these responses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to provide the 
hon. member or any other member of the House with copies of 
suggestions I have received about the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	I can warn the hon. member that I have received quite a few 
suggestions for changes to the Young Offenders Act. Last month 
my office received 12,000 letters from Canadians and many of

<P>
	After trees were cut in the Oka pine grove, the Kanesatake 
band council yesterday authorized removing the pavement from 
a private road leading to the golf course, in order to expand the 
Indian cemetery. The Mayor of Oka called this action a

follow through the negotiation process which he just set up and 
entrusted to Michel Robert?

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

<P>
	In the past four or five weeks, I had several meetings with 
Christos Sirros, the official in charge for the Province of

colleagues.

houses south of highway 344.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure he will be happy with that. We have looked at the 
grievances of the people in the area. We think they are 
legitimate. They should not be responsible for the drop in value 
of their houses. It was not their doing. We have authorized the 
federal negotiator to proceed in an orderly fashion to negotiate 
with them at pre-Oka prices, to negotiate with Kanesatake on 
most of the issues and we are hoping to bring the matter under

Nations to come in and give a hand. We are working with the

the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Yesterday we questioned the government on both the 
accountability and the effectiveness of CIDA. Contrary to what 
the parliamentary secretary has told us, the Auditor General did 
not praise CIDA with a glowing report as was suggested.
<P>
	The Auditor General exposed serious deficiencies in CIDA; 
for example, a poor managerial system, a lack of focus, 
conflicting objectives, not to mention a lack of accountability. 
Will the minister now make a commitment that CIDA will 
become responsible to Parliament through real legislation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

question.
<P>
	As I mentioned yesterday, although maybe I did not make it 
too clear, CIDA is responsible to Parliament and very 
accountable through the annual estimates. The committee on 
foreign affairs and international trade can call the appropriate 
ministers before it. We can question the ministers and the 
bureaucracy of CIDA through the estimates.
<P>
	I mentioned yesterday that the Auditor General's office did 
audit three CIDA projects in three Asian countries. It chose 
three countries because it thought they would reflect the rest of 
the countries.

<HR>

<P>
	In its report it had some severe criticisms of CIDA, et cetera, 
but what I want to stress is when the Auditor General and the 
director of CIDA appeared before the accounts committee and 
the foreign affairs committee, the Auditor General praised 
CIDA for how quickly it acted to the recommendations of the 
Auditor General.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, we appreciate that 
response but I still think it comes down to legal accountability to 
the House.
<P>
	It is one thing to say that the accounts are there, but I think all 
of us realize how difficult it is to really look at those and to 
really analyse those as to the costs.

directly to the House?

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

authoritarian one can make an accountability than through

ultimate accountability.

question is for the Minister of Finance. Last May 12, the 
opposition asked the Minister of Finance if he could confirm 
whether negotiations were under way with provincial 
governments to combine provincial sales taxes and the GST into 
a single national sales tax. The minister replied, and I quote: 
``The answer is no''.
<P>
	Yet, we recently learned from the Canadian Press that a task 
force of federal and provincial officials was set up last March to 
try to establish a single national sales tax.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that he misled Quebecers and 
Canadians by stating that no negotiations were under way with 
provincial governments to create a single tax, when in fact a 
federal-provincial task force has been looking at the issue since 
last March?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

always said clearly that we believe, like the vast majority of 
consumers and businesspeople, that harmonizing federal and 
provincial sales taxes was desirable.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member realizes that discussions are 
always taking place between federal and provincial officials. 
There are many issues and we certainly have to get ready for the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, if

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

and the charter of rights will apply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question.
<P>
	Many Canadians would judge that the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms perhaps goes to the very heart of what being a 
Canadian is and why Canada is such a desirable place to live. If 
we would allow different versions of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms for different groups of Canadians we would perhaps 
destroy what it means to really be a Canadian.
<P>
	Will the minister of Indian affairs state that the same charter 
will apply to all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is talking to the 
wrong minister. I agree with him entirely. There is one charter. 
There are certain basic rights that are common to most people 
and cherished by most people. I cherish them and I am sure the 
hon. member does, as he has so stated. I agree with him.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Fédération des communautés francophones et 
acadiennes complained about the federal government's 
indifferent attitude and asked the government to do what it is 
supposed to do. A tall order, Mr. Speaker!
<P>
	So far, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has responded 
rather contemptuously by dismissing the executive of the 
Federation as a bunch of malcontents.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. 
Considering the ravages of assimilation and the widening 
income gap between francophones and anglophones, would the 
Acting Prime Minister agree that instead of attacking 
francophones who invited the leader of the opposition to explain 
his position, his government should concentrate on 
implementing a comprehensive policy for the development of 
Canada's French-speaking community, as requested by the 
Federation?
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B>Mr. Speaker, 
we are focusing our efforts on keeping this country together, and 
that is the best way to prevent the assimilation of francophones 
in this country wherever they happen to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as it 
pursues this objective, does the government intend to act on a 
request from the Fédération des communautés francophones et 
acadiennes to create a central agency responsible for 
implementing a comprehensive policy for the French-speaking 
community? Yes or no? People are waiting for an answer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

we already have a central agency. We have the federal

my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Canada is beginning to see some improvement in its economy 
due to the promises of the government. Canadians are still 
worried, however, about reports of uncertainty in the financial 
markets and concerned over the highly unacceptable 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance tell us what steps the 
government is taking to improve prospects for Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member not only on 
his question and his tremendous interest in this matter but on his 
analysis of the reasons.
<P>
	I simply point out that the member's position is shared by 
many others. Today the Conference Board of Canada released a 
report stating that Canada's economy would outperform all 
other G-7 members over the next two years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Conference Board's report is similar in this respect to a 
report by the International Monetary Fund which recently said 
that as far as growth and productivity are concerned, Canada 
will rank ahead of all G-7 countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I must say the member demonstrates as well how much he is a 
true Liberal when he raises the issue of unemployment. The 
government is dedicated to creating jobs for Canadians. That is 
why the 115,000 jobs we created are so important. Our social 
program reform and the rollback in UI premiums-

American overfishing of Canadian salmon on the west coast.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4524"> 4524 </A></B>

	Could the minister explain why this tough talk to the 
Americans has not been matched with a commitment to tough 
enforcement of Canada's conservation regulations on the west 
coast?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question of the hon. member allows us all to 
appreciate the work being done in Washington by the minister 
who is attempting to get Pacific salmon negotiations back on 
track after many months of American stalling.
<P>
	With respect to conservation measures on the west coast they 
are at a very substantial level. There has been no decrease of any 
material amount. If the member wishes to be more precise in his 
very broad and sweeping statement-I do not think it is a 
question-the minister or myself would be happy to try to 
answer it. However I would like to have the actual information 
on which he is basing his question.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been 
severe reductions in the government's commitment to aerial 
surveillance on the west coast, to the coastal patrolmen's 
service, and to DFO's enforcement budget.
<P>
	When will the government accept its responsibility for 
enforcement and put it at the head of DFO's list of priorities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to DFO conservation officers, the number 
of fisheries officers has been erroneously reported as being cut 
down to 85 by a colleague of the hon. member. In fact there are 
153.
<P>
	These fisheries officers are now specializing in enforcement, 
while previously they did a great number of other tasks with 
respect to habitat protection, stock assessment and other such 
matters. Thirty-three positions have been switched specifically 
to stock assessments, habitat protection and other such things, 
while 153 positions remain as enforcement and are specializing 
in enforcement. There has been no change whatsoever in overall 
numbers.
<P>
	Perhaps he and his colleague, the member from Esquimalt 
who seems to believe the numbers have gone down to 85, would 
like to check further to find out how in fact they made their error, 
because in fact errors they have made.

Speaker, yesterday in the House, the Minister of Industry stated 
that only the prime contractors associated with the EH-101 
helicopter contract would be compensated. As everyone knows, 
the government has yet to provide any compensation.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry realize that, aside from the 
prime contractors involved, several other companies had made 
commitments under this contract and that they, along with the 
prime contractors, have yet to be compensated for the 
cancellation of this deal? Is the minister aware of this situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Regrettably, Mr. 
Speaker, the previous government made a bad decision when it 
agreed to negotiate contracts to purchase the helicopters. In 
keeping with the promises we made during the election 
campaign and with our conviction that this course of action was 
best for Canada, this government had no choice but to cancel 
these contracts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The people of Canada voted for us, understanding that we 
were going to cancel the contracts. It is unfortunate that some 
will lose as a result of that. In the final analysis this decision was 
made for the right reasons and done on the basis of the support of 
the people of Canada.

answering my supplementary question.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Industry justify awarding 
compensation only to prime contractors, for the most part 
foreign companies, when right here in Canada and in Quebec, 
many sub-contractors do not have sufficient funds to convert to 
civilian production? How does he explain this?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
members would ask questions that deserved answers they would 
get answers.
<P>
	The point is simply that there are contractual relations the 
Government of Canada entered into with contracting parties. 
That is simple. Those contracts are being resolved now through 
a process of negotiation and discussion. The Prime Minister 
made very clear that there would be no compensation beyond 
that provided for in contracts.

the taxpayers of Canada. They are the people who sent us here.

three separate parliamentary committees regarding credit card 
user fees and continue to charge interest rates as high as 28.8 per 
cent on the outstanding balance of their card statements.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry intend to act swiftly to protect 
the interests of consumers in the face of this unacceptable 
practice on the part of retail stores, which is leaving some 
consumers in a state of chronic indebtedness?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to thank the hon. member for his question because this is a 
very important issue. Actually, interest rates on credit cards in 
the retail sector are governed by provincial regulations. This is 
nevertheless an important issue which I have discussed, in 
writing, with the president of the Retail Council of Canada. It is 
very important that we find a way to bring down the interest 
rates on retail store credit cards as well as those issued by banks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, since a conspiracy 
seems to exist among retail stores to maintain similarly 
outrageous interest rates on their credit cards, does the minister 
intend to hold an inquiry to determine whether these practices 
constitute an offence under section 45 of the Competition Act 
concerning anticompetitive practices?

	Recently the minister received a report on the funding of 
amateur sport which recommended the elimination of funding 
for 19 different sports. The minister acknowledged that having 
received the report, he was not prepared to make any further 
decisions until the report was examined. Then yesterday, the 
minister announced that two of the 19 sports so identified for 
funding cuts, biathlon and freestyle skiing, would not have their 
funding cut.

used to decide which sports would have their funding 
maintained and which would have it cut?

very pleased to hear there is certainly an intended review by all

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFLABOURACT">DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-30, an act to amend the Department of Labour Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
I was saying earlier, like the other components of the strategy, 
the emphasis is on pragmatic, meaningful measures to target the 
real needs of those affected by change and the needs of the 
region as a whole at a time of unprecedented transition.
<P>
	The Atlantic groundfish strategy is, in fact, the opposite of the 
band-aid approach that has characterized the previous 
responses to the economic crisis in Atlantic Canada. The 
strategy represents instead a long term investment in 
communities deeply affected by circumstances beyond their 
control.
<P>
	It is also an investment in people, including those older 
workers who have invested and contributed so much for so long 
to the groundfish industry.
<P>
	As members are aware, the Atlantic groundfish strategy has 
two primary objectives, to re-establish a rationalized, 
restructured fishery, and to serve as a catalyst for diversified 
economic growth outside the fishery.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4530"> 4530 </A></B>
<P>
	As such, the strategy offers a wide range of programs and 
options specifically tailored to individual career and 
employment requirements.
<P>
	These options include training activities such as literacy 
training, community based adult basic education, university 
study programs and entrepreneurial training.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	Green projects that connect environment enhancement with 
meaningful skill development in an emerging industry.
<P>
	Employment incentives to encourage participants to find and 
accept jobs.
<P>
	Self-employment assistance to stimulate business start-ups 
outside the traditional fishery and support entrepreneurship 
training.
<P>
	A community opportunities pool allowing individuals to 
develop and contribute to community based projects and 
initiatives where they live.
<P>
	Portable wage subsidies to allow non-fishery employers to 
hire people and provide on the job training.
<P>
	Mobility assistance to provide relocation support for those 
who wish to find work outside their community.
<P>
	Several adjustment programs for youth and of course older 
workers.
<P>
	I now want to address more specifically Bill C-30, the 
proposed amendment to the Department of Labour Act. It is 
crucial to note that when we refer to older workers in the east 
coast fishery we are talking about those from 55 to 64 years of 
age. The Department of Labour Act already has the authority to 
make assistance payments to former employees between the 
ages of 55 and 64.
<P>
	However, an amendment to the act is needed to include fish 
plant workers who will reach 55 within their Atlantic groundfish 
strategy eligibility period.
<P>
	It is this amendment, Bill C-30, and the compassionate and 
pragmatic reasons supporting it that I wish to recommend to the 
House today.
<P>
	The strategy was developed with input from all those affected 
by the change: the provinces, business, industry, unions, 
communities and, most important, those whose lives and 
livelihoods were so closely tied to a diminishing resource. Some 
of them will be part of a streamlined future fishery. Others will 
take up new opportunities in new fields.
<P>
	However, for many fish plant older workers there is the real 
possibility of falling between the cracks at a critical time in their 
lives. That is why the Atlantic groundfish strategy includes 
special considerations for their circumstances.
<P>
	The fact is that because of their long term commitment to the 
fisheries many older workers have no realistic prospect of 
finding other work or learning and applying the new skills that a 
fast changing marketplace demands.
<P>
	Although they are free to opt for the active training measures 
available under the Atlantic groundfish strategy, their 
background could limit the benefits to be gained from the 
participation in the strategy options and in the long run their 
chances of finding employment outside the fishery.
<P>
	In the public hearings of the Standing Committee on Fisheries 
and Oceans many plant workers acknowledged this reality and 
asked about the possibility of establishing early retirement 
provisions starting at age 50.
<P>
	This essentially is what the fish plant older worker adjustment 
program and the related amendment to the Department of 
Labour Act proposed; a realistic, compassionate, income 
maintenance option for these workers who have given so much 
for so long.
<P>
	Under this program eligible fish plant workers who are 
between 50 years of age and 64 as of this May 15 may receive 
income supplement payments.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	The program would be administered jointly by human 
resources development and participating provinces that enter 
into agreements. The cost would be shared on a 70 per cent 
federal and 30 per cent provincial basis. Eligible workers will 
have 90 days after they are informed of their eligibility to opt 
from the fish plant older worker adjustment program. They will 
then receive income support until they reach the age of 65.
<P>
	Income assistance payments will be calculated on the basis of 
70 per cent NCARP unemployment insurance benefits averaged 
over the three best years of 1988 to 1993 with a monthly 
maximum of $1,000. Until these benefits begin fish plant older 
workers entitled to TAGS will receive income support 
equivalent to their three year average UI NCARP rate less 6 per 
cent. The older worker adjustment program will be cost shared 
with the federal funding set at 70 per cent and participating 
provinces paying the remaining 30 per cent.
<P>
	For older fish plant workers the maximum cost of this 
program to the federal government will be about $60 million. 
We believe that 1,200 older fish plant workers in Quebec and the 
Atlantic region will participate in this program. About 75 per 
cent of those workers are in Newfoundland, 15 per cent in Nova 
Scotia and the rest in Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and 
Quebec.
<P>
	Let me stress that participation in this program is voluntary. 
Fish plant older workers who want to benefit from the strategies, 
training and career planning initiatives can do so. The concept 
presented under the fish plant older worker adjustment program 
is one that our provincial partners and those personally affected 
recognize as having specific merit and relevance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4531"> 4531 </A></B>
<P>
	In the past and under previous governments of all stripes older 
worker readjustment policies rarely refer to early retirement 
because it was thought to perhaps encourage voluntary layoffs 
and create pressures for a universal and expensive rush to early 
retirement. However because of significant changes in social 
values and work patterns in recent years and yes, in the 
economy, more people are choosing to retire before they reach 
65 years of age.
<P>
	There can be no doubt that early retirement is an emerging 
human resources issue seen variously as a source to reduce 
unemployment, as a useful tool in industry restructuring or as a 
viable bridge to new lifestyle options. However we do not use 
the word voluntary for this program since fish plant older 
workers affected by the Atlantic groundfish crisis have not 
voluntarily chosen to leave their jobs. The fish plant older 
worker adjustment program addresses the fact that these 
workers were forced out of the labour force.
<P>
	Precedents exist for the kind of initiative we are proposing 
today, for example, in Atlantic Canada. There is a plant worker 
adjustment program which already applies to workers aged 
between 50 and 64 years. The program assists older fish plant 
workers laid off as a result of fish stock declines in Atlantic 
Canada. It is now being terminated as it applies only to layoffs 
which occurred until December 31, 1993.
<P>
	Other examples of income support programs for laid off older 
workers exist, including the northern cod early retirement 
program and the program for older worker adjustment. The 
northern cod early retirement program applies however to 
workers aged between 55 and 64. This program was created in 
1992 to encourage a permanent reduction in the numbers of 
fishermen and plant workers laid off because of depletion of the 
cod fishery.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	There is also a program named program for older workers 
adjustment, POWA, which applies to workers aged 55 to 64 who 
were affected by major involuntary layoffs from all industrial 
sectors across Canada. The fish plant older worker adjustment 
program is a logical application of these initiatives. It is also a 
necessary response to a unique and urgent set of circumstances.
<P>
	I spoke briefly about the kind of contribution fishers and plant 
workers made to the economic life of their communities. Now I 
want to say a few words about the way of life that their work 
supported and carried forward through the generations.
<P>
	Many if not most of the people who need help now live in 
small communities where people count on one another in a very 
unique way. Their communities were sustained by a fishery 
resource that is no longer available to them. The real resource is 
the people and the people are still there.
<P>
	The future is theirs to create, but we cannot ignore the present 
needs. The skills of the past may not be in demand but the 
courage, the resourcefulness and the determination of the people 
are still there. This program recognizes how important it is for 
the individuals involved to maintain self-sufficiency and 
dignity in the face of unprecedented adjustment and change in 
their livelihood and way of life.
<P>
	As such, the government sees the proposed amendment to the 
Department of Labour Act as essential to fully recognizing the 
past contributions and future needs of these older workers. We 
have drawn on the knowledge and experience of many groups 
and individuals to produce this legislation and this strategy.
<P>
	It is realistic. It is definitely comprehensive. It reflects the 
principles and beliefs of this government so it is a fair and 
compassionate approach. It is designed to meet the kind of 
emergency which Canadians have not faced since the days of the 
Great Depression so it is innovative and effective.
<P>
	This strategy and its programs are based on sound research 
and wide ranging open discussions with the people who are 
working to meet this challenge. Those who looked at the report 
submitted by the task force on incomes and adjustment in the 
Atlantic fishery, commonly known as the Cashin report, know 
that serious people examined the situation and came up with 
some realistic ideas.
<P>
	The strategy is the product of two months of consultation with 
fishery workers and their associations and unions as well as 
representatives from fishing communities and from the 
processing industry. We have had the benefit of speaking with 
officials from both federal and provincial departments with 
responsibilities in this area.
<P>
	The measures we have brought together under the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy reflect that consultation. Premier Clyde 
Wells of Newfoundland is one of the provincial leaders who 
contributed to the development of this strategy and he welcomed 
the measures it proposed.
<P>
	In addition, the fisheries minister of that province, Walter 
Carter, called it a reasonable package and in Nova Scotia 
fisheries minister Jim Barkhouse said he was pleased with the 
strategy. Union leaders have welcomed the approach the 
government has taken both in helping people and in planning the 
future of the fish resource.
<P>
	In the red book and in the speech from the throne, the 
government clearly spelled out a commitment to fairness and 
compassion in introducing fishery adjustment measures. We 
reinforced this commitment a month ago in St. John's. Common 
sense and common decency demand that the pragmatic positive 
implications of this amendment receive speedy and unanimous 
endorsement from all members.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-30 reminds me of an old photograph found in 
the remains of a house which has burned down, because it is the 
reflection of the disastrous condition of the fish industry in 
Atlantic Canada, which is mainly due to the mismanagement of 
the fishery issue by the successive governments of the last 20, 
25 or 30 years. It seems that we could not find a way to get 
scientists, fishermen and governments together to deal with this 
tragedy caused by the near extinction of some species.
<P>
	One good thing about Bill C-30 is that it recognizes the fact 
that some people are in a difficult and unacceptable situation. 
We see workers who, at 50, 52, 53 or 55 years of age, have lost 
their jobs. These people had developed some expertise in their 
field. These were fish plant workers you could rely on, but they 
do not have the skills to find a job in some other line of work. I 
do not think you can ask them to relocate, because they often 
have lived all of their lives in the same community, where they 
have gone through some difficult times and witnessed the failure 
of the federal government involvement in the Atlantic Canada 
fishing industry.
<P>
	I would like to remind members that, a few years back, we 
often heard, especially when the Conservatives were in office, 
about cuts to programs aimed at protecting certain species. I 
may recall that at the time there was an agreement under which 
administrative responsibility for the protection of species was 
delegated to the Government of Quebec, an agreement that was 
adopted in 1922. Under Mr. Trudeau's Liberal government, it 
was decided to withdraw this delegation-this was around the 
beginning of the eighties-and today we see the disastrous 
result. In Quebec and throughout the Maritimes, we have seen an 
industry collapse, an industry that is no longer able to provide 
work for the people in the communities which had made a living 
from the fisheries for years.
<P>
	I often wonder what we are going to do about the industry in 
the future. It is all very well to come up with band-aid solutions, 
but there is a basic problem, a problem that will not go away and 
it is high time the government took the initiative. I think that 
along with the compassion reflected in this bill, which lets 
people go on living in their communities, we must find new 
ways to intervene so that our maritime communities can look to 
the future with greater confidence in the potential for their 
development.
<P>
	I think there are a number of questions that should be asked 
about what the government intends to do about the fisheries in 
the future. What will the fisheries mean to us? Will the people 
who worked in the industry only be able to pass on their 
memories of days gone by? I am reminded of what happened in 
the seventies-and it seems we never learn from our 
mistakes-when Forillon Park was created in the Gaspé. The 
government forgot  that people had their homes there, and they 
even asked them to leave. Today, we realize that we could have 
called on these people to develop tourism in their area, making 
sure that they took an active part in it and earn some money that 
way.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The measure is interesting, but we can wonder if it will be 
applied openly, giving the necessary support to people who have 
all kinds of initiatives, such as setting up community projects, or 
turning a small village or a town into a tourist attraction. I hope 
that they will not have to cut through the same red tape as others 
before them with similar projects.
<P>
	For example, in my riding, some people applied to the 
independent workers assistance program. They were told that 
there was no money for that. They are on UI and since there is no 
money, new businesses cannot be allowed, and yet it would not 
cost anything more. Is this kind of treatment going to be applied 
to workers who will retire that way? I hope not.
<P>
	There is another question one must ask. Will the agreements 
be signed on an individual basis or will it be a general agreement 
passed with provincial governments? Individuals should not 
have to face government bureaucracy alone. In their tragic 
situation, they must be treated humanely.
<P>
	This bill brings the retirement age for fish plant workers down 
to 50. Do they not deserve a lot more? Let us have a minute of 
silence. It is like a death in the family. The parliamentary 
secretary said earlier that in areas like Atlantic Canada, the 
human resources were the main resource. I do agree, and it is 
probably the mistake we made in the past; we dissociated the 
human resources from their environment rich in other resources 
such as fish and forests. And because people wanted to catch 
fish, and mistakes were made in stock management, we are now 
in this desperate situation.
<P>
	Should we not learn from our mistakes and strive for 
renewable development at the local level? I believe that there is 
a know-how to be found among the people who lived in those 
environments and know what it is to earn a difficult living, day 
after day, people who have also experienced seasonal work. If 
we do not take advantage of what these people can teach us, we 
will have missed the boat, we will not learn from the sad 
experience of these victims of our poor management of fish 
stocks. This bill is the result of the shortsightedness of past 
governments.
<P>
	The situation in the fisheries is also preventing the next 
generation from learning the trade. People will be retiring 
thanks to a bill which will give them a minimum income, but we 
should use their knowledge to give young people the desire to 
fish, perhaps for species presently underused, and also to 
develop know-how in the processing of these new species in 
order to provide employment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4533"> 4533 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that it is an acknowledgement that government 
intervention in the fisheries failed in Atlantic Canada and in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	This bill is more or less an acknowledgement by the federal 
government that it did almost irreparable damage. We also 
realize that it is preferable that the people affected be allowed to 
retire rather that try to retrain them for work in other sectors, 
because it is too late.
<P>
	I believe that the government should try, as much as possible, 
to humanize its action, particularly when dealing with the 
people targeted by the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-30 is somewhat like reparations, something we do 
because we feel guilty for what we have done. I think we should 
see beyond that. In conclusion, I hope that people affected by 
this measure will enjoy to the maximum the years that lie ahead. 
I hope they will see in this situation an opportunity for a new 
start and will put their own professional experience to good use 
for the future development of their community.
<P>
	I lived in the Gaspé Peninsula for a few years and I know that 
people in that region have good common sense, a quality which 
sometimes gets scarce the higher you rise in the bureaucratic 
machinery; I think we should listen to what they have to say in 
order to arrive at more acceptable solutions.
<P>
	Allow me to make a parallel with the forestry workers. In the 
area of forest management, the situation is similar to that of 
fisheries ten years ago. We are beginning to feel the real threat 
of a shortage. Some workers in the forest management 
communities have presented various proposals for a 
restructuration of forest harvesting that would allow the 
resource to renew itself and would prevent a situation similar to 
that of the fisheries.
<P>
	The government always finds a solution for people who are 
really at the end of their rope, who have nowhere else to turn to, 
and I hope it will do the same in this case and listen to the 
message being sent so that it will not have to pass the same kind 
of bill for the forestry workers in seven, eight, ten or twelve 
years from now because that would be absolutely absurd.
<P>
	In his speech for the tabling of this bill, the parliamentary 
secretary praised the whole government action program for 
Atlantic fisheries. I think we should also seize this opportunity 
to see what could be done in other areas so that a situation like 
this one will never be repeated.
<P>
	Other sectors of industry are facing somewhat the same 
situation. Workers who are 50, 52 or 55 years old and who have 
experience in a specific field cannot easily be slotted into other 
jobs. I hope that this example will serve to make the government 
more aware of the importance of treating other groups in this 
manner and of being as attentive to their concerns as they were 
in this particular case.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the government is less responsible for 
the situation that prevails in other industries. However, fishery 
is one sector for which the government has primary 
responsibility. Other players have always been asked to do their 
part and co-operate, but the guidelines have always come from 
the government. Moreover, it was the government that turned a 
deaf ear to the warnings that were repeatedly issued, either by 
the fishermen or by scientific groups, about the repercussions of 
actions taken in the fishery.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope that the workers who have lost their jobs 
will be able, as a result of this measure, to continue living in 
dignity, to weather the crisis and to ensure a bright future for 
their local community. I hope that governments will listen to 
their concerns and that they will be given the necessary means to 
get their communities back on track.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, we oppose this bill 
not because we do not care but because we do not believe that it 
is as realistic or as compassionate as the government would have 
us believe. We suggest that the bill is defeatist, that it shows a 
lack of faith in people.
<P>
	We believe that happy people are people who are productive 
and people who have some control over their own destiny, men 
and women who earn a living and provide for their families.
<P>
	People do not want to be pushed aside and told: ``Here is $750 
or $1,000 a month. We understand you are only 50 years of age, 
but that's it. Your life is over. You can no longer provide for your 
family and in fact you cannot provide a positive example for the 
younger members of your family''. We do not think that is what 
people want in any part of our country, let alone in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	We have a government which in the last election promised 
jobs and now all it has to offer is early retirement. The 
government estimates that there are 1,200 older fish plant 
workers who will participate in the early retirement program 
and that the cost will be $6 million to the federal government. It 
claims that 75 per cent of the eligible older fish plant workers 
will be from Newfoundland.
<P>
	It is okay to criticize what the government is doing but I think 
what is called for here are some suggestions on what we can do 
to make things better for these people. If I could I would like to 
share how I felt when I visited Newfoundland.
<P>
	When you get off the plane there and make a purchase you are 
going to pay almost 20 per cent in sales tax and GST. If I were an 
entrepreneur and I arrived in Newfoundland and I had to pay 
almost 20 per cent sales tax, I would probably get back on the 
plane and head right back out of town. If I stayed around long 
enough to take a look at what the personal income taxes were I  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4534"> 4534 </A></B>
<P>
would swim to get off the island. I think that is where the 
problem is here.
<P>
	There is a problem wherein we have a province that is not 
economically attractive to entrepreneurs to establish 
businesses. What we need is more fundamental change in the 
economy to make it possible for the economy to grow.
<P>
	What we do not need are more handouts. More handouts do 
nothing for people. They destroy people. They destroy their 
spirit and their will.
<P>
	On this issue I am preparing a private member's bill which 
will make suggestions for cutting capital gains tax which I think 
will be very helpful in this regard.
<P>
	Bill C-30 provides legislative authority for one part of the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy, the part to be delivered by human 
resources development. I assume the department believes it has 
authority for those other components of TAGS that it will be 
delivering.
<P>
	Bill C-30 therefore responds to one of the recommendations 
of the Auditor General in his latest report with regard to the 
previous Atlantic groundfish package. The Auditor General 
stated this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government implemented a program for which in our view no clear and 
satisfactory authority existed. At no time did it go to Parliament to seek proper 
substantive authority for its actions. Parliament was denied thereby proper 
opportunity to review and debate the government's proposed program as part of 
the normal legislative process, to decide on its objectives and to approve 
expenditures to achieve those objectives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Auditor General went on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government should present to Parliament legislation that will provide a 
proper authority for this program and for any future programs of a similar 
nature.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is to be 
congratulated for the introduction of this bill as recommended 
by the Auditor General. But where is the rest of the bill? Does 
this bill really give Parliament the opportunity to debate the 
program's objectives? No, it merely attempts to patch TAGS 
into a pre-existing legislative authority.
<P>
	Unfortunately this is not its greatest deficiency. Where is the 
legislative authority for those parts of TAGS that DFO is 
delivering?
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	DFO will be attempting to retire fishermen, their licences, 
and to create industrial renewal boards. This part of the TAGS 
program is without legislative authority and I call on the 
government to bring in the remainder of the required legislative 
authority to cover it.
<P>
	DFO officials tell me that the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans intends to use the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act 
as part of the authority. The Auditor General has already ruled 
that the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act is an inappropriate 
legislative authority. That act, the Auditor General noted, was 
passed in the mid-eighties to permit the government to 
implement the Kirby commission's recommendations.
<P>
	It is important to note that the Kirby report and the Atlantic 
Fisheries Restructuring Act were founded on the expectation of 
a doubling of the groundfish harvest. The Kirby report saw the 
problem of the fishery as one of finding ways to market the 
growing supply of fish, the oversupply, not the lack of supply.
<P>
	TAGS expects to reduce the catch capacity by 50 per cent. The 
underlying assumptions of TAGS and the Atlantic Fisheries 
Restructuring Act are incompatible.
<P>
	The Kirby report said that one of the bright spots in the fishery 
was the outlook for the harvest, that by 1987 the cod catch would 
be more than triple the 1976 harvest. The total groundfish catch 
will have more than doubled.
<P>
	The act expanded the catch potential and the fish were caught. 
Now there are none. Let us have done with any talk of using the 
Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act to deliver any part of 
TAGS. I call on the government to bring in to the House a 
comprehensive bill that would outline its objectives and would 
give it the necessary authority to carry out the needed changes in 
the Atlantic groundfishery.
<P>
	Dwindling stocks, caused in part by a failure to manage the 
fishery, created the need for TAGS. While the government is 
spending nearly $2 billion on TAGS due to this failure to 
manage the fishery, it is not even maintaining existing 
surveillance and enforcement programs on the east coast.
<P>
	No better case exemplifies the willingness to allow this 
important infrastructure to run down than the letting of the 
contract for the fisheries observers in the Scotia-Fundy region 
earlier this year. The government did not even follow its own 
tendering rules. The tender requirements were manipulated in 
order to give the contract to a company that had no experience 
with foreign vessels and the offshore fishery.
<P>
	The company has been allowed to use observers without the 
necessary experience. There has already been overfishing as a 
result. There have been published reports in sector 3-0 of 
vessels without observers catching undersized fish and dumping 
the unwanted fish at sea. There have been problems with Cuban 
vessels in the silver hake fisheries which by law must have 
observers on every vessel. The Cubans are fishing in Canadian 
waters without experienced observers on board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4535"> 4535 </A></B>
<P>
	This makes a mockery of TAGS. The improprieties in the 
letting of this observer contract are too numerous to list today, 
but I do want to comment on one further problem that came to 
my attention this morning.
<P>
	Fisheries observers this morning told me that those fisheries 
observers who appeared before the standing committee only a 
few weeks ago have been blacklisted by the new observer 
contractor who has refused to hire them simply because they 
came to Ottawa and addressed the committee on the 
improprieties on the letting of this contract. If that were not bad 
enough, there is also an investigation under way into allegations 
against the chief of the fisheries observer program in Halifax as 
to his involvement in the letting of the observer contract.
<P>
	The investigator was to have submitted his report today. The 
investigator told my office this morning that the investigation 
had been delayed for perhaps two weeks.
<P>
	I call on the government to explain the status of this 
investigation into the chief of the observer program and to 
explain why DFO has delayed the completion and release of the 
investigator's report.
<P>
	In his report the Auditor General noted two other items I think 
worth mentioning. He said that the government had difficulty in 
targeting payments only to those clearly affected by the 
moratorium. What he means in this regard, as I understand it, is 
first that it is very difficult to define who those plant workers are 
who were directly involved, and second many people who are 
not covered by this program were as well seriously affected by 
the decline in fish stocks.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	The other point that he makes, and I think again it is very 
appropriate, is that fewer people than expected were taking 
training that would lead to work outside the fishery or were 
taking up retirement options in response to the adjustment 
component of this program.
<P>
	What we have to do is help people overcome the difficulties 
that have been forced on them by this program, not simply to 
give them a handout and say: ``Here it is, take this, go away. We 
do not want to hear from you again''. We must provide 
opportunity for people so that they can lead successful and 
happy lives.
<P>
	We on this side of the House envision an east coast fishery that 
is viable, self-sufficient and sustainable. We believe that the 
fishery can and should be a cornerstone of a more diversified 
economy in Atlantic Canada. We are confident Atlantic 
Canadians can compete in a world economy.
<P>
	The government would have Atlantic Canadians living 
dependent on government handouts and in a constant state of 
instability. It is the desire of Reform members to encourage the 
implementation of a comprehensive program of change which 
would see the people of Atlantic Canada not only working but 
working in an environment that is both profitable and satisfying.
<P>
	On the other hand the implementation of the government's 
plans will be to perpetuate the tragedy that is currently taking 
place in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise and speak on this bill, a bill 
that has great significance to me and to my riding, indeed my 
province and my section of Canada.
<P>
	I had to redo the presentation that I prepared because I was 
assuming that this bill would get unanimous support in the 
House. I was surprised and I might even say disturbed to find 
that this bill does not have the support of the Reform Party. 
Perhaps if I had been here last week I would have known about 
this. I fail to see the logic of why it cannot accept this bill. 
Perhaps later during the debate today some hon. members from 
that party will be able to express to the people of Newfoundland 
and to Atlantic Canada why they do not find it in their hearts to 
support this bill.
<P>
	I think it is a very important bill. It is important to the people 
of Newfoundland. It is important to those plant workers in this 
particular case who have been employed in the industry all their 
lives, generations, who have not been able to and are unlikely to 
find work with the devastation of the industry.
<P>
	Rather than speak directly on the bill, perhaps with the idea of 
having the Reform Party revise its outlook on this, I would like 
to give some indication of the proportion of this tremendous 
catastrophe that has befallen us. I am not going to attribute 
blame. I am not going to talk about the politics. I am going to 
give the dimension of it.
<P>
	I can appreciate that those outside the fishery would find it 
very difficult to understand what has befallen those people in 
Atlantic Canada through the loss of the groundfish. They know 
now the industry may not be allowed to rebound for a decade. 
The best scientific advice is five to seven years.
<P>
	To understand the proportion of this catastrophe, in terms of 
the Cashin report it is a called a famine of biblical proportions. I 
do not think that is an exaggeration.
<P>
	The sea is to those who fish like land is to those who farm. 
Any farmers here or representatives of farmers would appreciate 
what that statement means. Fishing, like farming, is more than a 
job because the relationship of the fisher to the sea is more than 
economic. It is organic. It is a way of life. It is a community.
<P>
	I come from a family which has been in the fishing industry 
for seven generations. My grandfather was in the business until 
he was 66. He was in it from the time he was a young man.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4536"> 4536 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a sense of belonging. There is a sense of 
accomplishment. There is a sense of community. There is a 
sense of past, present and future involved in this kind of organic 
relationship, in this case, to the sea and to the fishing industry. I 
cannot think of any more global terms or inextricably linked 
terms in which to put it.
<P>
	Having said that, the devastation of the industry affects not 
just one industry towns. It is not a question of Catalina, 
Bonavista, Port Union, Melrose or a single town, it is a whole 
coastal area. In the cases I just talked about, it is the whole 
Bonavista peninsula. The plant in Port Union that employed 
1,200 people supported 65 communities. That plant's closing 
down essentially means that most of the working population for 
men and women will not have jobs, not just in the three or four 
communities that are served by this plant but by 65 
communities. I know that is hard to realize.
<P>
	Again I would like to express the importance of the industry to 
Atlantic Canada. The parliamentary secretary said that in the 
case of this bill, 75 per cent of those affected are from 
Newfoundland. I want to concentrate on Newfoundland because 
that is the area I know the most about.
<P>
	We have very few centres in Newfoundland that are not 
dependent on the fisheries. I will give the exceptions in case 
there is any doubt in anybody's mind. We have three pulp and 
paper towns, Corner Brook, Grand Falls and Stephenville. There 
is one mining town in Labrador City. There is one town that is 
based on hydroelectricity and that is Churchill Falls. There are a 
handful of very small farming communities. I have a few in my 
riding, I suppose the best known is Codroy. There are also 
several administrative and business centres like St. John's and 
Gander.
<P>
	Almost all of the other 800 communities in the province 
depend entirely on the fisheries. Indirectly, even the 
administrative and the business centres that I talked about 
depend on the fisheries as they exist in large measure to provide 
services to the fishery dependent communities. The loss of 
groundfish fishery for a period of five to ten years can trigger the 
collapse of whole coastal areas, as I talked about earlier.
<P>
	Let me be more specific and quote figures for those who may 
not be as familiar with this as some others in the House. Almost 
every fourth person in the goods producing sector in 
Newfoundland relied on the fishery-one in four. Regarding the 
plant worker, viewed from the manufacturing sector, every 
second person was engaged in fish processing, which is now 
virtually wiped out.
<P>
	Let me talk to my colleagues from Ontario and perhaps from 
Quebec. If a calamity of similar magnitude befell Ontario's 
manufacturing industry some 800,000 people would lose their 
jobs. In Newfoundland 16 per cent of the total workforce 
depends on the fishery for all  of its income compared with 2.6 
per cent in Ontario in manufacturing, auto industry.
<P>
	If you compare 16 per cent in one province with 2.6 per cent 
related to the auto industry, putting this another way, the 
devastation of the fishery in Newfoundland has the same effect 
as five times closing down the automobile industry in Ontario.
<P>
	You are from Ontario, Mr. Speaker. I do not have to tell you 
what that would mean. That is another indication of the kind of 
proportion that we are talking about.
<P>
	Let me go back a few years, the year that I was elected, 1988. 
Harvesting and processing in the fishing industry provided 
employment income to about 48,000 people, which generated a 
total income of approximately $700 million a year.
<P>
	In 1994, 1995 and beyond much of this purchasing power, 
sustaining thousands of families in hundreds of communities 
along the coastal areas, will be severely reduced.
<P>
	I have 260 communities in my riding. Everyone relates to the 
factors that I mentioned. As a result, the majority of these 
people and their families will suffer sustained income loss. I am 
just talking about the families and those who are directly 
affected.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I want to talk now about the cumulative effect. What is the 
second, third or fourth order effect? The multiplier effect will 
reverberate through an already weak economy. The official 
unemployment rate hovers at about 25 per cent, but the 
unofficial rate is over 50 per cent. I do not have to tell many 
people in the House that this is the case.
<P>
	People say to me that I have Hibernia in my riding. Hibernia 
cannot be viewed as a significant offset to the devastating 
problem in the fishery. It cannot absorb all the communities. It 
cannot absorb the unemployed. In many cases it cannot even 
cope with the training period, the training opportunities and the 
skills that are developed. It could cope with some, yes, but 
Hibernia at its height could not even cope. We are talking about 
48,000 people.
<P>
	If no compensation measures are taken, the large and small 
fishery dependent communities I talked about will face total 
economic and social collapse. There are other results as well: 
the compensation expenditures, the retail trade, and the 
financial viability. I have had people say to me that they 
appreciate my standing up for fisherpersons and plant workers 
but that there are construction workers and other people who do 
not have jobs. I appreciate that and try to do what I can for them 
as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4537"> 4537 </A></B>
<P>
	The point of the matter is that if I do not support those in the 
fishing industry and the compensation is not there, the corner 
grocery stores will shut down and the butcher shops will shut 
down. I suppose eventually the schools will shut down because 
there will be no pupils to send; there will not be any people left.
<P>
	This money does more than compensate those directly 
involved. It keeps stores going and all the second, third and 
fourth derivatives. It is not only that. If there is no 
compensation, government revenues will decline. There will be 
another effect which does not affect us directly in the House of 
Commons. As a Newfoundlander I concern myself with its 
provincial budget. In 1992-93, $180 million was spent on social 
welfare in large part to look after people who had not been able 
to get compensation in the fishery or who had gone through their 
unemployment insurance related to the fishery and could not 
qualify.
<P>
	In the budget of March 17, 1994 tabled by the Newfoundland 
government it was noted that 13.6 per cent of all expenditure in 
Newfoundland would be for social welfare. That is a sad note. It 
is even sadder to say that in this coming fiscal year there will be 
$29 million more needed than the year before to look after social 
cases, those unfortunate people who have not been able to 
qualify. I could go on but I think I have made my point.
<P>
	It was suggested that maybe governments of the past had 
made mistakes. I know they have made mistakes. Governments 
are not perfect but governments have responsibility for these 
kinds of disasters. The government certainly has responsibility 
now to help affected individuals adjust to the calamity of losing 
their livelihood and with no hope of it being replaced.
<P>
	Plant workers who were 50 years of age as of last May 15 or 
would be 55 years of age over the course of TAGS, the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy program, very much apply in this case. It is 
the responsibility of the government to look after them. It has a 
responsibility toward fishery dependent communities to help 
them adjust. This is true throughout Atlantic Canada but 
particularly in those coastal regions primarily dependent on 
groundfish.
<P>
	The southern and northern coasts of Trinity Bay, all of 
Bonavista Bay and in many cases the northern part of 
Conception Bay have been wiped out. I mentioned the Bonavista 
peninsula earlier.
<P>
	There is a responsibility to the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. They have a responsibility themselves because they 
are dramatically affected as a society. To adjust to the disaster or 
the economic and social consequences is a necessity. It is not 
something that is just desirable or could be done; it is something 
that should be done and has to be done.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	We cannot take conventional approaches to these kinds of 
adjustments. I agreed with something said on the other side a 
few moments ago, that some old methods of the past have not 
worked. I do not disagree with that.
<P>
	In the summary of the report of the fisheries committee, 
particularly with respect to witnesses from Newfoundland on 
March 31, the chairman said that we would fail if we tried to be 
100 per cent successful. I agree. We are not going to be 100 per 
cent successful.
<P>
	I appeal to the Reform Party that is not going to support the 
bill that Bill C-30 is a measure of success which I do not think 
should be downgraded or denigrated. It should be viewed in the 
total package. It is one part of the package and I happen to think 
this part is successful.
<P>
	The task is too great to be undertaken in the way things have 
been done in the past. The key to shaping the fishery of the 
future and dealing with appropriate adjustment programs will be 
involving the affected people through their own programs and 
through their own institutions: fishermen and industry 
organizations, co-operatives and community organizations. 
That was done in the Cashin report. That was done in the 
fisheries committee when it was reviewing this matter. That was 
done by the minister and his staff. That was done by the human 
resources minister in advance of the bill.
<P>
	Sending in outsiders, however well intentioned, to sit fishery 
workers down in classrooms and tell them about the future in 
itself will not inspire confidence among those whose livelihoods 
have been destroyed. Unless governments in partnership with 
the industry and the people affected can shape a credible vision 
of hope, the coastal society of Atlantic Canada will be consumed 
by anxiety and despair. I do not believe there is one member of 
any party or an individual member of the House who would want 
that to happen.
<P>
	I have spent most of my time putting the bill into perspective. 
I have relied on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development to talk about the details of the 
bill. Bill C-30 is a very simple bill. It basically says that the 
minister may enter into an agreement referred to in a subsection 
of the Department of Labour Act to have the act apply to former 
employees who are less than 55 years of age. The condition is 
that former employees must be 50 years of age or more as of 
May 15 past. Significant to the debate is former employees of 
fish plants whose employment has been terminated by reason of 
a permanent reduction in the workforce at the plants because of a 
decline in fish stocks.
<P>
	I say to those who do not support the bill that I have 57 
processing plants in my riding. They will not look kindly on any 
member of the House who says that it is imperfect, that it is not 
totally the government's responsibility, that Newfoundlanders 
are being shortchanged and this is just adding to the situation, or  
for any other reason. Those who have run out of dollars to 
support their families and who are at an age when their prospects 
of finding work in a province where the unofficial unemploy-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4538"> 4538 </A></B>
<P>
ment rate is close to 50 per cent would not take too kindly to that 
either.
<P>
	I stand as a member of the House, as a spokesman for my 
party, to say that we appreciate the disastrous proportions of the 
calamity that has beset Newfoundland. Whose responsibility is 
it? I could spend the rest of the day attributing blame and I 
probably would not be right. I might feel a bit better, but it would 
not do much for those people who have been affected.
<P>
	I am saying to all members in the House who do not support 
the bill to take the perspective I have given, to take into 
consideration the 1,200 people and their families directly 
affected by the bill, and to take into consideration the possibility 
of anxiety and difficulty of living, of getting up in the morning, 
supporting themselves and sending their kids to school. Many of 
the 50-year old plant workers have young children. I know them 
individually. A proportion of the 1,200 plant workers in the 57 
plants in my riding will be watching the newscast on their 
televisions today and reading the Evening Telegram or their 
local papers. They will be very pleased that at second reading of 
the bill this member, this party and this government gave full 
and total support to a bill that I believe is one of the most 
important bills the House has ever seen.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very impressed by the passion displayed by the 
hon. member in his presentation and the quality of the 
arguments put forward, but I would have a brief comment to 
make.
<P>
	I would have liked him to have displayed and to display the 
same passion on the UI entrance requirement issue. So, here is 
my question: if we are going to be this compassionate and 
supportive of plant workers confronted to the difficult situation 
of finding themselves jobless and unable to find a new job, how 
does he reconcile this position, these impassioned and perfectly 
justified remarks with the provisions concerning 50-year old 
workers?
<P>
	How does he reconcile that with the changes made to the 
unemployment policy, changes which, as it is, will affect mainly 
the provinces he is particularly concerned for?
<P>
	Let me give you an example. In the Magdalen Islands, last 
year, 43 per cent of UI recipients could barely meet the 
minimum 10-week requirement. With the proposed changes to 
the Unemployment Insurance Act, many of these people will be 
forced onto the welfare rolls.
<P>
	I was wondering if the hon. member would not see fit to make 
on their behalf representations similar to those he has just made 
to his government regarding the increase in the number of weeks 
of work required to qualify for unemployment insurance and the 
reduction of the benefit period. Could he not put the same 
arguments to his government, and particularly to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, to be realistic and show 
compassion for the workers affected because fish plant workers 
seldom manage to find work for more than 10 weeks?
<P>
	Would the hon. member be prepared to make representations 
to the Minister of Human Resources Development to at least 
restore the status quo with respect to UI benefits and the length 
of the benefit period?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of sympathy for 
the point the hon. member raised. Many of us have been in the 
situation he has been in. I would imagine he comes from a part of 
Canada where unemployment is particularly high. He did not 
give the rate but I judge from what he said that it is high.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament representing fishermen I have 
suffered the criticism-we all suffer criticism and nobody 
enjoys it-of supporting one group against another. That is 
certainly not the case at all. When the necessity was there I was 
supporting construction workers and other workers peripheral to 
the fishery. I refer to truckers and people who have stores that 
sell spare parts and maintain fishery vessels large and small. I 
could extend it to people in construction work who are not 
building piers and breakwaters because the requirement is not as 
great as it was.
<P>
	The situation is not entirely the same. In this case a total 
industry was wiped out by an act of God or whatever. I really did 
not plan to attribute blame. It is not just the responsibility of the 
communities. Responsibility rests with communities, which 
means individuals. It rests with the provincial government. It 
rests with the federal government. This catastrophe or loss of 
work is so great that the effort required is not just a regional 
effort but is a national effort as well.
<P>
	In my response to the member I say that the disastrous effect 
of a complete wipeout of an industry does not get the same 
response from government or individuals in other sectors who 
are not affected to such a large degree.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	If I were the member I would say that does not really do much 
for my workers. I appreciate that. I guess the points made by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development were that the 
resources are limited and the present system, it has been proven 
by a number of experts in the field, does not do anything to get 
people back to work, so the adjustments that have been planned, 
that have been programmed, are not similar to those that are 
being discussed in this particular bill.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell)</B> moved 
that Bill C-203, an Act to provide for the review of postal rates 
and services and to amend certain Acts in consequence thereof, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to present this bill to 
the House of Commons today. This is not my first attempt; as 
you may know, I presented this same bill in the 34th Parliament, 
but unfortunately I was not lucky enough then in that my name 
was not drawn by lot, as is required for debating such an 
initiative.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to give you the background 
of this bill. In June 1988, the minister who was then responsible 
for Canada Post announced the creation of the Postal Services 
Review Committee, PSRC, which I am proposing to the House 
today.
<P>
	In August 1988, the government tabled a bill, C-149, to create 
the Postal Services Review Board. Unfortunately, when the 33rd 
Parliament was dissolved, the bill died on the Order Paper.
<P>
	Meanwhile, in November 1989, the PSRC made public 
several recommendations, most of which were not acted on by 
the Conservative government of that time. In 1990, the Minister 
of Finance in his budget abolished the review committee.
<P>
	At present, Canada Post must publish its new or amended 
regulations in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, after which the interested 
parties have 60 days to make their comments to the minister 
responsible.
<P>
	After the Board of the Corporation reviews the regulations, 
the proposal is sent to the Governor in Council, who in turn has 
60 days to accept or reject it. If no decision is made within that 
time, the regulation is deemed to be accepted and approved.
<P>
	Under clause 18 of the bill I am proposing to this House today, 
Canada Post would have to submit a copy of any proposed 
regulation to the board for review at least ten days before it is 
published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. The board would have 120 
days to hold a public hearing into the merits of the proposed 
regulation. The public would be notified of the times and places 
of each hearing at least 30 days in advance so that they can 
submit their recommendations in writing to the board.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The board would then publish its recommendations and 
comments in the <I>Canada Gazette </I>as soon as possible. The 
corporation would have 30 days to notify the board in writing 
whether or not it accepts the recommendations and, if not, to 
outline the reasons of its decision. This response would also be 
published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. The proposed regulation in its 
original form or, if amended as a result of the board's 
recommendations, in its amended form would then be submitted 
to the Governor in Council. If the Governor in Council has not 
approved or rejected the proposed regulation 30 days after 
receiving it, he shall be deemed to have approved it. It is similar 
in this regard to the current practice.
<P>
	All major service proposals from Canada Post would be 
treated the same way. The corporation would have to send the 
board a copy of its corporate plan at least 180 days before 
submitting it to the government. The board would have 120 days 
to review the proposal, including a 30-day public notice, hold 
hearings and send its recommendations to Canada Post.
<P>
	Again, the public would be informed of the recommendations. 
The corporation would have to respond to the board within 30 
days and the response would be made public. This response 
would be in line with the proposal that the corporation would 
attach to its corporate plan and would be forwarded to the 
minister to be approved by the government. It would then be up 
to government officials to make the final decision concerning 
the rate increase and other major changes to postal services. In 
other words, the government would keep its decision-making 
authority. However, we would have this quasi-regulatory 
process I am proposing today.
<P>
	The main thing is that this process will be as open and public 
as possible. Canadians will be kept informed, they will have the 
opportunity to make comments, to know the recommendations 
made by the Board, as well as the response of Canada Post and 
the decision reached by the public authorities.
<P>
	Besides the regular reviews of the postal rates and services, 
the Board will conduct other examinations at the request of the 
minister. In other words, the minister will have the authority to 
ask the Board to undertake additional reviews on any issue 
related to Canada Post. This way, the minister will be able to ask 
the Board to hold public hearings on any issue. In such a case, 
the Board would present its recommendations either to the 
minister or to the Canada Post Corporation.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill that I have produced today, Bill C-203, has its origins 
in a previous Parliament. It was designed to address a number of 
concerns related to Canadians that reflected the previous 
government's broader agenda.
<P>
	We all know that government, the Tory government, cut many 
services to Canadians in the name of balancing the books, not 
just postal services but many other services as well; VIA Rail, 
the CBC, I could go on and on, but especially the post office and 
especially in rural Canada.
<P>
	In essence the Conservative government thumbed its nose at 
Canadians, particularly rural Canadians, and slashed programs 
without considering the impact on the people of our country. 
What a change with the compassionate and caring government 
that we have now.
<P>
	That environment at the time fostered resentment and 
suspicion among Canadians that they were being shut out of 
decisions affecting their daily lives. There was a strong 
perception that the former government and by extension federal 
institutions in general were not serving Canadians as they were 
intended to do but were ignoring their concerns.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Even though this is a crown corporation and not a government 
department, Canada Post is the most visible federal government 
presence for many Canadians, especially in rural areas and small 
towns. Consequently the general dissatisfaction with the former 
government's method of operation caused people to question 
how the corporation serves them and whether their interests are 
being adequately considered in decisions about postal service.
<P>
	I remember those awful decisions of years gone by when 
Canada Post decided in communities in my riding to shut down 
the post office.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That reminds me of something that happened in St. Albert, a 
community in my riding where the famous St. Albert cheese is 
made. This is a very dynamic, fast growing community with its 
three farm co-ops. So, obviously, no one could argue that St. 
Albert did not need postal services any more. However, the 
previous government decided to close the post office in that 
community. Why? Was it because it was not needed any more? 
No. Was it because the people did not need postal services any 
more? No. Was it because the post office was losing money? 
Absolutely not! It was closed because the postmaster had 
retired. Can you imagine making business decisions like that? 
Can you imagine closing down a plant because the manager 
retires? Fortunately, that government, and its attitude, were 
replaced by a more reasonable one.
<P>
	For rural Canadians, the best day since the last election was 
when the minister responsible for Canada Post rose in this 
House to say that there would be no more post office closures in 
rural areas. That was an important day for my fellow citizens 
living in villages and small communities.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to congratulate again the 
minister responsible for Canada Post.
<P>
	It is the lack of concern shown by the previous government 
regarding the needs of Canadians living in rural areas and, to 
some extent, in urban centres, which prompted MPs like me to 
table bills such as this one. The purpose of this legislation is to 
ensure accountability and services to Canadians in rural areas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin: </B>It suits your own needs!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member opposite is alluding to 
sovereignty again. I want to tell him that the day after he was 
sworn in, the Minister responsible for Canada Post made another 
important decision. He told Canada Post officials-and I am not 
blaming them, I am blaming the previous government-that 
from now on, the Canadian flag would fly over post offices. This 
had always been the case in the past and the tradition was 
reinstated. The only federal symbol in rural areas is again 
present, thanks to the minister who, on that day, fulfilled his 
responsibilities toward Canadians. He displayed that same sense 
of duty when he said that enough was enough and that no more 
rural post offices would be closed. From now on, the Canada 
Post Corporation will be there to serve Canadians. This is what I 
call leadership! This is the kind of decision Canadians expect 
from their government, and I congratulate the minister for 
taking those initiatives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we all know, Canadians resoundingly rejected the previous 
government's exclusive focus on the bottom line. Might I add 
they rejected pretty soundly the previous government, period. 
The fact that there are only two members bearing that party's 
affiliation in this House is testimony to that.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-203, as I said previously, is to enable 
the public to play an important role in the establishment of 
postal rates and the provision of postal services. It would put in 
place additional safeguards to give Canadians a greater voice in 
how Canada Post serves them and to avoid the possibility of 
unilateral and arbitrary decisions by Canada Post, decisions that 
were made in the past because of the lack of political leadership.
<P>
	I remember asking questions of the minister responsible for 
Canada Post. Remember that word, responsible. When I would 
question the then member for Calgary Centre, Harvie Andre, 
who was the minister at the time he would say: ``Don't ask us 
about Canada Post. It is a crown corporation. I'll not do 
anything''. Those were the kinds of answers we were getting. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4541"> 4541 </A></B>
<P>
Those  answers were not satisfactory for my constituents. Rural 
Canadians did not like those answers.
<P>
	Is it a coincidence that in rural Ontario, actually all of 
Ontario, where the Conservatives shut down so many rural post 
offices that all MPs are Liberals, except one? Rural Ontarians 
and Ontarians in general understood that kind of Tory mindset 
and the lack of leadership they provided in that regard just was 
not the way. That is why they elected this government. That is 
why this government took those two very important decisions I 
brought to the Chair's attention only moments ago.
<P>
	What are Canadians' expectations of their postal service?
<P>
	First, they expect fair and reasonable rates for mail delivery. 
Canadians want some assurance that Canada Post will deal with 
them fairly, particularly when the price of a postage stamp 
increases or the price of other services increases. There may 
well be valid reasons for proposing a postal increase. Everyone 
knows that has to occur from time to time. Everyone recognizes 
that costs can go up and they do.
<P>
	Canada Post must be financially self-sufficient whenever 
possible, but if a rate increase is proposed Canadians want an 
opportunity for input. They want to know that Canada Post has 
not unfairly taken advantage of its customers.
<P>
	In fairness to the corporation I must point out that the rate 
increase for letter mail since January 1992 has been at a lower 
level than the cumulative increase for the consumer price index 
during that period. However that is not the only issue. Canadians 
want to know they can participate as I said previously.
<P>
	Second, Canadians want to know that Canada Post is fulfilling 
its mandate to provide a vital service. Notice those words, a vital 
service.
<P>
	As a member for rural Canada I know the postmaster is not 
just a person who gives you an envelope. The post office is the 
place where forms are picked up for old age pensions, passports 
and a whole number of other services. The post office is a 
meeting place where Canadians congregate. I do not apologize 
for that; I think that is wonderful.
<P>
	The postmaster is a person who is by statute of Canada 
assigned specific responsibilities such as vouching for 
someone's passport. You do not do that by simply replacing the 
post office with a service somewhere in the corner of a 
drugstore. A postmaster has specific responsibilities and 
important ones, particularly in rural Canada. That is why I am 
glad this government has said that the post office is in rural 
Canada, it is not there temporarily, it is there to stay.
<P>
	Canadians have clearly said they reject the previous 
government's single-minded focus on cutbacks.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	If changes to the post office are proposed, Canadians have the 
right to be consulted. They have the right to have their views 
considered seriously. We must ensure that the framework within 
which Canada Post operates provides Canadians the 
participation in decisions about the level and types of postal 
services available to them.
<P>
	That is why I proposed this bill to the House today. I will say it 
again in closing, I am proud to see the things done so far by the 
minister responsible for Canada Post. I know everyone realizes 
we have only just begun and that more will be done in the weeks, 
months and years to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to commend the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for his speech. I do not know 
whether he remembers, but we once met at the Saint-Clément 
post office, one of the post offices that was closed. I agree with 
the hon. member that the previous government lacked the most 
elementary respect for every aspect of rural development and 
for the vital role played by post offices in rural communities.
<P>
	I agree with his objections to the policy of also making 
closures contingent on the age of the postmaster. I do not think 
the policy made much sense.
<P>
	In any event, the moratorium ordered by the Liberal 
government was also mentioned by the Bloc québécois during 
the last election campaign, and in fact, we can say it probably 
came as a result of the will of the community and the leadership 
provided by people like members of Rural Dignity and the 
postmasters' association.
<P>
	I think we have them to thank for this decision, and I believe 
that Quebecers and Canadians sent a very clear signal to the 
government that they rejected this somewhat ruthless policy.
<P>
	Where the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
and I differ is on the quality of the moratorium. The one we have 
now is full of holes. I will give you an example. The minister has 
refused to reconsider past mistakes. The member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell talked earlier about the post 
office in St. Albert and I am talking about the post office in 
Saint-Clément.
<P>
	The Liberals, who were then in the opposition, supported the 
reopening but, as soon as they were elected, they declared a 
moratorium. The Liberals now completely discard the 
possibility to examine those cases where real flaws have been 
identified, even the ones they denounced when they were in the 
opposition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4542"> 4542 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a short message to convey in this regard. The people of 
Saint-Clément are very patient. They take their time but they 
usually win and they have taken steps to have the post office 
reopened.
<P>
	This will be an opportunity to see if the Liberal government, 
with this moratorium, really wants the communities to have 
their post office, because the will shown by the people of 
Saint-Clément will be supported by those of the area 
and-which will be very different from the last time-by the 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup who supports 
people of Saint-Clément, rather than the opposite.
<P>
	The moratorium declared by the Liberals also has other flaws, 
for instance the fact there will be no post office closing in 
municipalities with less than two post offices. This may look 
fine, but I am witnessing in my own riding another situation 
rather absurd, I must say, where it has been decided that a part of 
the mail going to Rivière-du-Loup would be sorted in 
Rimouski, approximately 100 kilometres away.
<P>
	So they do not close the post office in a municipality-the 
moratorium forbids it-but they dismantle it from within. It 
certainly does not look like the best solution.
<P>
	I feel this is more like playing on words. They are not 
respecting the essence of the moratorium by doing things like 
that, but there again they launched a process which I hope will 
succeed in guaranteeing the future of the post office in 
Rivière-du-Loup and will, at the same time, contribute to the 
economic development of the region.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	As we said before, I think good common sense would dictate 
that the post office not be closed simply because the postmaster 
is reaching retirement age and that we do not, for no reasonable 
cause, send a postmaster to sort mail in a post office elsewhere 
when in fact there is work to be done sorting mail in his own 
municipality.
<P>
	I believe the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is 
very persistent since he is tabling the same bill again, but his 
government does not have the same kind of backbone. In fact, 
the government could have proposed such a bill; the Bloc 
Quebecois would not have been opposed to the implementation 
of a regulation mechanism for the operations of the Canada Post 
Corporation. Provided that the system we set up is not too 
bureaucratic, I believe that, indeed, the action plan of an agency 
like Canada Post Corporation needs to be reviewed by the 
elected representatives of the people, because the objectives 
given to the corporation are not necessarily social, whereas 
government objectives could be.
<P>
	I am glad that this bill has been introduced, but I am sorry that 
it is not a votable item, because there will be no real follow-up 
on it. Moreover, it is not introduced by the government, and the 
government should be criticized on that score.
<P>
	What we need in this area is a real policy, a comprehensive 
policy that would show that we want to behave differently from 
the Conservatives. If we had a system guaranteeing openness of 
actions and mandate, if we had a board of directors made up 
differently, for example with representatives of the regions of 
Quebec or Canada, Canada Post would be more likely to listen to 
the regions and to consider more than strict productivity.
<P>
	I believe that the employees of Canada Post do their jobs. 
They do them well, but according to the mandates they receive. 
If the board of directors was made up of people concerned with 
rural development they would certainly act differently.
<P>
	Also, and this is quite obvious, we really need to change the 
approach to human resource management. Do you know that 
presently, in the post office of a medium-size town, there is no 
postmaster? Someone is in charge of sorting, someone else is in 
charge of marketing, but there is no real boss. That means that 
within the same organisation someone is only concerned about 
costs whereas somebody else deals with sales. No small 
business managed that way would last more than a year. There is 
nobody to balance both sides of the operation and that puts us in 
a ludicrous situation.
<P>
	Moreover, there is a long history of bitter labour disputes, and 
a great degree of openness is needed to create a different climate 
at the Post Office.
<P>
	Everything remains to be done at the Canada Post 
Corporation. We must salute the efforts made by the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, and recognize the need for an 
adequate regulation process that would not be overly 
bureaucratic, but we must go further than that. It is now up to the 
government. It must give a clear message. We need more than a 
moratorium full of loopholes which allows the Canada Post 
Corporation to pursue its down-sizing process without regards 
for the needs of regional communities. The government must 
make its position known and state unequivocally that the Post 
Office, as well as VIA Rail and other transportation companies, 
are regional development tools.
<P>
	It is only when we receive this kind of message from the 
government, through its minister, that we will be able to say that 
the mission has been accomplished. In the meantime, everything 
remains to be done.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to speak in this debate this afternoon. It 
is a concern of mine and has been for some time.
<P>
	I join in the debate to support the concept of periodic reviews 
of Canada Post Corporation and its proposals to change the 
postal rates. I believe it is high time that Canada Post Corpora-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4543"> 4543 </A></B>
<P>
tion became answerable in some public way to somebody other 
than cabinet.
<P>
	The postal service in Canada has been the subject of much 
debate and public displeasure for many years. In the late 1970s 
and early 1980s there was concern expressed over large deficits 
and accumulated debt in the post office. Then the solution 
seemed to be to set the post office up as a crown corporation. 
This was going to bring efficient management to the post office. 
In some ways it may have brought some form of efficient 
management but it was a management that did not care about the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	The people of Canada depend on the post office, on mail 
delivery. This is a vast, mostly rural country where mail delivery 
to the door or to the mailbox at the end of a farm lane is taken as 
a given in Canadian society.
<P>
	Not any more. We have superboxes for homeowners in new 
suburbs to walk to and we have post office closures by the 
hundreds in rural areas. This has already happened.
<P>
	Many rural Canadians have been saddened by the closure of 
their rural post offices because in many of these small 
communities their local post office was a spot where one could 
meet and chat with neighbours and their local postmistress or 
postmaster. It served a real social purpose in the community as 
well as a postal service.
<P>
	In Lake Errock, one of our small postal communities in my 
riding of Mission-Coquitlam, the residents have worked hard 
over the last two years trying to get Canada Post to recognize the 
rights and necessities of their part of rural Canada.
<P>
	To Canada Post I suggest just looking at economics is not 
enough. The post office is set up to serve the people and it is 
hoped that the present government will be concerned about all 
Canadians and continue to recognize rural post offices.
<P>
	The other problem faced by Canadians was the intermittent, 
or should we say the regular strikes or work stoppages by the 
postal workers. Who in the House can forget the regular nightly 
images on our television screens of the postal workers' union 
heads, Joe Davidson and later Jean-Claude Parrot, spelling out 
their ludicrous demands on behalf of their workers while we all 
suffered with mail delivery shut down?
<P>
	I used to send out many Christmas cards and about that time I 
stopped sending out Christmas cards and I have not done so 
since.
<P>
	I agree, the post office perhaps more than any other crown 
corporation needs a watchdog that can review price increases 
and internal matters to ensure that Canada Post is properly run 
and that taxpayers are at least in this instance getting their 
money's worth.
<P>
	As I said, to this extent I agree with the thrust of Bill C-203. 
However, set up a new bureaucracy to monitor the post office, a 
new board supported by a secretariat, personnel and all the 
attendant trappings? Maybe when there was more money in the 
treasury and maybe when the public was less cynical about 
government appointments to tribunals such as this, but surely 
not now.
<P>
	The previous government was infamous for the proliferation 
of boards and tribunals to which it would appoint its friends and 
supporters. The Canadian people voted last October to stop this 
kind of practice and we in the Reform Party respect the wishes of 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the thrust of this bill is a good idea. Surely 
the types of things that the review board was going to do in this 
bill can be done by the government operations committee of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	Canada Post Corporation is within the mandate of that 
committee. The committee deals with the estimates of Canada 
Post Corporation and if the inquiries are structured properly this 
committee should be able to do the job of Bill C-203's review 
board.
<P>
	I served for a short time on the government operations 
committee and it seemed to me at the time that after the 
estimates were reported back from the various departments 
which reported to this committee, this committee would have 
sufficient time at its disposal to deal with Canada Post 
Corporation.
<P>
	My suggestion puts the responsibility for the post office 
operations where it belongs, in Parliament. It is the fundamental 
function of all of us here to serve the Canadian people. One way 
of serving them is to put the subject of mail processing and 
delivery in the hands of elected representatives.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	To be precise, Canada Post would at least 10 days before 
publishing a proposed regulation in <I>The Canada Gazette</I> send a 
copy to the clerk of the government operations committee for 
review. The committee would have 120 days within which to 
hold public hearings on the merits of the proposal and make 
recommendations to Canada Post. The committee's 
recommendations would be published in <I>The Canada Gazette</I> 
and the corporation would have 30 days to report to the 
committee in writing.
<P>
	The recommendations of the committee and the response by 
Canada Post would be submitted to cabinet. If cabinet did not act 
within 30 days the regulation would come into force.
<P>
	Again, when Canada Post wishes to make major changes in 
service these corporate plans would be submitted to the 
government operations committee for review. Surely that is one 
of its purposes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4544"> 4544 </A></B>
<P>
	Ultimately after a public hearing process the 
recommendations of the committee would be sent back to 
Canada Post and then the entire package submitted to the 
minister in charge of Canada Post for final approval.
<P>
	With respect to rate increases, while the final decision would 
be up to the cabinet, a full public hearing process would have 
taken place on the subject and the rate increases again by the 
government operations committee. An important issue that the 
government operations committee in its review of the post 
office may wish to inquire into is whether, as alleged by the 
Canadian Courier Association, Canada Post is using the 
revenues gained because of its exclusive role as a mail courier to 
subsidize the purchase and operation of courier systems. Such 
an inquiry would be a good first step in establishing that the 
members of the House of Commons were serious about holding 
the Canada Post Corporation to account.
<P>
	The Canadian Courier Association in a letter dated October 
29, 1993 sent to all members of the 35th Parliament set out its 
concerns about Canada Post. It recited the findings of the 
Nielsen task force and the inquiry of Alan Marchment carried 
out in 1986 to support their case. I suppose it was the purchase of 
Purolator Courier that prompted this outrage by the Courier 
Canadian Association. Who can blame it? Canada Post used its 
unique position to subsidize its areas which compete with the 
private sector so Canada Post can charge less than the private 
sector.
<P>
	As I said, this would be an ideal matter for the government 
operations committee to investigate.
<P>
	In conclusion, while I support the thrust of Bill C-203, I do 
not support the means to accomplish the end. I would support 
amendments to the bill which would put the government 
operations committee as the review agency and would also 
support whatever changes would be necessary to the rules of this 
House to allow the government operations committee to 
perform this task.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-203 was introduced to address the concerns of 
the Canadian public over postal service in Canada. It is a 
commendable effort on the part of the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	As we have heard, this bill is substantially the same as Bill 
C-207 which was introduced during the previous Parliament. 
Since that time and since the introduction of Bill C-203, 
considerable progress has been made following the 
implementation of government policies designed to meet the 
needs of Canadians while enabling the Canada Post Corporation 
to carry out its mandate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1981 Canada Post Corporation was given a broad mandate 
that included achieving self-sufficiency while acting as a 
commercial arm's length crown corporation, becoming part of 
the business marketplace, and providing a federal presence in 
communities across Canada. Since then Canada Post has been 
taking measures to reach these objectives and has made 
considerable progress. It is imperative that Canada Post 
maintain its ability to fulfil its mandate.
<P>
	Much progress has been made since Canada Post Corporation 
was created in 1981. At that time Canada Post faced economic 
uncertainty and was losing $600 million yearly. Twelve years 
later Canada Post Corporation declared profits in the last four of 
the five fiscal years and has paid dividends to its shareholder, 
the Government of Canada.
<P>
	By improving its efficiency, updating technology and 
improving labour relations Canada Post has managed a 
remarkable turnaround. Furthermore, its on time delivery of 
mail to Canadians has been under regular and open scrutiny 
through an independent consulting firm.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada Post has moved forward and will continue to do so as a 
competitive, lean corporation that not only delivers mail on time 
98 per cent of the time but delivers an important service to all 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government supports the positive changes made by the 
Canada Post Corporation with a view to meeting the postal 
service needs of Canadian consumers and businesses. The 
moratorium on post office closures announced at the beginning 
of the year by the hon. minister responsible for the Canada Post 
Corporation is one of the best examples of positive change.
<P>
	If you have ever visited or lived in a small town or rural 
community in Canada, you will understand the devastating 
impact of the closing of the post office on the community. The 
post office is the nerve centre of small communities in Canada 
and guarantees a federal presence and an important 
communication link with the rest of the country and with the 
world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since 1987 close to 1,500 federally operated post offices, 
almost one-third of all federal post offices in Canada, have 
enclosed or converted. The minister's announcement earlier this 
year put an end to the closures of post offices in rural areas and 
small towns across the country, an initiative introduced by the 
former government which turned a deaf ear to the loud and 
emotional outcry of Canadians who risked losing an important 
link to the rest of the nation.
<P>
	The moratorium protects the majority of post offices across 
this country. As long as this government remains in power, 
4,000 communities across the country are guaranteed the 
benefits of a Canada Post operated post  office. Further, post 
offices located in large urban centres will not be closed without 
a public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4545"> 4545 </A></B>
<P>
consultation process conducted through the postal service 
customer councils.
<P>
	This demonstrates the ongoing commitment by the Liberal 
Party in saying no to the policy of post office closures, a policy 
that seriously hindered Canada Post in carrying out its mandate 
to provide a federal presence in communities across Canada.
<P>
	This brings me to the subject of exclusive privilege that has 
been granted to Canada Post. Some would argue that Canada 
Post's exclusive privilege for the delivery of letter mail gives it 
an unfair advantage and justifies the creation of a monitoring 
agency.
<P>
	However, in today's environment the exclusive privilege is 
perhaps more accurately described as an exclusive 
responsibility. Only Canada Post has the responsibility to 
provide all Canadians throughout the country with postal 
services. Its competitors can pick and choose where they can 
operate profitably, ignoring Canadians in those regions of the 
country where small populations and great distances between 
communities would limit the return on investment or result in a 
loss.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Liberal government believes that for all Canadians, 
postal service is a right, not merely a privilege. All Canadians 
must have access to affordable, reasonable postal service, 
regardless of where they live. This essential service is protected 
by exclusive privilege which ensures that small communities 
and rural regions, the backbone of our vast country, enjoy postal 
service at a reasonable cost.
<P>
	The challenge of providing service to such a vast country is 
formidable indeed, Mr. Speaker. I support the principle of 
exclusive privilege because it allows for the continued existence 
of the necessary infrastructure to provide fair postal service to 
all people, regardless of where they live.
<P>
	Since exclusive privilege affords the Canada Post 
Corporation a foreseeable income, the corporation can ensure 
universal access to postal service while maintaining its financial 
self-sufficiency. This policy is consistent with that followed by 
countless postal services around the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, it should be taken into consideration that 
Canada Post does face increasing competition from the world of 
technology such as the electronic transfer of information. 
One-third of its business is in competition with couriers, bus 
companies, trucking companies, airlines and other such 
industries.
<P>
	In this rapidly evolving environment, competition provides 
ample incentive for Canada Post to meet its customers' needs at 
an affordable cost.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	Other actions that continue to bring Canada Post closer to 
fulfilling its mandate include the establishment of a national 
control centre and the corporation's new in business to serve 
program. The national control centre is located in Ottawa and is 
linked to all individual centres across the country as well as to 
the dispatching system of airlines and the weather forecasting 
network. It constantly monitors mail movement 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week in a drive toward even more efficient mail 
delivery. It is the most sophisticated mail monitoring system in 
the world and has become a model for other postal 
administrations.
<P>
	The national control centre is a great innovation that helps 
ensure Canadians receive a high level of postage service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The future of the Canada Post Corporation looks brighter with 
a new approach to client services. The new watchword is ``In 
Business to Serve.'' It is also the name of a new program. As I 
said earlier, Canada Post has to compete against a growing 
number of companies. While some technological 
improvements, like the National Control Centre, are helping 
Canada Post to keep its place on the market, a new marketing 
approach is also needed. With this new ``In Business to Serve'' 
Program, Canada Post will be able to meet the challenge by 
focusing on improved client services and recognizing the 
contribution of its employees and partners to this goal.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to stress the real progress made by 
the Canada Post Corporation in order to meet the expectations of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	By announcing a moratorium on the closure and conversion of 
post offices, the minister has already done a lot to address the 
issues raised by this bill. I am sure that the Canada Post 
Corporation will find the tools to provide Canadians with the 
postal services they need while remaining self-sufficient.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate on a bill the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell introduced in order to impose 
some kind of regulation over the closure of rural post offices. In 
the last few years, under the previous Conservative government, 
many communities in Quebec, in Canada and in my own area 
had to fight to try to keep their post office. The people affected 
by those closures told us that this struck at the very life of their 
community.
<P>
	Rural communities, of which I have a few in my riding and 
many in my area, are often built around the parish church, the 
school, and the post office. Those are the usual three institutions 
to be found in those communities. In many cases, they have 
already lost their school, some do not have a full time priest in 
their church any more and their post office has been closed 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4546"> 4546 </A></B>
<P>
down. People in these communities are dismayed at the demise 
of  communities on which their founders had put all their hope.
<P>
	I am pleased to support the bill introduced by the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell because it provides 
some kind of parliamentary control over the closure of post 
offices. It is a fact that the Liberal government declared a 
moratorium on the closure of post offices in smaller 
communities, but a moratorium is no more than that. The 
minister who declared the moratorium can lift it just as easily. In 
view of the significance of an institution such as the post office 
in small communities, I think the Parliament of Canada should 
have some control over the potential closure of those offices.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I went through an experience last week in my riding. It was 
not the closing of a post office, but of a school in the 
Saint-Jean-Eudes neighbourhood, in Jonquière. 
Saint-Jean-Eudes was once a municipality. After an 
amalgamation some time ago, it became a neighbourhood of the 
city of Jonquière. The people of Saint-Jean-Eudes had a city 
hall, a credit union, a post office and a school; they even had two 
schools.
<P>
	Now, there is no city hall any more, no credit union, the post 
office is gone and they have been announced that their school 
will be closed.
<P>
	When I visited these people last Sunday, I could see that they 
really had a feeling that a part of their community was going 
with their school. I was able to understand the feelings of the 
people of Saint-Clément, in Québec, and of St. Albert, in the 
riding of the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. These 
people have seen a part of themselves, have seen major 
institutions leave their community, and they are concerned.
<P>
	I think it is important for the Parliament of Canada to make 
sure that justice be done for small communities, that they be 
given the necessary means to remain alive and well. Of course, 
the argument that they are being given is that their post office is 
too isolated, too expensive, not profitable and that cuts are 
necessary. It has been said in the case of some small 
communities, and it is now being said even for some regions.
<P>
	For example, some say that the Lac-Saint-Jean or 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region is too far from metropolitan 
centres like Quebec City and Canada and that we will no longer 
be able to provide some of the services.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, they are now thinking of abolishing the 
passenger service between Jonquière and Montreal because it is 
not cost-effective, and the distances involved are too great. And 
so they cut a number of services in my region under the pretext 
that we are a remote area and that we must understand how the 
market operates. When it is not cost-effective anymore, we 
must stop spending.
<P>
	I think that people have good reason to resist arguments like 
those because the government's responsibility with regard to 
regions, small communities and people in need is still the same. 
The government must ensure that its services meet the special 
needs of regions, small communities and individuals. It does not 
mean that we must give out all kinds of grants and pour money 
down the drain, but I think that before closing some institutions, 
a post office, a school or some services in the regions, members 
of Parliament should really think twice. They must ask 
themselves if they must apply only the law of the market or if it 
would not be better to be more generous and to take some 
initiatives so that these institutions can survive and keep the 
wheels turning in our country.
<P>
	Canada is not made up only of big cities which work well and 
are cost-effective. It consists of a great number of communities, 
on the North Shore, in southern Quebec, or what have you; all 
these communities make up our country. Before taking 
measures that would jeopardize communities built by our 
fathers and institutions established by our predecessors, I think 
the Parliament should think twice and do what it must do so that 
these institutions, towns and communities will be able to 
survive and expand.
<P>
	I invite my colleagues to support the proposal of the member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, since I think it seeks to 
maintain important things and to help Quebecers and Canadians 
live and be happy in their communities.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we are discussing the 
management and control of an entity which is neither fish nor 
fowl. In theory it is an independent crown, but because any real 
competition is legislatively prohibited there is little incentive to 
be cost effective or to provide service. Therefore, it is legitimate 
that the post office be subject to government oversight.
<P>
	However, I do concur with the proposal of my hon. colleague, 
the member for Mission-Coquitlam, that this should be 
accomplished by the government operation's committee and not 
by a new, additional bureaucratic committee.
<P>
	Canada Post has forgotten its basic mandate which is to 
provide a public service. For example, as we speak Canada Post 
has proposed to eliminate the special rates for inter-library 
loans on books and to replace them with standard parcel post 
rates.
<P>
	Just to give the House an example of what this would mean to 
some of our small regional libraries in rural areas, a book which 
would now go out under the present rate of 53 cents per kilogram 
returned would have to be sent out at a cost of $2.05 per kilo 
each way. We are looking at an enormous increase in rates, in 
fact an increase that is so great that it would effectively  
terminate inter-library loans in rural Canada. Another rural 
amenity is going to disappear if this is allowed to go forward.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4547"> 4547 </A></B>
<P>
	I have calculated that for the regional library in my 
constituency at Swift Current, based on its current rates of loan, 
the costs would increase from a current rate of about $14,000 to 
a rate of $103,000 a year, almost $90,000 which a small regional 
library obviously cannot come up with. If you do not want 
people in rural areas to have books then this is the way to go. Let 
Canada Post have its own way without any government 
oversight and raise these rates as it will.
<P>
	It is time that we took a hard look at the way this organization 
operates. It says that it has to be lean and mean. Well it is mean 
but I do not know how lean it is because it does not have to really 
compete. Since it is a natural monopoly let us for heaven's sake 
exercise the function of a parliamentary democracy and let the 
government get a handle on these people.
<P>
	It is an arrogant, pampered organization. It is time it was 
brought to heel, preferably by the government operation's 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would be remiss if I did not rise to support Bill C-203 presented 
by the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	The largest number of rural post office closures in Canada, as 
the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell well knows, 
happened in my riding of Victoria-Haliburton. That is a big 
number to have happen in one riding. I have seen enough of the 
senior citizens, handicapped and disadvantaged Canadians who 
are suffering for a very basic service, to receive and send mail. It 
seems so basic.
<P>
	The postmaster of the little Britain community centre is a man 
of great spirit who has great sense of community. The post office 
in Bethany is in a gas station. Lindsay has a sub-post office in a 
drugstore. Minden and Fenelon Falls were on the chopping 
block.
<P>
	When I went to Sunderland I could not read the sign for the 
post office, it was so dilapidated. It looked like they were 
waiting for the disaster to happen. Well, Mr. and Mrs. 
Postmaster, I would like you to get your signs painted. Tell the 
public that the government will not close any more rural post 
offices.
<P>
	I would also be remiss if I did not mention that I presented a 
petition earlier today, which I fully support, allowing senior 
citizens in a large complex to mail a letter. Why Canada Post can 
send a truckload of mail to a large complex, drop it off, but not 
pick any up at the very same location is beyond belief.
<P>
	I support this bill by the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. I look forward to the 
strengthening of rural Canada and the strengthening of the rural 
post office service.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before closing off the 
debate I will give the mover of the motion no more than one 
minute if he wishes to wrap up, because this is not a votable 
item.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to take this 
opportunity to thank my colleagues who have spoken so 
eloquently on this bill. I am glad to see the attitude demonstrated 
particularly by the government in its wish to strengthen the 
postal system in rural Canada.
<P>
	To those who wanted a parliamentary committee to review the 
continuing operation of the post office, I am not sure that every 
time we increase the postal rate by one cent or the price of parcel 
post that a parliamentary committee should have hearings 
across the country to review it. I would prefer that hon. members 
of the House deal with the substantive issues of our country and 
allow an agency such as the one I propose do the task of 
reviewing postal rates.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and a word of thanks to all my 
colleagues.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1) the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	Before adjourning the House I want to take a moment, 
colleagues. At this time of year many visitors come to 
Parliament Hill and large numbers of young people come to our 
capital.
<P>
	Earlier today I was not able to seize the opportunity at the 
time because we were in a serious debate, but one such visitor 
was Erica Louise Corbett. She is none other than the young 
daughter of William ``Bill'' Corbett who sits at the table as a 
principal clerk. It was her day to shadow Dad as part of a school 
project. I regret I did not have the opportunity to recognize her. I 
understand she is still probably somewhere in the building 
shadowing Dad. I want to tell her I am sorry I did not have the 
opportunity to recognize her, but I wish her and Bill the best on 
her project.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 2.32 p.m. this 
House stands adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m., pursuant 
to Standing Order 24(1). Have a good weekend.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.32 p.m.)
