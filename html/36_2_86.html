<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 6 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-19, an act respecting genocide, crimes against humanity 
and war crimes and to implement the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, and to make consequential 
amendments to other Acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this second 
reading of Bill C-19 is an opportunity to say how long it took 
this bill to appear. It is not that Canada was long in the preparation 
of it, but this bill is of a very particular nature, because it is 
the translation into law of an international agreement to create an 
international criminal court for global concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the liberty of reading a text by Philippe Weckel, a 
professor at the University of Nice-Sofia-Antipolis, which 
summarizes well, it seems to me, the realization of the Rome 
statute in Bill C-19. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Rome conference opened on June 15 and closed July 18 
following the adoption of a treaty on the statutes of the first 
international criminal jurisdiction of a permanent and universal 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An old utopian idea is achieved paradoxically with the help of 
realism. This success, uncertain to the last minute, will not enthuse 
those who wanted to proceed much more quickly and go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the balanced compromise finally reached, after the 
laborious negotiations of the night of July 16-17, gives the new 
institution a chance to survive— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat “gives the new institution a chance to survive”. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and to progressively develop its activities and authority.  In 
other words, this historic moment signals an achievement, causes 
certain frustrations but gives rise to cautious optimism. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This introduction expresses both the hope raised by the Rome 
Treaty creating, once the signing and international ratification 
conditions have been met, an international criminal court, and 
the difficulties connected with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The famous conference of July 17 and 18 ended, it must be said, 
in confusion.  On July 18, 23 states, including France, signed a 
document that had been hastily put together and not reread.  Two 
months later, the true and authentic instrument of the Rome 
Treaty was still an unknown quantity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the bill tells us, this treaty was adopted on July 17, or the 
morning of July 18, corrected by the protocols of November 10, 
1998 and July 12, 1999.  This speaks to all the difficulties 
surrounding the birth of something on which thinkers had focused 
a half-century of efforts.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term “international criminal court” is an unusual one in 
itself.  Any viewer who has not yet given up on such a 
complicated subject, knows what a court is, and there is nothing 
new and different about the words international and criminal 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truly revolutionary aspect of it is the combination of the 
three.  Until this treaty, a criminal court was an instrument, 
within a state, which judged individuals who had committed 
offences of a criminal or other nature.  The international court 
was in place to judge conflicts between states or between groups 
and a state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time, a court will be called the “international 
criminal court” to ensure—this is the objective—that certain 
categories of extremely serious crimes will no longer go 
unpunished, as has been the case until now.  This is our hope 
and objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What crimes will the international criminal court deal with? 
There are four different types. There is the genocide, which is 
defined as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a 
national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crimes against humanity are also included. A crime against 
humanity is defined as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—acts...committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack 
directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the 
attack— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>War crimes are defined as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such breaches include attacks against civilian populations, 
deportation, hostage takings, the intentional destruction or the 
pillaging of civilian property, including towns, villages, 
dwellings or buildings which are undefended and which are not 
military objectives, and employing poison or poisoned weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the crime of aggression, which could not be 
specifically defined in the Rome Statute. 
The court will have authority over the crime of aggression only 
when this crime has been properly defined under a new treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, and also our viewers, the future 
international criminal court will have a huge responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout history, and until the creation and operation of that 
court, these crimes were often not defined or named as such, but 
they were recognized in foreign policy and in history as actions 
taken by certain states in their quest for power. We know that, 
over the centuries, that quest for power has been a quest by one 
country to dominate another. 
It can also be domination over groups or confrontation with 
other nations. All manner of horrors were perpetrated.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was how political tyrants and dictators behaved, but their 
actions were not judged.  People might be revolted by the 
ensuing millions of deaths, but there was no other way to judge, 
and worse, no other way to try them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did this idea of an international court arise therefore? 
Several individuals must have had the same idea over the years, 
centuries even, but it was actually in the aftermath of World 
War II and specifically the crimes against the Jews that the 
Nuremberg tribunal was set up. 
In fact, it was the first international criminal justice 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear when we look back on these events that this tribunal 
caused many problems, particularly from a legal perspective. 
Right up to the beginning of the trial, genocide was not 
considered a crime.  At Nuremberg, victims were only witnesses, 
not complainants or civil parties.  It was the states that 
judged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not been possible to rid this tribunal of its image as a 
court of victors.  Very often, as we know, history is written by 
the victors, and much time must pass before it can be rewritten, 
I might add, since my background is in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of an international court arose at the same time as the 
Nuremberg tribunal was created. 
This idea first came up at the UN over 50 years ago.  On 
December 9, 1948, the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, with its article 6 
providing for the possibility of the future establishment of an 
international criminal court, was adopted by the UN National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 6 provided that persons charged with genocide would be 
tried by a competent tribunal of the state in the territory of 
which the crime had been committed or by such international 
penal tribunal as might have jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it then that the treaty launching the process of adoption 
was not signed until July 1998?  Because even though this idea 
was adopted by the UN, it ran into tremendous difficulties, the 
first being that the sovereign states could not agree to the 
creation of a court whose jurisdiction exceeded their own and 
which could try actions committed by the powers in control of a 
state at some point in their history.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project was the result of certain events, it must be said. 
The international law commission was making no progress.  The 
work was resumed in 1989, but what really hastened progress was 
the events in Bosnia and later Rwanda, and the Security 
Council's decision to use its powers to create the international 
criminal tribunal to judge the crimes committed in Bosnia and 
Rwanda to which we have referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mere mention of these two courts shows how difficult it is 
to have a true international court.  After everything that has 
been done, we know that 65 individuals have been charged, 35 are 
presently imprisoned, and 14 have been sentenced.  This shows 
how lengthy proceedings are, that it takes a long time to ensure 
justice and the appearance of justice.  No one, however, would 
say it was not worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the international criminal tribunal created for Bosnia 
and Rwanda, the international criminal court will have two main 
elements.  There will be a permanent court with nine justices, 
in the Hague.  States ratifying the Rome Statute will be 
required to work in collaboration with this court.  How?  Mainly 
by delivering up the accused and the witnesses, or evidence in 
their possession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court will operate along the same lines as the international 
criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
As well, the international criminal court will be able to 
delegate its powers to national judicial systems, which is what 
interests us even more in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Courts in countries that have ratified the statute could judge 
accused persons themselves, in accordance with the rules of law 
recognized by the court.  This latter mechanism is what is 
termed application of—and this is a term that will come up a 
great deal—“universal jurisdiction”, which confers upon national 
courts in countries such as Canada jurisdiction over serious 
crimes committed outside their territory and not involving any 
of their nationals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to keep these two conditions in mind. 
They are rather surprising as principal conditions, because—I 
would need to go into detail on amendments to Canadian statutes 
here—a Canadian court could have been empowered to judge in 
Canada criminals who were not Canadians or had committed crimes 
against persons who were not Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of the time did not consider it appropriate to 
enforce the law of Canada, so that the jurisprudence is such 
that, without the passage of Bill C-19, no court in Canada can 
judge criminals who are not Canadian or who did not allegedly 
commit crimes against Canadian nationals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of being able to delegate to other national courts the 
attributes of the permanent court at The Hague—this is the 
hope—will take a load off this international court, and lighten 
its operations and its costs, two sources of criticism against 
the international court of justice and against the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, whose mandate was 
expanded to include Rwanda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken of the long history behind this Rome Statute, but 
I have not yet said why many base their hopes for world peace on 
the creation of such a court.  The first reason given is to 
ensure justice for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote Kofi Annan: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For nearly half a century—almost as long as the United Nations 
has been in existence—the General Assembly has recognized the 
need to establish such a court to prosecute and punish persons 
responsible for crimes such as genocide.  Many thought, no 
doubt, that the horrors of the Second World War—the camps, the 
cruelty, the exterminations, the Holocaust—could never happen 
again.  And yet they have.  In Cambodia, in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, in Rwanda.  Our time—this decade even—has shown us 
that man's capacity for evil knows no limits.  Genocide...is 
now a word of our time, too, a heinous reality that calls for a 
historic response. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a corollary, we can add that this court aims at putting an 
end to impunity.  Justice for all means the end of impunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jose Lasso, the former UN commissioner for human rights said, 
and we should bear this in mind: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We run a greater risk of being brought to justice and sentenced 
for the killing of one man than for the killing of 100,000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what impunity is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That impunity has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of 
conflicts in several regions of the world. Perhaps we get that 
impression of a rapid increase because we are immediately aware 
of these conflicts, through our modern media. In any case, we 
are aware of an increasing number of conflicts and of the fact 
that many of those who committed terrible crimes escape justice 
through power, wealth and honours. There is nothing that we can 
do against these people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If such a situation is generally accepted in this day and age, 
it will undermine the moral order. Some think that the Rome 
Statute, which parliament will ask Canada to ratify, will help 
put an end to conflicts. How can they say that? There can be no 
peace without justice, no justice without laws, no laws worthy 
of that name without a court responsible for ruling on what is 
fair and legal under specific circumstances, including in 
situations of ethnic conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that not everyone shares the same hopes 
regarding this treaty until it becomes law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international criminal court will try to remedy the 
inadequacies of special tribunals and will take over when 
national institutions, in the area of criminal justice, do not 
have the will or the ability to act. I should point out that 
those who have already signed this treaty, or who will sign it, 
are committed to do everything in their power- but, as we will 
see, this power does not have enough teeth—to ensure that country 
leaders who do not ratify the statutes and may have committed 
crimes against humanity can be prosecuted. If these people leave 
their territory, they could be extradited and tried in another 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some claim that the Rome Statute could deter future war 
criminals. Perhaps, but, as far as I am concerned, that argument 
is not any more valid than another one that we reject, namely 
that imposing capital punishment in a country has a deterrent 
effect on criminals. I believe this is why Canada decided to 
abolish the death penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many hopes are pinned on this international criminal court, but 
let us be clear.  Before we get to the stage where this 
universal jurisdiction can be exercised, 60 countries must 
ratify the Rome treaty.  What progress has been made to date? 
Eight countries have made the move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally a number of countries whose leaders might be targeted 
by this court will not be rushing to add their signature.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a long road ahead before the Rome treaty is fully 
implemented.  It should be emphasized that the United States has 
serious reservations about this international criminal court. 
Other countries, such as France, may also drag their heels 
because of the influence of the military and their assessment of 
the impact of the international criminal court.  I mention these 
two countries because they are important, but there are 
undoubtedly many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I said that there has been criticism, even from experts 
and politicians who are in favour of the international criminal 
court, but who fear that it will not be able to completely meet 
our expectations, and in certain cases not be able to meet them 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to cite Lise Bissonnette, an editor who has now moved on 
to other equally noble functions.  On July 20, two days after 
the treaty was adopted, she wrote the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new international criminal court is a very incomplete step 
in the fight against impunity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She poses a number of questions.  These are very certainly the 
same questions we will be asking ourselves when we begin our 
deliberations in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the classic definition of genocide, war crimes, and 
crimes against humanity, must these offences be broadened to 
include enslavement, sexual offences, the use of chemical or 
biological weapons?  Will the court have automatic and universal 
jurisdiction and could it pursue nationals of a state that had 
refused to sign the treaty?  Where would the jurisdiction of 
national courts end and that of the international court begin? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some responses have been forthcoming since the writing of this 
editorial, but other questions remain unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again quoting Lise Bissonnette: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The zeal focussed by numerous countries, which eventually led to 
the creation of the international criminal court, paradoxically 
shows how readily the international community could prevent war 
crimes, genocide and aggression.  As history has shown, from 
Latin America to Africa, only the democratization of nations put 
an end to abuse, to reprisals against civilian populations, to 
political murders, to the violent crushing of minorities and 
dissidents. The most scandalous of impunities is not, therefore, that 
allowed to dictators and their underlings when they are allowed 
to get off scot-free because there is no international tribunal 
before which they can be judged—

said “—the most scandalous of impunities is that guaranteed to 
them at the very moment they are leading their reign of terror”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The most sordid recent example— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It dates back to 1998. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—was that of Indonesia and of former President Suharto, whom the 
international community has just let off for economic rather 
than moral reasons, he who had on his conscience the proven 
genocide of one third of the population of East Timor.  This was 
perpetrated before the very eyes of the country's trading 
partners, and with their full knowledge, for over twenty years. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the warm, and self-serving friendship Canadian Prime 
Minister Chrétien had for this murderer (a minimum of 200,000 
people killed during his regime and on his orders) is concerned, 
the fact that our Minister of Foreign Affairs was at the same 
time agitating for the creation of an international criminal 
court makes our diplomacy look pretty calculating and cynical. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a harsh judgment, but one that is worthwhile.  The 
example of the relative effectiveness of the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia justifies such 
questions, which need to be asked today, as the committee begins 
its deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs' global position on human 
security is an important component of this international 
criminal court to ensure the protection of children and civilian 
populations, but are we not, at the moment, in international 
terms, agreeing that the only role of the international 
community is to ensure order within existing borders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are giving ourselves the means to punish the heads of states 
once we catch them.  Madam Justice Arbour's charge against 
Milosevic, who remains the President of the Yugoslav Federation, 
served as a signal, but at the moment, and I will point this out 
in committee, almost all the peacekeeping measures we refer to, 
the ones we invest in, are means of repression, when we must 
accept that the vast majority of current conflicts are conflicts 
within countries and due to various causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These causes, which may be the unrecognized but disputed 
self-determination of peoples, may underlie the huge problems we 
see and, in this area, the international community is much less 
active.

community that must be raised during committee debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my speaking time is drawing to a close, I can say that at 
second reading, the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill, but we 
have some concerns, including the fact that the treaty was 
signed without prior debate in parliament, as we have been 
calling for prior to the implementation stage, when we cannot 
change much.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased today to be able to speak to Bill C-19, an 
act respecting genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes 
and to implement the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court, and to make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party supports and applauds this 
excellent initiative by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  The 
purpose of Bill C-19 is to implement Canada's obligations under 
the Rome Statute, which was adopted on July 17, 1998 by the 
United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the 
Establishment of an International Criminal Court. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been previously mentioned, this piece of legislation 
forces us to examine some very disturbing matters throughout the 
world and oftentimes within our own borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the ICC has been set up it will be the first permanent 
international court empowered to investigate the most serious of 
crimes under international law.  These include genocide, crimes 
against humanity and war crimes.  We can all be assured that 
although Canada is showing great leadership by making sure that 
war criminals will be prosecuted and punished for their awful 
crimes against humanity during a war, there is more that we can 
and must do.  The legislation lays the groundwork to empower 
those officials within our borders to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many lives have been taken.  It is time for the 
international community to work together to ensure that something 
is done to provoke positive change in this area to bring about 
greater accountability and to bring to justice those individuals 
who have performed and partaken in these atrocities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's leadership throughout the century has been one for 
which we can all be proud.  With Bill C-19 we have an opportunity 
to do more.  Canada is one of many countries taking steps to 
implement statutes within a framework of national and 
international systems of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although six states have already ratified the statute, Fiji, 
Italy, San Marino, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago, in light of the 
legislative initiatives brought forward by the federal government 
last December 10, the Conservative Party is glad to say that 
Canada is one of the first countries to take overall 
comprehensive legislative steps to implement the Statute of Rome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again congratulate the minister for his efforts and his 
leadership in pursuit of justice for war criminals, and certainly 
on behalf of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to justice department statistics, there are presently 
400 people living within the boundaries of Canada who have 
allegedly been involved in the commission of war crimes, crimes 
against humanity or genocide.  It is simply unacceptable that 
many war criminals are able to live out their quiet lives here as 
if nothing had happened, as if nothing they had done was wrong 
and escape prosecution for terrible atrocities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these individuals in question hail from the Balkans, 
Africa and Central or South America.  Canada must not ever become 
or be seen to be a safe haven for war criminals.  In response to 
this problem, Bill C-19 is a great achievement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly Canadians and the world will have to wait until the 
international community gets together to implement a permanent 
institution that can have genuine and necessary judicial capacity 
to fulfill the mission to address the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime we have witnessed the carnage in Kosovo, in 
Rwanda and in other countries around the world, which makes this 
legislation all the more important and all the more timely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically Bill C-19 would implement the Rome Statute and 
replace the current provisions in the criminal code with respect 
to war crimes.  It creates two kinds of offences:  offences 
within Canada and offences outside our borders.  Offences within 
Canada are encompassed in clause 4 of the bill.  Pursuant to 
clause 4, every person is guilty of an indictable offence who 
commits, in Canada, genocide, a crime against humanity or war 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These definitions provided for the three offences are based on 
those found in sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Rome Statute.  This is 
in addition to the criminal code where a person, if convicted of 
one of these offences, shall be sentenced to life imprisonment if 
the crime was committed intentionally.  Obviously there is the 
burden of proof on the crown.  In any other case, a person is 
liable to life imprisonment, a very serious and appropriate 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions would apply to conduct committed in Canada and 
permit Canada to either prosecute these offences or extradite 
individuals to the country where the atrocities occurred and face 
prosecution in those lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great addition since it was extremely difficult for 
the justice department in the past to prosecute war criminals who 
had taken refuge here as a result of the supreme court ruling, 
the now very infamous and famous ruling of R v Finta.  In 
that decision, many will recall that Imre Finta, who was legally 
trained as a captain in the Royal Hungarian Gendarmerie was in 
command of an investigative unit at Szeged during the second 
world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is documented that during that time over 8,000 Jewish people 
were detained in a brickyard, forcibly stripped of their 
valuables and deported to horrendous, dreadful conditions in a 
concentration camp as part of the Nazi final solution.  This 
order for execution, the final solution, was on the gendarmerie 
and certain police forces to carry out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the war Mr. Finta fled to Canada.  In the early 1990s the 
Canadian courts challenged the respondent under the Canadian 
Criminal Code war crime provisions with unlawful confinement, 
robbery, kidnapping and manslaughter of the victims at that 
horrible death camp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his client's defence, Mr. Finta's lawyer argued correctly 
that the defence of obedience to superior orders and the peace 
officer's defence were available under the criminal code, which 
was the case for members of the military or police forces in 
prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These defences are weighed by the courts, subject to the 
manifest illegality test.  This test basically refers to defences 
that are not available when the orders in question are 
manifestly unlawful.  The burden of proof here relies very much 
on the qualification of the unlawful act.

Mr. Speaker, today is day five of the Shawinigan shenanigans in 
the Middle East.  The tired and bruised Prime Minister is in 
Jordan, apologizing for missing the late King Hussein's funeral. 
His Gaza gaffes are headlines all over the world.  His spin 
doctors are panicking and working overtime.  They cannot keep up 
with the Prime Minister's lack of preparation and the remarks he 
bleeds into the Middle East media every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister does not understand what he is talking about. 
After four days of saying what he was not supposed to say, now he 
says “Listen.  I do not have to discuss the situation between 
those two countries”.  Which countries?  For him, any two 
countries in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has he not been saying that since the beginning when he 
realized he could not be helpful to the peace process and he 
could not be a statesman? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are ashamed of the damage he has done to three 
different sets of sensitive negotiations that have forced him 
with his tail between his legs to ask if he was still welcome in

Wednesday, the hon. member for Chicoutimi criticized the 
Government of Quebec for not investing sufficiently in the 
development of highway infrastructures in the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and Quebec City regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the hon. member that the Government of 
Quebec invests close to 72% of its fuel tax revenue in highway 
infrastructures, unlike the federal government, which collects 
over $6 billion yearly in excise tax but invests only 17.4% of 
it.  The rest of that revenue goes to swell the already 
over-inflated budget surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Chicoutimi will agree with me that the level 
of government responsible for our poor road conditions is none 
other than the federal.  With its surpluses, it could renew 
strategic agreements for highway improvements with the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec is once again the only one bearing the 
burden of highway development.  I trust that the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi will have a better idea which direction to take with 
his steamroller, the next time he takes the floor in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have benefited.  In one program alone, under grants 
and contributions, 28,000 new jobs have been created which employ 
Canadians.  The main thing is that with our investment of about 
$300 million we have leveraged $2.7 billion to partner with us, 
for a net gain of $3 billion of economic activity in regions of 
high unemployment.  The people who live in those regions know

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the parliamentary secretary cannot give us more of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister of Health indicated that his department 
was studying the NAFTA implications of Bill 11 in Alberta.  We 
welcome this.  We think it should have happened a long time ago. 
But time is now of the essence.  By the time we come back from 
the Easter recess Bill 11 could have passed and the wall that 
protects Canada's medicare system could well have been breached 
by then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What contingency plans does the minister have to stop Bill 11 
and to stop Premier Klein from committing this act which has 
irreversible and national consequences? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first, there are differing points of view on that question.  The 
hon. member has expressed one, there are others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job of this government and its lawyers is to examine those 
various interpretations to determine which is the most sensible, 
and then develop policy on that basis.  That is what we are 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NAFTA is only one of the concerns we have about Bill 11.  We 
think it is bad policy.  We have also written to the Alberta 
government saying that enhanced services should not be sold for 
profit at a private for profit hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has not yet passed.  Amendments will be coming before 
the Alberta legislature.  We hope the bill, as it emerges—if it 
emerges—will not contain that feature. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I say to the minister that he cannot afford to be wrong 
in his interpretation of the NAFTA.  Time is of the essence.  We 
cannot afford to allow the bill to pass if there is any 
uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we passed Bill C-20 in the House, which said that 
Quebec could not unilaterally separate from Canada, that the 
interests and rights of all Canadians must be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does Premier Klein get the right to unilaterally sabotage 
a national social program which all Canadians value?  What will 
the national Minister of Health do about this? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the national Minister of Health, from the beginning of this 
debate in November, has made it very clear that the Government of 
Canada will safeguard the principles of our national health care 
system.  We have done precisely that in the positions we have 
taken and on the issues we have identified for the Klein 
government, including NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell the hon. member that not only NAFTA, but the combination 
of enhanced services being sold at a private for profit hospital, 
elements of conflict of interest and overnight stays enlarging 
the role of private for profit hospitals at an accelerated rate 
are all issues that have been taken up with the Alberta 
government, and we will continue to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bank lobbyist Barry Campbell, a long time Liberal, organized a 
huge fundraiser for the minister last fall, raising over $70,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the minister consider the clear violation of the conflict of

<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, prior to the

said that as long as the solicitation was broadly based there 
would be no problem if financial institutions attended or were 
invited.

<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
is no solicitor like an old solicitor.  If there was no conflict 
of interest, why is federal ethics counsellor actually 
investigating? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barry Campbell, a friend of the minister, was a lobbyist for the 
Bank of Nova Scotia from May 1998 to mid-March 1999, a period 
when the bank mergers were under discussion and review by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister compromise the merger review with his close 
affiliation with the bank lobbyist representing the Bank of Nova 
Scotia who later rewarded this loyalty with $70,000 of 
fundraising? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Let me be very clear, Mr. 
Speaker.  Mr. Campbell is a former colleague and a long time 
friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Willowdale's regular finance chair could not be available 
for the event, I asked Mr. Campbell to replace him.  He did.  At 
no point while he was the chair of our fundraising dinner did I 
have any dealings with Mr. Campbell in any area of my 
responsibility.

an inquiry would be most effective if public servants at HRDC

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister continues to totally contradict her department

</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have a great deal of sympathy for the cause, which is 
multiple sclerosis, and I have a great deal of admiration for the 
person who was named in the statement, I think it would be a 
mistake if we were to get into the habit or even allow it to pass 
without comment when members rise in their place and give 
telephone numbers and addresses as to where people could donate 
to certain causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is something that the Chair might perhaps want to 
comment on.  If there is no rule against it, it seems to me there 
should be.  I just wanted to register my own concern about that 
particular event. 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had not intended to rise on 
this point but now that the hon. member has raised it, there 
could be a precedence here that should be looked at either by the 
Chair, and if not, then perhaps House leaders could arrive at a 
consensus to make a recommendation, if there is none available, 
to the Chair immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that using Standing Order 31 for the purpose of 
fundraising for charitable causes, and in this case a very 
excellent one, is perhaps a precedent that we should be very 
careful of setting.

question raised by the member.  If the House leader of the

together with all House leaders to talk about it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that this issue has come up. We in 
the House should also understand and respect the right of each 
member to submit to the House issues that are importance to them. 
If the information in that S. O. 31 was important to the member 
then it should also be respected and kept in mind if any 
decisions are made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have done a lot of research on non-profit 
organizations and charities.  The reality is that although there 
are very many worthy charities, sometimes it is impossible to 
tell when a charity is not worthy.  I think it would be a great 
mistake to set a precedence whereby members would be promoting 
one charity or another charity when there is always some danger 
that the charities may, indeed, not be worthy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is ready to at least 
say something on this subject.  It is a matter of some concern to 
the chair, not just because of the point raised today but because 
there have been other occasions when the Chair occupant has been 
in the House and has heard statements listing other members' 
number so people can call and complain or giving various sorts of 
advertising for different causes.  They are sometimes of interest 
and sometimes of great amusement but they are not always ones 
that are necessarily widely appreciated on every side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being conscious of that and being conscious of the freedom of 
speech that the Chair seeks to ensure for all hon. members in the 
House, I respect the submissions that have been made by all hon. 
members who have said something on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of all hon. members, I will read from page 364 
of Marleau-Montpetit.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has also cautioned Members not to use this period to 
make defamatory comments about non-Members, nor to use the 
verbatim remarks of a private citizen as a statement, nor to make 
statements of a commercial nature. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we have stepped beyond a charity, to commercial in this 
case, I am not prepared to rule.  I would caution members to 
exercise discretion in their use of the time they have.  It is a 
one minute statement.  There are guidelines.  If hon. members 
feel uncertain about the guidelines I urge them to read chapter 
10 of Marleau-Montpetit and conduct themselves accordingly.

parliament to prioritize funding for the national highway system,

fatalities and injuries on the roadways, alleviate congestion, 
lower vehicle operating costs and reduce emissions, improve

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that Canada has the second highest 
rate of breast cancer in the world, second only to the United 
States.  They also point out that the U.S. has had a mandatory 
mammography quality assurance standard since 1994 and that Canada 
has no legislation for mandatory mammography quality assurance 
standards.

I have a petition signed by virtually hundreds of Canadians, most 
of them from the Victoria and Nanaimo, B.C. area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that 
one in five Canadian children live in poverty; that on November 
24, 1989 the House of Commons unanimously resolved to end child 
poverty in Canada by the year 2000; and that since 1989 the 
number of poor children in Canada has increased 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They therefore call upon parliament to use the federal budget 
2000 to introduce a multi-year plan to improve the well-being of 
Canada's children.  The budget is already over but the sentiments 
of these Canadians continues on to other budgets and beyond.

a unique institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will realize, of course, Mr. Speaker, that the House of

legislation that defines marriage as a union of opposite sex 
persons and that it has ensured that marriage is recognized as a

Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present.  The first

The petitioners are concerned that under the Criminal Code of 
Canada it is currently not a criminal offence for an adult to 
engage in sexual activity with a young person aged 14 years or 
older if the young person consents to sexual activity, as long as 
the adult is not in a position of trust or authority over the 
young person.  The petitioners therefore ask that parliament 
amend the Criminal Code of Canada to raise the age of consent for 
sexual activity for a young person from 14 to 18 years of age.

Mr. Speaker, the petitioners who have signed the second petition 
are concerned about Bill C-23.  I am, as well.  They suggest that 
it is an inappropriate intrusion and discriminatory for the 
federal government to extend benefits based on a person's private 
sexual activity while excluding other types of dependency 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners ask that parliament withdraw Bill C-23, affirm 
the opposite sex definition of marriage in the legislation and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the government's record on that issue, a fat lot of good a 
petition would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last petition I wish to present is related, as well, to Bill 
C-23.  It states that the government has invoked time allocation 
to cut off debate on Bill C-23 and that the Prime Minister has 
indicated that a free vote would not be allowed.  I see that it 
was.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT

<A NAME="LINK201">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-19, an 
act respecting genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes 
and to implement the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court, and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Bill C-19 is, of course, a very important bill that 
has international and national ramifications here at home.  It 
highlights a very serious situation at a time when our Prime 
Minister is in the Middle East making numerous comments which 
have made Canada the focus of the world stage. 
He has made some very reckless comments, which have been referred 
to in the House.  It is no joking matter.  Sadly, some of the 
commentary that has been highlighted is quite pathetic in nature, 
and the ramifications are most serious for Canada as our 
international reputation is very much at stake.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning back to the bill at hand, it is very clear that the 
parlance in this legislation is basically aimed at the defence of 
disobedience to superiors' orders and peace officers who use a 
certain type of defence.  The bill is aimed, in essence, at 
scrutinizing very closely the defence that individuals were 
simply taking orders when partaking in some of the most heinous 
crimes imaginable.  Instances in which this type of defence is 
raised and circumstances where the accused has no moral choice as 
to whether he or she could follow the order are addressed in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we refer to moral choice we mean that other particular 
circumstances might exist where there was such an air of 
compulsion or threat to the accused that he or she had no 
alternative but to obey orders.  Obviously this argument was 
maintained throughout the trial of R. v Finta and, for those 
reasons, on March 24, 1997 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that 
Mr. Finta could not be found guilty of the crimes against him. It 
is a very troubling situation, one that takes a great deal of 
moral intrusion and comprehension as to the human dynamics that 
exist when a person in authority is faced with this type of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure hon. members, as a former crown prosecutor, that 
the provisions included in Bill C-19 are very necessary and 
welcome.  It is a shame, however, that rather than amend Canadian 
law to do away with some of these grey areas when it comes to 
prosecuting individuals for war crimes or crimes against 
humanity, or when these specific defences are invoked, the 
federal government opted instead for a course of action whereby 
war criminals could be deported to their native country as a 
temporary solution to the problem at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with that said, this is a very complicated process 
because in most cases the events in question took place as far 
back as the second world war and sometimes before.  Many of those 
events that date back 50 years are increasingly difficult to deal 
with, simply because the individuals who may be involved or who 
may be able to give evidence are no longer available or, in some 
cases, are no longer living or no longer compos mentis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The individuals who perpetrated war crimes and crimes against 
humanity under the Nazi regime fall very much into the latter 
category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the same problems surface when justice department 
officials attempt to find witnesses to those events to justify 
the extradition or the prosecution.  Evidence sometimes goes 
missing and key witnesses, as referred to, may no longer be 
available. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the offences of genocide, war crimes and 
crimes against humanity committed outside Canada are covered 
under clause 6 of Bill C-19.  Contrary to the three offences 
defined in clause 4, those in clause 6 are based on the 
provisions of international law existing at the time they are 
committed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Henceforth, perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity or 
war crimes could be brought to justice regardless of where the 
crime was committed.  Furthermore, pursuant to subclause 6(4), 
the crimes in question could be dealt with if they were committed 
prior to July 17, 1998, the date on which the Rome Statute was 
adopted by the United Nations.  As such, the bill applies 
retroactively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate again all members of the committee and the 
minister for bringing this bill to fruition.  In that precaution, 
if this had not taken place, this bill would have been, some 
would argue, irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another particularity of the bill is that in the case of war 
crimes or crimes against humanity or genocide committed outside 
Canada or within Canada, clauses 5 and 7 of the bill make it an 
offence for a military commander or other superior to fail to 
take reasonable steps or exercise proper control over one or more 
military or civilian person under their command. 
As a result, very serious offences may sometimes be committed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of offences committed outside Canada, subclause 7(5) 
provides for criminal prosecution before the coming into force of 
Bill C-19, to the extent that at the time and place of the act of 
omission the latter constitutes a contravention of customary or 
conventional international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the offender may be prosecuted if the criminal 
act according to the general principles of law is recognized by 
the community of nations, whether or not it constituted a 
contravention of law in force at the time and in the place of its 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is fairly complete, as it gives jurisdiction to 
Canadian courts in the case of offences committed outside Canada 
through clause 8.  This clause also recognizes that Canadian 
courts have the authority to prosecute any person charged with 
having committed specific acts, providing one of the conditions 
is listed exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, if a person was a Canadian citizen or was employed 
by Canada at the time, perhaps in a civilian or military 
capacity, or if the victim was a Canadian citizen, there may be 
some attachment to Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party supports this idea.  Canadian courts also 
have jurisdiction to prosecute if, at the time the offence was 
committed, Canada could, in conformity with international law, 
exercise jurisdiction over the person with respect to the offence 
on the basis of that person's presence in Canada before or after 
said criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the defence of superior orders, which is perhaps 
one of the most compelling and interesting aspects of this bill, 
and the defences which stem from it, can be used, barring a few 
exceptions.  The defence of superior orders should be in 
compliance with the provisions set out in the Rome Statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, an accused cannot base his defence solely on the 
belief that it was an order if it was unlawful and if the belief 
was based on information about a civilian population or an 
identified group of people who encouraged the commission of 
inhumane acts or omissions against the population or group. 
There is potential for prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 puts aside the Finta decision, to all intents and 
purposes, and is a good step toward the pursuit of justice.  Bill 
C-19, because of its complexity and because of the objective it 
pursues, also makes it an offence to possess or launder property 
obtained as a result of the commission of the proposed new 
offences.  This is a good provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and the Progressive Conservative Party fully support the 
principle that no one should profit from war crimes.  Obviously 
there is potential for further legislation.  If the government 
wanted to make sure that all war criminals would and could be 
convicted, other laws might have to be modified.  I am referring 
to the Citizenship Act and the Extradition Act which, through 
their new provisions, would make it easier to prosecute. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 33 of Bill C-19 would amend the Citizenship Act so that 
while a person is under investigation by the Minister of 
Justice, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service for one of the offences in Bill 
C-9, that person shall not be granted citizenship or take the 
oath of citizenship. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-19, Canada now has an obligation to 
surrender people caught by the ICC for genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to section 48 of the Extradition Act, a person who is 
the subject on a request for surrender cannot claim immunity from 
arrest or extradition under common law or by statute under the 
Extradition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, by stating that victims of war crimes have 
suffered terrible ordeals is to understate the obvious.  Through 
Bill C-19 Canada takes the position that no war criminal is safe 
or welcome within our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a positive undertaking on behalf of the government which 
is supported, I believe, by all opposition parties.  The 
Progressive Conservative Party also affirms this principle. 
Canada cannot tolerate our wonderful country being used as a safe 
haven to escape responsibility for acts so heinous and so 
atrocious against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be ample opportunity to review further provisions 
within this bill. 
As it moves to committee, there will be opportunity to modify and 
perhaps improve upon this legislation at that time.

<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, when we look at this legislation, it appears on 
the face of it to be a good thing.   We all have concerns about 
human rights and war crimes.  We would have to say that the devil 
is in the details or in some cases lack of details in respect to 
some of these things.  There are some very vague definitions and 
in other cases, no definitions at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports war crime tribunals in practice and the 
apprehension, trial, conviction and punishment by due process of 
genuine war criminals.  However, we have some serious 
reservations about the international criminal court.  We have 
these reservations because the statutes that were agreed to in 
Rome in 1998 regarding the international criminal court were 
negotiated without adequate public consultation and input from 
parliament.  They were negotiated with the aid of NGOs that did 
not represent the values and principles of most Canadians.  The 
international criminal court is flawed in several ways.  From the 
larger perspective of international treaties in general, we see 
that there needs to be a democratic reform of the whole 
treaty-making process in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An esteemed member of the Bloc yesterday put forward a private 
member's bill in regard to this whole problem.  We agree to these 
international treaties without ever having scrutinized them 
within this House and without having had any discussion or forum 
across the country.   We see the same problem in what is before 
us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports foreign policy guided by the values and the 
principles of Canadians, that is political democracy, economic 
freedom and human rights.  Therefore, we support in principle the 
idea of war crimes tribunals.  However, as I said, the 
international criminal court threatens to become an unaccountable 
institution with power to investigate, prosecute, indict and try 
citizens of Canada, thus undermining Canadian sovereignty and 
Canadian justice.  As a new and permanent international 
institution, the international criminal court creates a new power 
hungry United Nations type of bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and its like-minded allies failed to win the support of 
the United States and some other critical countries around the 
world.  Without that support, the input and the co-operation of 
those major countries in the world, how can the international 
criminal court ever be effective or ensure true justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international criminal court threatens to become an 
international stick in the hands of rogue states and special 
interest groups in particular to beat the United States and its 
allies, including Canada.  That would be the primary intent of 
certain of those who are involved.  The international criminal 
court could undermine the ability of UN members to act in the 
interests of international security and peace, for example, 
stopping Saddam Hussein or sending a message to terrorists. 
Charter and common law rights such as the right to a fair trial 
by jury would not be guaranteed under the international criminal 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government paid for special interest groups to 
attend five weeks of meetings in and to advise the Canadian 
delegation.  I do not have time to speak today about some of the 
shenanigans and games that were played.   There were secret 
meetings off to the side.  Certain other Canadian people were 
shut out because it was known that they would oppose certain 
elements and aspects of the international criminal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure to consult with Canadians about what is wanted at 
the international criminal court is a major problem.  Canadians 
were again left out of the process as they were at Kyoto and with 
the MAI, the multilateral agreement on investment.  This 
situation is no different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the people, through parliament, should have an 
oversight of treaty making and international agreements well 
before it gets to the stage where we have our leaders signing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international criminal court will have power to investigate. 
I think we are pretty much agreed in terms of the war crimes 
area, but there are other vague terms such as crimes of 
aggression that are used where it is left wide open to judges 
from around the world who will constitute the tribunal to 
interpret. 
It is another reason why we have some serious reservations about 
this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support human rights objectives in co-operation with 
international organizations.  Such activities must be the result 
of free and sovereign Canadian initiatives acted at the will of 
parliament through international instruments of our choice and 
not the other way around.  The emphasis should be on working with 
them as that suggests a voluntary nature of working alongside 
them instead of an element of coercion as is the case here.  This 
is another reason why we have for many decades now supported ad 
hoc tribunals, agencies with a sunset provision rather than 
permanent bureaucracies and the concept of an unaccountable 
international court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some supporters are calling for empowering this court to 
prosecute not only war crimes and things of that sort, but to 
prosecute drug trafficking, something we should be going after, 
as well as such other vague offences as serious threats to the 
environment and committing outrages on personal dignity, 
whatever that possibly could mean.  This is the direction many 
individuals are pushing this to go.  Obviously we do have 
concerns about some of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an alliance, we are certainly prepared to work with 
international organizations, but we feel it should be our 
Canadian parliament first and foremost that makes decisions.  We 
should not give up our sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read for the record part of a letter from a rather 
outstanding individual, Judge Eli Nathan, head of the delegation 
of Israel to the UN diplomatic conference where this was being 
discussed.  I read this into the record because Israel was one of 
the countries that over the years because of the Holocaust and so 
on has had a real strong interest in a court, generally speaking, 
of this nature.  Israel initiated this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Israel was the original country to come up with this idea and 
has been promoting it because of the terrible injustices and 
genocide committed against its people.  I think it rather 
significant and very noteworthy that Israel itself had to back 
away and could not vote in favour of the statutes agreed upon by 
other countries.  Israel, as one of the prime movers of this, had 
to back away and could not give its approval. I will cite at 
least one of its major concerns but it has other concerns as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter from Judge Eli Nathan states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, it causes me considerable pain, both personally as 
a victim of the Nazi persecution of the Jewish people, and on 
behalf of the Israeli delegation which I proudly head, to have to 
explain the negative vote which Israel has been unwillingly 
obliged to cast today with regard to the Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that out of the embers of the Holocaust against 
the Jewish people—the greatest and most heinous crime to have 
been committed in the history of mankind, came the calls of Jews 
throughout the world, and leading Israeli lawyers and statesmen, 
as far back as the early 1950s, for the establishment of an 
International Criminal Court, as a vital means of ensuring that 
criminals who commit such heinous and terrible crimes will be 
duly brought to justice.  This was, Mr. President...our idea! 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “With this aim in mind, Mr. President,” and having 
regard to the world renowned judiciary established in Israel, we 
have enthusiastically and quite responsibly been involved at the 
earlier stages here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on to point out and make the particular point: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore fail to comprehend why it has been considered 
necessary to insert into the fist of the most heinous and 
grievous war crimes, the action of transferring population into 
occupied territory, as it appears in Article 8, Paragraph 2(b), 
subpara.viii. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without entering here into the question of the substantive 
status of any particular alleged violation of the Geneva 
Convention...can it really be held that such an action as that 
listed in Article 8 above really ranks among the most heinous and 
serious war crimes— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That refers to the resettling of people as they have done in the 
Middle East.  We can question that but there are many in the 
world who do not accept that on the rank of a heinous war crime 
or the nature of the others listed.  He asks whether: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—this has been inserted as a means of utilising and abusing the 
Statute of the International Criminal Court and the International 
Criminal Court itself as one more political tool in the Middle 
East conflict? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gets to the nub of it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This international criminal court already has become very 
politicized and will be more than ever because of the special 
interest groups that are involved, the radical feminist groups 
and the anti-family groups and so on.  It will be a very 
politicized tool in the hands of elite and special interest 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the delegates, this esteemed judge from Israel, goes on 
to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all our entreaties, during the discussions of the 
Prep-Com as well as here in Rome and directly to capitols, this 
paragraph still remains as a symbol of politicization, sullying 
the entire Statute. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, neither the Delegation of Israel nor other 
delegations have been given the opportunity to vote against 
inclusion in the Statute of Article 8, Paragraph 2(b), 
sub-para.viii. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further talks about his frustration at this politicization of 
the statute and the court.  Then he goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, Israel has other problems with the Statute, which 
we will address at the appropriate time. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very insightful and eye-opening to understand that a 
country, which of all should most be concerned and wanting 
something like this, has grave concerns with the direction this 
has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned before the matter of overriding our national 
sovereignty.  This permanent international body, if that is what 
it becomes, could be very unaccountable and might override the 
sovereignty of our nation's legal and government systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people defend it and say that it has been structured so 
that the sovereignty of nations will remain primordial, and it 
does so by requiring the enactment of domestic legislation as 
before us in each ratifying state, which gives that sovereign 
state both the judicial equipment and the right to prosecute 
suspected cases of the said crimes domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would rebut that by saying that requiring an enactment of 
legislation does not allay our fears.  The legislation may simply 
enact the signing away of Canada's sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, while the legislation gives Canada the right to 
prosecute suspected cases of said crimes, there is a whole list 
of them and there are some vagaries in there as well, we do have 
the right to prosecute domestically.  It also imposes not only a 
right but an obligation to do so with the penalty being that the 
international criminal court will step in and take over if in its 
judgment Canada does not fulfil its obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our courts over the course of time, including the supreme court, 
are dangerously close to conceding Canada's sovereignty.  For 
example, a recent decision in the Supreme Court of Canada states 
that international covenants have no direct application within 
Canadian law, however, it goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the values reflected in international human rights 
laws may help inform the contextual approach to statutory 
interpretation and judicial review...The legislature is presumed 
to respect the value and principles enshrined— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In whatever international law happens to be out there. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so far as possible, therefore, interpretations that reflect 
these values and principles are preferred. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Chief Justice 
Antonio Lamer gave impetus to that when he said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Charter can be understood to give effect to Canada's 
international legal obligations, and should therefore be 
interpreted in a way that conforms to those obligations. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying here is that we have in effect been invoking 
international arguments about which Canadians and their 
legitimate lawmakers were never properly consulted, and that is 
the problem, getting back to the ceding of our sovereignty to 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we also find somewhat disconcerting is the fact that Bill 
C-19 writes a blank cheque.  What I find rather disturbing is the 
fact that the rules of procedure and evidence are currently being 
negotiated through a series of meetings of prep-coms which 
include delegations from signatory states and other interested 
states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The details of precise meetings, of terms found in the statute, 
evidence and court procedures and administrative structure are to 
be concluded in consensus agreements adjacent to, not part of, 
after the fact, it seems.  It is kind of like buying a pig in a 
poke or signing a blank cheque for these things to be worked out 
over the course of time, but we already agreed to be part of the 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations address some of the critical and fundamental 
issues, the things that as we said before are not discussed here 
in parliament.  Issues such as the definition of aggression and 
other terms, the conditions of imprisonment, judicial protocol 
are controversial issues.  All of these decisions taken at these 
negotiations should be subject to the input and ratification of 
parliament, otherwise the values of Canadians might not be 
adequately enshrined in the law, the structure and procedure of 
the criminal court.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also draw attention to something which may be of interest to 
some.  Some words make up new terms and expressions in a 
surreptitious manner. I draw attention to some of the concerns 
from the pro-family, pro-life perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were certain things with respect to the protection of 
family and so on which some of the Mideast and Arab nations 
wanted to be put in yet they were turned aside.  They have grave 
concerns about the intrusion into family and imposing our 
culture, a western mindset if you will, on some of the other 
cultures.  Some of the Arab states are concerned about removing 
protection for families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one is in terms of respect for life or a pro-life point 
of view.  They realized they could not get abortion into the 
statutes, so instead they talked about enforced pregnancy.  That 
was a new one to me.  What is enforced pregnancy?  We find out as 
we begin to read the material and get at a definition of what 
they have in mind.  An enforced pregnancy is where a woman has 
become pregnant, a wife or a girlfriend, and she has to carry the 
child for nine months.  I think this is a beautiful and wonderful 
thing.  An enforced pregnancy is when there is no access to 
abortion so in effect the pregnancy has to run its course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries that do not have abortion facilities nor provide that 
option to women would be subject to the International Criminal 
Court. An enforced pregnancy has to go its nine months because 
the abortion clinic or facility is not available. It would be a 
punishable crime if a country did not provide abortion clinics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1992 in the state of Utah, the American Civil 
Liberties Association came up with this new, strange and perverse 
wording.  It argued that the law caused enforced pregnancy 
because there was no possibility of an abortion, that a woman had 
to carry and give birth to a child, that it was an intolerable 
and dehumanizing form of servitude. It said that it was an awful, atrocious 
thing and tantamount to a war crime, a crime against 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of special interest groups have got in at the very 
beginning and are pushing their point of view in a pretty 
persistent way.  In fact these groups can have individuals 
helping out in the International Criminal Court, funded by 
wealthy individuals, the billionaires of this world, and of 
course are beholden somewhat to those individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of the International Criminal Court, we should support 
the continuation of the concept of ad hoc international 
tribunals.  Such tribunals would not be permanent.  They would 
always remain ad hoc and subject to “sunset provisions” as are 
the tribunals that operate at present.  An ad hoc body has the 
advantage of being able to be set up and dismantled again by 
sovereign governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bureaucrats of ad hoc bodies in turn can be removed at the 
will of elected parliamentarians by dismantling these bodies. 
That is why officials and bureaucrats are keen supporters of a 
permanent body that is not subject to the will of the electorate 
or the public in any one country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Primarily, because of the imposition of international law, and 
we have a good law system here in Canada, there is an overriding 
of our sovereignty.  The vagueness of some of the definitions 
leaves room to shoehorn in some rather strange terms that impose 
other cultures upon certain countries around the world, to which 
we have major objections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect we are signing a blank cheque.  The rules of procedure 
and evidence, which are well established and have stood the test 
of time in our country and within the British Commonwealth, are 
still being made up on the fly.  We would be signing on to 
something over which we would not have proper control with 
respect to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those and other reasons, notably that there are certain 
major countries around the world that have grave concerns, it is 
not a good thing for our country. Countries like Israel no less 
have not been able to sign on because of the politicization of 
the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may suit the Liberal government and its agenda of soft power, 
but frankly we think for a whole host of reasons, it is not a 
good thing to do.  As a Canadian Alliance government coming into 
power, we would have to revoke and pull back on this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to 
the hon. member for Wanuskewin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not think that Bill C-19 deals with some very important 
issues of implementing a process by which people cannot commit 
crimes against humanity?  Genocide and war crimes are defined in 
the bill.  Is he suggesting to the House that this bill is not 
trying to deal with an extremely important question in the world 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the member was here when President Václav Havel 
from the Czech Republic was here.  He talked about the fact that 
in the new century the nation-state concept was giving ground to 
wider responsibilities.  From everything I have read and know of 
him, I suggest that Václav Havel would be supportive of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in the bill that any citizen of goodwill in Canada or 
another country would not support?  With Kosovo, Rwanda and with 
all of the catastrophes we have seen around the world, this bill 
is something all of us should support, not just members on this 
side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I certainly 
appreciate the question asked by the hon. member.  There is no 
doubt in my mind that he has probably looked at the greater 
document, the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of 
Plenipotentiaries on the establishment of an International 
Criminal Court, the five weeks of meetings in Rome and some of 
the other things. I referred to the Israeli concern in terms of 
the politicization of the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, I am of the view that we need to prosecute and pursue these 
people to the full extent of the law.  We need to go after them. 
We have to reach into these different countries and so on.  I 
think we can do that by the ad hoc tribunals of the past.  I am 
not sure what this is going to do that we have not already been 
able to do.  If we cannot get access to those people by way of ad 
hoc tribunals, how will we be able to it by way of this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very much aware, and no doubt the hon. member is 
somewhat aware, that over the years we have had the aspect of 
victors' justice.  I have never seen a situation historically. 
These bodies when they came together for prosecution, it was 
always from the perspective of the conquerors and not the 
vanquished. We look at some of this stuff within the 
International Criminal Court.  If we were to go back to some of 
the actions that were taken on the part of the victors, they 
sometimes deserve due consideration but in the real world that 
probably will not happen.  I have concerns for that reason as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different cultural backgrounds.  Frankly, to load all 
that into a situation would on many occasions be an imposition of 
a western mindset or world view in respect to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we could address these things, as we have in the 
past, by ad hoc tribunals.  I am not convinced that this is any 
improvement.  In fact, I see all kinds of flaws and problems in 
terms of usurping our country's sovereignty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like 
the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa, I am 
mystified at how anybody can find fault with what is being put 
forward today.  I cannot understand how people can fail to see it 
and mix in as part of the argument such narrow and parochial 
views such as abortion or whatever special interest group the 
hon. member happens to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me that the hon. member for Wanuskewin has failed to 
recognize that the international institutions to deal with these 
things are inadequate.  They were not adequate during Kosovo.  We 
bumbled our way through the Balkans.  The whole world, as are 
hon. members and guests who have visited this House recently, is 
calling out to leaders around the world to come together.  If we 
are going to have the globalization of capital, we must also have 
the globalization of human rights, labour standards, 
environmental standards and the rule of law in order to enforce 
those newly agreed upon standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want the hon. member to restate the arguments he has 
already put forward which I thought were very weak.  Does the 
hon. member have any way to defend his position other than 
dredging up his family values, special interests, abortion and so 
on?  I ask the hon. member to leave that stuff to the side and 
honestly try to address how to defend or criticize a concept of 
an international institution that is capable of dealing with the 
very complex issues of globalization and globalization standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I certainly will. 
As I move to do that I do not apologize for my pro-family 
concerns.  I do not apologize for acting on behalf of Arab 
families and these were the states that brought these concerns 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say when we have brought into the International Criminal 
Court some of the statements and others pushing for other things 
with respect to environmental issues and those being tantamount 
or ranking equally with crimes against humanity, war crimes and 
so on, I have considerable concerns about that.  We would begin 
to shoehorn all other kinds of things. We talk in terms of 
aggressions that are undefined.  What exactly do we mean by that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am concerned that this would become captive to special 
interest groups that would drive the agenda.  We already have 
enough issues in terms of judicial activism within our own 
country, never mind some unaccountable group of the United 
Nations which would be entrenched forever.  We have no way of 
recalling those people.  We have dollars to no end that are 
wasted in my view on some of the United Nations activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This just adds another big monster with respect to trying to do 
things that can be done effectively in other ways.  Sunset clause 
tribunals that are ad hoc over a shorter period of time can get 
to the same result. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today to Bill C-19, on the 
issue of the International Criminal Court, its purpose and 
relationship to Canadian law and rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will do an overview on the purpose of the International 
Criminal Court.  It is designed to be a permanent institution 
that would prosecute serious crimes of international concern.  It 
is designed to be complementary to national criminal 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that our Minister of Foreign Affairs is vigorously 
supportive of this court.  On September 25, 1998 when the 
minister appeared before the UN General Assembly he said, “A strong 
reinvigorated United Nations is still the best foundation for the 
future.  The contours of that future are emerging.  A new system 
based on humanitarian standards and new practices based on 
humanitarian needs and human security is emerging.  Also 
enhancing human security requires establishing new legal 
instruments.  The agreement in Rome which establishes the ICC, 
the International Criminal Court, is a major step toward that 
goal”. Our minister has stated publicly and internationally that 
he supports this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In trying to review issues like this one I believe in doing an 
equilibrium or balance. I will try to do that today to lay out 
some of the positives behind the bill, this institution, this 
court and then highlight some of the potential concerns which I 
think could well be addressed and should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the positive side, the crimes are defined pretty specifically 
as crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
A reasonable thinking Canadian citizen would say that any of 
those things should be prosecuted, should be taken care of and 
should see sanctions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT35"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT35"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second positive aspect would be that war criminals would have 
difficulty hiding.  In this modern day of rapid communication it 
would be very difficult for a war criminal from another country 
to hide.  With international scrutiny and the scrutiny of the 
public, I think that would surely be a positive.  This process 
would leave the right to prosecute still with the nation's 
judicial system.  In other words, if Canada had a war criminal 
living here, we could prosecute that individual here under 
Canadian law.  To my mind that would be appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I find positive is that the bill is a forward 
looking bill which could not look backward at crimes committed 
before the bill was enacted.  We have a bill which is trying to 
look at things that most reasonable thinking individuals would 
say are horrific.  They should not be condoned.  They should not 
be allowed.  They should be prosecuted.  To that end those are 
the positives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns are there related to going down this road?  One of 
the concerns is about national sovereignty.  When there are extra 
country bodies there is a concern about national sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to my colleague from the NDP, which is regularly 
against globalization when it relates to financial issues, 
praising globalization of court issues.  That is one thing I 
would like to engage in, in terms of an information gathering 
source.  If globalization is bad with these big international 
companies coming in and taking over, and I think that is a 
legitimate concern in some cases, how is it that suddenly 
globalization of a court system would cause no anxiety 
whatsoever?  There seems to be a bit of an imbalance in that 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National sovereignty is a concern.  Would the prosecutor have 
powers that would override national laws?  I am not certain that 
I have the answer to that.  I pose that more as a question than 
as a statement of fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second big issue for me is accountability.  That is a 
buzzword phrase these days in politics.  By that I mean that if 
there is an expansion of rules relating to specified crimes, if 
there is a problem with the bureaucracy growing and becoming very 
expensive, are those mechanisms of accountability present?  In my 
reading of this issue that is another question mark.  The 
regulations which go with these processes often do not follow the 
line or the trend intended.  Accountability is a second concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of cost.  It would be a very foolish 
politician who said “Here is a blank cheque.  Let's have an 
international court that is not subject to cost”.  I listened to 
those who said that war crimes tribunals would be more expensive 
than an international criminal court.  I have yet to see an 
international organization save money, especially one run by 
politicians and bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The politicization of some of these issues, these war crimes, is 
another concern I have.  I will use the specific example of 
expansion.  I said before that one of the big crimes was crimes 
against humanity.  That is a very broad categorization.  During 
war crimes rape is one of the horrific crimes.  No one would 
argue with that.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another crime under crimes against humanity is enslavement.  If 
someone were to ask me if a soldier enslaving a group of 
individuals would be a war crime, my answer would be 
categorically yes.  To bring people under bondage is a crime 
against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if the definitions went a little further?  In a relatively 
more narrow form the family position in many Arab countries is 
that the woman stays home, covered and does not have much 
interchange with the masculine component of society.  What if 
that were to become enslavement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from members of Arab nations that they have 
concerns in that regard.  How would I prevent those definitions 
expanding?  The means to do that so there are no court challenges 
would be to have very specific definitions of enslavement.  I 
will not go deeper into that, but the specific way in which those 
crimes are defined is very important in something of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned briefly the issue of globalization.  There are many 
who think that globalization is absolutely ideal when it comes to 
economic issues.  There are many who think that globalization is 
absolutely ideal when it comes to a large police force in the 
world to do peacekeeping.  There are many who think that 
globalization is ideal with regard to a court system for these 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise my own personal concerns because I have not seen good 
accountability, good cost control and a lack of politicization at 
that level.  The idea of going after criminals worldwide for 
heinous crimes is one that any sound thinking Canadian would 
support vigorously.  The bill may end up being supportable.  Bill 
C-19 may end up having enough definition and specificity brought 
to it.  I certainly hope that would be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pause in my commentary on the international criminal 
court and sum up by saying that I believe this could move toward 
a point where it is supportable.  At this point in time, in terms 
of the positive and the negative, maybe we need to tip the scales 
of balance a bit to bring in more of the positive before I could 
personally support the way the bill is laid out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke 
indicates it is one hand or the other for him, but does he not 
think that there is much that is positive in the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who has been, for example, to Rwanda has seen the bodies 
of people as I have in the schools that are still there.  Does he 
not think that we need something like this that will help us to 
bring to justice people who commit these crimes outside Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member admires Václav Havel too.  Was this not the 
kind of thing that President Havel was talking about when he 
spoke to the House not so long ago?  What would it take to tip 
the balance for the hon. member so that he could support the 
bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I value the opinion of the 
member opposite.  I have always found him to be a very fair and 
balanced individual.  The positives that I mentioned of course 
were not allowing war criminals to escape by hiding in a 
jurisdiction, the definitions of the crimes and having an 
oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns I have relate to expanding definitions of some of 
these crimes and having an impact on cultures which do not 
operate like those in Canada.  I do not think it would be 
impossible to make the bill very supportable.  The definitions of 
the war crimes would need to be pretty specific. 
They would have to exclude some things that activists might go 
after.  I do not mean to spend a lot of time on that, but issues 
of costs and accountability would be very well and properly laid 
out.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I did not mention was the comparison between the ad

long term hope is that this sort of thing would not be necessary, 
that we would be able to co-operate in an international way, and 
that brotherhood and wonderful values would prevail.  Perhaps the 
eternal optimist in me is showing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think my concerns are insurmountable.  I would hope 
that we could review these things in a good and open spirited 
dialogue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my question is with respect to some of the other 
material in the Statutes of Rome.  I am referring to a rather 
intriguing section in chapter 6 under genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the member define the things included under article 
6(b)?  It talks about causing mental harm to members of the 
group.  In another place I read in article 8(c)(ii) that it talks 
about committing outrageous acts upon personal dignity.  Would 
the member have a way of defining or telling me exactly what that 
means? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe those 
definitions are not specific enough for me.  I think my colleague 
is moving in the same direction as I am.  If we are to define 
crimes against humanity, let us be specific.  Most of us 
understand that these are major crimes such as genocide.  Wiping 
out a population for political purposes is absolutely against 
everything I believe in.  Since time immemorial we have had 
people who have purposes that I do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not go down the road of politicization.  Let us not go 
down the road of saying that if there were a war and a host of 
people were being held in an area against their will would 
somehow be the definition of crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talk about murder.  I talk about rape.  I talk about torture. 
I talk about the awful things that happen.  Let us make sure that 
we stay on real true crimes against humanity rather than going to 
some idea that is hard to define such as mental cruelty.  I have 
real trouble with that in my own family.  I sometimes think my 
teenagers practise mental cruelty on me.  I hope I would not be 
confined for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, the debate today on Bill C-19 
concerns setting up an International Criminal Court that would 
deal with serious issues like genocide and various other crimes 
between nations and internally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea for this court came up after the serious issues of the 
second world war involving the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials.  It 
also came from the current United Nations special war crimes 
tribunals which arose out of Yugoslavia and Rwanda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 18, 1988, under the auspices of the United Nations 
General Assembly, Canada along with 119 other countries signed a 
treaty that would bring into force the International Criminal 
Court.  This court is intended to be a permanent court with a 
permanent bureaucracy.  The treaty was specifically referred to 
as the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This court would have the power to investigate, prosecute, 
indict and try persons for the most serious crimes of 
international concern. 
These include genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and 
the crime of aggression which are open to wide interpretation by 
judges from around the world who would be sitting on this 
tribunal. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the purpose of the ICC is to prosecute war crimes, 
including internal acts of repression.  This is where we begin to 
question the interpretation that the various judges would use and 
bring into effect judge graded law, I guess, on an international 
scale.  It is my understanding that the regulations and other 
issues setting up this court are not in place at this time.  To a 
certain extent, we are buying a pig in a poke on this treaty with 
not knowing those very things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance certainly support foreign policy 
that is guided by values and the principles of Canadians. In 
trying to set up one court that would encompass the beliefs and 
traditions of the whole world, it is hard to see that being done 
in a very effective and efficient manner or even in a manner that 
would deal fairly and justly with individual countries around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the arguments why ad hoc courts have been set up 
to deal with specific incidents that arise as opposed to trying 
to say, before the crime is even committed, that we will be 
imposing this set of values on those people in that country when 
it may be culturally insensitive and not in keeping with the 
traditions in that area of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A specific country or individuals in a specific country who are 
committing crimes against humanity certainly cannot be tolerated, 
but I question whether or not this permanent court is the best 
way to address those crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ICC threatens to become a powerful, unaccountable 
institution with power to investigate, prosecute, indict and try 
citizens of even Canada.  Here we would run into the 
interpretation of the courts as to what constitutes this crime 
when that may be something we would consider a crime in Canada 
but a crime that should be dealt with internally as opposed to a 
crime that this court and the United Nations would feel should be 
dealt with on the international scene.  That is a serious 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it has been demonstrated that the United 
Nations has the capacity to run an international criminal court 
without making it as ineffective as some of its programs and the 
bureaucracy set up to handle issues of starvation and so on 
around the world.  It always seems that individual countries end 
up having to come to the aid of other countries that are 
experiencing problems that the UN seems incapable of doing 
anything about because of the gigantic bureaucracy it has put in 
place.  It is a bureaucracy that has been put in place not by an 
elected government necessarily.  The bureaucracy is made up of 
people who were appointed, often patronage appointments, from the 
member countries of the UN that puts these people in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we could see with a permanent court is virtually permanent 
employees of the bureaucracy and permanent appointments to that 
court that would not be in the best interests of many people and 
many countries.  As Canadians, we have to very seriously consider 
national interests and national values as to what we believe is a 
criminal justice system. 
Even between ourselves and Europe there is a difference in how 
criminal justice systems work.  I do not believe the negotiations 
that were entered into to bring this treaty forward really 
considered all the various aspects.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our government's point of view, prior to the signing, 
besides the non-government organizations that were funded by the 
federal government, we should have obtained more input from the 
general population of Canada and from the opposition members in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the ICC could undermine the ability of the United 
Nations to act in the interests of international security and 
peace.  One example would be stopping Saddam Hussein or sending a 
message to international terrorists.  I do not see how, at this 
point in time, we can get away from the co-ordinated efforts, 
such as we have under NATO, to take care of these serious 
international issues.  The United Nations just does not have that 
capacity.  Giving the United Nations a permanent criminal court 
would not seem to be the way to go at this point in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the world is ready yet for a world government. 
There is a lot of resistance out in the ridings when people 
consider that there is this bogeyman set up as the world 
government.  When we talk about permanent institutions like a 
criminal court, that is what is happening.  I appreciate that it 
is not designed for every small offence inside a country, but it 
does smack of having one world government, which is certainly not 
in the best interests of individualism, freedom or democracy as 
we know it in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the concept and the continuation of the ad hoc 
international tribunals that have been dealing with war crimes 
and international situations.  These tribunals should never be 
made permanent.  Instead, I argue that they should always remain 
ad hoc, subject to sunset provisions as the tribunals are 
presently operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main reason for saying that is that a permanent international 
body would essentially be unaccountable and would, as experience 
with other international organizations have shown, become a rogue 
type entity to the sovereignty of elected parliaments and 
legislatures.  Not every country that appoints people to this 
court would be democratic.  Many countries in this world are 
still run by dictatorships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ad hoc bodies have the advantage that they can be set up and 
dismantled by sovereign governments and by governments that have 
a direct concern and interest in the area and might have the 
military strength.  In the case of Canada, which has little or no 
military strength, it could make a strong, morally persuasive 
effort for which we have a good reputation on the international 
scene.  The world would be much better served by having that type 
of ad hoc court which would be more sensitive to the very 
incident that has given rise to the complaint of war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, war crimes are something that every one of us has 
lived with in our lifetimes.  We can certainly go back into 
recent history and see the war crimes that were committed.  It is 
of very serious concern to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, rather than just submitting a good idea forward to our 
foreign affairs minister and certain other people around the 
world, maybe the majority of people will not be in agreement with 
that.  Countries with a long history of democracy, such as the 
United States or Israel, have very serious concerns about this 
treaty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would be remiss as a government in Canada and as 
Canadian people to approve a treaty that is deficient in any way. 
When the majority of the world, including a major power like the 
United States, have their questions answered, along with the 
serious questions we have raised here today as part of the 
Canadian Alliance, that is the time we could consider having a 
permanent court. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, does the hon. member for 
Selkirk—Interlake, who stressed what he regards as the financial 
unaccountability of the international court, accept the fact that 
there is an assembly of states parties that will elect the 
prosecutor and judges for the court on the basis of established 
qualifications, that the assembly will be able to remove judges 
for improper conduct, will have management oversight of budgets 
and will audit the operations of the court? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this international court not have a good deal of 
accountability?  I would contend that it has a lot more 
accountability than the present ad hoc tribunals do, at least the 
one in Arusha.  Perhaps the member is aware that there have been 
all kinds of administrative and other problems with the ad hoc 
tribunal operating in Arusha. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not more cost effective to have a standing court rather 
than continually reinventing the wheel, such as we have had to do 
in the case of the ad hoc tribunals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that we were buying a pig in a poke.  That is a 
good metaphor but where is the pig and where is the poke?  It 
seems to me that this court is something that has been shrieked 
for by what has been happening around the world, which the member 
knows very well.  I would urge him to reconsider what he said 
about the lack of accountability in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, the pig in a poke 
comment referred to the fact that it would be nice to have all 
the regulations and everything set out beforehand so that we 
could know fully how the court will actually operate and how it 
will be put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to war crimes, I do not believe that cost is a big 
concern when trying to deal with the actual issue, but I am 
concerned with costs that are imposed by a bureaucracy that has 
been put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the hon. member opposite can deny that the 
bureaucracy of the United Nations has been really unaccountable. 
We saw several countries, including the United States, withhold 
payments in order to get the United Nations to become more 
accountable and more efficient.  I think its agriculture 
department was one of those that was identified. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member is aware that article 
44 in the documents from Rome provides that the international 
criminal court may employ, free of charge, expertise of personnel 
provided by state members and individual NGOs.  To me that will 
mean that well-funded radical groups will be stacking this court 
with their selected radicals.  Article 105 also provides that the 
$80 million annual cost to the ICC could be defrayed by voluntary 
donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he has a concern that groups like the Rockefeller 
and Ford foundations will be contributing to the court with many 
strings attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly non-elected 
organizations, which are non-government organizations, should 
have input into government policy in their home countries. 
However, to be so directly involved on the international scene 
affecting the sovereignty of countries like our own is 
unacceptable to me.

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, in addressing the House today on 
petitions I want to start by saying several things about the 
democracy within which we live.  There are many concerns in the 
country about the ability to take concerns to the House of 
Commons to be heard and to get action taken.  Petitions is one of 
the few ways that citizens can sign a document, send it to the 
House of Commons, have it read in the House of Commons, and get 
some action taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate thing about petitions is getting the action 
taken.  I just submitted three petitions today.  Two were on Bill 
C-23 which the government has already disposed of and really did 
not listen to it.  The other one was about changing the age of 
consent from 14 to 16 years for consensual sex.  That will fall 
on deaf ears.  A letter will go back to the person who initiated 
the petition saying so sad, too bad, try again some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a brief background about petitions and what they are 
used for.  The petition process was first introduced into the 
Alberta legislature by Jim Gurnett, an NDP member for Spirit 
River.  Those particular concepts upon which this motion is 
debated were eventually brought into the House of Commons by Ross 
Harvey, another NDP member for Edmonton East in 1992 under Motion 
No. 89. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not make the wild assumption that I am following the 
dialogue and prospectus of any bill in which the NDP would be 
interested, but where it comes down to the input as a democracy I 
think those two gentlemen had the right idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United Kingdom the right of petitioning the crown and 
parliament for redress of grievances dates back to the reign of 
King Edward I in the 13th century.  Citation 666 of Beauchesne's 
fifth edition at page 209 says the following about petitions: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right of petitioning the Crown and Parliament for redress of 
grievances is acknowledged as a fundamental principle of the 
constitution and has been exercised without interruption since 
1867. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with petitions in this land is that they fall on 
deaf ears once they reach the House of Commons.  Virtually 
everybody in the House has submitted petitions.  Many of them 
have been very good and informative petitions that we want to go 
somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current process is that they are presented by members of the 
House under Standing Order 36.  Then the government tables a 
response in the House and sends the response to the first name on 
the petition.  Even if 40,000 people signed it, only one person 
would get a response.  That is the end of the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way a petition can be referred to a committee is with a 
show of unanimous consent, which is something that almost never 
happens in the House of Commons. 
Basically it does not even go to a committee for study, which is 
sad indeed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debated whether or not the particular motion should be 
votable, it is unfortunate that even the subcommittee on Private 
Members' Business decided not to support it as a votable motion. 
I believe the issue has a great deal of support in the House of 
Commons.  It is sad that it will never get to any further action 
than what is said here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was I proposing in the motion?  Let us see how harmful it 
is, if it is at all.  If hon. members had 3% of eligible voters 
on a petition, which is approximately 550,000 people, it would 
ultimately get to be a votable resolution in the House.  It is as 
simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go through a lot of the other details, but the primary 
point is that people in our country see it important enough to 
physically take a petition around their areas, their cities, 
their communities and their provinces.  They see it important 
enough to take it door to door.  Those who see the issue as 
important enough to sign a petition should have some way of 
seeing it followed through by their representatives in the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not happening today.  If someone signs a petition it 
basically goes nowhere.  It comes into the House.  We say we have 
a petition and have about 15 seconds to read the darned thing, 
and there it dies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government might say that it looks at the petition and 
considers it in legislation, but let us face it: since I have 
been in the House I have not seen a petition that has really 
affected a piece of legislation.   Major bills have come forward 
such as the Young Offenders Act; Bill C-68, the gun control bill; 
and Bill C-23, the recent modernization of benefits.  All of them 
had substantial petitions from across the country with hundreds 
of thousands of names.  They have come into the House and nothing 
has happened with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As politicians we hear from people who say that they feel 
strongly about an issue.  They want to get a petition together 
and ask for help in wording it.  They want to take it door to 
door and make a change in Canada.  I do not even have the heart 
to tell them that the other half of the process is that I will 
take it to the House and read it for 15 seconds.  Then I will sit 
down and it will die.  It is not a good process whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is not votable.  I stand here today on a non-votable 
issue only to get my point across.  What we need is all parties 
in the House to say that the process is not working.  We need to 
be able to effect change by the will of a majority of people who 
care about it.  In effect that is called citizens initiative.  We 
talk about citizens initiative.  That is what a petition really 
is.  It is a citizens initiative to invoke change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  When it reaches a certain threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Yes, I agree with my colleague.  This 
certain threshold is 3% of eligible voters.  When it is signed 
and 3% or more of eligible voters want the change, it does not 
mean that it has to come into the House and is done right away. 
It means discussion takes place.  It means committees get 
involved and look at it.  In effect, rather than have legislation 
that comes into the House top down, we are getting legislation 
that is encouraged bottom up.  It makes sense to most people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this does not fall on deaf ears after today.  I hope when 
we get into committees like procedure and House affairs, the main 
management committee of the House of Commons, we could table this 
as a necessary change to the standing orders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have a serious discussion and have a subcommittee and 
the House of Commons look at some way of putting some strength 
into the courage and convictions of those who walk around the 
country and sign documents to get change to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is being made here that we lack a certain amount of 
democracy in what we call a democracy.  If we continue with 
majority governments in this land that basically make the bills 
in cabinet and whip their members into a vote on a Tuesday 
night— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  You're cynical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  The minister says I am cynical.  At 
least there is one minister here listening to how we should 
invoke democracy into the country by getting petitions in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government and the democracy keeps working from a 
majority government and a cabinet to its members to vote in a 
certain way, notwithstanding the desires of people through 
petitions across the land, then we tend to alienate ourselves 
from the very people who have put us in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comment is this.  If we truly want democracy, then let us put 
it in place.  Let us take a simple process like petitions with 
some threshold of numbers of our population who sign them and 
turn their question or desire into a motion.  Let us get it into 
a committee, study it and possibly turn it into legislation or 
include it in a piece of legislation that we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is it.  I would be interested in other comments in the 
House, but more than comments, I am interested in some action. 
The next time this comes up, it should be in the House of Commons 
with some kind of legislation with teeth in it and not some kind 
of rhetorical comments that, sure, they want our comments but, 
too bad, so sad, they are going to do nothing about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak to Motion M-128. Institutional 
reform is something for which I believe there is a broad based 
level of support, not just within this parliament but from 
Canadians, and that we do need a significant level of 
institutional reform to make parliament and our democratic 
institutions more functional.  There are a number of things that 
need to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a secular decline in the role of the member of 
parliament over the last 30 years.  It started in the late 1960s 
when the practice of debating the estimates in the House of 
Commons ceased and instead committees took over some of that. The 
notion of committees taking over some of these responsibilities 
previously held by the committee of the whole in the House of 
Commons is not in and of itself necessarily a bad thing.  The 
difficulty with it is when the committee structure becomes so 
partisanly controlled and, of course, comprised of a majority of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often we get the idea in the House as members of parliament that 
the committees are operated as branch plants of the ministers' 
offices and in fact committee chairs are often at the beck and 
call of ministers it seems.  Sometimes the legislative agenda of 
committees seems to be more dominated by the legislative agenda 
of the executive than it probably should be.  I think there would 
be a rather significant level of agreement with that from both 
members on the opposition benches and members of the government 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal brought forward by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford would change the standing orders to provide 
direct access to the agenda of the House of Commons for 
petitioners representing 2% of the eligible electorate.  It does 
this by requiring qualified petitions to be the basis for 
legislation or an order of the House to meet the demands of 
petitioners.  A mandatory process of time allocation or closure 
of debate governs the considerations of all qualified petitions.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic in some ways that the hon. member, who regularly 
objects to the government's use of time allocation, is prepared 
to have it further enshrined in the rules to cover this proposal. 
Time allocation, some arbitrary allocation of time to any 
legislation whether imposed by the government or some 
institutionalized parliamentary procedure, is equally egregious. 
This proposal would give something to petitioners that members of 
the House do not enjoy and that is the guaranteed consideration 
of any proposal meeting the 2% threshold.  I have some concerns 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the heart of the discussion is the age old question of what 
is the role of the member of parliament.  Are members of 
parliament here to represent their own best judgment and to 
represent the best interests of their constituents by using that 
judgment?  In a representative democracy this is a very important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A representative democracy is based on the premise that when a 
member is elected to the House, that for the period of a member's 
term he or she makes decisions.  The member's goal is not only to 
represent the views of his or her own constituents but also the 
interests of all Canadians in this House.  Every four years there 
is an opportunity for the electorate to make a decision to 
re-elect that member or to elect somebody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact the hon. member actually believes we should be moving 
away from the principles of a representative democracy to a 
direct democracy, I have some significant concerns as would many 
Canadians when they really thought about it.  What is the magic 
of a 2% threshold? It is an arbitrary figure.  Certainly it is a 
large number of people, but 2% of the electorate certainly does 
not represent a majority.  It is 2%.  Why should special powers 
be given to 2% of the electorate that is denied to other 
petitioners? Are the ideas or grievances of persons lacking 
resources to garner the 2% threshold automatically less worthy 
than the beliefs or concerns of the people who may account for 
1.5%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the House requires 25 signatures on a petition.  This 
was put in place in reaction to abuses that took place in the 
past when petitions were used to delay or oppose government 
bills.  Those days are gone and the House should back Canadians 
who petition the House of Commons on legitimate issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members take very seriously the petitions presented in the 
House. I listen intently to petitions when they are presented.  I 
consider the views of individuals who have through the petition 
process an opportunity to have their views heard here in the 
House of Commons.  Through the private members' process, which 
should be bolstered and improved, individual members of 
parliament have the opportunity to represent views presented in 
petitions from their constituencies, not just on Wellington 
Street but on the main streets of their ridings.  We should be 
using the private members' process, as should the government. All 
parliamentarians should advance the notion that there should be a 
greater level of engagement for private members to bring forward 
through the private members' process constructive motions and 
legislation that can benefit Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is with who would use this provision.  It is a ready 
opportunity for many of the moneyed interest groups and so-called 
ordinary citizens are quite likely to initiate petitions.  If we 
look at the U.S. with the well financed and powerful lobby 
organizations, the difficulties and problems are far greater with 
the degree to which these lobby organizations are financed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would invite the same type of what the hon. member may view 
as direct democracy. I consider this as being an opportunity for 
some of the major lobby organizations and individuals with money 
to use the process to garner support and actually gain direct 
access to the House of Commons.  In some way they could push 
aside the elected members who are here as part of a 
representative democracy to not only recognize the concerns of 
focused special interest groups, but also to make decisions on 
behalf of all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of concerns. The hon. member has spoken a number 
of times about the importance of his constituents.  If the 
majority of his constituents want something, then it is 
absolutely the right thing for us to do.  I remind the hon. 
member that there have been times in the past when decisions have 
been made, which in retrospect have been the right decisions, 
that a majority of Canadians did not agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One was the free trade agreement. The majority of Canadians 
voted against a free trade agreement in the 1988 election, but a 
visionary and courageous government was willing to seize the day. 
It had a vision for the future.  Instead of focusing on polls, 
it took a significant risk.  It actually implemented the types of 
public policy Canadians needed for the long term, not the types 
of public policy that would benefit the party in the short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Populism is the natural enemy of representative democracy.  The 
poll based populism which is so pervasive in the hon. member's 
party, seems so palatable to people when they first hear of it. 
When Canadians have thought about it more clearly however, and 
they have, they have rejected the hon. member's party.  Canadians 
have done this because they realize they are better served by 
thinking members of parliament who have a vision for the future 
and who will take risks sometimes and offer Canadians real 
solutions and courageous visionary policy on issues of importance 
to Canadians instead of focusing on short term polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party the hon. member represents has at various times fought 
against the charter of rights.  It has criticized the charter of 
rights and has referred to it as judicial activism.  It has 
ignored the fact that in our system of government the judiciary 
has a role.  Ultimately I am glad that we have a charter of 
rights to protect Canadians against members of parliament who 
would go with the tyranny of the majority and where majority 
rules in areas where it should not, such as minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on an on about this motion.  It clearly will not 
work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to address the issues raised in Motion No. 128 
introduced by the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford.  He 
proposes that we amend the standing orders to alter the way we 
deal with petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague is well known for his background, experience 
and knowledge in the area of parliamentary procedure.  I will 
take the time to review the proposal carefully and I hope he and 
the House will view it as constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand my hon. colleague's motion correctly, the 
purpose of his motion would be to alter the process for dealing 
with petitions so that a public petition could automatically 
become the basis for law or a resolution of the House.  Not only 
does the member propose that any petition with sufficient 
signatures could become law, he also proposes that these laws 
could come into effect with no apparent policy analysis or prior 
consultations with affected groups and with relatively minimal 
parliamentary scrutiny.  In fact it appears that the House and 
its committees would be forced to consider these petition bills 
on a relatively short deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I discuss the merits of the motion, I will address the 
historic background of petitions.  The procedure for petitioning 
parliament is a longstanding practice which goes back many years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In medieval England, the records show that individuals 
petitioned parliament to seek resolution to an issue in cases 
where the courts had been unable to reach a decision.  The 
British House of Commons, therefore, served in a quasi-judicial 
capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Procedures for handling petitions evolved from this early form 
partly because of their extreme popularity in Great Britain in 
the early part of the 19th century.  In the year 1843 alone there 
were over 33,000 petitions filed in the House of Commons. 
However, as my hon. colleague might imagine, dealing with this 
inordinate number of petitions did not leave very much time to 
deal with the other pressing matters of national business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the impact of these petitions on the time of the 
House, changes were made to limit the rules of debate so that 
matters of interest and importance to all individuals would not 
be hijacked by political strategies that might not be in the 
broader interest of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, of course, has adopted these British parliamentary 
traditions and petitions are now only presented to the House, 
generally without provision for debate.  In the 1985 report of 
the Special Committee on Reform of the House of Commons, the 
chair, Mr. James McGrath, noted: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the right to petition Parliament is a fundamental right of the 
citizen and that petitions are an integral part of the process 
whereby the people of Canada speak to their elected 
representatives. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is still true today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a means of ensuring that petitions are treated in a relevant 
fashion, the standing orders require that the government respond 
to petitions within 45 days to ensure that the government would 
take note of the content of the petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that the sponsor of this motion is suggesting that 
petitions are not given due recognition by the government and it 
would seem that through Motion No. 128 he is attempting to alter 
the nature and significance of petitioning a parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, the government does take seriously its 
responsibility to respond to petitions presented by Canadians and 
within the 45 day limit.   In this session we had about 600 to 
700 petitions presented by members from both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the presentation of petitions allows parliament and the 
government to tap the public mood and to hear what issues concern 
individuals, not only from across the country but also from 
specific regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the standing orders require the responsible department 
to respond to petitions.  Petitions give these policy makers or 
policy advisors valuable information that can be fed into the 
ongoing and dynamic process of policy development.  This can and 
often does stimulate legislation, regulatory or policy change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, members of the House have numerous instruments here at 
their disposal for debating issues of national and regional 
importance, including those raised in petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a representative of his constituents and with his experience, 
if my hon. colleague saw an issue that required attention he 
could introduce a private member's bill or motion to allow an 
issue to be considered, just as he has done in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On any day the House is sitting, a member can ask a question of 
member of the government during question period or can submit a 
written question.  Of course, opposition parties can make their 
own determination of what issues are important to Canadians. They 
actually select the subject of debate on any opposition day in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the standing orders of the House now provide that 
standing committees have a mandate to study any issue that falls 
within the mandate of a minister's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process that my colleague is proposing through Motion No. 
128 raises a number of questions.   For example, how would 
parliament deal with several petitions on the same subject but 
with opposing perspectives?   How would a standing committee cope 
with petitions that affected many other committees or that 
required broader consultation and integration with the work of 
other committees of the House?   From a purely constitutional and 
procedural perspective, bills which involve the spending of 
public funds can only be introduced by the government with what 
we call the royal recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that my hon. colleague's motion, while it is a 
creative initiative, it has a number of practical difficulties. 
I want to emphasize that the government supports the ability of 
Canadians to petition their parliament.  With reference to the 
member's initiative, members of the House may wish to consider 
whether they want to alter the way we deal with petitions.  We 
might wish to consider other ways of dealing with them and place 
these procedures in the standing orders.  I therefore suggest 
that if the hon. member wishes to pursue this matter further—and 
he may well might as well might other members of the House—he 
could seek to have this issue, among others, brought on to the 
agenda of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
which might study it further.  One never knows what might be 
recommended back to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Motion M-128, introduced by our colleague from 
Langley—Abbotsford, moves us to reflect upon the political system 
within which we operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British parliamentary system is, as we know, one of 
representative democracy.  It is absolutely beyond the realm of 
possibility for 30 million Canadians and 7 million Quebecers to 
all get together at one time in one place to pass rules to 
govern the society in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the population delegates the power to legislate to 
a certain number of representatives, their members of 
parliament, who meet together in parliament to pass legislation 
in lieu of their constituents, their fellow citizens, whom they 
represent to the best of their ability, during a mandate.  At 
the end of their mandate, if the elected representatives have 
not fulfilled the expectations of those who elected them and 
have not carried out their mandate, it is the responsibility of 
the population to decide to change representatives and to place 
its trust in another party, another individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate around Motion M-128 leads us to reflect upon this 
system of representative democracy within which we operate at 
the present time, and to look at what possibilities are 
available to us in order to achieve better participation and a 
participative and more direct democracy.  This would result in 
our fellow citizens, those whom we represent, becoming more 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the British parliamentary system as we know it was first 
established, centuries ago, in the United Kingdom, Great Britain 
at the time, communications systems were obviously not like 
those we enjoy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, therefore, understandable that our fellow citizens 
experience a degree of frustration and cynicism as far as 
politicians are concerned, because nowadays they are in a 
position to follow politics closely.  They can get their 
expectations and concerns through to their MPs quickly, and they 
are also able to see very quickly the impact of the decisions 
made by their elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to counter this sort of wave of public cynicism toward 
politics and parliament, perhaps we should consider involving 
the public more in the democratic process and politics outside 
the traditional election periods when they choose their members 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, let us get back to the heart of the debate, the 
matter of petitions.  We know that petitions have been an 
integral part of the British parliamentary system since its 
inception.  It became clear very quickly that, outside election 
periods, the public needed a way to make its expectations known 
to parliamentarians and to direct the work done and decisions 
made by its representatives.  So petitions made this possible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pubic could sign a petition from time to time, express, in 
doing so, its support for a given cause, its support for a given 
government legislative measure.  In fact, the petition served to 
draw the attention of parliament and the government to a variety 
of public concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that over the years, even though petitions remain 
a privileged means of expression for the people, they have lost 
a great deal of their meaning, not because it is no longer 
important for Canadians to share their expectations with their 
elected representatives, but because we can see that the 
government is paying less attention to those petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times have we tabled petitions in the House and 
received just a very short response from the government? And 
then nothing further is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least the motion brought forward by the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford would make sure there would be a proper 
follow-up on every petition. Having said that, I have some 
questions regarding the appropriateness of the particular 
measure proposed by the member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, and members certainly noticed that in my 
introduction, 
the Bloc Quebecois is completely open to the development of 
mechanisms for participatory democracy. As a matter of fact, we 
embarked on a thinking exercise on democracy to see which 
avenues could be explored to bring the people to take a greater 
interest and participate more actively in the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This first thinking exercise led to a second one because we felt 
there was still a lot of work to be done, there were still many 
elements to develop with regard to this idea of better involving 
the people in the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I must tell my colleague from Langley—Abbotsford that, 
in this respect, the legislation introduced by one of his 
colleagues, namely Bill C-229, seemed to me more appropriate, 
even though I had some concerns regarding it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his motion, my colleague from Langley—Abbotsford proposes that 
when a motion is supported by at least 2% of registered voters 
it eventually become a resolution of the House or a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-229 is better in that a petition was not supposed to 
minize, so to speak, the work of parliamentarians because it 
provided for one extra step. A petition was needed to hold a 
referendum. And its was only after the referendum was held that 
parliament could consider passing a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, I wonder about the mechanisms, as they seem 
somewhat absent from Motion M-128, if I may say so; mechanisms 
should be put in place in order to ensure that ultimately it is 
the elected representatives of the people who make the decision 
to pass legislation so as not to jeopardize or make a travesty 
of representative democracy by introducing an element of direct 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the goal is to allow people to bring about changes to the 
existing political framework, influence public policy and 
government action, questions arise since even an election fails 
to alter the course of events in parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has only to think of the 1993 election, which at the time 
completely destroyed the political balance within this 
parliament and reflected a deep desire for change among then 
people.  What did this deep desire for change translate into? 
Nothing.  The federal government has done absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how this could be done.  How will this measure manage 
to take into consideration other measures passed by the House? 
I am thinking in particular of the distinct society motion 
passed in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Points 3 and 4 stipulated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) the House encourage all components of the legislative and 
executive branches of government to take note of this 
recognition and be guided in their conduct accordingly. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the House is paying no attention to this motion.  How could 
the House pass Bill-20?  How can the House be preparing to pass 
Bill C-3, without taking into account the distinct character of 
Quebec, which should have precluded it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would say that, because even this House fails 
to respect a number of earlier decisions, how can members of the 
public be expected to stay on top of all those decisions 
previously taken by the House, which would eventually affect its 
subsequent actions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are open to discussion. 
I believe that Motion M-128 opens the debate on participatory 
democracy.  Unfortunately, I think that Motion M-128 as drafted 
fails to meet the short term goals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Well, 
Madam Speaker, never let it be said that private members' hour in 
the House does not produce some interesting debates and some 
excellent speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had never intended to speak on this debate.  I just happened 
to be in the House doing my duty, but I received I think some 
very eloquent points of view on an issue which I think is of 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of petitions and what petitions mean when people 
submit them to members of parliament is a very important 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say, Madam Speaker, that I remember when I came up 
here as a parliamentarian for the first time in 1993, there was 
an orientation period in which experienced members of parliament 
instructed us in this very chamber on what to expect as fledgling 
members of parliament.  I remember, for the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford's benefit, that one of those MPs who advised 
the new MPs on what to expect here was the member for Edmonton 
North who brought up the question of petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What she said basically, was that the members of 
parliament can take advantage of the opportunity to present 
petitions from their constituents.  I remember classically the 
words.  She said “They do not really mean anything when you put 
them before the House.  They do not actually do anything or have 
any effect, but they are a great instrument for encouraging 
personal attention in your own riding”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the member for Langley—Abbotsford I think touches a real 
nerve.  I remember that statement vividly.  In fact, Madam 
Speaker, as a result of that statement I have tended to 
discourage petitioning in my riding, and yet I hear the 
parliamentary secretary observe that in fact, yes, there is a 
place for petitions in the House, that it is an opportunity for 
people to actually get a forum through their MPs.  So there is 
merit both ways, although I am very sensitive to the criticism 
that is being raised by the member for Langley—Abbotsford, that 
is where do petitions really go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the difficulties, however, with petitions, and trying to 
expand the opportunity for petitions to have an effect, as 
suggested by Motion No. 128, is in fact petitions like opinion 
polling or referendum, that kind of thing, can in fact represent 
a minority trying to grab the agenda by putting direct pressure 
on the parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today, I presented three petitions in the 
House.  Each one of those petitions represents a minority in 
society who has a particular thing they want to see happen.  They 
are trying to put pressure on me as a member of parliament by 
means of a petition.  It does not matter whether there are 25 
names or there are 200 or it is 2% of the entire population. 
It is still a minority.  It is still a special interest group. 
Whether the special interest group represents people who are 
against Bill C-23, as was the case in one of the petitions I 
presented, or whether the subject is a contract for the postal 
workers who were petitioning me to support a private member's 
bill allowing the unionization of rural mail couriers, it is 
still a special interest group pressuring a member of parliament 
to take a particular action.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis there is nothing wrong with this.  I have 
to answer not only as best I can to everyone in my riding, but I 
also have to be sensitive to the petitions of minorities, the 
petitions of special interest groups, the petitions of groups of 
people with whom I may personally disagree.  They still have to 
have a voice in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Langley—Abbotsford that the present 
situation and the present method is inadequate.  People, no 
matter what their viewpoint in a democracy, particularly an open 
democracy like Canada, have to have an opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that parliament is in the process of being reformed. 
One way it is being reformed is by opening up Private Members' 
Business.  Just as we are having a very fine debate this 
afternoon in private member's hour, so too are we trying on all 
sides of this House to open up the opportunities for backbench 
MPs to advance meaningful legislation.  We have had a number of 
very good private members' bills advanced, and on this side of 
the House, at any rate, voting on private members' legislation is 
always a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the member for Langley—Abbotsford that rather 
than try to adjust the rules in a huge way in which basically we 
would be advancing the power of minority special interest groups, 
which we do not want to do, I would take the point of the member 
for Kings—Hants.  We are elected to represent and to make 
decisions on behalf of everyone, as best we can.  That is the 
parliamentary system.  That is what we inherited from the British 
system.  On the other hand, we can give everyone an opportunity 
to be heard and to have their issue debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would suggest is that we go forward and try to find a new 
method of dealing with petitions.  One thing we could consider, 
and this would go to the procedure and House affairs committee, 
would be to open up Friday, which is a day which is not very good 
for government business because many MPs are away and often 
cabinet ministers have other duties. Perhaps we could devote 
Friday entirely to Private Members' Business, to debate and 
advance private members' legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not use part of that time to debate petitions, no matter 
what the petition is about?  If I have received a petition, 
whether it is on Bill C-23 or the rural mail couriers, that 
petition is independent of everything else.  It is independent of 
legislation and it deserves to be heard and debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would propose that perhaps the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs could consider setting up a regime whereby the 
petitions would come before a subcommittee to determine whether 
they should be debated in the same way as private members' bills 
come before a subcommittee to determine whether they should be 
made votable.  That way the petitions which Canadians gather, 
again whether there be 25, 100 or 1, 000 names, might have more of 
a life in this House than they do at present.  I congratulate the 
member for Langley—Abbotsford for raising a very important 
issue.

Madam Speaker, I often get some of my knowledge and points from 
the great and learned Yuroslav, who is an individual of 
impeccable knowledge.  The great Yuroslav has often told me about 
the need to involve people in politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a couple of comments about the comments that were 
made.  By and large, we all agree that we should do something 
with petitions, that they should not just come into the House and 
die here, that we should have a way of at least discussing the 
darn things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues, the chairman of the procedure and House 
affairs committee, mentioned that we should discuss this issue at 
committee.  I did table that idea about three years ago, so one 
has to ask where it is going to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only disappointing comments I heard today were from the 
Progressive Conservative members, who said “If the majority of 
Canadians want it, that is not necessarily the right thing to 
do”.  Is it any wonder people do not vote Progressive 
Conservative today.  That is exactly the opposite of what I think 
most people are saying today in Canada.  If the majority of 
people want it, that is necessarily the right thing to do, even 
though politicians in their rhetorical positioning in the House 
may not agree.  That should be quite irrelevant.  It is what the 
majority of Canadians think that matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that petitions are indicators in our society 
that people want change.  People organize petitions and go 
through the exercise of getting a certain number of Canadians 
interested in an issue for the purpose of sending it to the 
House.  No matter what the issue is, and it may not be palatable 
to the House, we should have the right to discuss it, to look at 
it, to provoke thought and to send something forward to move the 
government in some direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not ask for unanimous consent, but I would suggest to 
the chairman of the procedure and House affairs committee that 
the committee look at this issue.  I would ask that it look at 
the issue and not exactly what I have put forward in my motion. 
Let us not get tangled up in whether there are opposing positions 
on certain petitions.  Let us not get tangled up in whether it is 
2% or 3%.  Let us take this issue to the procedure and House 
affairs committee to see if there is anything that can be done 
with petitions to make the people of Canada feel that all the 
work they went through was worth it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
As the motion has not been designated a votable item, the order 
is dropped from the order paper.

1, 2000 at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Orders 28(2) and 24(1).
