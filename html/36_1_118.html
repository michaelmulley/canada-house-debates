the motion cannot be put.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I understand that the government House leader is trying to put 
this motion to the floor this morning, but this is the time for 
routine motions to be put and this is not a routine motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to assist the Chair, if I may, I 
know that the opposition House leader has raised the proposition 
that this was not, in his view, a routine motion.  I draw to your 
attention Standing Order 67(1)(p) which states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(p) such other motion, made upon Routine Proceedings, as may be 
required for the observance of the properties of the House, the 
maintenance of its authority, the appointment or conduct of its 
officers, the management of its business, the arrangement of its 
proceedings, the correctness of its record, the fixing of its 
sitting days or the time of its meetings or adjournment. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this very well covers the fact that indeed this motion 
is receivable the way it was presented under Standing Order 
56(1). 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very new to this place and I do not profess to 
be an expert in this, but my understanding is that what happened 
yesterday was that a substantive motion was passed on the floor 
of the House and that cannot simply be overturned by a routine 
motion from the government.  There is a procedure that has to be 
in place.  There is notice that has to be given.  My 
understanding is that this cannot happen in the way that the 
government House leader is trying to put it before the House.

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The House leader for the Conservative 
Party makes a very interesting point, as does the opposition 
House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the House that it would be one thing to go with 
the strict wording of this rule.  However a motion was put on 
February 19, 1998 which perhaps went beyond the scope of the 
wording and it went through the House.  On December 1, 1997 a 
motion pursuant to Standing Order 56.1(1) was put and it went 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My interpretation of both of those motions is that we cannot 
pick and choose on the way through.  Those two motions went 
through before and they seemed to go somewhat beyond the scope of 
the wording, and at that time no one raised a voice of objection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am loath to interfere at any time like this. I would rule that 
because of these other two motions that went through as 
precedents, I will allow this one to go through.  I would 
strongly urge the committee on procedure to perhaps take this up 
again and to give direction more clearly to the House and the 
Speaker.  I am going to allow this Standing Order 56.1 to stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what happened in this House 
last night was in effect an order of the House.  Now we are going 
to get into a discussion of the principles of this House of 
Commons. It is an order of the House.  The government cannot just 
come in here and change an order of the House, something which 
was passed by this whole House.  Otherwise all of the issues we 
deal with here— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I made a ruling on this issue.  Now the 
House will have a chance to pronounce itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Not on this issue.  I have made a ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is on the motion.  Will those members who object to 
the motion please rise in their places.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.  I point out to your attention Standing Order 67: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>67.(1)  The following motions are debatable: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This motion is not debatable.  I repeat, 
will those members who object to the motion please rise in their 
places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And 25 members having risen:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Because there are 25 members standing in 
their places, this motion is deemed withdrawn.

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 27(1), I move: 
<A NAME="LINK19">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, commencing June 10, 1998 and concluding June 23, 1998, the 
hours of sitting be extended to 4 a.m. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased actually to debate this motion.  Could you tell 
me, Mr. Speaker, first of all how much time I have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  As long as you want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Until 4 a.m., right?  I have until 4 
a.m. Let us start it off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. opposition House leader wanted some 
information regarding timing.  The entire debate will take two 
hours and the hon. member has unlimited time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Take two hours, Randy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  What does a fellow do for two hours in 
the House of Commons any more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for this motion is obvious to those on this side of the 
House.  We have said continuously in the 35th Parliament and the 
36th Parliament that we are sick and tired of standing up in this 
House expressing the viewpoints of those people we represent 
across this country to seats that are empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again, we come into this House.  We stand here. We 
try to do what we can for people across this country.  We try to 
get our points across and we stand here and talk to maybe one 
person who is reading a newspaper who does not have the least bit 
of interest in what opposition parties say in this country. They 
are told what to do time and time again by the Prime Minister and 
the cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it is time now that we are getting close to the end of 
June that we have this debate and we extend it as long as we have 
to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic.  Here it is the 10th of June today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The 9th. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Who can tell?  It will be the 10th at 
four in the morning anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are on the 9th of June and the government says “We are 
going to punish you people.  We are going to make you work for a 
change.  We are going to make you come in here until four in the 
morning”.  Well I have news for the government.  We do not mind 
that in the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of things to talk about in this country. Maybe for 
a change we will get this government back on issues that are 
bothering average everyday grassroots Canadians out there like 
debt, like spending, like taxes, like problems at the immigration 
department, like crime, like where is the national victims bill 
of rights.  For instance where is the bill on drunk driving that 
was committed to by this government in May and which was reneged 
by this government, that was changed apparently to November 30. 
Now we understand it is not going to do that either when every 
party here in opposition agreed with the government for a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals say “We have some things on the agenda”—not 
too much on the agenda I might add—“and we cannot have our own 
way, so you will have to stay until four in the morning”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, could I have a clarification on the rotational 
order on this two hour debate?  After it goes from me, could you 
clarify whether it goes to the Liberals or back into opposition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  That will be a matter to decide 
depending on who rises to participate in the debate.  It is a 
difficult issue to predict, but I think the hon. member can 
expect that there would be some movement back and forth.  The 
hon. member has two hours at his disposal if he chooses to use 
it.  That is the maximum length of time for this debate and the 
question will be put at the end of the two hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I needed a little break to 
confirm something else as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are wanting to deal with the estimates today.  We 
understand that the House may possibly not sit next week.  We do 
not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the overriding issue here is something that the 
government forgot once again. That is that we are sick and tired 
of talking to the wall. We have brought this up numerous times. 
All we ask for in this House in opposition from all parties is 
just a tad, a little bit of respect.  Listen to what we are 
saying.  It may not go through and the government may not buy 
what we are saying, but at least people listening or people 
watching CPAC can at least understand that there are two, three, 
possibly four different positions on any subject in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the government sitting on the other side, it is darn 
difficult to get a decent debate and a decent hearing on any 
issue.  Why is that so hard to understand?  With some 150 members 
over there, why is it so hard for them to understand that all we 
ask for is quorum in this House?  Quorum in the House of Commons. 
Twenty people, 20 bodies out of 301.  Why is that so hard to get? 
Quorum in any other organization is usually 50% plus one. Yet the 
government cannot manage to sit enough people across the House 
and even on some days as yesterday, there is nobody.  Do the 
Liberals understand how people in all the parties across here 
feel when there is nobody sitting on the other side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we get to do about it?  We cannot say there are no 
members there, that there is no one sitting there. The Speaker 
does not allow it.  Somehow we in opposition have to show the 
frustration and that is all.  One member over there is counting 
the heads over here. Quite frankly, there are more opposition 
members in this House right now than there are Liberals on the 
other side.  Every day is like that and that is fact.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have drawn the line.  Henceforth that will not occur in this 
House.  Henceforth we will be drawing up unanimous consent 
motions such as this one.  Henceforth this government is going to 
go through the mill on this issue.  When it gets lazy again and 
when it misses its shot at trying to watchdog what is going on 
over here, it will find we are going to deal with it. I wonder 
what the people watching this today think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard someone say they have an idiot standing here talking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe I heard the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine remark that the House leader of the 
official opposition is an idiot.  I think that is out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It certainly would be a word the 
Chair would find offensive.  The Chair did not hear the word.  If 
the hon. member said it I am sure she would not want to leave 
that on the record.  I do not know whether the hon. member wishes 
to clarify the position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is nice to know that 
there are people in the House who know which riding I come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the point of order, Mr. Speaker you are right.  I lost my 
head for a moment, as Reform members often do. I did use a word 
which was unparliamentary.  I called the leader of the House for 
the official opposition an idiot.  My parents did not raise me to 
call people idiots, so I withdraw the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is really good.  There 
are those who would say I have been called worse than that 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess in parliament it is a little different. They seem to get 
excited when the opposition over here catches them sleeping. They 
seem to get excited actually when we bring up an issue near and 
dear to the heart of most Canadians like what exactly is a 
democracy. Is a democracy sending parliamentarians to Ottawa to 
represent their constituents and to stand up here in the House 
and talk to no one on the other side?  Is that what democracy has 
come to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from a number of people this morning already on 
this issue, not parliamentarians but other people, who said it 
has been like this for a while.  It is going downhill in the 
House of Commons.  The opposition parties get plain frustrated 
because there is no one on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think because we are drawing a line here today it is most 
appropriate and I think this government is going to hear from all 
opposition parties very likely that we are just sick and darn 
tired of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to take any further of my time on this.  I know 
there are other members that want to talk to this.  But if I can 
impress any one thing on this other side, do not take this issue 
lightly.  We did not come here to face the other side with all 
the seats empty.  We are going to make this a very large issue 
and it is going to cost a lot of time in this House in debate 
time.  It is going to cost a lot of hours and it is all 
unnecessary.  All we ask is the respect of a majority government 
to sit and listen and debate and consider what we have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government should understand this.  It has very few seats 
where I come from and we do represent the people where we come 
from.  If it does not have that representation, for instance in 
the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, I am a part of it.

other side but just as much as my colleagues from all parties 
across this side have to sit in here and listen to the things 
they say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is truly to be a house of democracy then what is really 
required is a government to pay attention to the people from all 
regions of this country and listen to what they have to say.  Do 
not ever again empty the seats on the other side or the 
government will find the next motions before it a lot tougher 
than this one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is  my 
pleasure to participate in this debate. Following this rather 
intense discussion, I immediately wrote a little something for 
my colleagues from the Reform Party. It reads like this: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Everybody loves somebody sometime. Everybody calls for Reform 
members. Something in your moves just told me your sometime is 
now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure all hon. members appreciate 
the hon. member for Quebec East's vocal talents but perhaps they 
would be better exercised in the lobby. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the House leader for the official opposition for being 
brief and giving others a chance to speak to this motion because 
I am sure he must have been tempted to take up the whole two 
hours but he did not and this will give others an opportunity to 
speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak against the motion and preface my remarks by saying 
I very much regret that the House has come to this place in its 
proceedings.  I regret the use of 56(1) whenever it is used and I 
remember when this particular measure was brought in, I believe 
in 1991, by the Conservative government at that time. I remember 
with irony when the House leader of the Conservative Party 
indicated that he thought this motion was inappropriate at the 
time.  I think this motion is inappropriate at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is what I called it then, sort of the parliamentary 
ubermenchen clause.  This is the clause that means that in the 
end the government can do anything.  I realize it did not succeed 
in using 56(1) and has now moved to have a much longer process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the rules the government has at its disposal are rules 
it opposed when they were brought in and if we were serious about 
parliamentary reform we would have a good look at these rules and 
we would all imagine ourselves some day in opposition.  Some of 
us imagine ourselves in opposition all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition will come to the government as surely as I am 
standing here, eventually in one form or another.  We all have 
the responsibility to try to imagine what is best for the 
institution.  What is not good for the institution are these 
motions. 
But what is also not good for the institution, and I think here 
is where the Reform Party has done parliament a service by 
bringing this to a head, is the perpetual absence of government 
members in the course of debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was common practice in this House for many years is that at 
least one cabinet minister was present during all debates and 
perhaps there were two or three ministers and a cadre of 
government backbenchers.  They may not have always liked what 
opposition members were saying.  They may not have always 
listened carefully and took notes of what opposition members were 
saying.  But they were there. Opposition members had both the 
perception, some might say the illusion, and the reality of the 
fact that somebody from time to time was listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have seen happening in this parliament, and I have raised 
this with the government House leader on numerous occasions, is 
that the government has sunk into a form of contempt for 
parliament.  I suppose it comes from a contempt for the 
opposition, but that is beside the point.  That is quite beside 
the point.  We are talking here about a contempt for parliament 
that is ultimately destructive of this institution and of our 
democratic values and our democratic way of life.  It cannot go 
on like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is not the responsibility of the government House 
leader technically speaking.  It is the responsibility of the 
whip or in this case the deputy whip because we know that the 
whip is not able to be on the job these days for medical reasons. 
But somebody is responsible over there.  Overall the government 
itself is collectively responsible for how it treats parliament. 
It cannot go on like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this speaks to a larger problem.  It is not just the 
contempt the government is showing for parliament or for the 
opposition or for both.  It is also a matter of the declining 
perception of the relevance of the House of Commons to the 
decision making process in this country.  That is something all 
of us have to deal with and presumably we should try to deal with 
it in a non-partisan way.  To the extent that we deal with it in 
a partisan way, and I know this is not avoidable at all times but 
it is certainly more avoidable than is usually the case, to the 
extent we deal with the powerlessness of parliament and the 
growing irrelevance of parliament in a partisan way, we simply 
contribute to its growing irrelevance and powerlessness because 
we reinforce the stereotype that this is just a place where 
people fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all tempted to do that.  I think we are all guilty of 
that each in our own way.  So I urge members to try to think 
their way through the kind of partisanship that sometimes 
manifests itself on the floor with respect to parliament itself. 
It is fine to be partisan about issues. There are choices that 
people have to make between political parties with different 
perceptions, different policies and different positions.  It is 
all in the course and the nature of democracy that people will be 
partisan, will be polemical, will be political, will argue with 
each other.  I think that is all fine and dandy in a democratic 
society but we ought not to be partisan about parliament itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is what has happened.  It is very regrettable.  I 
hope the Reform Party members see the irony of the fact that they 
are now, in many respects by virtue of circumstances beyond their 
control but somewhat within their control, playing exactly the 
same kind of parliamentary silly games they made a career out of 
criticizing before they came here.  I am sure that must bother 
them as it bothers me on occasion when I am forced to play these 
kinds of games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we play them with joy and sometimes we play them with 
sadness because the government gives us no option.  I think the 
government has created this situation. This morning it had 39 
members on the other side— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
My hon. colleague has been saying a lot of things that are 
exactly true and right. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, he said that we are talking about the Liberal 
government never being here to hear the debate or to hear the 
concerns.  It operates in an autocratic fashion.  My point is 
that there is not one cabinet minister here to listen to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a valid point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think the point is well taken even if it is not technically a 
point of order.  It is not factually correct in the sense that 
the government House leader was at the table.  We have one 
cabinet minister whose job it is to bird-dog this debate.  He 
better not leave in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this with the greatest respect to the government House 
leader.  I believe he is as troubled by what is happening on the 
other side of the House as anybody.  He has been here for a 
while.  I have always regarded him as somebody who has a great 
deal of respect for parliament.  He has come up through the ranks 
over the years.  I am sure he is not happy with what happened 
yesterday, not just for the trite political reasons that it is 
embarrassing to the government and he now has to go through all 
this hassle to get the motion that was passed unanimously 
overtaken by subsequent procedures of the House.  I am sure he is 
unhappy with the fact that this situation could even have been 
created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I started to say before the point of order this morning, when 
the government needed members for its own purpose there were 
upwards of 40 members on this side of the House.  As soon as they 
saw they were not needed any more, the place cleared out like it 
was on fire or something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again we see the government not being willing to even 
maintain the same percentage of their caucuses that opposition 
members maintain in the House.  If we have 10% or 15% of our 
caucus here and the government and all other caucuses were to do 
the same we would have quorum all the time.  That would not 
require very many government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have committee responsibilities.  People cannot hide 
behind committee responsibilities.  We all have to take our share 
in committees.  We all have the problem of having to be in more 
than one place at one time.  It is difficult.  I do not think the 
public appreciates the way the timetable works in the House. 
Members are supposed to be in the House of Commons, be in 
committee and be meeting with people.  It is not always easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see absolutely no reason the government could not maintain a 
semblance of the appearance that it is listening.  It should have 
at least one cabinet minister in the House, if not two.  I would 
recommend at least two and its share of quorum, which means over 
half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully we would have more than quorum because in parliament 
members are supposed to be talking to each other. Even if we do 
not like what the other person is saying we can get up and argue. 
I often do not like what the hon. member from Calgary is saying, 
but I can get up to ask him a question.  We can have some kind of 
exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However what is happening is that we are all seeping away from 
this place.  The collegiality that exists even in conflict in 
debate is disappearing from this place.  People just come in 
here, do their thing and take off.  This is not good for 
parliament and it is not good for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B>  You are always here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I hear somebody saying I am always 
here.  No, I am not always here.  For heaven's sake can the 
member not listen to these comments as being directed at all of 
us, no matter what party we come from, as parliamentarians who 
have a responsibility to this institution?  Or, does everything 
have to be cheapened by the kind of remark I just heard from the 
hon. member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish with a word of constructive criticism.  I hope it 
will be taken in the spirit in which it is offered. What we also 
see in declining relevance of parliament is the culmination or 
the fruit of a decade of dumping on politicians.  We see it not 
only here, but we see it in legislatures across the country.  For 
a decade people have been told that politicians are bad, they are 
the worst thing that could ever happen to a society, that the 
real good things that happen in the country happen elsewhere and 
that somehow we are all sort of parasites.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues in the House have arrived in parliament 
and want to make a go of it.  I admire them for that.  However, 
it is an irony that they are trying to make a go of it at a time 
when the consequences of some of the things they have been a part 
of are kicking in.  I would ask them to think of that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From here on I ask the government to let us see some members 
over there.  Let us have some respect for parliament.  That is a 
responsibility the government has and it has not been executing 
it.  Anything that comes out today from what the Reform Party did 
last night that helps the government see more clearly and to get 
its act together will be of benefit to all of us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the member on his remarks.  The House leader of the 
fourth party is one of the most distinguished parliamentarians in 
this place.  I usually disagree with things he has said, but he 
is a man dedicated to parliament as an institution and should be 
recognized as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has been in this place for some time, nearly two 
decades or more.  Does he think that the current attitude of the 
government to the business of the House is consistent with the 
history of this place?  Or, is this an increasing problem over 
time, this disregard of parliament as a place of debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have just started my 
20th year.  I think there have been times when we have had 
complaints about the government's attitude toward parliament, but 
I cannot remember a time when the government was not willing to 
maintain quorum.  This is a new development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have complained about governments that did not listen, 
governments that were arrogant, governments that changed the 
rules in a way that gave government too much power over the 
opposition, et cetera.  There is a long litany of things that 
have happened over the last 20 years which all in themselves have 
reduced the power of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not remember a time when the government benches were 
consistently empty in the way they have been over the last while. 
This is a new development and something that is greatly to be 
regretted and greatly to be resisted.  In the sense of what is 
now happening I think it is a good thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, like my hon. friend from the western Reform Party I 
commend the member who previously spoke.  The House leader of the 
NDP obviously has a great history in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke very eloquently to this issue.  He spoke to the fact 
that closure was first brought to the House of Commons by the 
Conservative Party.  Like the NDP, the Conservative Party has 
been around a long time, a claim that the Reform Party cannot 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member feel there are times that closure might be 
a useful tool for parliament, if exercised with discretion, if 
used by the government, tempered at times, and if used on 
occasion when the opposition may be misusing or taking up 
parliamentary time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that is what happened in this instance, but 
I am suggesting there are rules that have to be respected by all 
members of the House and procedures that have to apply to 
everybody.  If used with fairness and equity those rules can be 
adhered to and the rule of closure can be used on occasion and 
used properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not mean to suggest 
that closure originated with the Conservative Party.  Closure in 
itself goes back in the history of parliament.  Certainly I 
remember that closure was moved during the pipeline debate of the 
fifties.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was suggesting that the immediately previous Conservative 
government brought in the various reforms in 1991, having to do 
not just with closure but with other ways in which the government 
could trump various things that the opposition might be able to 
do.  That is the point I was trying to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role for time allocation and closure but it should be 
a very rare thing.  The problem is that it is not rare.  In 
previous parliaments it just grew like Topsy.  People get used to 
this kind of thing so it is not a big deal any more.  When the 
opposition tries to make a big deal out of what is appropriate to 
make a big deal out of, the media are tired of it and the public 
is tired of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened over the course of many years is that the 
opposition is eventually weakened in its ability to hold up 
government legislation, not just procedurally but politically, 
because people regard the whole debate about closure as a big 
yawn when they should not but they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it is appropriate to regard it that way because it is 
a kind of pro forma battle between government and opposition. 
People kind of twig on to that and they lose interest.  What 
happens is we throw out the baby with the bathwater on that. 
Sometimes when it really is important people are not paying 
attention or they cannot see just how important it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that has happened around this place is that 
the function of delay has been devalued, again because we have a 
cult of efficiency in our culture now.  We think that everything 
should happen like a corporate boardroom or some kind of 
production planning and control mechanism for a factory floor. 
That is not what parliament is.  Parliament, by its very nature, 
is a parliament, a place where people talk.  To the extent that 
the only kind of talk we now regard as valuable are things that 
happen on talk shows rather than what happens in parliament there 
is a very funny thing happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as our whole culture is obsessed with talk on 
the radio it has no time or appreciation of the talk that goes on 
in this place between the people elected to talk about what kind 
of country is wanted.  That might be the subject of some kind of 
thesis for some student.  It is more than I can go into at the 
moment.  I think there is an interesting irony there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is that the power of the opposition has been 
systematically reduced so that we cannot put up the kind of 
resistance we used to put up to a government measure and then 
take the political consequences.  If we are delaying something 
and there is not a lot of support for delaying it, sooner or 
later we will stop delaying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to stop regarding that as a waste of time.  That gives 
people time to mobilize.  It gives the Canadian people time to 
figure out what is going on.  It gives the media time to decide 
that they are going to cover it.  If they only have 48 hours 
between the time the issue comes up and the time it is resolved, 
there is no time for any of that to happen.  There is no time for 
process.  What we have done here is killed the opportunity for 
that to happen in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some issues drag on and there is time for that.  I am not making 
an absolute categorical statement here, but that is part of the 
problem.  It is not just closure in any of its formal forms.  It 
is the self-imposed closure we all do on ourselves by saying it 
does not matter whether we have anything to say in here because 
nobody is paying any attention anyway, particularly the 
government.  It is not even willing to go through the motions any 
more.  Over time everybody loses heart.  When we lose heart we 
lose the very thing that is absolutely essential for a democratic 
culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have more of a comment to make than a question.  I always enjoy 
listening to the House leader of the NDP.  I respect him for his 
respect for the parliamentary institution we are a part of.  I 
will admit I have only been here for five years so I am still 
learning.  I am still wet behind the ears compared to the member 
who has just spoken. 
It is not only my read on history.  There are rules by which we 
govern ourselves in our standing orders and in Beauchesne's. They 
state that reasonable delaying tactics are acceptable in the 
House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the government is not right to expect and it 
should not expect that we make it as efficient as possible over 
here.  It is not within the realm of reason for us to say 
whatever you want to do at whatever timeframe you give us, we 
will just have to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish government backbenchers, not just cabinet which 
understandably wants to run it like a business, would realize 
that the role of all parliamentarians is decreased every time the 
government brings in time allocation. This is about the 50th time 
this government has brought in time allocation, although this is 
not time allocation.  The government has brought it in so 
frequently that the public and even the government backbenchers 
say I guess that is just the way we have to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame when people come here with the best of intentions 
only to find out those intentions cannot be followed through on 
because no discussion, no debate and no delaying tactics are 
allowed.  The government just says it is its way or— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time for questions and comments 
has expired.  I am afraid we have run out of minutes.  I did my 
best to hint to the hon. member that we were doing that but I am 
afraid the time has expired.  Given that this is a two hour 
debating time, the Chair is going to be relatively strict on that 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also advise the House that when the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford rose to speak, the Chair indicated he had 
unlimited time.  In review of the standing order, the Chair was 
apparently incorrect in making that ruling and we wish to 
apologize to the House.  The ruling should have been that it was 
a 20 minute speech because the motion is not a government order. 
It is a motion under routine proceedings.  Accordingly, the 
speech should have been a 20 minute one, subject to questions and 
comments, and it was not.  The Chair wishes to apologize to the 
House for that error.  We did not want to have a bad precedent 
set by that ruling. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with some regret that we find ourselves 
debating this issue but it is obviously a very important one.  I 
am honoured to be following the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona who has a long and storied history in this 
place.  He spoke very eloquently about the changes he has seen 
during his years in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of former parliamentarians who are watching what is 
taking place in this place, members like Robert Howie from 
Fredericton, New Brunswick who have served in this House and all 
members across the country who look back and occasionally follow 
the parliamentary channel.  They must wonder what is taking 
place.  There is obviously a digression.  There is something 
afoot that seems to be undermining the relevance of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly suggest that occurrence is a result of a change 
in attitude, an attitude on behalf of a government that has now 
been sitting in the government benches for five years and some 
months.  It has decided in its arrogance that it is going to do 
what it wants to do.  That was displayed in the House this 
morning.  After a motion was properly moved and tabled by the 
opposition, the government decided in its wisdom to come forward 
and to try to rescind it, simply rescind it without any debate or 
consultation.  It was simply going to run roughshod over the 
opposition as it has done, as has been its wont in the past 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition on this side of the House has shown a 
non-partisan unison by banding together and saying no, we are not 
going to let that happen. The time has come to draw a line in the 
sand and say it is not proper that the government is going to do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here we are.  Standing Order 56 has been debated.  It has 
been used on a number of occasions in this parliament.  It was 
used in the last parliament as well to stifle the opposition on 
occasion.  I was glad to hear the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona acknowledge that there is a time and a place 
when closure can be used, much like the rules of procedure 
themselves where there is a time for their application.  But this 
was not the time or place for the government to exercise that 
discretion.  It did so in such a way that it displayed an 
attitude such that the opposition parties felt that was enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating this issue when we could perhaps be debating 
other more important issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the issues that will arise in this debate are the 
issues that do govern the House, set the rules of engagement and 
set how the rules of procedure will be applied.  Therefore it is 
an important debate and I am hoping there will be some lessons 
learned and some exchange of information and ideas that will 
perhaps improve the way we choose to apply these rules for the 
months and years ahead that will bind us in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is high time that the government realized that MPs in 
the House, whether its own backbenchers or opposition members, 
are not irrelevant and are not here to be taken for granted by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a bit of irony to see the reaction of the government 
House leader when this occurred, a complete overreaction I would 
suggest, an attitude of disbelief that the opposition would have 
the audacity to stand up and oppose what was about to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen occasions where the government had no hesitation 
whatsoever to applying the whip to its own members.  It happened 
in a very poignant way during the debate on hepatitis C. It was 
not at all afraid to fill all of the benches on the government 
side to ensure that every single member was present in the House 
when it suited its purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, time and time again opposition parties bring forward 
issues they feel are of relevance and importance to their 
constituents, be it in the east, the west, Ontario or Quebec. 
They want to debate relevant issues to put their voice and the 
voices of their constituents on the record in parliament and to 
be heard by the government.  There are far too few members on 
that side of the House.  That does not lead to a healthy 
discourse or to the exchange that should take place in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been referenced by the previous speaker from the New 
Democratic Party, parliament is supposed to be about speech and 
about the exchange of ideas, thought and thought provoking 
debate.  The debates that occur in this place should be of 
interest and importance.  I hope Canadians around the country, 
abroad and those serving overseas who hear about what is taking 
place in their own Canada should have no more focus than on 
parliament and on what we say and do in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, what we have seen are a lot of shifting priorities on 
the part of this government.  One of the things I viewed with 
great regret was the use of press conferences on the part of the 
government as a means to announce shifts in policy and to 
broadcast the direction in which the government had chosen to go 
rather than making ministerial statements here in the House, 
allowing members of parliament to be given the first opportunity 
to review what the government had chosen to do and allowing 
members of parliament to perhaps ask relevant questions and 
discuss the decision the government had made to move in a certain 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has done that on two occasions within 
the last number of months.  Rather than bring forward new 
legislation on the Young Offenders Act and talk about the 
priorities of her department, she chose to hold a press 
conference and leaked that information to the press before 
members of the House were given an opportunity to speak on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a very relevant and lively debate yesterday about the 
status of parliament as it compares to the judiciary and how some 
members of the opposition are feeling that perhaps parliament is 
losing is relevance when it comes to the making of laws. Again 
that is a sad reflection on this place when some members in the 
House actually feel we are becoming that irrelevant, that we are 
not the supreme court of the land when it comes to the making and 
passing of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be a House of democracy and a place that is most 
reflective of the fact that Canadians have entrusted us and have 
put their faith in us as members of parliament to come to Ottawa, 
leave behind our homes and the places I am sure each of us would 
prefer to be, and bring forward their ideas and deal with the 
problems that do exist out there.  There are many problems out 
there when one looks at the high rates of unemployment, the 
declining quality of our health care and the problems within our 
justice system, to name a few.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians as well as parliamentarians, are feeling that this 
place is losing its relevance, this is a sad day.  One would only 
hope that we can learn from this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of discussions today and as a result of 
circumspection and looking back on what has occurred, perhaps the 
government will not be quite so quick to react in the manner in 
which it did to inform us that we are now going to be speaking 
and called on to debate issues until 4 a.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Leader of the Opposition said, so be it.  If that is the 
way it has to go, we will be here.  I know members of the 
Progressive Conservative Party will be here as they always have 
been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are prepared to be in this House if called on until 4 a.m., 
until the wee small hours of the morning.  We will be here. I 
give that assurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To send a message to the government, I am very pleased that the 
official opposition has taken this initiative.  I think we will 
see there is a non-partisan tone to what has taken place here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this was to send a message that the opposition 
matters.  I am sure that many members in this House have been 
questioned, those in opposition.  What can one really do as a 
member of parliament in opposition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If for no other reason, the message that comes out of today's 
debate is that there are occasions when we can hold the 
government accountable.  We can say no, that is not the way it 
should go, it will not run roughshod over the entire opposition 
with its motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a bad message to come from this debate.  We 
certainly know this is a busy place and that people do work.  I 
do not think there is any suggestion that government members as 
well as opposition members do not have a very busy schedule on 
the Hill, the amount of work that goes on in committees, the 
amount of work required in striking that delicate balance between 
the obligations of serving one's constituents and the obligations 
brought on either by a ministry or a critic's portfolio.  Those 
are very important roles and it takes a great deal of time and 
effort to do the job we are charged with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also has to be a shift in attitude.  There has to be a 
conscious change in attitude on behalf of the government when it 
comes to its arrogance toward the opposition.  That has been 
reflected time and time again in the manner in which the rules of 
this House have been applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot simply acquiesce.  In opposition we cannot simply say 
we are powerless, we accept that we are the opposition and the 
government has the majority and it can do whatever it pleases. 
That only goes so far and finally the opposition, as we come to 
the end of this session, says enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government in its wisdom will review this situation 
and realize there was an overreaction here that did not have to 
happen.  The role of the opposition here is to hold this 
government accountable.  I am sure that all members on the 
opposition side take that task very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can somehow improve the influence and perhaps improve the 
relations we have with this government, again I that is going to 
be a positive outcome from today's developments.  We are also 
charged with protecting the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some times that government initiates policy that is 
not perhaps in the best interest of the Canadian people.  We 
certainly should have the opportunity to question it when that 
occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a healthy debate.  This has been an opportunity to 
perhaps raise the level of intellect, the discourse that should 
be taking place properly in the House of Commons.  Perhaps now we 
will see the government a little more anxious to call to arms its 
own members when there is debate occurring in the House, not only 
for its own purposes but for the purpose of improving generally 
the way matters proceed in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly hope the trend spoken of by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona and other members, the downward spiral of 
disinterest and the perception of unimportance that might exist 
out there, will change.  We can put a stop to that by showing 
more mutual respect between government and opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly hope that we are not going to see a continued 
trend of righteous indignation on behalf of government members 
when opposition members decide to stand and question what it is 
they are doing here in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that message gets through and if we are not forced to use a 
tool such as the tool which was used this morning to try to 
block, outmanoeuvre and outflank the government, perhaps we will 
not be forced to digress into this type of debate again.  Perhaps 
then and only then will we be able to get on with the discussion 
of the important issues and the important tasks that we have been 
given as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of respect and attitude.  If we can learn from 
this, if we can hopefully get past this interlude and move on to 
the issues that matter most to Canadians and do away with this 
contentious, non-important attitude that seems to exist on behalf 
of the government toward opposition members, then I am sure we 
will all be better off and the level of debate and the type of 
importance and emphasis that is placed on this parliament will 
improve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for his comments.  I always enjoy 
listening to his comments and as the House leader for the party I 
know he has a lot of interest in the whole procedural part of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate when the public looks on and says “I am not 
sure what is going on.  There are a lot of green seats and there 
are some things flashing on the screen, but I do not know what it 
is all about”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe that it is critically important today to 
discuss the issues of the role of parliament and the role of the 
opposition parties, collectively, in a properly functioning 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciated the comments that the member brought forward 
regarding the need to respect this institution and the need for 
people on all sides of the House, especially the government which 
holds the big hammer, to understand that there is a role to play. 
A proper functioning democracy needs an efficient opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and I spoke to 
the Cuban delegates together some time ago.  We talked about two 
things.  I talked about the role of the opposition.  I told them 
that we think a good government can be made better by an 
efficient opposition.  The opposition is important in making a 
government more efficient and accountable; not just efficient in 
the sense of quickly passing legislation, but efficient in the 
sense of doing the right thing and representing people better. 
The opposition is required.  I made it perfectly clear when I 
talked to the Cuban representatives that the opposition was 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough talked about the 
importance of a free media and its role in a functioning 
democracy.  In other words, there are the people themselves, the 
voters, the active participants that not only vote but make their 
feelings known to their politicians, there is the role of the 
media to actively report not only what is sensational but the 
meat and potatoes of what goes on in this place, and there is 
also the role of the opposition parties.  All of that is key to a 
properly functioning democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be more key in that parcel that we are involved in, 
which is partly media and partly debate, than to have the right 
to speak to important issues?  The public may say “This is just 
a debate on restricting your ability.  They are going to try to 
wear you out by sitting until 4 o'clock in the morning”.  The 
public should know that it is the crux of a democracy to be able 
to speak out in parliament when we do not agree with something. 
It is the quintessential essence of parliament to debate, to 
talk, to be able to get our points across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was before my time, but when the pipeline debate came to a 
head and the government restricted debate, what happened at that 
time? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pipeline was one issue.  It was a big issue.  It was an 
important issue for the country, but what the subsequent election 
turned on was the use of closure.  Mr. Diefenbaker made proper 
use of that.  He said “It is not just the pipeline, it is the 
fact that we were not allowed to talk about it”.  The election 
turned on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia, back in Dave Barrett's day, 
the opposition of the day, which was led by Bill Bennett, made 
the point that the government was not using the legislature.  The 
legislature was not sitting.  The government was bypassing it by 
using orders in council to pass everything, to spend millions and 
millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bennett went around the province and his rallying cry was 
“Not a dime without debate”.  He could not go to the 
legislature and cry it because it was not sitting.  He went out 
and said to the people of that province “It is not right that 
the government is bypassing the legislature, bypassing 
parliament, and running the province by executive order.  We need 
to have public scrutiny.  We need to have public debate.  We need 
to have the legislature sit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was back in the early seventies.  It was such a big issue 
that he won the next election because the government refused to 
do its job, which was to sit, to withstand the barrage of media 
scrutiny, to withstand the scrutiny of the opposition parties who 
put questions to it and to debate legislation.  Because of that 
the Barrett government fell.  It was one of many reasons, but 
that was the rallying cry leading up to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That happened about 25 years ago.  In 25 years we have come so 
far that this government has used closure and time allocation 50 
times to restrict debate on routine issues of the day.  It just 
does not want to bother talking about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a national pipeline debate.  It is just “We don't 
not like the cut of your jib, so we are going to cut off 
debate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes are necessary.  We had a debate on potential changes to 
the standing orders.  I put forward six or eight ideas that I 
thought could improve this place to make it more accountable and 
also to limit the extreme power of the government.  I wonder if 
the house leader of the Conservative Party could detail for us 
some of his ideas on standing order changes which would make this 
place function better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dealt with things such as referral before second reading 
and a lot of other things, but I would be interested to know if 
there were some specifics that he thinks could improve this place 
so that the government does not only holds all the cards but play 
them underhandedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for that question.  As always he brings a great deal of history 
and a great deal of knowledge to the debate, even though he is a 
relatively new member to this Chamber.  He is not as new as I am, 
but I always respect and enjoy hearing the hon. member speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has a great depth of knowledge of the history of the 
Conservative Party of Canada, which leads me to believe that 
there may come a time when he will be back in the party.  I am 
very encouraged to hear the hon. member speak in such glowing 
terms of some of the past glories of the Diefenbaker years and 
the Conservative Party itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To turn to the question, he asks specifically about some of the 
changes that I or the Progressive Conservative Party might like 
to invoke or to see take place within the standing orders 
themselves.  I have not turned my mind to that, except at this 
very moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One suggestion might be, in terms of the use of this card that 
has been played, this heavy-handed card of closure or time 
allocation, that the government within a certain term of 
parliament would only be allowed to use that card a specified 
number of times.  It could be limited.  Perhaps that would 
address the problem that has been referred to by the hon. member, 
that it would appear this government uses this measure, this 
shotgun approach to a mosquito, basically with no discretion. 
They simply, at a whim, decide that debate has become irrelevant, 
or a nuisance or a bother and they shut it down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That might be one suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I think, generally, the rules of procedure, obviously, like 
the law itself, are like a living tree.  They have changed over 
time.  They have evolved.  The rules of procedure are not 
necessarily the problem, just as it is with the law.  It is their 
application.  It is the tool in the hand of the person that is 
using it, the old expression being that a poor carpenter blames 
his tools.  The government has, in my opinion, displayed an 
attitude of arrogance and irreverence toward the opposition.  It 
has misused the rules or the tools of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was a change in attitude, a shift in the focus of the 
government as to its role as juxtaposed to the opposition, and if 
it had a little more respect for the opposition, I think that 
would go a long way to improving the way in which this place 
operates.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an 
outcry today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, we were treated to a marriage between the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party, and today we have moved on to 
adultery between the Conservative and Reform parties.  Members 
opposite are all so perfect.  It is the Jimmy and Tammy Baker 
Show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are telling us how to do our job.  These are people who 
ask questions in the House about India and Pakistan when there 
is not even a Conservative Party representative on the foreign 
affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are so self-righteous, telling us there is nobody in 
the House, when we know that parliamentarians are also required 
to work in parliamentary committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing worse than a weak opposition.  The opposition 
is weak because the opposition is weak.  Today, we see why.  The 
polls show the Reform Party with only 12% of popular support and 
the Conservative Party with 15%.  The reason we have 55% is 
because we do our job.  They are such a mighty opposition that, 
when 25 members were asked to rise in the House, there were 13 
Progressive Conservatives and only 12 Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point, the ridiculous comments have to stop.  Enough of 
this hypocrisy.  I will tell members something about hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in the Reform Party constantly saying that they 
are looking after important matters.  I am on the sports 
subcommittee, and Reformers were never visible.  The only time 
they showed their faces was when the National League governors 
were there, or when representatives from the Montreal Expos came 
to testify, because then there were cameras present.  When there 
is a photo op., when there is a chance to show off, to play a 
little game, then they are there.  But when there is a 
discussion of important issues, where are they then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They got all holier than thou about Stornoway, saying it should be 
turned into a bingo parlour, but now their leader is living 
there because, as he said, “I have received mail on this, it is 
shocking. I was forced to move to Stornoway”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see all the nonsense that is going on now with these 
people—not just the leader of the opposition, but also members of 
his party and the Conservative Party—trying to cover up. I heard 
the NDP member commenting on “How dreadful it is, you are not 
there”.  He should go see how things are in the foreign affairs 
and justice committees. To be honest, the only ones doing their 
job properly aside from the Liberals are the Bloc Quebecois. 
They take committee work seriously, the only ones who do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> On the back of the unemployed and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> The other side is whining again. It is this 
government that put the emphasis on the fight against child 
poverty. 
We allocated $850 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
While it is true that the Liberals balanced the budget, they did 
did it by implementing 37 tax increases.

debates here on phoney points of order.  The hon. member for 
Bourassa has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not the debate that 
is phoney.  It is the members of the opposition who are phoney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think hon. members might allow the 
member for Bourassa to complete his remarks.  I know that what he 
is saying is clearly provocative.  On the other hand it is not a 
matter of consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may be provocative in his remarks but with 
respect, when we have points of order raised that are not points 
of order, that are phoney points of order and that disrupt a 
member's speech, we know this on every side, that it causes more 
difficulty for all members.  I urge hon. members to allow the 
member to complete his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a period for questions and comments at the end when 
members are encouraged to make comments and ask questions, and 
argue with the hon. member.  I hope that members will take full 
advantage of the 10 minutes that will be thus afforded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B>  He is going to cry again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a point of order here. 
The member insists on using language which demeans other members 
of parliament and that is against the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member uses 
unparliamentary language, I am sure the member for Elk Island 
will draw it to the attention of the Chair, if the Chair does not 
pick up on it himself.  The Chair tries to ensure that the words 
used in debate are within the rules.  So far, the Chair has not 
heard words that are in and of themselves unparliamentary from 
the hon. member for Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B>  There is a short fuse, Mr. Speaker. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the truth hurts, this is what happens. Last evening, they 
tried to pull a fast one on us. This morning, we begin to see 
the weakness of their arguments and realize that they just 
wanted to be in the news again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Canadians will not be fooled. They realize what is going on 
and they showed it again last week in the polls. The Liberal 
Party of Canada has the support of 55% of Canadians, compared to 
12% for the Reform Party and 15% for the Conservative Party. 
Even without a leader, the Conservatives are more popular than 
the Reformers. This may be why the Reform Party is trying to 
conclude other sorts of alliances. They committed adultery and 
gave birth to the NDP. Look at the results.

for Prince George—Bulkley Valley, I do not believe there is a 
precedent saying that the expression “a bunch of clowns” is 
unparliamentary.  It is somewhat unrestrained.  As your Speaker, 
at times when I have been in the House I have heard the 
expression used in relation to different groups.  I will not rule 
it unparliamentary. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are beginning to understand 
them.  If the word “clown” is not unparliamentary, I will say it 
again.  I think they are going to create the order of clown, the 
deform party circus. Mixing the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform 
Party makes the deform party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This band of clowns goes in for props.  They really like props, 
but when it comes to basics, to serious business, the reason is 
clear why the Liberal Party was put in power.  It is simply for 
that.  They can make all the fuss they like, trot out their 
music, wander about in sombreros, make blunders and even try to 
stick the system— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> —but people will not be fooled. We have a 
government to be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They tried to put one over on us, but the people of Bourassa, 
like the people in all the ridings that elected Liberal members 
are proud and are saying “At least you do not go off with the 
chairs and you do not say stupid things.  You are working for 
the public good”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to describe all we have done, including create new 
jobs and, as was mentioned yesterday, an agreement to clean up 
the St. Lawrence.  In terms of the environment, we have done 
specific things.  In terms of finance, we have shown our mettle, 
our stature and our knowledge of handling public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most demeaning thing in politics is to act like a clown. 
The most demeaning thing in politics is to watch the opposition 
members fussing about and then to have them say to us “Look, 
there is no Liberal member in the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they try to hurt us, they are hurting themselves, because 
now we can talk about committees, such as the Standing Committee 
on Environment and Sustainable Development, the Standing

Human Rights, and the Standing Committee on Health.

Members of the official opposition want to speak at length. 
There is no rush, we will take our time.  While members opposite

working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Health has eight members from the

They can all rise in the House and say that they want to debate,

that members must have something to say and when they say it, it 
must be sensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no, we have this little procedural tussle.  When we have an 
international, local, provincial and regional role to play, and 
opposition members are not even present on parliamentary 
committees, we have to wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am clearly proud to be a member of this party.  I am proud to 
be a member of this government, because we know where the

know that a member's role— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> They are whining again. Next we know, they 
will be in tears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day, I heard someone say that backbenchers were 
unhappy in this place. That is nonsense. Sheer nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are we happy to be members of this government, but 
together with this government we participate in taking important 
stands in the interest of the public, while these 
anti-francophone people are not interested in anything besides 
their own little power plays and ensuring that their leader can 
keep going for another week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look after the public interest. We work for the public 
interest. We, on this side, whether francophones or anglophones, 
are working for all Canadians and treating everyone on an equal 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What am I hearing from the Reform Party? When they are not 
clowning around in sombreros, what do they do? They put 
francophones down. They are anti-francophone. We, on the other 
hand, are taking our responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of continually standing up in this House with their 
petty rhetoric, their hogwash, their whining and their strings 
of petty points of order, which are even more trivial, they 
should really shut up, because the more they talk, the more they 
damage their case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Liberal Party, that suits me just fine; the 
more they talk, the better we fare in the polls. That is how we 
had a member elected in British Columbia. There was a reason for 
that. People are not stupid. While they were clowning around, 
parading in sombreros, while they were giving us their hogwash, 
we were working, and the people took notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the ultimate test? 
While Reformers were clowning around in sombreros, we 
demonstrated to the public that we were looking after the best 
interest of the country and its people properly. Do members want 
proof? The only time the Reform Party could have demonstrated 
they were right, we got a Liberal candidate elected in British 
Columbia. This just goes to show what the real, the ultimate 
test is, where the public can show how satisfied or dissatisfied 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth hurts. The facts speak for themselves. I am proud to 
be a member of this government. People need not worry, we are 
working. They have tried to lead people to believe that we are 
not here to do our job. That is b.s., that is not true. We are 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do committee work, we work in our ridings, we make 
announcements left and right, we travel thousands of kilometres 
to serve the public. 
We are doing our work in this House. Just because some barnacle 
comes along two minutes before the adjournment to try to play 
procedural games, nobody is going to take away the value I 
attach to this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more Reformers run down the institution, the more harm they 
are doing to themselves.  If they want to be effective, instead 
of saying dumb things, instead of playing the clown, going 
around in sombreros, they should act sensibly and talk sensibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of how much time there is for speaking, but 
one of speaking when one has something to say.  This can be done 
in a restrained and precise manner.  The day Reformers figure 
this out, they will understand what the role of a real member 
is.  Respecting the institution requires self-respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by what I have seen this morning, opposition members 
ought to be ashamed of themselves.  This is not a great day for 
the institution, because once again, if the opposition is weak, 
it is because the opposition is weak.

said to the young aspiring speaker to shout like crazy at that 
point because the point is weak.  That is what we just heard, a

committees and to pride in his party.  I would like to point out 
that we in the Conservative Party number only 20, not 156. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something happened here yesterday.  There was not one member of 
the government in the House for debate on a motion.  That is 
unbelievable, when there are 156 of them.  I am not afraid to 
bite, and I am not afraid of being bitten back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is proud of his government and of his 
committees.  When I was appointed to the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development, I tabled a motion for examination 
of the employment insurance reform, which also impacts upon the 
hon. member's riding.  The committee voted it down.  Is he proud 
of that?  Just recently, the members of his party voted against 
compensating some of the victims of hepatitis C.  Is he proud of 
his government for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, not only am I proud, but I am 
honoured to be part of this government.  If there are only 20 
Conservative members and 16 committees, it means one 
Conservative per committee.  If the member is present and does 
his job, I have no comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is he whining?  He is no clown and he is not wearing a

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my first mandate as an elected official to the House of

of a parliamentarian takes place in the House and it also takes 
place in the committees.  The hon. member for Bourassa made an 
excellent point when he gave out the numbers as to the permanent 
committees of the House that were sitting this morning and who 
was actually there.  I think the point was very well taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply say, as the public has seen and understood today, 
that, when Reform members spit it lands on their noses.  By 
trying to demean the institution, the Reformers have once again

he has nothing to say, to at least say it loudly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out to the member that if he does not 
like the fact that the opposition agreed on something 
unanimously, then the solution to that is very simple.  Some 
members on the government benches could deny the unanimous 
consent to things they do not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member railed on and on about all the bad things that we are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the remarks.  Facts do 
matter.  There is one important thing that should be put on the 
record which is that the Conservative Party has but one member on 
each committee.  When we have one member there, we have 100% of 
our membership on that committee present.  That is a very 
important fact which should be on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess a lot of the members on the government side have chosen 
not to be in the House to hear the vitriolic, adrenalin driven 
remarks of the hon. member.  I am recalling a phrase my 
grandfather used to use.  To mix metaphors with a big stick here, 
he used to say that occasionally one could find a good stick of 
wood in a pile of manure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point that was made was that members should do their duty in 
committee, but they should also do their duty in the House. On 
balance, I would like to know from the hon. member for Bourassa 
if he is saying that a member should be at committee when there 
is important debate going on in the House.  We have been in that 
position a few times when ministers were in committee and 
important debate was happening here. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I want to tell the 
parliamentary leader of the Progressive Conservative Party that 
he should talk to his whip, because there are currently no 
Conservative members on the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights, and on the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade. They should do their job in that 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mao made this extraordinary statement: “Cow dung is more useful 
than dogmas. At least it can be used to make fertilizer”. This 
is the reply I could make to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I have always taken part in the debates on substantive 
issues. You can check if you want. I always have. I do not want 
to downplay the role of parliamentary committees, because it is 
at that level that the work is done in the legislative process. 
This is extremely important, because the legislative process is 
based on the work done by parliamentary committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Progressive Conservative Party is not represented on the 
standing committee on justice, then its members should not ask 
us questions in the House when they cannot do their job.

when there is one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is actually amusing to watch the Liberals' response 
to the motion put forward by their House leader earlier.  The 
reason we are here today is that the Liberal government was 
caught in a very visible way last night at a practice it has been 
doing since the 1993 election when the Liberals were elected as 
government.  That practice has been to continually show utter 
contempt and disdain for the opposition parties in this House. 
That has been shown very clearly on an ongoing basis by their 
lack of presence in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what the Liberals were saying to the opposition 
parties as we debated issues that were important to all the 
people of Canada was that they simply did not care enough to be 
here.  They do not care enough about what we are saying to even 
show up in the House.  This is evidence today.  We are debating 
the Liberals' own motion and there are only three Liberal members 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know where two of them are. The deputy whip is looking for a 
safe place to hide today, no doubt.  The House leader is out on a 
massive pout trying to figure out how he can get even with those 
dastardly Reformers who caught them in the act last night of 
their utter contempt for this House of Commons and the opposition 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Bourassa spoke so loudly earlier about the 
presence of one Reform member at many of the committee hearings. 
The simple answer to that is that one Reform member can handle 
six Liberals in debate any time of the week. Mr. Speaker, you 
will like this.  One member of the Reform Party appropriately 
handled the entire Liberal government last night. One of us is 
worth a thousand of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader certainly put forward this motion because the 
Liberals got caught last night.  They got caught with no members 
in the House.  Mr. Speaker, as you well know and could probably 
confirm, this is typical of what we see during debate most times. 
We see a goodly amount of opposition members while across the 
way we see no government members.  We certainly see no ministers 
when we are talking about issues.  That shows they do not really 
care about what the people of Canada who are represented by this 
side of the House have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Given that on this debate about the absence of government 
members there is only one government member opposite, I think 
quorum ought to be called.  Could you see if there is a quorum 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have to do a quorum count.  There 
has been a call for quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see a quorum.  We will continue 
with the debate please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure the members who 
just ran in came to hear the rest of my speech.  I thank them for 
showing up today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address some of the points made by the member for 
Bourassa where he incorrectly accused the opposition parties for 
not showing up for committee meetings.  He will find out if he 
looks because it is documented that many times in this session 
the chairman of the Indian affairs committee could not get a 
meeting together because not enough members from her own party 
showed up to make quorum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the committee meetings had to be cancelled or delayed. 
I think it is astonishing that the government itself cannot get 
enough of its own members to a committee meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole thing is about the government's having respect for 
the opposition, for the points the opposition party has made and 
I want to talk about two very good examples.  There may be some 
heads hung over there as I remind them of how they have shown 
their contempt for decisions that were made in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I start with a motion put forward concerning the victims bill of 
rights.  This was brought into the House in the last parliament. 
It was debated and voted on and it was carried unanimously in 
this House, that the government would take steps to enact a 
victims bill of rights.  Its own members voted for it.  But to 
this day, and it is well over a year, there has been absolutely 
zero done by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was on a motion passed unanimously in this House two years 
ago.  The government has done nothing to bring it into some sort 
of legislation.  That is a slap in the face to the democracy that 
is supposed to go on in this House and it is certainly a slap in 
the face to the millions of Canadians who were supporting in 
their own way a victims bill of rights, certainly to victims of 
crime when a government will not deal with a bill that has been 
passed in this House.  Its refusal to deal with that bill was 
another example of its contempt for the opposition parties and 
the ideas that we bring forward in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with another matter dear to my heart, the Reform 
supply day motion that called on the government to examine all 
areas of the Criminal Code that dealt with the crime of impaired 
driving in order to enhance deterrence and ensure that the 
penalties for this very serious crime reflected the seriousness 
of the crime. That motion was debated in the House.  It was 
passed unanimously. A minister of the government made amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made an amendment that would send it directly to the justice 
committee and also another amendment that instructed the justice 
committee to deal with this whole issue and report back to this 
House with appropriate legislation as a result of its findings by 
May 15, 1998.  There was a mix-up when it was reported in 
<I>Journals</I>.  We approached the government and this was 
cleared up on a Speaker's ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has totally disregarded the will of this House. 
It still has not dealt with that motion.  The chairman of the 
justice committee as I understand, and I wonder how much power 
chairmen of committees have, has been telling the government that 
she will not handle this motion.  This was a motion that was 
passed in this House and sent directly to the justice committee 
with a timeline directive and the justice committee chairman has 
told the government and this House and all the people in Canada 
concerned about the serious crime of impaired driving that she 
simply will not deal with it, notwithstanding what has happened. 
That is astonishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of the disdain and contempt of this 
Liberal government that allows her to get away with this. We 
still do not know when the justice committee is going to deal 
with the issue of impaired driving in this House.  We go on 
waiting for it to change the Criminal Code to try and stop the 
epidemic of impaired driving.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single day that has been wasted by this Liberal 
government, statistically four and a half people have been killed 
in this country by impaired drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the six or seven months since this motion was passed about 
50,000 people have been injured by impaired drivers.  The 
government still refuses to deal with that issue. That is another 
example of the disdain of this government and the contempt it 
holds for the opposition parties.  It does not understand 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite who just spoke said that the first thing she 
learned in this House was the democratic fashion and the way it 
operates.  I suggest that the first thing she learned was to do 
exactly what her whip told her to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously some Liberal members are going to be taken to task for 
not doing exactly what they were told to do last night, not to 
mention the deputy whip.  I will not dwell on that.  She is the 
one who is really in trouble today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party find a lack of attention given to issues 
we represent.  We are a federal party and represent Canadians not 
only who voted for us in our ridings but across this country from 
coast to coast.  We bring those issues before this House to be 
dealt with, we trust, by the government in a sensitive and 
intelligent manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not come to this House to frivolously debate issues that 
make no sense.  We bring very serious issues to this House only 
to speak to empty chairs opposite because this government has no 
interest in showing up for debate unless it has to speak. There 
might be one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go on and talk about closure and time allocation. Closure 
is simply put in by this government because it does not want to 
hear any more.  It never wanted to hear from the opposition in 
the first place and it finally ran out of time on its agenda and 
so it implements closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today because the Liberal government got caught last 
night doing what it does best, having no interest in the debate 
in this House. Apparently now the House leader for the government 
is lashing out at the opposition members and at the Reform Party 
which caught him by coming to this House like a petulant child 
and saying “we are going to get you, we are going to sit until 4 
a.m.”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fine with us because maybe now we will get some more 
time to debate the issues that are important to Canadians.  We 
will be here until 4 a.m. and we welcome the Liberal members to 
join us en masse to have a good discussion about a lot of the 
issues that concern Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is just about up.  Lots of members from the 
Reform Party are anxious to continue debate on this. I wish the 
deputy whip well today as she climbs out of her tight spot.  I am 
sure she will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, we probably will be supporting this motion to extend 
hours because we think it gives us a lot of good parliamentary 
time to bring forth the issues that concern Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am not sure what the Reform Party thinks the purpose 
of a whip is.   Is it to be in the House at every single moment 
to deal with its deleterious and destructive motions?  I can 
assure members that no whip spends every moment in the House of 
Commons, nor should we. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of spending time in the House of Commons and who is 
interested in the issues, the member has the gall today to talk 
about drunk driving, a resolution of this House, and victims 
rights and the justice committee and what it is doing about that. 
While Mothers Against Drunk Driving were at committee this 
morning talking about exactly both those issues, who was there 
listening to them?  Not the Reform Party which drags its 
tragedies into the House of Commons and bleeds all over the floor 
about them, but eight Liberals and one Reformer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think people should know there were nine committees meeting 
this morning. That is nine Liberals on every committee. That is 
81 Liberal members in committee listening to groups like Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving, the International Centre for Human Rights. 
No, they do not want to sit here in the House listening to these 
people blathering on time after time and making the same speeches 
over and over again.  They want to be in the committees, doing 
their work, caring about things like drunk driving, like victims 
of crime, like human rights. That is where they have been this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many times I sit in this House and Liberals as well 
are speaking to empty benches opposite. We accept that members of 
parliament have many responsibilities. We do not frankly jump up 
and criticize them every time they are not here sitting in the 
House listening to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the 
deputy whip of the Liberal Party got her information. At the 
justice committee as we speak and as it has been for quite some 
time now, there have been three Reform members present which 100% 
of our membership in that committee. But apparently there are 
only about three Liberals there and that is 33% of their 
membership of that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the hon. deputy whip of the government what the 
subject is this morning. The subject is victims rights. Surprise, 
it has taken two years for the Liberals to start talking about 
victims. This is one of the points I made in my speech.  After 
the motion passed in this House, two years later they decide just 
maybe we should have a little committee talk about this victims 
rights issue.  With all due respect to the deputy whip, the MADD 
organization is there to talk about victims rights.  It would 
love to come to the justice committee and talk about impaired 
driving.  But nothing is being done to allow that by this 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I quote from an article that appeared in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> 
today in which the government House leader admitted he and his 
MPs had only themselves to blame:  “Randy White is right. I 
don't like it that he is right”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member knows he cannot refer 
to other hon. member's by name, even when he is reading. I know 
that is awkward but I invite the hon. member to comply with the 
rules in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I was quoting 
the paper.  I did not realize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the government House leader admits that it is their fault. 
They made the mistake.  Now what they are saying is “because the 
Liberals screwed up, we are going to penalize the rest of the 
House and make you guys sit until 4 a.m.”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is the major blunder made by the Liberals last night 
is typical and indicative of the level of incompetence they 
display time and time again not only in the House but in the 
management of the affairs of operating the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would like to comment on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would not take me long 
to talk about the good management of the government because there 
is precious little to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is quite right when he talks about the neglect of the 
Liberal Party in being here to engage in substantive debate. Last 
night was just another example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are gone now, but the fact is that we had 25 
members here to prevent a procedural trick the Liberals tried to 
pull this morning.  That is why we were absent for a short time 
from the committee meetings, but when the trickery of the Liberal 
Party and the House leader was exposed and defeated our members 
diligently went back to the committees where they are now.  They 
are keeping the Liberals accountable for everything they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not care if it is three to nine on a particular committee. 
I say once again three Reformers can easily handle nine Liberals 
on any committee.  We could actually bring some back and handle 
them on committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we must 
all subject ourselves to a dose of reality.  If anybody in the 
House believes that one Canadian is interested in our procedural 
wrangling he or she is totally mistaken, totally out of sorts 
with what the Canadian people believe and feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is important that instead of procedural wrangling 
we get back to debating substantive issues.  The sooner we do it, 
the sooner we will be responding to what Canadians elected us to 
the House to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out 
to the hon. member that it was in fact— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. minister is quite right so I suggest we seek unanimous 
consent of the House to have the Liberal motion we are currently 
debating withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not know that the hon. member 
can ask for consent to withdraw a motion that some other member 
has put forward.  It strikes me as a little irregular. However, 
is there unanimous consent to withdraw the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no such consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the hon. 
secretary of state's comments, but I would like to point out very 
clearly to the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions who has a long title and does a good job, I am sure, 
that it was his party that brought forward the motion we are 
debating right now.  He may not know that because I think he just 
got here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He accuses our party of procedural wrangling but it was his 
party that brought the motion forward.  His House leader brought 
in the motion that we are to sit until 4 a.m.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is ironic that just before the two hours are up we 
are talking about membership in the House and whether or not the 
Liberals will be attentive and already we find that we do not 
have quorum in this place.  That is truly unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to count heads in this place once again 
after all this debate.

is very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the hon. member for Bourassa accused the Reformers 
of not having substance, of not taking part in the debates, of 
contradicting themselves and of being interested in technical 
rather than substantive positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, this upset them. The Reformers rose and started 
protesting. They swore that this was not their intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you one example, just one. The Reformers talked 
about human rights, about democracy. 
Barely two weeks ago, we led a mission that went to Chiapas to 
look at the situation of human rights, democracy and people 
whose lives are threatened. No Reformers accompanied us, because 
of a decision made by their own party. They are not interested 
in protecting the interests of people or democracy. They are not 
interested in fighting poverty. They are only interested in 
debates of a technical nature. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, talking about human rights 
in response to that nonsense, I only need to say that if the 
Liberal government cared so much about human rights why was it so 
anxious to jump in and sell a bunch of Candu reactors to the 
country of China without first discussing human rights with that 
country?

honoured today to stand in the House to present a number of 
petitions signed by people mostly from the wonderful riding of 
Elk Island. I represent them in the issue of the definition of 
marriage. There is a petition circulating now by people who are 
concerned about the redefinition of marriage. These petitioners 
simply ask that we leave it the way it is, that it be defined as 
a marriage to be entered into only by a single male and a single 
female.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to present a petition on behalf of my constituents 
pursuant to Standing Order 36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners, mainly from Kamloops, Winnipeg, Kitchener and 
Guelph point out the concern they have regarding the MAI. They 
are aware that the government simply set it aside until later 
this fall in an attempt once again to impose this agreement on 
the people of Canada and eliminate much or our sovereignty. 
They point out that they are simply against the MAI and urge the 
government not to consider it any further.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in another 
petition, the petitioners are concerned about the changes the 
government is planning to the pension system of Canada.  They say 
that Canadians have worked hard over the years to build our 
country. In no way should they have their pensions clawed back as 
the present system does and particularly as the proposals have 
it. They are simply against any of the suggestions so far 
regarding changes and amendments to the Canada pension system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in this 
petition, the petitioners are concerned about the unfair tax 
system that presently exists in Canada and are urging a complete 
study of fair tax reform.  They are suggesting that every 
corporate tax exemption be considered on its merits.  They assume 
that none of them have any merit that would withstand a fair 
evaluation.  Therefore, they are anticipating that we will simply 
do away with all corporate tax loopholes.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT

<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too have a great many petitions to present concerning the 
multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an agreement that was to be concluded in October but was 
not. A great many Canadians are happy about that. However, they 
want the government to go further than simply not arriving at an 
agreement in October.  They want parliament to reject the current 
framework of the MAI negotiations.  They want the government to 
seek an entirely different agreement by which the world might 
achieve a rules based global trading regime but one that protects 
workers, the environment and the ability of governments to act in 
the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many such petitions rolling in from all across the 
country.  It shows that Canadians are urging the government to 
take a more critical attitude toward the current globalization 
model and seek a different way of forming a global community, 
that is to say, forming a global community and not just a global 
marketplace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, similar to the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, 
I also have a petition that touches on the subject of the MAI and 
the manner in which the Canadian government has negotiated or 
attempted to negotiate this agreement behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This petition calls upon the government to have more open 
participatory discussions in the public forum that are 
transparent.  They urge the government to do so forthwith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very honoured to table this petition on behalf of the 
constituents of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and do so 
pursuant to Standing Order 36.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to rise quickly and pose the question 
that I have posed on numerous occasions here in the House with 
respect to Question No. 21 that languishes further on the Order 
Paper, eight months and counting.  We are very anxious to have 
this question answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very straightforward question but we have been told time 
and time again that it involves a great deal of investigatory 
work on behalf of the government.  There are 30 departments and 
we want to know where ministers were at a certain set period of 
time.  Perhaps we could get an indication from the parliamentary 
secretary when an answer will be coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary 
secretary to the House leader is presently chairing a committee 
meeting and I will bring this submission to his attention at the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just need some 
clarification.  We just passed a motion that the hours would be 
extended to 4.00 a.m. as of June 10.  As it will turn into June 
10 at midnight tonight, I was just wondering if the House is 
sitting tonight voting or whatever we may be doing at midnight, 
does the order kick in at that time and we will be sitting until 
4.00 a.m.  Is that correct?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is reasonable to conclude that the 
order brought by the government House leader, which was voted on 
a few minutes ago, applies to the sitting days starting on June 
10. Since the sitting will commence tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m., 
I assume it is the one that will be extended until 4 a.m. and it 
is not anything that might happen this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we conclude the business of supply and the other deferred 
divisions this evening, I think the House will adjourn at 
whatever time that might be and not sit until 4 a.m.  That would 
certainly be the Chair's interpretation of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the standing orders provide that the extended sittings 
start tomorrow night.  Tonight is not an extended sitting except 
by reason of the fact that we have a final supply day.

$193,805,000, under JUSTICE—Department—Operating

<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today is an important 
day.  Today the House will consider the motion to concur in the 
main estimates for the current fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House will approve all spending of the government 
and will debate the main estimates for 1998-99.  We also have 
before us 50 motions in opposition to specific items contained 
within these estimates. Consequently the government has a similar 
number of motions on the table to reinstate opposed items.  We 
will debate the first opposed motion presented by the hon. member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough under the justice department 
for operating expenditures in the main estimates for the fiscal 
year ending March 31, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have licked the deficit monster.  We have looked it in the 
eye and we have met the challenge.  We have put the programs in 
place to fight the monster and we have slain the monster.  Four 
years ago few if any could have imagined the success we have 
achieved.  Since the tabling of our fifth budget the fiscal 
achievements are still making news not only across this great 
country of ours but also beyond our borders.  For the first time 
in 30 years the federal budget will be balanced this fiscal year. 
That is a reduction of $42 billion in just four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the U.S. we are the only G-7 nation to balance its 
budget.  Using the accounting standards of the United States we 
registered a surplus last year and a surplus of $12 billion is 
projected for this year, easily the best record in the G-7 
nations.  We will balance our budget next year and the year 
after.  This will mark the first time in nearly half a century 
that Canada has three consecutive balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put simply, we are at the start of a new fiscal era.  As the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have said repeatedly, 
this success story is due to the will, the forbearance and the 
patience of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our efforts to restore the health of our nation's finances we 
have pursued a balanced approach, reducing the deficit steadily 
step by step while undertaking within our limited resources 
strategic investments to build a strong economy and a secure 
society.  We will continue to follow the balanced approach of 
sound economic and financial management.  It is an approach that 
works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back only four short years ago the financial markets 
considered Canada to an economic disaster in the making.  We were 
lumped with every troubled economy in the world. 
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I> called Canada an honorary member of 
the third world.  Canadians did not need <I>The Wall Street 
Journal</I> to convince them.  They knew we needed a fundamental 
change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were prepared to take the harsh medicine necessary to 
restore Canada's fiscal health.  With this firm commitment we 
reduced government spending and encouraged economic growth 
without increasing personal income tax rates.  We cut $14 billion 
from federal program spending.  In fact we were the only country 
in the G-7 to actually reduce spending in absolute terms. I 
emphasize that we have cut more in our own backyard than in 
transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1993-94 and 1999 to the year 2000 transfers to the 
provinces will have dropped by 5.3% compared to a decline of 8.7% 
in direct federal spending.  The result is a leaner and more cost 
effective federal government.  In fact as a share of the economy 
Government of Canada spending is headed back to where it was in 
the post-war era of the 1940s.  Program spending to GDP fell from 
16.6% in 1993-94 to 12.4% in 1997-98, a decline of 4.2%.  We will 
never go back to overspending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999-2000 we project federal program spending will be down to 
11.5% of the GDP, a drop of nearly 8% from a peak of over 19% 
during the mid-1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More Canadians are now working.  More Canadians are now paying 
taxes.  More Canadians are now buying goods and services which in 
turn means higher sales tax revenues and increased corporate tax 
revenues reflecting higher profits.  That is what a healthy 
Canadian economic growth is all about: more jobs, more sales, 
more production and a larger economic pie.  All of that is good 
news for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy has improved thanks to our sound fiscal policies and 
our will to put our fiscal house in order.  Thus now is not the 
time to relax and rest on our laurels.  We now have to reduce the 
debt burden.  The truth is that while we have won the battle of 
deficit we have not yet won the war on the debt burden.  That is 
why we will stay on course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take the same systematic determined approach to the debt 
that we successfully took against the deficit.  Step by step, 
year by year, we will steadily reduce the debt and we will 
continue to present fiscal plans based on prudent economic 
planning and assumptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-1980s the government spent $1.20 on programs for 
every dollar of revenues collected.  This year, given our large 
debt and cost of servicing, 72 cents of every revenue dollar 
collected will be spent on programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding our high debt and the need to service it, the 
government recognizes that the tax burden on Canadians is too 
high.  It must and will be reduced.  In each of our previous 
budgets we have introduced targeted tax relief measures for those 
most in need and where the payoff is the greatest.  Now that the 
government will be balancing its books we have also begun to 
provide general tax relief starting with low and middle income 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget eliminated in its entirety 3% of general surtax 
on those whose incomes were approximately $50,000 and reduced it 
for those with incomes of up to $65,000.  We have also added $500 
to the amount that low income Canadians can earn tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these measures are necessarily modest for now they are 
significant.  In fact over the next three years the measures 
announced in the 1998 budget will provide some $7 billion worth 
of cumulative tax relief for Canadians. 
Ninety per cent of all taxpayers will get some degree of personal 
tax relief from the 1998 budget.  Thirteen million filers will no 
longer pay any federal surtax and another one million will pay 
significantly less surtax.  Four hundred thousand low income 
Canadians will be taken off the income tax roles entirely.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as the Minister of Finance clearly stated, when 
financial resources permit we will broaden and deepen tax relief. 
In addition, to build a stronger economy the government's 
approaches entail investing in areas critical to our long term 
economic performance and to the achievement of our social goals. 
To do otherwise would be short-sighted and bad economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government recognizes that the private sector is the 
engine of job creation, we also believe the government has an 
important role to play in the economy.  That is why we chose to 
invest in access to education, in skills, in low income families 
with children and in health care in the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centrepiece of this effort is the Canadian opportunities 
strategy.  The strategy is a co-ordinated set of measures to 
provide greater and more affordable access to the knowledge and 
skills needed to help Canadians succeed in the 21st century.  We 
want to ensure that we have the best educated and most skilled 
labour force in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end the strategy increases access to post-secondary 
education through scholarship, grants and loan relief.  It makes 
it easier for adults to return to school and helps parents save 
for their children's education.  Our balanced approach to 
investing the fiscal dividend for the long term benefit of 
Canadians will ensure that we will build a stronger economy and a 
more secure society at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures we introduced in the 1998 budget are carefully 
targeted and matched to our ability to pay.  They are a measure 
of our fiscal success.  Also fuelled by our fiscal success the 
Canadian economy is showing significant strength.  In 1997 the 
economy grew by 3.8%, our best performance since 1994.  It was 
also the best performance of the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government came into office in 1993 Canada was caught 
in a vicious circle.  Today we have set in place a virtuous 
circle that has made Canada an attractive place to do business, 
to invest, to produce goods and services, and to conduct research 
and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job creation is up sharply.  Over one million jobs have been 
created since 1993, 372,000 jobs in 1997 alone.  The unemployment 
rate is now 8.4%, the lowest level since September 1990, down 
from 11.2% in 1993.  While the level is not satisfactory the 
improving trend is clear.  Long term interest rates are at their 
lowest levels in about 30 years and our inflation rate is one of 
the lowest in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our determination to keep it that way is illustrated by the fact 
that the government and the Bank of Canada announced in the 
budget that we were extending the current inflation control 
targets of 1% to 3% until the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking ahead, both the IMF and the OECD expect Canada to lead 
the G-7 in economic and employment growth this year.  The good 
news is that we have reached a major milestone in our path of 
fiscal and economic health.  The best news is that we have 
natural resources, the economic resources and, most important, 
the human resources to build an economy that has durable strength 
and a society that has security second to none in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will enter the new millennium with a healthy economy and 
Canadians can count on us to stay on track with sound fiscal 
policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the remarks of 
the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of his government's accomplishments.  He spoke of the 
fact that the budget has now been balanced.  He mentioned that 
the unemployment rate is now coming down.  These are all positive 
things and Canadians should be pleased with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I wonder if the hon. member will acknowledge and 
recognize that it was the previous Conservative government that 
implemented many of the very important economic policies, like 
the free trade agreement and the much hated and maligned GST, and 
for those brave initiatives there was a great electoral price to 
pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member not acknowledge that it was those policies, 
which were adopted and expanded by his government, that really 
share much of the credit for what he would have us believe is his 
government's initiative? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:</B>  Madam Speaker, most people in this 
House would know me as one who does not get involved in idle 
partisan debate and discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that one administration leads into another. 
There is no question that it does not matter which party is 
elected to form the government, they all do some things right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I must say that the political will was not there in the 
last government.  In fact, what Mr. Mulroney said and what he did 
were two different things. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have listened very intently to my colleague's comments from 
across the way.  He talked about the budget being balanced, that 
it was accomplished in four years' time and that the overall 
growth of the GDP in Canada has been some 3.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1993 election I recall that the Reform Party came out 
with a plan which we called our zero in three plan.  We said that 
under our administration we could balance the budget in three 
years' time.  We projected a growth of 3.5% in the economy.  I 
remember very distinctly a lot of literature coming from the 
Liberal camp, and from my Liberal opponent, which said that it 
was impossible to balance the budget in three years.  It was not 
even desirable to balance the budget.  They also said that 2% of 
GDP was an acceptable level of deficit for any country.  It was, 
after all, referred to as the United States' target of 2% of GDP 
which would have Canada's deficit at something like $14 billion 
or $20 billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite amazed that in three or four years' time the Liberal 
philosophy has changed so much.  I would ask the hon. member if 
he concurs that some of the change in the Liberal philosophy came 
about as a direct result of the platform put forth by the Reform 
Party in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
for his question, but the answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have on this side of the House is a good management 
team.  We have reviewed all of the departments.  We have the 
ability and the will.  Political will was lacking in the previous 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure of the Reform Party and its political platform.  I 
am sure its members had some projected statistics.  But part of 
what it was going to do was to cut our social programs.  It was 
going to privatize health care.  It was going to reduce transfers 
to all of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have used a balanced approach.  People of Canada have judged 
us.  They have given us a second mandate.  They recognize that we 
are doing a good job.  We are investing in people.  We understand 
the dynamics of a good economy, an educated and a healthy 
population, and we will continue to work in that direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my colleague from Bruce—Grey may not like to indulge in 
partisan comments, but I do not have any such reticence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat through the five years of the Mulroney government that the 
Conservative House leader referred to.  I sat through five 
budgets where programs were cut and slashed, all in the name of 
reducing the deficit.  However, the deficit kept going up and up. 
The amount of money that Canadians were paying on interest kept 
escalating and escalating.  They talked a good game, but they 
really did not do a lot.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat through five years of unemployment that rose to over 11% 
and then heard the leader of the Conservative Party in the 
election campaign of 1993 saying that it would be well over that 
until after the end of the century.  Now it is down to about 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw all those years of high interest rates, high inflation and 
all those things that dampened business and economic recovery.  I 
have seen a total change in those things since the Liberal 
government was elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the deputy 
whip for her comments.  The hon. member has been here a long time 
and she witnessed a government that operated much differently 
than ours does.  We are glad to have her on our side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member personally.  I know her useful experience, 
which is on track with mine.  People like her are very important 
for our government, as is the job that she conducts in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I agree with my colleague when she says that the last 
government really was not a good manager. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I find it rather interesting that the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the President of the Treasury Board would suggest in his comments 
a term called political will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the wonderful economy that we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three things that the Mulroney government put into 
place.  One was the GST.  The second was the low interest rate 
policy that we had in 1991, which was based on the low inflation 
rate policy of the Governor of the Bank of Canada.  The third was 
the NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, did it not take political will to 
implement all three of those particular policies?  Why does this 
government not have the political will that he speaks of to scrap 
the GST, as was mentioned in the red book, to rip up the NAFTA 
agreement and in fact to go back to a high interest rate policy 
with higher inflation than we have right now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member would like to tell me where the 
political will of this government is with respect to those 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:</B>  Madam  Speaker, the government 
looked at 17 different ways to find another accommodation and it 
found that a progressive tax like the GST was still required.  It 
generated some $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Why did you promise it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:</B>  Madam Speaker, as far as I know, we 
said we would look for a way to change the GST.  We did look. 
There were 17 different things that we looked at and we came back 
to the same accommodation that the Europeans are using as well as 
everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are running a good government.  Last year, for instance, we 
paid down the foreign debt by $14 billion.  This is a government 
that is very responsible, that walks the talk, that understands 
how to govern with a balanced approach.  Slowly and surely we are 
refining government so that Canadians can prepare for the 21st 
century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I do not think we should let inaccuracies go unchallenged. I want 
to suggest to the hon. parliamentary secretary that there is no 
place that he will find in the Reform Party platform or 
philosophy where we are in favour of privatizing the medicare 
system of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is not the Reform Party that has gutted the health 
care system of this country, it is the hon. members across the 
way who have not been able to prioritize their spending to make 
sure that things like health and education are taken care of for 
average Canadians in this country.  It is this government that 
has done that.  It is this government that has gutted the health 
care system in this country on the backs of the taxpayers.  It is 
not right for him to suggest that the Reform Party was going to 
do something that it has not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson:</B>  Madam Speaker, in my estimation and 
on this side of the House, health care is one of the most 
important pillars of this country.  There is no question.  All we 
have to do is look at the way Reform approaches problem solving 
and we will find that the object is to privatize it, give it to 
the people with money so they can make money out of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I say that health care, the pocket book and the ability 
to pay by cheque is not the way to go for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to take 
part in this debate which focuses on the expenses and the 
priorities of the government.  Particularly in this portion of 
the debate we are looking at the Department of Justice and the 
priorities that have been set by the minister and this government 
as they relate to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Minister of Justice appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights and did so only for a 
couple of hours, it is important that we have an opportunity now 
for a more open and transparent debate where we can exchange 
ideas and perhaps explain or at least go to some lengths to let 
the taxpayers know where their money is going as it relates to 
this very important department and perhaps even give some useful 
suggestions as to how we in opposition, and the Progressive 
Conservative Party in particular, would suggest that some of this 
money should be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very important initiatives that we have seen is the 
presentation of a DNA databank.  This is without a doubt perhaps 
one of the most important crime fighting tools that we will ever 
see in the life of this parliament, if not in the life of many 
previous parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it is aimed at specifically is using technology to combat 
crime.  What we are talking about here is very violent crime, 
crimes of a sexual nature, crimes of violence that involve the 
most heinous invasion of a person's well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are truly to take advantage of this particular piece of 
legislation, one would hope that the police would be given the 
opportunity to optimize the use of DNA; that is, that they would 
be able to take the DNA from a suspect at an appropriate time 
when a certain criteria has been met, namely, that enough 
evidence exists within the police officers' investigation to lay 
a charge, and when that does happen, when that particular bar has 
been crossed, the police will then be given the opportunity to 
take a DNA sample and use it in an investigation, use it perhaps 
to compare it to samples from crime scenes that had been taken 
previously.  If a match occurs, then a very important link has 
been made to an accused individual and a crime.  Due process, of 
course, will allow for the presumption of innocence, if it 
exists, to prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important piece of legislation that in its present 
form has come before the House and is flawed.  There was an 
attempt made by members of the opposition on the justice 
committee to remedy that.  We moved what I considered to be 
useful amendments.  Unfortunately, and to the detriment of this 
legislation, the government chose to vote those amendments down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this can be changed.  This could be fixed 
quite simply by the initiative of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas which are quite similar to this where the 
government could invest money, such as improving the Canadian 
police investigative computer system, the CPIC system, which 
police officers routinely use to track or to update themselves on 
the criminal involvement of suspects and those involved in 
committing offences against Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The violent crime linkage analysis system is another very useful 
system that, with the proper use of the police, could go to great 
lengths to help fight crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, however, has chosen not to touch that.  It has 
chosen not to invest or to put the necessary resources and 
funding into these areas.  Again, I really question the wisdom of 
that.  The government, by doing so, is showing that it has no 
interest in optimizing this cutting edge technology that would, 
and I suggest could, prevent and, equally important, solve 
existing crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only use this example to emphasize this point.  There are over 
600 unsolved murders in the province of British Columbia alone. 
The statistics across the country would be even more disturbing 
and more staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one area where the government could emphasize the 
necessity of putting resources into a specific area of technology 
and helping the police with this important crime fighting tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another general area that I would refer to the House is the fact 
that the provinces themselves should receive greater funding, 
greater assistance in the administration of our federal laws. The 
Young Offenders Act is a prime example. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government traditionally has been called upon and is 
legislated to supply or pay 50% of the cost of administering this 
federal act called the Young Offenders Act.  In truth what is 
happening here is it is paying only on average 30% of the 
administrative costs of the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been downloading of the majority of the cost to the 
provinces since 1994, and since 1994 we have seen a slashing of 
over $6 billion from transfer payments.  Those cuts have hurt not 
only justice but certainly in a broad sweeping fashion health 
care.  The hon. member from the Reform Party spoke of the cuts to 
education.  It cut the absolute basic necessities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This downloading on to the provinces and subsequently on to the 
municipalities can only serve to further undermine the justice 
system, the health care system, the education system and take 
away the provinces' ability to administer necessities to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the federal government prepared to put its money where its 
mouth is?  We have heard numerous announcements and those 
announcements, most traditionally in the area of justice, come 
outside of this Chamber. They are either leaked to the media or 
the government chooses to have a press conference as opposed to a 
ministerial statement of policy in the House.  I certainly 
question the wisdom of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister really prepared to pony up and pay the provinces 
and ensure that the provinces have these resources to administer 
changes that she has initiated, changes she spoke of in her youth 
policy initiative?  She has indicated she wishes to scrap the 
Young Offenders Act entirely, to throw it out, the baby with the 
bathwater approach.  One questions the wisdom of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no doubt in anyone's mind that the Young 
Offenders Act requires changes.  It requires significant changes 
such as lowering the age of accountability, bringing the parents 
into the system so that they too will be accountable and will be 
asked the hard questions as to what their role has been in 
supervising their child when that individual might be out 
committing an offence, or changing the Young Offenders Act where 
the emphasis is placed on prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Minister of Justice has contemplated these changes. 
She has spoken of them at length.  She has given great master's 
thesis presentations on what she would like to see happening 
within the justice system, but what we see lacking throughout 
these entire machinations and the process that we see when the 
minister makes these announcements are any of the hard figures, 
any of the concrete amounts, the dollar amounts that would be 
required to bring about this change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is just one of many changes that the 
government has spoken of, has taken the initiative to raise the 
consciousness of Canadians about and yet we are waiting and the 
clock is ticking.  We see it time and time again where the 
government says it is going to do something and then when pressed 
on the issue or asked when we will see some legislation tabled in 
the House, the response has become a patented response.  It has 
become the rallying cry of this government, in a timely fashion 
it will happen.  There is a process that we must go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly can respect that there is a process but as with 
health, as with education, when the time is rolling by, when the 
necessary changes that could have a positive impact are delayed, 
the result can be catastrophic.  It is tantamount to not giving 
treatment in health care.  One only has to look at some of the 
terrible examples of individuals suffering from afflictions like 
hepatitis, like cancer, and if the treatment is not administered 
the results can be death and injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is equally true within our justice system.  If there are 
preventive steps that can be taken, if there are measures that 
can be implemented that will improve the system, help prevent 
crime and help solve crimes that continue to be outstanding on 
the police record, if we can do something about it, why shouldn't 
we?  Put aside partisan politics and move as quickly as possible 
to see that those legislative initiatives are taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House, and I can only speak for the 
Progressive Conservative Party, if we saw that happening, if we 
saw positive changes like the DNA bill in its perfect form coming 
through this House, we would jump to our feet to support that. 
There would be no hesitation on our part to see those things 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the minister's policies look good on paper and 
certainly make for good press, we question their timeliness. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another suggestion we have with respect to the Young Offenders 
Act would be to provide judges with more powers to provide or 
impose mandatory treatment or therapy when a youth embarks on a 
troubled career or the wrong path, and have that early 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the concept of restorative justice has become very 
prevalent in the discussions around young persons and actually 
more broadly within the justice system itself.  Once more there 
has been a great deal of talk about what the government would 
like to do in this area but we have not seen anything concrete 
develop.  We have not seen it materialize as yet. Restorative 
justice is something that certainly would be a positive 
initiative.  It would be something I believe the government would 
receive a great many accolades over if it were to actually invoke 
that type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention one other area I spoke of previously, further 
parental responsibility, involving the parents in the justice 
system where they would more fully appreciate the consequences of 
their children's actions.  They, for lack of better words, would 
be called to task as to why their children were permitted to be 
out after a certain hour of the night, perhaps breaking into 
somebody's house or behaving violently, perhaps because they are 
emulating something they have seen in their own homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not new initiatives.  I will not say this discussion 
is redundant but it is certainly information that is available. 
It has been discussed at justice committee.  It has been 
discussed by the government's own experts.  Recommendations were 
made for things like lowering the age of accountability and the 
government has chosen to ignore that.  We in the Conservative 
Party question the wisdom of the minister in ignoring that 
advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the money being spent?  Where do this government's 
priorities lie?  It is incredible, and it has become almost a 
ruse in this country, the staggering amounts of money being put 
into the ill conceived and not thought out long gun registry. The 
howls from the government benches when anyone mentions this are 
quite incredible.  There are indignant cries of “you are against 
gun control, against safe handling of guns”. That simply is not 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the record will show quite convincingly that it was a 
Conservative justice minister who brought in Bill C-17 which was 
the most comprehensive legislation aimed at safe handling of 
firearms. The legislation spoke of safe storage.  It spoke of 
safety courses that were to be implemented.  It talked of trigger 
guards and keeping of ammunition separate from weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party has always been consistent in its 
approach that it does favour safe handling of weapons.  Simply 
putting a stamp with a serial number on a rifle and having that 
databank, a computer system that records who owns certain guns, 
is not in any significant way going to help combat the criminal 
use of firearms.  We are targeting innocent Canadians who take 
part in sport shooting, recreational hunting, who go to firearms 
ranges.  Why on earth would the government choose to spend the 
amount of money that this ill fated system will cost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost has absolutely ballooned.  The original figures said 
$85 million.  We know that with the start-up date of this 
legislation fast approaching the cost has already gone far beyond 
that original figure.  We are talking about a figure that will be 
tripled or perhaps quadrupled by the time this legislation comes 
into place, half a billion dollars at the worst estimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has chosen again to put the money into an area 
that will not have a significant effect when it could put money 
into something such as the suggestion yesterday of having an 
advocate or ombudsman for victims within our system. 
It costs only $1 million to have an advocate, the commissioner 
for correctional investigations.  It would cost $1 million to 
have an advocate for victims and the government chooses not to do 
that. That is a conscious priority decision that the government 
has made.  One has to question why the government would decide to 
spend hundreds of millions of dollars on this gun registry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to another very questionable decision and a 
priority choice by the government, the now nefarious and 
subversive investigation into the entire Airbus affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an investigation into a Canadian citizen and a former 
prime minister.  This brings the entire office of the prime 
minister into disrepute when this type of scandalous 
investigation is embarked on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the former prime minister under investigation 
has been harassed and defamed by the current government's 
administration.  That again was a choice that the government 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly is not just about cost when a person's reputation 
is attacked and resources are put into it for perhaps some 
politically motivated reason.  We know there was an out of court 
settlement of $2 million.  The cost of having government lawyers 
pursue that through the various court levels and appeals 
certainly expanded or doubled that cost.  All this at the end of 
the day resulted in a very jaded apology and yet this 
investigation continues.  It has expanded in its scope.  There 
are more officers working on this file than before and to what 
end?  Canadians need to know this is a choice the government has 
decided to make and pursue in the area of justice. It is 
certainly anything but justice that this is allowed to occur.  It 
is a farce and Canadians should know that it is a farce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do about it?  We can talk in the House endlessly and 
talk until the cows come home.  We can make suggestions but it is 
the government ultimately that bears the responsibility and has 
the ability to act on these initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many improvements could be brought to the system without 
spending a great deal of money by refocusing the choice as to 
where the money was spent and by taking the money out of the gun 
registry system.  It is sad because the money is being spent and 
has been spent to a great extent.  We know it is going to cost 
more.  Police officers question whether it is going to improve 
the current justice system.  The officers and those who are 
working directly on the front lines in our justice system are the 
ones who are best charged with the knowledge of whether this is 
going to work, and they say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of a potential change in our justice system that 
would not cost the government a great deal of money would be the 
change to the Criminal Code with respect to impaired driving. It 
would be easy for the government to take an initiative to make 
changes to our Criminal Code as it pertains to impaired driving. 
On a number of occasions I asked the minister when that was going 
to happen.  It has been before the standing committee.  It has 
come back before the House and yet regretfully we are not in a 
position to bring about those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put these statistics on the record only to demonstrate how 
important it is that we deal the Criminal Code changes soon. Once 
again it demonstrates that as time goes by there is a very heavy 
price to pay in the area of human lives.  Impaired drivers kill 
4.5 people in Canada every 24 hours, every day of the week. In 
1995, 1,519 people were killed in Canada by impaired driving. 
Impaired drivers killed 17,630 and injured 1.1 million in Canada 
from the years 1983 to 1991.  Shocking statistics.  The havoc 
wreaked on the highways of this country as we speak in the House 
should be cause for concern for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that alcohol has significantly increased the 
risk of motor vehicle accidents and yet we have not dealt with 
that in a substantive way in the House.  We have not rushed to 
try to remedy the situation.  That is another example of a change 
that could be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is section 745 in the Criminal Code, bringing 
about truth in sentencing.  Individuals who are serving life 
sentences for committing the most heinous of crimes are still 
given the opportunity in this section to apply for parole. 
It truly is a shame.

<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to begin by congratulating my colleague, who can certainly not 
be accused of being pathologically partisan.  On the contrary, 
thanks are due the constituents of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
for electing such a distinguished parliamentarian, who tackles 
his work with such enthusiasm.  He has already been very well 
accepted by all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As did our colleague, the member for Brandon—Souris, the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough pointed out this government's 
complete lack of agenda, with examples from a few particular 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government was re-elected with a distinctly smaller 
majority than in 1993, after some completely incredible 
flip-flops on free trade. The Liberals battled the former 
government fiercely on this issue. However, this measure has 
resulted in our exports increasing from $90 to $215 billion.  It 
was the same with the GST.  We lost the election on the GST. 
They also had a lot to say about the acid rain treaty and 
defeated us because of national defence issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such a track record of public contradictions, why was this 
government re-elected, even with a smaller majority?  Was it 
maybe because the opposition parties are becoming more 
regionalized and divided? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of what my colleague, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, said, I find it completely 
incredible that a government that makes historic errors on 
national agendas adopted by the previous government, that in 
some cases contradicts itself while in office by passing 
measures it voted against, particularly with respect to national 
defence, and that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars after 
making election promises not on the sly but right out in the 
open, on television, is re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this government re-elected?  I think is has something to 
do with an aspect of Canadian politics that has cost us very 
dearly to date.  Is it not because of the proliferation of 
opposition parties, which have trouble reaching any kind of 
consensus that could be constructive for our country?

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to respond first 
by thanking my colleague from Chicoutimi for his very kind 
remarks.  I take it as very high praise coming from a 
parliamentarian such as himself who has continually distinguished 
himself in this House, regionally and nationally.  My father had 
the honour of serving with him.  I take it as a great honour that 
the member would make those remarks in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer his question, if an answer is possible, I suppose it 
is a question that many in the opposition ask when we see the 
performance of this government on certain issues.  The member has 
referred to historical decisions that they have made. One might 
call them hysterical if they were not so far reaching. One might 
call them hypocritical if one examined the record as to what was 
said previous to this government taking office.  It does lead one 
to question as to why we have the electoral response that we have 
and the regional breakdown that exists within this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there was a great deal of dissatisfaction expressed 
against the Progressive Conservative Party in 1993.  There was a 
huge price paid for the necessary and brave initiatives that we 
paid a price for and now this government rushes to take the 
credit. That is something history will sort out.  I suspect that 
history will be very kind to the Conservative Party.  We are 
hoping that in the very near future the Conservative Party will 
be restored to government and that is certainly the aim of our 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to make positive suggestions and positive 
constructive criticisms of this government in the hope that the 
environment is going to improve for all Canadians.  That 
ultimately has to be the purpose of an opposition that wants to 
be credible and wants to one day form a government which we in 
the Progressive Conservative Party certainly do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, all this back slapping and patting on the back is really 
great.  It is nice to hear.  Everyone in here is of course a 
great parliamentarian. I would like to keep things in perspective 
however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was speaking for some length about gun control. My 
recollection of a lot of history of the gun control issue is that 
Bill C-17 was simply the first step in a long progression that 
led to the gun control we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that when the vote came down, the Conservative caucus, 
in the Senate in particular that certain senators voted in favour 
of the gun legislation bill. I would like the member to comment 
on that because the veracity of the truth of his words has to be 
seen in the context of the whole picture if we are to believe 
that on this issue. We are also waiting for ex-parliamentarian 
Jean Charest to make his first comments from Quebec on that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member any comments on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do appreciate the 
question and the opportunity to answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member himself a former police officer has been 
very involved in the law enforcement community.  I suspect he 
would be very reticent to suggest that anyone in this House is 
against gun control or the safe use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 as I said in my remarks is the most substantive piece 
of legislation aimed at the safe handling of firearms and the 
safe storage of firearms.  That is completely different, 
completely outside the parameters of what Bill C-68 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to correct an inaccuracy. The Conservative senators 
did work in a very substantive way to see that Bill C-68 was not 
passed. It has never been a derivation from our platform that we 
did not feel that the registry of long guns was a complete waste 
of money and it was something that was not necessary.  In terms 
of priorities in the area of justice, it certainly should not be 
a high priority and it certainly should not be a legislative 
initiative that is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
which is what is coming to light. Perhaps it could be a billion 
dollars before this is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  I have been made the honorary chair of 
the rifle association because of our stand on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  I do not mean to sound alarmist but 
this is the scope of this legislation.  And the interim leader of 
the Conservative Party is the honorary chair of the rifle 
association. I know her personally to be a very straight shooter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the question and I look forward to further debate 
on this issue.

I do not have a question but I feel obliged to break up this 
Woodstock Tory love-in that is going on over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member had a lot of experience with this in his 
former capacity.  I spent a couple of years working in Europe 
where there is a zero tolerance for impaired driving to the point 
where police are able to require blood tests when they pull 
someone over.  It is not .08, it is zero.  The argument is that 
one of the things that happens when you drink is that your 
judgment is impaired so why do we not set the bar at zero?  Does 
the member or his party have an opinion on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for 
that question. When it comes to impaired judgment, his government 
has certainly led the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the specifics of his question, the blood alcohol 
level has been lowered to point zero in a number of countries in 
Europe.  I believe Australia has gone to a zero tolerance with 
respect to alcohol consumption.  The Conservative Party is not 
suggesting that, although it is certainly something that would 
deserve a great deal of debate. We are suggesting and I have put 
the initiative forward that we should consider lowering it to .05. 
I know that Conservative governments in Manitoba and 
Ontario are also considering making this change to their 
provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something that is currently before the justice committee. 
We will be getting into the area of impaired driving in the fall. 
I hope it will be on the legislative agenda sometime shortly 
after we get it at committee. I look forward to the hon. member's 
participation in the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on this last allotted say to talk about the 
estimates.  Unfortunately it is a sham we go through in the House 
of Commons each and every year. We pretend to debate one of the 
most important things that affects all Canadians, the amount of 
taxes they have to pay and how that money is spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the estimates for this year, we are going to spend 
$145,460,380,000.  We would think one of the most paramount 
responsibilities of this place is to talk about how we are going 
to spend that monstrous amount of cash and to make sure it is for 
the benefit of all Canadians.  The first thing is that the rules 
prevent us from speaking about most of the money.  We can only 
speak about $42,422,644,000 because the rest being over $103 
billion is approved by statute, we are not able to speak on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My dear colleague you have just set the 
stage with $42 billion.  That will keep you going for a little 
while.  It is almost two o'clock so we will proceed to Statements 
by Members.  Of course the member will have the floor when we go 
back to the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, schizophrenia is a devastating illness which has severe 
mental, physical and emotional consequences not only for those 
who suffer but for their families, friends and for society in 
general.  Their suffering is made worse by the social stigma 
which sadly still attaches to people with mental illness. 
Approximately one out of one hundred Canadians will suffer from 
this disease in their lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because schizophrenia often causes a lifetime of mental and 
physical health problems, the treatment costs to society are 
exorbitant, and because schizophrenics tend to have poor 
employment prospects, decades of productivity are lost for each 
patient, which just adds to the very high costs borne by society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schizophrenia causes acute suffering, increased homelessness and 
chronic unemployment.  It is essential that more resources be 
allocated to research so that a cure may be found for this 
terrible disease.

abandoning the victims of hepatitis C infected through tainted

from the government's standpoint these innocent victims were 
really no different than people who got cancer from cigarettes.

Speaker, I explained that there was a period between 1986 and 
1990 when the government was negligent and could have done 
something which was not done.  In terms of the victims of other 
kinds of problems that arise in the health care system, we have 
to look at the government's responsibility.  I gave an example. 
There are a lot of people among those who were infected with 
hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has two types of compassion.  It has compassion 
for those who got hepatitis C through blood transfusions, but it 
has no compassion for the people who got hepatitis C by other 
means. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, people who smoke cigarettes know about the risks of 
cancer.  It is written on the label.  These hepatitis C victims 
were infected innocently.  They trusted the government to make 
sure the blood supply was secure and when they went into a 
hospital for surgery they had no idea that they would come out 
with a deadly disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the Prime Minister cannot see the difference when 
everyone else can? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry, he is talking about people who got hepatitis 
C through blood transfusions before 1986.  I am asking him about 
the people who got hepatitis C in other ways.  If it is not a 
matter of responsibility, then it becomes a matter of compassion. 
Why does compassion exist for some and not for others in the head 
of the Leader of the Opposition? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder this issue is confusing.  Day after 
day the Prime Minister has claimed that the working group of 
officials is trying to find a way to help compensate these 
victims and he has pretended to be sincere.  Now it comes out 
that the Prime Minister thinks these victims are no more 
deserving of government compensation than cigarette addicts or 
junkies on illegal drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what the Prime Minister really thinks about these 
victims, is it not obvious that this working group and this

started smoking before there was any notice on cigarette packages 
who have cancer today?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We care about the victims.  But that does not mean that

<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the point that we are responsible.  Suddenly, the same people who

downright sick for the Prime Minister to choose a youth audience 
in Regina yesterday to argue that compensating hepatitis C 
victims will open the door to compensation for smoking related 
cancers.  There were no warning labels on the blood that infected 
hepatitis C victims; no labels that said “This blood is

on the table.  At that time the provinces, including the 
socialist premier, did not want to put a cent on the table.  It 
is this Minister of Health who decided that the compensation was 
needed for those infected after 1986 and he forced the provincial

the point that comes of all this is that the Reform Party likes

that it puts in the gallery for show.  But when it comes to the 
HIV strategy to help those with AIDS, even those who got HIV 
through the blood system, the Reformers will not support it. It 
is called hypocrisy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For two days the only clear thing is that the minister has no

job and she is way over her head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask her very simply and slowly so that her friends can help 
her, what exactly is the federal government's position, what is 
her position, on the issue of land claims in British Columbia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Transport has said that he was counting 
on the goodwill of the railways not to close branch lines until 
Justice Estey's federal review was complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CN Rail is closing two more branch lines including the Imperial 
subdivision in my riding.  Why does the government delay acting 
to save our banking system until that task force reports but lets 
CN dismantle a rail system that is still under review?  Why the 
double standard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of consistency why will the minister not order CN

<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I believe the hon. member was in the House when we 
debated the amendments to the National Transportation Act which 
give the railway some latitude in terms of dealing with their 
excess infrastructure, much of it in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put in place the Estey commission, the statutory grain 
transportation review, to look at all various aspects of grain 
transportation including rail line abandonment.  What I found in 
our dealings with the railways is that they are very sensitive to 
the concerns of the hon. member, especially in his province of 
Saskatchewan, as we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, we on this side of the House agreed to fund 
facilitators to help small communities that want to take over 
these branch lines. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian Transportation Act took any decisions about 
the railways out of the Liberal government's hands.  Since those 
changes took effect the track record of the railways has been a 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister today stand up for western farmers and demand 
a standstill in rail line abandonments now?  Will he back that 
demand with legislation if necessary? 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the policy of 1996 has been very successful because 
five times as many short lines have been created as have been 
abandoned.  That shows the policy is working.  Smaller companies 
can take over these small tracks, make them economically viable 
and serve the interests of producers and especially farmers in 
Saskatchewan.

“The report describes managers as autocratic, abrasive,

It does come down to attitude and at the end of the day the 
health and safety of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness to the member for Rosemont, and out of respect for

realizing that he was breaking any Standing Order.  When he 
became aware that he had done so, he immediately consulted the 
House's Director General of Financial Services, who confirmed 
that he had indeed breached the Standing Orders.  The member for 
Rosemont therefore undertook to pay, and did in fact pay, the 
costs of the mailing, including postage, envelopes and

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
pointing out that today, as we are debating the estimates, when 
we think the most important issue facing parliament is the 
spending of the public purse, the approving of taxation and the 
spending of $145 billion of taxpayer money, we would take that 
very seriously in our debates in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate news is that we treat the whole process as a 
completely perfunctory process where we have the estimates tabled 
by the President of the Treasury Board and automatically refer 
them to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we know that the committees do not take their work 
seriously as far as the estimates, the reason being they know 
they make no difference.  Never in the last 25 years have we in 
this House been able to change one single penny of the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, the committees say why should they bother 
knocking their heads trying to introduce changes to the 
estimates, spending the money more intelligently, spending the 
money on issues that are more important to Canadians.  The 
problem is this government is not prepared to listen and previous 
governments have not been prepared to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the President of the Treasury Board tables his estimates 
around March 1, he takes the arrogant approach and says he 
basically has the approval of the House even though here we are 
on June 9 voting on these amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big affronts is that we are dealing only with is $42 
billion of expenditures. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other $103 billion was approved by statute some time in the 
past.  When I say some time in the past, that could have been 50 
years ago.  It was the last time that we in this House had the 
opportunity to pass judgement on a program that required 
expenditure of taxpayer funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation is passed, that is called statutory 
authority and the government never has to come back to this House 
again to seek its approval to spend the money on these programs 
as the costs balloon up and up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a huge affront to this place and to the Canadian people 
that later on today we will be voting on only $42 billion of a 
total expenditure of $145 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other affront is the way the rules of this House have been 
organized to ensure the government gets its way.  When we look at 
the normal process in the business of the House, a bill is 
introduced which can be amended and the amendment can be amended 
again. We first vote on the subamendment and if that passes, it 
amends the main amendment.  If we vote on that and it passes, 
then we have amended the piece of legislation. We will vote on 
the legislation and if that passes, the amendments have caused a 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We start at the bottom and work our way up.  Not so with the 
estimates because as soon as we table a motion that we want to 
reduce the estimates, in essence if we wish to amend the 
estimates, we do not vote on the amendment, we do not vote on any 
subamendment. The first thing the rules say is that when we put 
forth an amendment, that causes the President of the Treasury 
Board to move concurrence in his main amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at the 1998-99 estimates, parts one and two, page 
1-44. Their total expenditure under Vote No. 1 is $867,573,000. 
If we want to reduce the amount of money the Department of Health 
is going to spend by even $10, that will cause the President of 
the Treasury Board to put forth a motion to concur in the total 
expenditure of $867,573,000 and the House has to vote to say we 
are going to give the department that full amount of money.  If 
that vote were to fail, the department would get no money and 
therefore our motion to reduce would be irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is impossible to defeat a motion on the main 
estimates, because it is preceded by a concurrence motion.  That 
is why the rules have been turned upside down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use health as an example because in the public accounts 
committee some months ago we dealt with the Department of Health 
and its supply of services to natives and aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found, for example, and this is no fault on the aboriginals 
but certainly every fault on the Department of Health, that they 
were approving payment of bills submitted to them by dentists and 
so on in amounts 40 times greater than the provincial amount 
approved for these procedures.  A multiple of 40 is the mark-up 
that some dentists have been putting on some treatment, sending 
the bill to the federal government for payment and it was being 
paid without even a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial governments have been trying to husband their 
health resources and scrutinizing the bills and saying they feel 
this is about the amount they are prepared to pay for this 
procedure. For the federal government there is no limit to what 
it is prepared to pay, even 40 times the regular amount. 
If we wanted to take $55,000 out of health in the estimates today 
because we should be paying only the appropriate amounts rather 
than these exorbitant amounts, it would cause the President of 
the Treasury Board to move a motion to concur in the entire 
amount. Once we have voted for the entire amount, how can we turn 
around and say that we want to change our minds and vote for 
something less?  It makes an ass of the system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to use something that may be close to unparliamentary 
language, but I am talking about the system, not a member, 
although that sometimes is open for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use another example, which is the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.  Again I think about our 
committee, the public accounts committee, where the auditor 
general pointed out to us a problem that he found regarding a 
water treatment system on one reserve in the province of Ontario. 
The water treatment plant, according to the consultant, could be 
fixed for $26,000.  But by the time the job was done, and it was 
not done properly, the bill was over $2.3 million.  There is no 
control.  If we wanted to remove that amount from the estimates 
we could not do it.  That is a serious problem that we have with 
the main estimates as they are presented and with the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance department will spend approximately $45 billion a 
year on interest on our national debt.  Because that is deemed to 
be statutory spending, as I referred to earlier, we cannot vote 
on one single penny of that $45 billion.  Surely it is the House 
that is supreme and it is the House that has control of the 
public purse.  We thought we had control of the public purse, but 
obviously the House does not have control of the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, my question is:  Where do we go from here?  The good 
news is that there is an answer.  The answer lies, in my opinion, 
in the report that was tabled in the last parliament, called 
“The Business of Supply:  Completing the Circle of Control”. It 
was an all-party committee chaired by the deputy whip of the 
government.  It dealt with a lot of the problems I have raised 
here today.  This report, which one eminent person called the 
best report on parliamentary procedure in 50 years, deserves a 
great deal of consideration by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that 52 recommendations were made.  I will just 
mention one or two of them to give hon. members an idea of how 
“The Business of Supply:  Completing the Circle of Control” 
report dealt with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recommended that a committee be set up to monitor and review 
the estimates and the supply process.  That is just a simple 
recommendation to say this asinine procedure of putting the cart 
before the horse should stop and we should get it back to the 
right way.  That way the House will be able to express its 
opinion on how to change the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It said that the standing orders should be amended to create a 
standing committee on the estimates with a mandate to monitor and 
review the estimates, the supply process and related matters and 
that the work of the standing committees on the estimates be 
referred to them.  That way we would be able to ensure that the 
committees that deal with the estimates would be dealing with 
them in an appropriate fashion and bringing back to the House 
appropriate recommendations based on all parties' opinions as to 
what they thought of the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say that a standing committee on the estimates 
should be specifically empowered to report to the House on the 
estimates and on the supply process at least on an annual basis. 
We want to ensure, again, bringing back to the House the 
authority and the primacy that the House is the granter of supply 
to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee went on to recommend that the standing committee 
on the estimates be authorized to undertake periodic reviews of 
the mechanism used by crown corporations to report to parliament 
and the adequacy of the means by which they receive 
appropriations from parliament.  That is an excellent 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to talk about how in this day and age, when we know 
that people want to spend all of the budget rather than achieve 
their objectives within budget, the parliamentary committees 
should be allowed to move up to 5% from one allocation to 
another. 
That makes common sense today when we hear so much about wastage 
and balloon budget spending toward the end of the fiscal year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Motion No. 1, through which the President of 
the Treasury Board seeks to grant a vote of over $193 million to 
the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to inform the House that the Bloc Quebecois opposes the 
vote proposed by the President of the Treasury Board for the 
Department of Justice, for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the opening of the parliamentary session in September, the 
government's justice policies have often been criticized by 
opposition parties and by Canadians and Quebeckers, who are 
tired of seeing their tax dollars being used for objectives that 
do not meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been turning a deaf ear for a long time. It 
runs the country as it pleases, without listening to what 
taxpayers have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and his Minister of Finance are the only ones 
to set priorities, and these priorities do not at all serve the 
interests of those most in need. Because of the government's way 
of managing, an increasing number of our fellow citizens have 
difficulty making ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's priorities are very poorly defined. The 
measures taken by the Department of Justice are a perfect 
illustration of the Liberals' bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, by going ahead with its reference to the Supreme 
Court of Canada, in spite of all the opposition to such a 
measure, the Liberal government showed that it is prepared to 
blindly spend public money, against the interests of Canadians 
and particularly of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers unanimously opposed the decision of the federal 
Minister of Justice because, among other reasons, the issue does 
not concern the federal government but Quebeckers, who alone 
must decide on their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reference to the supreme court is a prime example of how 
public money is wasted. What are we to think of the comments 
made by the Minister of Justice, to the effect that her 
government's representations to the supreme court are useless? 
Indeed, while the lawyer representing the federal government was 
pleading before the Supreme Court of Canada, the Minister of 
Justice said that, in any case, this exercise was useless. She 
said the process was unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the minister is quite right in saying that the nine 
judges appointed to the supreme court will be unable to resolve 
the problem of Quebec sovereignty, because it is up to Quebec, 
in all legitimacy, to decide on its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By admitting to the media that the reference is pointless from 
the constitutional point of view, the Minister of Justice was 
adding insult to injury.  In addition to denying the right of 
the people of Quebec to self-determination, this reference is a 
total waste of public funds, and the federal government ought to 
be ashamed. This is one of the reasons for our opposition to the 
$193 million-plus the President of Treasury Board has given to 
the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it must not be thought that the funds committed to 
this political waste are coming solely from the coffers of the 
Department of Justice.  People must be aware that the Privy 
Council, and the departments of Canadian Heritage and of 
Finance, are all very actively involved in the reference. 
We must not, therefore, be surprised to learn that the bill is a 
lot stiffer than the Minister of Justice suggests in her answers 
to questions in committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding of the reference to the supreme court comes not only 
from Justice, but from other departments as well.  It is 
virtually impossible to know which departments have spent money 
on the reference to the supreme court, but we do know that 
millions of dollars have been spent on it.  Members will 
therefore understand that, when we are presented with a bill for 
$193 million, the Bloc Quebecois is against it, knowing what the 
money is going for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court reference on Quebec's right to be the only one 
to decide its future proves to us, without a shadow of a doubt, 
that the Liberal government holds the democratic rights of 
Quebeckers in complete contempt. 
Unfortunately, the sombre list of Liberal nonsense does not end 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reference is not the only example of the profound malaise on 
the Liberal benches.  In introducing her strategy for the 
renewal of the youth justice system recently, the Minister of 
Justice demonstrated again that her government was light years 
removed from the needs of its people, and especially light years 
away from what Quebec wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform of the Young Offenders Act, which, according to the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, is to calm 
misinformed public opinion, is another example of poor 
management of public funds.  As the primary stakeholders in the 
field of juvenile crime pointed out, the Young Offenders Act is 
sufficient. 
It needs only be properly applied.  The problem is not the act, 
as I have said, but its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, whose youth crime rate is the lowest in Canada, sets an 
example for all Canadians in its application of the law. 
Instead of encouraging the other provinces to follow Quebec's 
example, the minister embarked on a costly reform that will not 
serve society's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of following Quebec's lead and intervening in the 
reintegration and rehabilitation of young offenders, the 
Minister of Justice has opted for stigmatization and easy votes 
in western Canada.  Quite honestly, this is not a judicious use 
of public funds, of the taxes paid by Quebeckers and Canadians 
alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister took the easy way out by ignoring the advice of 
experts in this area as well as that of her predecessor. The 
minister's predecessor, another Liberal justice minister, was 
also involved in this, but he did not share the current 
minister's opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As evidenced by the following remarks, the current Minister of 
Health and former justice minister repeatedly spoke in favour of 
the existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the people listening to us, I shall quote 
him. The minister said “The government continues to believe the 
youth justice system is a valid one and supports it. 
The Young Offenders Act as it exists at present is more than 
sufficient, if properly administered, to deal with juvenile 
justice in the country.” That is what the then Minister of 
Justice, now health minister, said at the time about the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the current minister is nevertheless going to legislate on 
the basis of an unfounded public perception fostered by the 
Reform Party. In addition, the minister indulges in unjustified 
spending, while her government owes the Government of Quebec $77 
million for the implementation of the Young Offenders Act. The 
Quebec justice minister repeatedly asked that the costs 
associated with implementing the act in Quebec be reimbursed to 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is home to approximately 25% of all young Canadians, 
while in terms of funding it receives only 18% of the federal 
budget for implementing the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally questioned the minister on this, given how unfair 
this is to Quebec, which has been requesting funding for years, 
and in light of the fact that the predecessor of the current 
Minister of Justice all but admitted this money was owed to 
Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT62"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT62"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he is asked to justify this imbalance, his response in 
committee is that Quebec got less because it had placed the 
emphasis on rehabilitating young offenders and these measures 
were less costly than the measures involving incarceration which 
were used by other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this answer rather fascinating. Since the objective of 
the Young Offenders Act is reintegration into society, I would 
have thought the province best applying the act would get more 
money, but the opposite is true.  In Quebec we are penalized 
because we are implementing an act passed by the federal 
government; however, the western provinces, which have focussed 
on structures and on locking people up, will get more money, 
because that approach is more costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something illogical about this, and members will 
understand that, when one sees the Department of Justice 
spending the $193 million it will be getting via supply, why the 
Bloc Quebecois cannot agree with this, given that these monies 
are mismanaged and misspent by a minister concerned only with 
raising her profile and getting easy votes in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice's strategy on youth crime can, 
therefore, be summarized as follows.  It sets up a new, 
expensive, and inadequate program; it turns a deaf ear to 
Quebec, which is implementing the legislation properly; it 
refuses to reimburse Quebec for doing so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I just wonder if you would perhaps check if we have quorum or 
not. After this morning's debate, I am concerned about what is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just to be clear. Is 
the hon. member for West Nova requesting a quorum call? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes I am calling quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have quorum. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I invite the Liberals to 
stick around and listen.  What I have to say is extremely 
interesting.  I extend that invitation to the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister in particular. It would be worth her 
while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to what I was saying before I was interrupted by the 
quorum call, which incidentally the government, and not the 
opposition, is responsible for maintaining—if a quorum is 
called for, it is because there are not enough government MPs in 
the House, and this needs to be explained because people are not 
aware of it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government MPs fail to understand is that it is up to 
them to maintain a presence in this House.  They are the ones 
who have to maintain a quorum, not the Bloc Quebecois, not the 
Conservatives, not the NDP.  They are the ones in power, and 
they are the ones who have to be here if the House is to keep 
operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said—they cut me off in the best part and they are annoying 
me—the Minister of Justice's strategy for juvenile crime may be 
summarized as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, my colleague should not leave but listen.  She sets 
up an expensive and unsatisfactory new plan; she turns a deaf 
ear to remarks by Quebec, which properly applies the law; she 
refuses to reimburse Quebec for applying the law and, in the 
end, she is making political points in the West.  Once again, 
the Liberal government should be ashamed of the way it manages 
its priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of spending most of this money on unlawful political 
forays such as the reference to the Supreme Court of Canada and 
unsuitable programs such as the reform of the Young Offenders 
Act and all the programs involving young offenders, the federal 
government should respond to the desperate needs of the people 
and to the legitimate expectations of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when will the government agree to make the 
necessary changes to the Freedom of Information Act, among 
others?  How many reports by the commissioner of information 
have to be tabled in this House before the Minister of Justice 
agrees to reform a law which lacks the teeth to ensure access to 
information in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the information commissioner, who says “After 15 
years, the Freedom of Information Act must be consolidated and 
modernized”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say “The blame lies neither with fate nor with the 
law, it lies with the government and officials who prefer to 
complain of the demands of access to information rather than 
espouse its noble objectives, who prefer to deny the public the 
information it paid for with its taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government spent carefully, perhaps we might see an 
access to information act that would give Canadians and 
Quebeckers the transparency democracy requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is strange, when one looks at past <I>Debates</I>, is that when 
the Liberals were the opposition, they made comments, for 
instance about the Access to Information Act, to the effect that 
it did not meet their needs, that it did not give access to all 
documents, that things were being concealed.  They said that it 
was not strict enough, or this or that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are on the other side.  They could amend the Access to 
Information Act, to reflect their criticisms while in 
opposition.  But when one is on the gravy train, when one is 
busy concealing all manner of things from the public, and when 
one is in government, there is no desire to change things. That 
is where the Liberals are at now.  They are hiding behind a law 
that needs changing, even the access to information commissioner 
says so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also say a great deal about all the unnecessary 
expenditures, or more particularly what the department is not 
doing and ought to be doing, with the $193 million or so that 
will be voted to it this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, it could introduce a money laundering bill. 
Why does the federal government not spend some money on looking 
at the possibility of legislation to tighten things up so that 
Canada is no longer the hub of money laundering?  Billions pass 
through Quebec, Ontario and the other provinces for that very 
purpose, and the federal government sits there with its arms 
folded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says “Isn't it terrible about all that money laundering” but 
does nothing.  The opposition has often asked questions on this 
and the members of the government do nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois did manage, through its efforts, to push the 
government across the way into introducing anti-gang legislation. 
I see the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve who worked hard 
with me on this issue in the Standing Committee on Justice, when 
we were the official opposition. We managed to get the Liberal 
government to make concessions, although not as many as we would 
have liked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to give a little over $193 million to the 
Department of Justice, why not add certain provisions to the 
anti-gang legislation, so we can go after gang leaders? As we 
know, all those who implement this legislation say that it does 
not allow them to go after the leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the government used its money for legitimate 
purposes. It is time it admitted to making some bad choices. It 
is time it recognized that things are done differently in Quebec 
and listened to Quebeckers' concerns about, among other things, 
the Young Offenders Act, which is a very simple piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It costs a lot more in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> One can see the ignorance of members 
opposite. One can see the ignorance of government members who 
say that it costs more in Quebec to implement the Young 
Offenders Act. This is not true. Look at the figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if you take into account the outstanding claim that the 
federal government is refusing to pay, Quebec gets less money 
per young offender than any other Canadian province. For a total 
of 10,000 young offenders, Quebec is getting eight times less 
than western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do not understand is that the person who made these 
comments is a member from Quebec. I think he should work harder 
at protecting the interests of his constituents. The member for 
Beauce should be ashamed of distorting the facts, as he is now 
doing, and not adequately protecting his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should rise and tell the Liberals that it does not make sense 
to use public money the way they do, including the $193 million 
allocated to the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish the Liberals who are listening would be 
more perceptive. They look concerned. I get the impression that 
I taught them a few things today. They should take a closer look 
at the budget before voting on the business of supply tonight. I 
do hope they will at least check on what the Minister of Justice 
will do with this $193 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that Quebec members—and many of them are listening—will 
also keep an eye on the Minister of Justice to stop her 
from spending Quebeckers' money on things such as references to 
the Supreme Court of Canada, because Quebeckers have had enough 
of this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to my hon. colleague with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The removal of $193,805,000 would completely remove the client 
services and the law and policy administration. I recall earlier 
this year that the Bloc Quebecois pleaded with the government for 
help with motorcycle gangs like the Posse, the Rock Machine and 
Hell's Angels.  Will my hon. colleague still be asking for that 
kind of help?  Where would the money come from to fund that 
resource? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, in a sense, I answered that 
question when I commented on the amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member has been following the Bloc Quebecois' arguments 
since 1993 regarding the criminal justice system, I will not be 
telling him anything he does not already know when I say  that, 
when it comes to justice and the application of the Criminal 
Code, the federal government should simply withdraw.  It should 
negotiate with the provinces so that they can recover full 
jurisdiction over the criminal justice system and all criminal 
courts.  This should come entirely under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present situation makes no sense.  The federal government 
passes laws, but does not apply them.  That is left to the 
provinces, because the administration of justice is a provincial 
matter. 
Perhaps back in 1867 the Fathers of Confederation—or is it 
federation, because the federalists opposite use a different 
jargon and cannot agree on whether it is a federation or a 
confederation, but that is not my problem, given the Bloc 
Quebecois' objective—thought it would work well.  But, as it 
happens, it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it happens, there is extremely expensive overlap and 
duplication. The federal government should withdraw and return 
full jurisdiction to the National Assembly and the other 
provinces so that they can have full control over the criminal 
justice system and all related matters.  The $193 million not 
spent by the federal government could thus be transferred to the 
provinces so that they can have jurisdiction and administer the 
criminal justice system properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give another very recent example.  In committee, we are 
studying provisions that would create a kind of victims' 
assistance bureau, or something of the sort. 
A number of provinces, including Quebec, already have a law 
known as the victims of crime act.  We have an office to help 
victims of crime, and compensation is given to these victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants to legislate in this area and to 
parallel Quebec, because we already have this.  I have heard 
from representatives of British Columbia the same thing I have 
heard in Quebec.  They do not want the federal government 
intervening in an area of provincial jurisdiction and investing 
money in programs paralleling those already existing in the 
provinces.  They want it to give the money to the provinces so 
they can spend it where it would do the most good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what I mean when I say I oppose the appropriations worth $193 
million we will be voting on is that the money is badly used and 
badly spent. 
If there is one area where the provinces are more competent and 
closer to the people in order to better respond to their 
expectations, it is the area of the Criminal Code and related 
legislation, and the provinces should have full jurisdiction 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question the hon. member raised is that if $193 
million is cut, there will be no more money to go after the 
motorcycle gangs.  In this regard, I will speak to you of 
Quebec.  In Quebec, the Parti Quebecois government—first under 
Mr. Parizeau, then under Mr. Bouchard, assumed its full 
responsibilities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They created some highly competent squads with excellent 
results.  The people across the floor may well laugh. The hon. 
member for Beauce may well not know his history, or what is 
going on in the National Assembly, but I think that where the 
anti-gang legislation is concerned, if the Government of Quebec 
had not acted on it, if the Government of Quebec had not helped 
the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. members over there would never have 
had the political courage to listen to what many Quebeckers were 
calling for in connection with legislation against motorcycle 
gangs.  The Minister of Justice decided to act because of the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I understand that the Liberal MPs from Quebec do not 
want to hear that. 
They are ignorant of their history, as we have often said, but 
today we have one more proof of it.

sure that you will join with me in commenting on the eloquence 
of the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, as he spoke with a 
depth one very rarely gets from that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask one question of my colleague, the hon. 
member for Berthier—Montcalm.  Can he tell us why it is important 
at this point in history and in the present situation with 
organized crime, to have MPs like those in the Bloc Quebecois 
able to stand up and propose concrete measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague referred to money laundering. This is cause for 
great concern.  I would like my colleague, with his knowledge in 
this area, to raise the awareness of others, the government 
members in particular, who are a bit slow to assimilate anything 
new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, money laundering is indeed 
a major industry in Canada. According to police officers and 
experts in the field—and the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve 
can correct me if I am wrong—between $225 and $250 billion are 
laundered in Canada every year. It should come as no surprise 
that Canada is known internationally as a haven for money 
laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Quebecker, this does not make me proud. We are working hard 
to achieve our goal but, for the time being, Quebec is still 
part of Canada. Every year, between $225 and $250 billion are 
laundered in our country. This bothers me a bit. We repeatedly 
asked this government to introduce legislation to make it harder 
to launder money in Canada, since it is done all too easily 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its electoral platform, the Bloc Quebecois suggested a very 
simple idea which the government could implement immediately. 
It could even be implemented before we adjourn for the summer. 
Canada is about the only country in the world with bank notes of 
$1,000. No other country has $1,000 bills. Why not stop 
producing these $1,000 bank notes? Who in this House walks 
around with ten bills of $1,000 in his pockets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Raise your hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Come on, raise your hand. There are not 
many Liberals and there is no one on our side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, do you have ten bills of $1,000 in your pockets? 
No? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, $1,000 bank notes are used almost exclusively for 
transfers, for buying land, or by organized crime members. 
Not many people walk around with $1,000 bank notes in their 
pockets. I think that bills of $100, $50 and $20 adequately meet 
the needs of Canadians, particularly since we make extensive use 
of credit cards. There is no need to carry large amounts of 
money in our pockets.

one.

this, to say the least, odd deposit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian heritage may seem like a vague term to most Canadians. 
However, when they begin to understand the areas which heritage 
covers it has tremendous importance to each and every one of us. 
When we talk about the heritage department we are talking about 
the Canada Council, the CBC, the Canadian Film Development 
Corporation, all of our libraries and museums, the art gallery, 
the CRTC, the NFB and all of the community grants and supports to 
individual artists.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The floor must then

Department of Justice from conducting its statutory

responsibilities for the legal affairs of the government as a 
whole and to provide legal services to individual departments and 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, these funds will enable the department to 
continue to meet its responsibilities under three lines:  one, 
the provision of services to the government; two, policy 
development and administration of the law; and three, the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice serves the government in various ways. 
It drafts all government legislation. It provides legal advice 
to all departments and represents the government in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the timely provision of the services they need, most 
department incorporate legal services in their departmental 
headquarters. These are the legal services falling under the 
justice department, in charge of providing legal advice, court 
representation and legal assistance on all legal matters that 
concern the various departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A network of regional offices provides most court representation 
services. These offices also provide legal advice to meet the 
needs of the government and its agencies in terms of regional 
operations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three main areas where the Department of Justice has 
lead responsibility:  criminal justice policy, family and youth 
law policy arising out of marriage and divorce; and human rights 
policy. The department also has the lead role in constitutional 
law, administrative law, aboriginal justice, access to 
information and privacy law, official languages law and the 
government's mandate for courts and judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice and her department are responsible for 
over 40 statutes, many with major policy ramifications.  The 
department must anticipate future legal and societal trends in 
order to provide timely, strategic and effective responses; to 
provide leadership both to the government and the public in 
understanding the changing legal world; and to provide guidance 
in achieving governmental objectives in a manner consistent with 
fundamental rights and freedoms, fairness, equality, 
accessibility, and effective and efficient legal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet this challenge and to ensure Canadians have a fair, 
efficient, accessible and inclusive national system of justice, 
the department provides a range of services relating to the 
planning, co-ordination, development, promotion and 
implementation of justice related policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice 1998-99 report on plans and priorities 
shows that the department is moving forward with a balanced and 
focused policy agenda which responds to the issues Canadians have 
identified as important to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine some of the areas the department is currently 
working on.  One is the crime prevention strategy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General 
announced a new phase in the national community safety and crime 
prevention strategy, whose budget has increased from $3 million 
to $32 million a year. This strategy is designed to help 
communities address the root causes of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the justice department in this new phase of the 
program will be to promote the exchange of information between 
communities on effective crime prevention measures, help federal 
departments co-ordinate their efforts and establish relationships 
based on partnership between the governments, NGOs and the 
private sector. To this end, the justice department will have to 
call upon the interest, expertise, ideas and contribution of all 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to youth justice, on which the members of the 
opposition had much to say today.  The Minister of Justice 
recognizes that Canadians' confidence in the youth justice system 
has been shaken in recent years. She announced a few weeks ago a 
youth justice strategy that would lead to the replacement of the 
Young Offenders Act. The reform would ensure that violent young 
offenders would face meaningful consequences for their crimes. It 
would also provide new ways of approaching youth justice that 
give young people the opportunity to turn their lives around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice does not believe, as the Reform Party 
does, that putting more kids in jail for longer periods is the 
solution.  This is too simplistic an approach, as are most of the 
Reform Party's approaches on justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent youth will face custody but jail terms are often 
counterproductive for the vast majority of youth who are 
non-violent. The strategy involves looking at alternative 
approaches, approaches that specifically aim to instil the values 
of responsibility and accountability in youth. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treatment accorded victims of crime is another of the 
Minister of Justice's priorities.  The work done by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights should provide the 
Department of Justice with useful information to find ways to 
guarantee victims at least two things: access to information and 
protection under the law.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night the Minister of Justice visited a town hall meeting 
that I held in my riding with the assistance of the hon. member 
for Mount Royal and other members of the Quebec caucus on the 
government side.  Despite what the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm said, most people who were present at this 
meeting, although the Quebec system is a good one, still found a 
lack of funding for a lot of the resources that victims need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we are attempting to do through this type of 
consultation with Quebeckers and all other Canadians across the 
country is to ensure that there is collaboration between federal 
and provincial governments and to ensure there are services 
available for victims.  Certainly last night that was not the 
portrait presented in Quebec in terms of the system in place in 
Quebec which lacks funding.  We encourage all members of the 
House of Commons to told town hall meetings. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is looking to resolve victims' frustration by 
trying to improve access to appropriate information, especially 
as concerns the co-ordination and sharing of information on 
victims' rights and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has asked the department to examine the 
possibility—and, I repeat, possibility, one of the ones on the 
table, nothing is written yet—of creating a central office to 
assist victims.  However, she never said, and reference was made 
yesterday at my town hall meeting, that this would duplicate 
something that already exists in the provinces. 
There is no question of that.  It is only one of the things 
raised by the agencies working with victims.  We are looking at 
all the options.  Everything is on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for legal protection, counsel with the Department of Justice 
recently defended the constitutional validity of the new 
provisions of the Criminal Code aimed at limiting public access 
to the medical records of plaintiffs in proceedings involving 
sexual offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is also looking into the possibility of amending 
the Criminal Code to respond to their concerns by, among other 
things, permitting greater use of victims' statements. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing is another favourite topic of the 
opposition.  The Department of Justice is examining on an ongoing 
basis areas which are controversial.  One of those areas is 
conditional sentencing.  Since September 1996 when judges have 
been able to grant conditional sentences over 18,000 such 
sentences have been imposed.  The vast majority of these orders 
were considered appropriate dispositions.  However some decisions 
have caused concern and controversy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons they have caused concern and controversy is 
that they are constantly being exploited by members of the Reform 
Party.  Sensationalizing the most violent criminals in our 
society seems to be the game of the day.  Fearmongering is also 
part of Reform's strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice is working closely with the provinces 
and territories to monitor conditional sentences at the request 
of the attorneys general of all provinces.  This monitoring work 
is important to ensure that any reform to the law is based on 
real facts, not on perceptions based on media reporting or 
fearmongering on the part of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very recently the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear appeals 
in five cases involving persons who received conditional 
sentences of imprisonment.  The appeals are expected to provide 
clarification and guidance in the use of conditional sentences in 
cases involving violence resulting in death or injury or other 
such cases.  The department has also been asked by the Minister 
of Justice to consider the development of common guidelines that 
would assist prosecutors in deciding when to seek conditional 
sentences.  We have acted despite the opposition saying that we 
do not act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a constant debate in the House on firearms 
control.  We must never forget that opposition members oppose any 
type of gun control system in Canada, even though 80% of 
Canadians support a universal registration system for shotguns 
and rifles.  The opposition is out of touch with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective implementation of a firearms control program is among 
the highest priorities of the Department of Justice.  The 
regulations required to implement the system have been made 
following the scrutiny of both houses of parliament.  The system 
will be functional by October 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration together with licensing and the other aspects of 
the Firearms Act are aimed at facilitating the continued 
enjoyment of their sport by responsible owners using safe 
practices.  This will decrease the risk of gratuitous violence 
and will promote a culture that recognizes safety and 
responsibility.  We do not want children killing children in 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The new firearms legislation is a positive effective contributor 
to the range of criminal and social measures put in place by the 
government to further a safe and secure society.  The gun control 
legislation has the support of a large majority, as high as 80% 
and as high as 72% in some rural areas, and is a reflection of a 
country of peaceful communities, safe streets and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning administration it is a third business line of the 
Department of Justice.  It encompasses the range of corporate 
management and administrative services required to support the 
department's program delivery and internal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I believe the department is managing its resources 
responsibly.  The department's policy work will have an impact on 
the confidence of Canadians in their justice system. In addition 
the role of the Department of Justice in advising the government 
on legal issues—and let us not forget it is the legal department 
for all government departments—and in conducting litigation on 
behalf of the crown is vital to the proper functioning of the 
Canadian government and Canadian society as a whole.  The 
department should be given the means to conduct its 
responsibilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
always amazed when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice speaks in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is given the opportunity to bring forward the programs of 
government and the benefits that it believes will flow from those 
programs.  She either seems to be uncomfortable or lacking 
confidence in her own position or in her government's programs 
and legislation because she always has to take up much of the 
time simply attacking the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary talked about the gun control program 
and said that 80% of the people supported the hideous, ill 
conceived Bill C-68.  If that were the case we would not have 
four provincial governments having to answer to their electorate 
just as the federal government will have to do.  If 80% of voters 
were telling their provincial governments to support the bill, we 
would not have four provinces and two territories supporting the 
constitutional challenge that is occurring now before the appeal 
court of Alberta.  I will get back to this point when I speak in 
the House on the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about spending more money.  The minister 
announced the expenditure of $32 million in the area of crime 
prevention and so on.  However, when the justice minister and her 
officials appeared before the standing committee on the estimates 
I asked this question of the minister: “Why is it that the 
province of Manitoba is considering litigation to get out from 
under the administration of the Young Offenders Act?  Why is that 
happening based upon the fact that the federal government is 
reneging on its cost sharing program?” I also asked the minister 
where that stood and if there was more money on the table to 
bring Manitoba back onside.  At that time the answer was no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of additional expenditure in the area of justice, has 
new money been offered to the province of Manitoba to get it 
onside and to get it to continue to administer the Young 
Offenders Act, or is it still heading for court to get out from 
under the administration of the Young Offenders Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take offence at the 
suggestion that we are trying to dodge our responsibilities in 
the House, be it the minister or be it myself as parliamentary 
secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the question the member asked, the $32 million put 
forward by the government was the crime prevention initiative to 
ensure community involvement in terms of crime prevention.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government, unlike the Reform Party, believe that we 
have to start early in order to prevent crime.  Jail is not the 
answer for children.  Nor is whipping, as one member would like 
us to believe.  Nor is caning, as another members would like us 
to believe.  We should take the $32 million and sit down with the 
provinces, the municipalities and the private sector to come up 
with effective crime prevention initiatives across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be ongoing negotiations with the municipal 
governments, the provincial governments and all other players, be 
they private or community based organizations, to ensure that we 
prevent crime and do not continue to spend as much money as we 
spend right now in terms of incarcerating people.  That is 
totally different from what the Reform Party would like us to 
believe.

pleased to take a few moments to exchange views with my 
colleague, the member for Ahuntsic, who I hear is very involved 
in the school elections, but we will have another chance to talk 
about that.  I nonetheless wish her good luck on Sunday, because 
she could find it rough going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister tell us a little about what her government 
plans to do with respect to the Canadian Human Rights Act?  I 
have its latest report here.  I have always been extremely 
interested in the whole human rights issue, and we are urgently 
calling for an overhaul of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a piece of legislation that has not been amended, except 
obviously for the addition of an 11th prohibited ground of 
discrimination last year.  It cries out for an overhaul.  Does 
the minister agree with those who think that poverty is a 
growing reality in Canada?  Did members know that there have 
never been so many poor people in Canada?  I can see, of course, 
that you are thinking that there is a direct link with the 
terrible cuts to transfers made by this government and you are 
not mistaken.  The fact is that the income of approximately 40% 
of Canadians and Quebeckers is below the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What connection does this have with the Canadian Human Rights 
Act?  The connection is that we should give economic rights and 
that we should never allow discrimination based on social 
status. 
May I remind you that in France, the mother country of us all 
and the elder daughter of the Church, there is an obligation for 
the human rights commission to review all acts, and to advise on 
the impact legislation passed by the French government will have 
on poverty. Might I ask the hon. parliamentary secretary, whose 
sensitivity to this issue I am well aware of, whether she 
subscribes to such measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, does she acknowledge that her government is particularly 
clam-like, if not jellyfish-like, lacking in scope or ambition, 
when it comes to fighting organized crime?  The hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, a rising star in the Quebec firmament, has 
clearly pointed out to us that a meaningful policy against crime 
requires a number of significant measures that are lacking at 
present. 
Of course, there is all the business of money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no great expectations of the parliamentary secretary's 
answers to the questions, but if she would agree to cast a 
little light on this question, I would be grateful to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, can she tell us who she plans to support in the 
school board elections coming up this Sunday, June 14, in 
Montreal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, we are not discussing 
school elections here.  When a member abuses his privileges here 
in this House, it is my duty, as a member of this House, to 
point it out, even when he has repaid the money, because he 
still committed the act.  Political parties do not enter into 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never been involved in school elections.  The Bloc gets 
involved in every one.  Every time one is held, there they are. 
The former member for Rosemont would get involved, the leader of 
the Bloc has been involved and now the new member for Rosemont. 
Three times they have got involved.  They are involved in school 
elections. 
I was not involved, I simply pointed out to all Canadians, 
including the people of Rosemont who complained to me, that the 
member for Rosemont sent a letter in support of MEMO, the gang 
of separatists in Quebec, to everyone.

House.  I think we are in favour and that we can consider the 
suggestion by the Bloc justice critic on money laundering.

legislation here.  We are therefore well aware of the problem to 
be resolved.

to mention to the hon. member that the Quebec charter contains

the possibility of adding another condition to the Canadian 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize as a government that poverty is an important aspect 
of crime in this country.  If people live in poverty, aspects of 
their lives may lead them into crime.  This is why we invested 
$32 million in crime prevention—in order to help people and 
prevent crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
understand I have 20 minutes to address the estimates. 
The hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the justice minister refused to answer my question 
regarding the position that Manitoba is in right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there more money placed on the table to keep that government 
on side in terms of administering the Young Offenders Act?  I 
asked that question very clearly.  I repeated it and she refused 
to answer it.  That is the type of response we get from this 
government on very vital issues.  Yet she can stand in her place 
and criticize, scorn and mock the opposition, all opposition 
members, including the official opposition, that we have nothing 
good to say, nothing good to offer.  There is nothing over here 
worth consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when we ask her a straightforward question about a province 
struggling to administer a key component of the justice system 
what do we get from her?  Her answer is on the record.  My 
question is on the record and her non-answer is on the record. 
She ought to be ashamed of herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the motion we are debating now, Motion No. 1 moved by my hon. 
colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, I cannot support 
this motion because if passed it would mean that all funding 
would be eliminated within the solicitor general's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these motions were to pass we would effectively shut down the 
RCMP, the DNA databank, the RCMP external review committee, the 
National Parole Board and Correctional Service Canada. Although 
we have some serious concerns and reservations about these 
departments and the expenditures within, we cannot support 
completely shutting them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate this motion put forward by the hon. member because 
it does open the avenue for the debate I think is very necessary 
in this whole area of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not support certain expenditures under the solicitor 
general and we do not agree with particular expenditures of this 
government under justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is one area the Reform Party believes funding should 
remain constant in, with priorities being shifted.  The Reform 
Party would increase spending in areas such as community 
policing.  Our police forces are slowly diminishing to the 
detriment of public safety.  Thus we would propose increased 
transfers to the provinces to provide for more police on the 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We moved 200 RCMP officers to an international posting but we 
did not replace them.  Imagine the positive effect of having 200 
RCMP members wisely deployed across this country and the enormous 
deterrent they would have on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are making these types of decisions and expending this kind 
of funding to help internationally while at the same time 
reducing the effectiveness of our police forces and law 
enforcement agencies at home.  We question that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have proposed to reduce spending by $20,390,330 within the 
Department of Justice under grants and contributions.  This money 
has been allocated as a contribution to the provinces and 
territories for the firearms program.  Under the supplementary 
estimates I proposed the $87,467,000 allotted for the Canadian 
firearms registration system be reduced to $1.  It is no secret 
that the Reform Party is opposed to the expenditure of scarce 
dollars for the registration of riffles and shotguns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years we have been fighting long and hard to repeal Bill 
C-68 and its ill conceived firearms registry.  We are adamantly 
opposed to the costly bureaucratic registry because to date the 
government has failed to provide any statistical justification 
for registration.  The statistics used by the Department of 
Justice have caused significant controversy and concern among 
firearm owners, Canadians in general and specifically the 
Canadian Police Association since the release of a letter from 
the commissioner of the RCMP to the deputy minister of justice 
regarding his concern over the bogus use of RCMP statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of that letter from the RCMP commissioner's office 
dated July 21, 1997 to Mr. George Thompson, deputy minister of 
justice and deputy attorney general of Canada wherein he 
expresses his grave concern and the grave concern of the RCMP 
over the misuse of RCMP statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that, these statistics were placed in a document 
called “The Illegal Movement of Firearms In Canada”.  One 
example is on page 10 of the document, and there are many other 
examples in this document.  On page 10 is table III.  The top of 
the table states “Firearms Involved in Crime.  Type of Firearm 
Removed According to Offence”.  Then there are categories such 
as violent offences, rifles and shotguns, 915. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this first came to the public's attention we met with 
members of the firearms section of the justice department and 
also with a member of the RCMP.  It was admitted to members of 
parliament that this creates an erroneous perception that all the 
915 riffles and shotguns recovered in violent crimes, according 
to this table, was not accurate.  Many of those rifles and 
shotguns had never been used in the commission of a criminal 
offence.  They had been seized by police in other matters.  For 
example, they would stop a drug dealer and conduct an arrest.  He 
would have a rifle or a shotgun in the trunk of the car.  It had 
not been used in the commission of a crime. They would seize 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example given was they would attend a domestic dispute. 
Although the spouse had not been threatened by a firearm she felt 
that she had been threatened.  For safety reasons the police 
would seize the firearm in the house.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are using those kinds of statistics to justify what 
amounted to be an erroneous and false perception of the number of 
firearms used in the commission of criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst part about this is that this letter expressing the 
concern of the RCMP was dated July 21, 1997.  The Alberta court 
case, the constitutional challenge to Bill C-68, proceeded I 
think in November of that same year, a number of months 
afterwards.  In spite of the concerns raised here there were six 
affidavits filed by justice officials containing these same bogus 
statistics, creating a false representation of the number of 
firearms used in the commission of a criminal offence.  There we 
go. In the letter from the commissioner's office, concern is 
expressed that there was an improper and a false basis created to 
justify the creation of Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear there is not anyone in the House who does not 
support firearms control.  We have asked the former justice 
minister, now the health minister, we have asked all the 
proponents of that bill to please tell the House and the people 
of Canada how the registration of a rifle and shotgun will reduce 
the criminal use of those firearms.  Of course they were never 
able to do that. If they could have shown us something that we 
were unable to see of course they would have had our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that is a myth.  The registration of a rifle or 
shotgun will not reduce its criminal use.  The weapon of choice 
for the street criminal is still the handgun, which has been 
registered in this country for the last 64 years. It has not 
reduced the criminal use of that firearm, because the use of that 
firearm, by their own statistics, is on the rise, certainly over 
the 64 years since registration was put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the enormous cost contained within these 
estimates simply to administer, to set up the software, to get 
things ready for October 1, 1998, it is an unacceptable cost that 
ought to be going to crime prevention or it ought to be going to 
our DNA databank where it will have an impact on the commission 
of crime and there is a chance of reducing crime in certain 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the polls.  They quote the polls to support this 
erroneous, ill conceived piece of legislation.  After this bill 
came into effect we had the province of Manitoba go to the polls, 
the province of Saskatchewan and the province of Ontario. In 
every case the party that formed the government came out strongly 
and publicly against the registration and licensing portion of 
Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about polls, the most significant poll we can 
get is a poll where the issue is debated and the people have a 
vote.  That is exactly what happened in all three of those 
provinces.  To suggest that 80% of the people support that 
portion of this ill conceived bill is utter nonsense.  If that 
were the case we would not have Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan 
and Alberta risking their political future by taking the most 
obnoxious portion of the bill, the licensing and registration 
portion, to court on a constitutional challenge.  We would not 
have the two territories saying the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here a needless and useless piece of legislation and we 
are spending millions on it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that there are other areas in justice 
crying out for these types of resources which are being ignored. 
Why?  It is because the government has set itself on a path and 
will not change it in spite of evidence to the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government going to do?  The registration and 
licensing portion of that bill is not aimed at the criminals who 
use firearms, it is aimed at the law-abiding gun owner.  If 
someone deliberately and knowingly refuses or neglects to 
register their .22, what is the penalty they will pay under the 
bill?  The maximum penalty is 10 years in prison.  Is that not 
wonderful?  They will have to do that simply because they failed 
to fulfil an administrative requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the legislation that has come forward since the 
Liberals formed the government in 1993, it is unbelievable that 
they are allowing conditional sentencing to continue.  Convicted 
rapists and people who have been convicted of manslaughter have 
been allowed to walk free, and yet they are saying to the 
law-abiding rancher, farmer, gun owner that if they do not 
register their firearms by the year 2003 there will be a series 
of penalties, the most severe of which can be a 10 year jail 
sentence.  However, the rapists are walking free.  Violent 
offenders can walk free.  It is a gift from the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examined what is happening in our country in this 
particular area and at the economic impact.  We had witness after 
witness appear before the standing committee, not only on the 
bill itself but on the regulations, who told us about the 
enormous negative impact it is having on the economy in certain 
areas of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked the justice officials if they had done an economic 
impact study on this bill and what impact, negative or otherwise, 
it would have on the economy, they said they had not done an 
impact study.  They do not seem to care whether they drive people 
out of business or shut down gun shows, shooting ranges or gun 
clubs.  They do not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the witnesses appeared before the committee that was what 
they told us.  Their testimony is on the record.  They were 
saying that with the implementation of these regulations they may 
not be able to function as a gun club, as a shooting range or as 
a gun show any longer.  The government is threatening to destroy 
the social events in the firearms community, those social events 
where people get together at a gun show to display their 
collections.  They buy and they trade.  It is much like a garage 
sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked the witnesses from these shows who appeared before 
the committee if their activities over the past 20 years of 
running these gun shows had ever created personal or public 
danger to anyone, they replied that they had not.  We asked them 
why they thought the government was regulating something that was 
not causing a problem.  They had no answer for that.  The 
minister has no answer to that question either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is simply regulating many of these law-abiding 
organizations out of business, possibly through the increased 
insurance they are going to have pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill and the money that we are spending on this bill is 
wrong.  It was wrong-headed at the beginning and the government 
has never been able to admit that it is wrong.

Bill C-68 and the registration of rifles and shotguns is not gun 
control at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is in favour of the common sense control of firearms. 
The registration of rifles and shotguns does not contain the 
capacity to do that, nor does it contain the capacity to reduce 
the criminal use of the firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will allow the confiscation, without 
compensation, of thousands of firearms.  Bill C-68 will prohibit 
over 500,000 handguns.  Why?  The barrels are too short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is property which has been lawfully acquired and legally 
held for years.  It is going to be confiscated, ultimately, 
without any compensation.  Again, this is wrong.

ill-conceived bill like this and the government is not fully 
disclosing the cost to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firearms group has said that it is the greatest boondoggle 
this country has every seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see.  We will watch to see whether it comes into effect 
on October 1 and what kind of mess occurs.  There are 20,000 to 
30,000 of these handguns under this specific category that are 
going to be lost by the firearm owners themselves, the dealers. 
There is no law covering them.  Therefore, they will lose them, 
apparently without compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will watch to see this ill-conceived piece of legislation as 
it moves into effect to see whether it brings safety to streets 
and homes or whether it continues to be an unmitigated mess.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

would like to remind the hon. member that I do not pull figures 
out of the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent Angus Reid poll, 82% of Canadians supported a system 
of universal registration of rifles and shotguns.  There was 72% 
per cent approval for that same system in rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members just do not get it.  This government was voted in 
after it adopted that piece of legislation, which had the support 
of this side of the House but was opposed by the opposition 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member keeps referring to a letter which he says 
distorts the facts.  In fact, he is distorting the facts.  The 
minister herself tabled a letter right here in the House which 
stated that the facts and figures represented in the first letter 
were true, but that they were based on a different system of 
calculation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member refused, both in the justice committee and here 
in the House after it was debated on numerous occasions, to make 
reference to the second letter which was tabled in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constant distortion of the facts continues on this issue because 
the hon. member and his party refuse to accept that Canadians do 
not want children killing children, as happens elsewhere in the 
world, but in fact want to know that if somebody has a gun in 
their house the police know about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP and the Canadian Police Association endorse our policy 
of gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member like to tell this House why he refuses to 
make reference to the second letter that was tabled by the hon. 
minister in this House which in fact says that the statistics are 
true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting.  She is 
asking me a question after she refused to answer mine.  I will do 
what she did not do and answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at both letters.  The RCMP is saying that our 
statistics are true. 
Those statistics that we gave represent firearms used in the 
actual commission of a crime.  What the deputy minister said was 
that their group looked at it from a broader point of view.  They 
looked at firearms seized by the police in any type of 
investigation, not necessarily those used in a crime.

found on page 10 of that book.  At the top of the chart it says 
“Firearms Involved in Crime”.  Under the violent column it says 
that rifles and shotguns were used in 915 crimes.  When we met 
with the firearms officials, as well as a member of the RCMP, 
they admitted to us that the figure of 915 did not accurately 
represent firearms used in crimes, but that is the perception 
created there.  They admitted it could very well create a false 
perception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that we have been making is that this false and bogus 
piece of information was filed in the Alberta Court of Appeal in 
six different affidavits in the constitutional court challenge of

are wrong now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a couple of brief questions for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have watched the estimate of the cost of this firearms control 
effort rise from an estimated $85 million to what it is now being 
estimated at, which is $133.9 million just for this year alone. 
That estimate was made by the spokesman for the new firearms 
centre.  It will be $133.9 million for this year alone and it has 
not even begun yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member has had any indication from the 
government what the total cost is going to be?  Or has he been 
able to conclude a cost himself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question refers to the $32 million crime prevention 
initiative announced by the government, which a newspaper article 
cites as another $32 million down the drain.  It says that the 
minister's crime prevention initiative is more of the same 
mollycoddling that has made a joke out of the Young Offenders 
Act.  I wonder if the hon. member agrees with that comment which 
appeared the Toronto <I>Sun</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the cost of 
the firearms program, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough asked the minister that very 
question when the minister appeared before the committee on April 
20 of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the minister, with the deepest respect, mugwumped 
around that question and did not give us a clear and decisive 
answer as to the exact amount of money that had been spent up 
until that time, that is, April 1 of this year.  What the 
minister did say was that they had spent $66 million, but that 
also included the administration of Bill C-17.  We do not know 
the cost of Bill C-17.  Therefore, we do not know how much had 
been spent up until that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Valin, who was reported by Sean Durkan of the Ottawa 
<I>Sun</I>, claimed that we just did not ask the right question of 
the minister and that the total cost for this year was the figure 
that my hon. colleague mentioned, which is $133.9 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is such a confusing mess.  We do not know if this is on top 
of the $85 million or on top of the $20 million that the 
estimates are going to send out to the provinces.  We just do not 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you are only going to give me 90 seconds on that 
question, then I will have to sit down and beg my hon. 
colleague's pardon for not getting to his second question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, many 
witnesses who testified at the standing committee on justice with 
regard to firearms registration said many times that a registry 
of firearms is certainly not going to prevent crime in any 
substantive way. 
The Conservative Party supports proper control of firearms and 
their proper use, but we think this expense of $85 million 
referred to by the government is low.  We hear rumours of a 
potential for maybe $500 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we are to believe what 
we are reading we will spend another $133 million on top of 
whatever has been spent before a single firearm is registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the process to register a firearm or simply to get 
a licence to hold one, it is the same process or almost identical 
to the requirement for an FAC.  The Toronto police board 
estimated the cost to process a single FAC requirement in 1994. 
I think it came to $181 to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Ontario is high and we knock it down to $100 and if there are 
three to six million firearm owners and we have to spend $100 to 
process a licence application, we will spend $300 million to $600 
million before we register a single firearm.  The cost has never 
been honestly declared by the government, either because it does 
not know it or it does not want us to know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of justice is on record as saying that if it 
came anywhere near half a billion dollars he would withdraw and 
not proceed.  The government is hiding the cost and I dare say 
for that very reason. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London—Fanshawe, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
oppose the motion of the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough if it is a serious motion.  If 
the motion were to pass it would literally handcuff the 
Department of Justice and the important work it has to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear to me as a member of parliament in my second 
term that Canadians want an improved system of justice.  This is 
a priority concern of Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
Obviously it will be necessary to invest some taxpayer dollars 
into priority areas.  To pass a motion like this one would 
prevent the department from carrying out its existing duties and 
would certainly make it impossible for the Department of Justice 
to move into new priority areas of the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the heavy responsibilities the department 
executes.  There is service to the government itself. There is 
the matter of policy development and the administration of law, 
and there is general administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding service to the government, we well know that the 
Department of Justice drafts all legislation and provides legal 
advice to all departments.  The department has the lead role in 
criminal justice policy in the areas of family and youth law 
policy arising out of marriage and divorce and of human rights 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard very clearly from my constituents in 
London—Fanshawe that they are looking for new initiatives from 
the government.  The government is responding and I support those 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One that comes to mind very readily is the area of crime 
prevention strategy.  The minister is embarking on a national 
strategy for community safety and crime prevention.  These lofty 
words are not just words but are being backed up by an important 
expenditure of funds.  There is an increase in funding from $3 
million a year to $32 million a year.  That is a very real 
commitment to the important area of crime prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I well know from my conversations with the chief of police in 
London, Ontario, Chief Fantino, that the chiefs of police 
understand the importance of preventing crime in the first place. 
It is the old analogy of the Fram oil filter we have all seen on 
TV, pay me now or pay me later. 
For every crime we can prevent through investment in people, 
particularly young people and families, the savings later on will 
be much greater than the necessary investment.  Chief Fantino and 
other police chiefs and social agencies across the country have 
made that point repeatedly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the municipal council of London, Ontario, for 
11 years during which time I spent several years serving on the 
Children's Aid Society.  Over those years we repeatedly heard of 
the need to invest in families and in children which leads 
directly to preventing youth crime.  It is very simple.  We know 
a very high percentage of young people in Canada who get into 
difficulty with the law or who break the law come from problem 
families described one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such initiatives will also involve other levels of provincial 
and municipal governments, NGOs, community experts such as the 
Children's Aid Society and the private sector in a very important 
partnership with this government to do much more in the area of 
crime prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know colleagues throughout the House heard the following 
concern from their constituents as I do from my constituents in 
London—Fanshawe.  They are very worried about the issue of youth 
justice.  They are concerned about youth crime, particularly the 
increase in violent youth crime.  I share that concern as a 
Canadian and as a member of parliament.  Mr. Speaker, I know you 
do as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is trying to respond to those concerns.  She 
proposed a justice strategy to replace the Young Offenders Act. 
It is clear to me and to most Canadians that the confidence of 
the Canadian public in the Young Offenders Act has been badly 
shaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, however, to draw the important distinction 
between violent and non-violent youth crime.  The input I have 
received from the people of London is that they have very little 
if any tolerance for violent youth crime, particularly by repeat 
young offenders.  They expect the government to implement tougher 
penalties in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done that since being elected in 1993 and we intend to 
go further in the area of violent youth crime particularly when 
we are dealing with repeat violent young offenders.  In this 
instance public safety must and will come first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear from social agencies, the chief of police and others in 
London that when we are dealing with non-violent youth crime 
incarceration is not a panacea.  This is where the majority of my 
constituents and I as a member of parliament perhaps disagree 
with some colleagues in other parts of the House.  Throwing these 
young people into institutions and thinking that will solve their 
problems and that they will not repeat these offences when they 
are let free is not realistic.  It is incredibly expensive to put 
them in these institutions.  More to the point, it is not an 
effective way to deal with non-violent criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  And we agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  I am very pleased to note the agreement 
of my colleague from Wild Rose.  We draw a distinction between 
violent and non-violent criminals particularly when we are 
talking about young offenders.  We could say that for any 
offender.  I believe and my constituents recognize that when we 
are dealing with violent and non-violent crime we need two 
different strategies.  The answer is not to lock them up and 
throw away the key.  We have to be more analytical and realistic 
than that and try to take the best action in whichever situation 
we are dealing with, violence or non-violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I alluded to the well known fact that the vast majority 
of young offenders, a shockingly high proportion of young 
offenders or criminals of an age, come from families with serious 
problems of one type or another.  I know that is so from 22 years 
in the classroom in the field of education. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there are more people from the field of education in 
this parliament than ever before in the history of the Canadian 
parliament.  These educators know.  They have seen it.  When a 
young person acting out and getting in trouble at school 
unfortunately slides into youth crime, in a shockingly high 
percentage of cases we are dealing with a young person who comes 
from a “problem family”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important as a government to support Canadian 
families more effectively.  I am very proud of the fact the 
government has made several steps in that direction.  It needs to 
go further and I hope it will.  I for one intend to encourage 
that so that we will do even more to promote healthy family life 
as a way of preventing and minimizing the chances of young 
offenders being involved crime and crime in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak specifically to several important initiatives 
undertaken in the past and previous budgets.  One initiative was 
increasing the child tax credit for families that wish to have 
one of the parents stay at home with the children.  They wish to 
exercise the option my wife and I exercised as a mutual decision. 
There ought to be recognition that those families are making a 
very important contribution to society and to raising good 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in the child tax credit and the increase in support 
for poor families by removing them from the tax rolls in the last 
budget are very real and tangible ways the government has tried 
to support families.  We need to and will do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative is the increase in the child care expense 
deduction for families that choose not to have one of the parents 
at home or through whatever situation cannot have one of the 
parents at home with the children.  There is also the case of a 
single parent family where the single parent must work to support 
the children.  Increasing the child care expense deduction was a 
important improvement in supporting those families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may be considered old fashioned, but if so I proudly say I 
think many of the problems in Canada begin with problem families. 
That is not to be simplistic.  To me it is quite obvious.  I am 
proud of the initiatives the government has undertaken to improve 
support for Canadian families.  I look forward to even further 
increases over the next three budgets during the time we intend 
to be in office and hopefully for many more thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third area that has come to my attention repeatedly in the 
town hall meetings I have held on a regular basis with my 
constituents and in many calls and letters I receive as all 
members receive is the need to be more cognizant of justice to 
victims, better treatment for victims.  Perhaps the pendulum has 
swung too much toward being so concerned about the rights of the 
accused that we have failed to take proper care of victims and to 
respect their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see the initiatives the minister is undertaking 
to begin to do more to improve the treatment of victims. 
Specifically what?  Better access to information for victims. The 
notion that the minister has put forth for discussion with other 
governments of a central victims office for victims who are 
trying to obtain information so that they are not tied up in a 
bureaucratic maze.  They could get the information and the legal 
protection they need much more quickly and much more readily and 
could deal with their situations much more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea needs to be explored.  The minister is committed 
to exploring the necessity of having victim impact statements 
play a much greater role in court cases and in sentencing 
convicted persons.  We have seen more of this in the last few 
years.  There is much more room for it.  I am pleased the 
minister has indicated she is moving in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sensed a fair bit of support from some of my colleagues 
opposite of a number of my comments.  I suspect at this point we 
may digress.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move to the area of the firearms debate, the Bill C-68 
debate we all lived through. I thought it had begun to wrap up, 
but I am hearing some points raised from hon. members opposite. I 
have a number of concerns about some of the statements I have 
heard. I do not purport to be an expert on this topic.  I never 
did.  I will simply state the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what the officials in my community think. I was pleased 
that the Reform Party held a convention in London, Ontario a 
couple of weeks ago. They were very welcome and they have been a 
nice economic boost to London, Ontario.  I had a lot of good 
feedback from the Reform members of how impressed they were with 
our community.  We were pleased to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share with my colleagues opposite the views of the people 
of London, Ontario.  They expressed them without any reservation 
to me and my colleagues in the past term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the well-respected and nationally known chief of 
police in London, Ontario, Julian Fantiono, came on my monthly 
show which I hold on cable television for my constituents.  He 
obviously was not going to be partisan supporting me, but in a 
very non-partisan, clear and effective statement he outlined why 
he as the chief of police of London, Ontario fully, totally and 
completely supported the registration of firearms.  His 
explanation was not at all nebulous. Let me share the key point of 
it with my colleagues who question the value of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Fantiono and other experts across this country have said 
that registration of firearms will improve the safety of the 
public, particularly front line officers working for the chief 
who attend at a crime scene or a potential crime scene. 
Registration of firearms will lead to more effective police work 
in tracking down weapons used in the commission of crimes and in 
the conviction of criminals using those weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting.  As soon as we quote experts who disagree 
with some of the members, they do not want to hear those 
opinions. That may be the case.  What I am putting forward are 
not my personal explanations about the necessity of registration 
of firearms.  I am putting forward the views of Chief Julian 
Fantiono, that I have on tape and which I would be glad to share 
with my sceptical colleagues opposite. I have heard these views 
shared by chiefs of police coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very real value in the minds of the chiefs of police 
and front line officers in the registration of legal firearms. To 
me it is nonsense to say that criminals are not going to register 
their firearms and therefore no one should have to.  The chief 
simply said his word for that was “nonsense”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Crowfoot has raised some very important points 
about the validity of this whole action by the government.  Let 
me share with him some other facts from London, Ontario and my 
riding of London—Fanshawe.  These are based on hundreds of 
inputs by phone calls, responses to a questionnaire that went to 
every household in my riding, meetings which I attended 
specifically on Bill C-68 and general meetings throughout the 
term where this topic came up. Seventy per cent of my 
constituents clearly supported the government in its action. 
Despite the heckling of the members opposite, those facts do not 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference was made to election results somehow questioning the 
validity of Bill C-68.  I would point out that in the province of 
Ontario in the last federal election certain colleagues of mine 
on our side of the House were targeted by the opponents to Bill 
C-68. They were targeted specifically for their support of that 
bill to try and have them lose the election.  The reality is that 
every single one of those people who sought re-election is back 
here and where the people did not seek re-election, the Liberal 
replacement candidate is in this House now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to my friend from Wild Rose that you have to be 
careful when you draw results of elections, be they provincial or 
federal, highlighting one issue and drawing conclusions. 
There is evidence on this side that Bill C-68 did not defeat any 
Liberal MPs in the province of Ontario. I think that evidence is 
very clear for anyone to see.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, subject to your ruling I have some facts on the 
estimates in terms of the economic performance of the government 
that I would be quite happy to move to if that is in order at 
this time.  Could I ask for your guidance on that now?  Could I 
move to the area of economic performance of the government as it 
relates to the estimates? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  At this point I am 
afraid that the debate must remain on Motion No. 1 on justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, at another time I will be 
pleased to highlight the outstanding economic performance of the 
government and remind Canadians and the members in the House of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion and I say this with respect, if it really is a 
seriously intended motion of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, obviously I cannot support it. 
It would literally handcuff the Department of Justice in the 
duties it now has to carry out.  It would also make impossible a 
number of very important initiatives that I have tried to outline 
today. With those remarks, I say I cannot support the motion.

<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a few questions for my distinguished colleague, the hon. 
member for London—Fanshawe, who is also the president of the 
Canada-Ireland committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member introduced himself earlier as a teacher of 22 
years and a councillor in his lovely town for 11 years. To 
become a teacher, one must have one essential quality and that 
is fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had he had favorites in his class, our colleague, the hon. 
member for London—Fanshawe would certainly not have had such a 
long career because, as he knows, there is nothing that students 
hate more than unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this member explain that Ontario and Quebec have their 
own police forces, namely the Sûreté du Québec in Quebec and the 
OPP in Ontario, while in the other provinces, police services 
are provided to municipalities by the RCMP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government bills the other provinces, or the RCMP, 
for only a fraction of the actual costs. As a result, with 60% 
of the population, Ontario and Quebec pay 60% of the costs 
incurred by municipalities and provinces served by the RCMP. 
That is one example of unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had he been this unfair as a teacher or city councillor, he 
would have been kicked out. When hit with a claim from Ontario 
and Quebec, which pay for part of the police services provided 
outside these two provinces, his government refuses to pay up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Douglas Young, who used to sit over there, did not care about 
poor people. He unilaterally abolished POWA, a program designed 
to help older laid-off workers. He abolished it unilaterally, 
without consulting any province, simply stating he would come up 
with another program, a superior program of course, to replace 
it with. We are still waiting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, the average age of the 305 workers who were laid 
off at the asbestos mine is over 52. A good number of these 
workers contributed to employment insurance for 25, 30 or 32 
years. Now they are only being given 55% of their insurable 
earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, Clermont Bégin, a 63-year-old former asbestos mine 
worker, has seen his EI benefits cut off by the human resources 
development office in Thetford because he did not tour the 
riding every day to look for a job. How can you expect the 
Liberal Party of Canada to instil a sense of justice in this 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now go back to my main question to the distinguished member 
for London—Fanshawe. 
Does he find it fair that Ontario and Quebec pay for 25% or 30% 
of the costs of police services in municipalities and other 
provinces without compensation from the federal government? 
Better yet, if the federal government charged municipalities and 
provinces for every dollar spent, then the money demanded from 
the Treasury Board for the justice budget would be much lower 
than the current $193 million. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
from Frontenac—Mégantic for his important questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has noted my involvement in the Canada-Ireland 
interparliamentary friendship group and I thank him for that 
commercial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not belabour the point other than to simply say in the 
most serious way I can that if there is a country in the world 
perhaps where we can see the results of there being no control or 
very inadequate control over firearms and other dangerous 
weapons, I think that unfortunately the country of my ancestors 
is a very ready example of where the problem can lead to whatever 
the motivation is behind it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most relevant question my colleague asked was that the 
provinces of Quebec and Ontario have their own police forces 
whereas in other provinces those services are provided by the 
RCMP.  That is quite true, but of course as we know, the other 
eight provinces contract for the services.  They pay for the 
services by the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>La belle province du Quebec and the province of Ontario choose 
to have their own police forces.  They would not have to have 
their own police forces if they did not choose to. They could 
apply for the same service to be contracted with the RCMP.  I 
think it is a reflection of the size of the two provinces, Quebec 
and Ontario, that they wish to have their own police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for municipal forces, my friend again mentioned my 
involvement in municipal government.  While I well know there is 
no requirement for my city of London, Ontario to have its own 
municipal force, it chooses to have it.  The taxpayers of the 
city of London fund it and are prepared to do so on a priority 
basis.  There are smaller communities near my riding such as the 
town of Exeter just to the north of London. A number of those 
communities are now saying that perhaps they cannot afford their 
own municipal force any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decisions my colleague refers to really are choices in my 
view that the municipalities across Canada make, be they in 
Ontario or Quebec.  In the example he cited, the choices of the 
provinces of Quebec and Ontario to have their own police forces 
are choices the people and their governments have made 
provincially. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member a couple of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the compassion he has for people who are suffering 
in our land.  I understand the member quite clearly on those 
things.  I know he is concerned about the poverty that exists in 
this country.  He also suggested that a lot of these problems can 
lead to crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that possibility exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 it was quoted in this House that there were 
approximately a million children starving, living in poverty in 
this land, and that we needed to do something.  The latest figure 
I heard is a million.  Evidently we are not making much progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the public accounts I do not want to support this 
motion either, but I have a fear that this money is going to go 
for a golf course or other ridiculous things.  Are we going to 
spend money on transition to adulthood, $105,00; sexual 
dissidence in historical context, $23,000; infants understanding 
how people act, $75,000; institutional change in household 
behaviour in rural China, $55,000; sexual behaviour of senior 
citizens, $116,000.  I feel good about that being a senior.  That 
is what this government has spent.  Then we talk about the 
billions of dollars given to companies like Bombardier or a $25 
million free flag giveaway.  This spending is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree that is good spending or should we 
redirect that money to those poverty ridden places and give a 
chunk of that money to the children's societies of Ottawa and 
Toronto and every city and stop this foolish spending that goes 
on?  Believe me it exists.  Sell the charter jets that these 
members in the front row fly around in.  They should sell them 
and take economy flights like the rest of us try to.  Save bucks 
and help these people.  When is it going to stop on that side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, they are important 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Wild Rose that a priority of our 
government spending ought to be poorer families and children in 
poorer families, to assist them for a number of reasons, one of 
which is to reduce the likelihood that some of these young people 
would find themselves in a criminal situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concede readily as an MP, and I am sure any colleague on my 
side would, that I do not support every single dollar spent by 
this government on every single project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you ruled me out of order to tell the very good 
economic story, so I will have to wait for another time to do 
that.  I know the member will be anxiously waiting for that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on the Main Estimates, within this debate 
on supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the President of Treasury Board intends to allocate 
$194 million to the Department of Justice for the coming fiscal 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have examined the estimates presented by the President of 
Treasury Board with great interest and great care.  I have just 
recently discussed them with a few of my colleagues, including 
the hon. members for Châteaugay, Frontenac—Mégantic, Rosemont and 
Champlain. 
Unfortunately, the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve was 
unable to join in our discussion on this vital issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the government's proposal with great interest and 
great care, one can see that this $194 million budget allocation 
to the Department of Justice shows just how much this government 
lives from day to day, without any road map or compass, and 
practically without giving its actions any thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They move from one slapdash policy to another without an overall 
plan, and this is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give numerous examples to illustrate this, the first 
being of course the reference to the Supreme Court.  As we know, 
in 1980 the Government of Quebec and all the people of Quebec 
voted on a rather specific question concerning 
sovereignty-association. 
The federal government of the day, led by Prime Minister Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau, accepted the rules for consultation of the 
people of Quebec. 
They said at the time that it was democratic and that it was 
accepted.  Trudeau's participation implicitly validated the 
referendum process in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although at that time the question also concerned Quebec 
sovereignty, another consultation was held after 1992, again in 
accordance with the Quebec referendum legislation.  Again the 
federal government took part, at Charlottetown, and validated 
the Quebec referendum act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 there was a referendum campaign.  The debate was fierce, 
fair, and intense, but it was always serene. 
This is the great quality that Quebeckers have. They had a calm 
and peaceful debate on the future of a country to be, Quebec, 
and therefore of an existing one, Canada, which shows that the 
Quebec society is a perfect model of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the federal government took part in the process. The 
then Prime Minister, who is still the Prime Minister—although I 
do not know for how much longer—also got involved by organizing 
rallies and appearing on television to discuss the impact of 
sovereignty. The result of the vote was so close that neither 
side can really claim victory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, the federal government said “Since I almost 
lost, I will change the rules of the game. I will deny 
Quebeckers the right to decide their own future, as they did in 
1980, 1992 and 1995”. What did the government do to achieve 
this? 
It asked the supreme court to rule on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is like having a problem with the fence between our 
property and that of our neighbour and telling him “Listen, we 
have a problem with the fence. I will ask my best friend, whom I 
will pay, to make a decision”. This is what is happening with 
the supreme court. The judges are appointed by the federal 
government. They are paid by the federal government. Not only 
that, but they are interpreting a document, the Constitution of 
Canada, which was never recognized by any Quebec government, 
whether federalist or sovereignist. So, the decision is removed 
from the hands of the people of Quebec and handed over to an 
unelected authority, the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to see that this unilateral action by the federal 
government takes us back 150 years. 
Back then, in the 1830s, the elected assembly, the people's 
democratic representatives, wanted to wrest power from an 
oligarchy appointed by the Imperial government in London.  It 
was this debate that led to the rebellion and that later, much 
later, led to responsible government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By going back 150 years, this government is deciding to take 
away Quebeckers' right to decide on their own future and giving 
it to nine individuals it has appointed, who are interpreting a 
document it produced without Quebec's consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the current Minister of Justice herself has said, this 
reference will bring absolutely nothing new to the debate from a 
constitutional point of view.  We can even tell you what the 
court's ruling will be. 
It is a complete waste of taxpayers' money, all for the purpose 
of hijacking democracy in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example of how little the government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I must interrupt the hon. 
member.  All Speakers of the House have always considered 
references to magistrates and tribunals unparliamentary when 
they took the form of a personal attack or blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will therefore ask the hon. member to choose his words 
carefully and to be careful about attacking the court.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Madam Speaker, on this point of order, 
members will recall the Reform Party motion of not so long ago 
in which they debated the position of the judicial arm vis-à-vis 
the legislative and executive.  Numerous questions were asked 
about the nature of supreme court appointments.  The Prime 
Minister even appointed some of his former law office colleagues 
to the supreme court.  These debates were allowed by the Speaker 
of the House.  As democratically elected representatives, we are 
therefore perfectly entitled to speak about appointments and the 
operation of the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member.  You are right, we can speak of such things, but at 
some point there is a limit and we have to stop there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Madam Speaker, on the same point of order—and 
I do hope this time will not be subtracted from my speaking 
time—I would like someone to tell me where I went overboard, 
because I have followed the rules of debate ever since I was 
elected to this House on June 2 last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its handling of the young offenders issue is another example of 
how completely out of touch with reality this government is. The 
Liberal government plans to spend huge amounts on reforming the 
Young Offenders Act. The intention is laudable; we are always in 
favour of fighting crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as mentioned repeatedly by stakeholders from 
various communities, the problem with the Young Offenders Act is 
not the act itself, but rather its enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, who is 
unfortunately not in the House, even stated candidly on national 
television that the main purpose of this reform was to placate 
public opinion, especially in western Canada, and give the 
impression the government was taking charge in this matter. But 
the fact is no policy can be worse than a policy guided by petty 
politics and by the desire to court public opinion in any given 
part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the community agrees that the enforcement of the 
Young Offenders Act by Quebec is exemplary. Many stakeholders in 
Quebec and even outside Quebec have said so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the Quebec government understand and enforce this 
legislation designed to rehabilitate young offenders, but it has 
applied the provisions of this act better than anybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois criticized this reform, because it is a 
reform for Reform's sake or worthy of Reform.  The new bill on 
young offenders aims to brand young offenders.  It thus runs 
counter to the objective of rehabilitation that is, that should 
be and that was at the very heart of the legislation on young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than implement rehabilitation or education programs for 
young offenders, the Minister of Justice is capitulating to 
western pressure, in favour of sentences and their reinforcement 
and the hardening of the attitude to this problem, which affects 
us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I must denounce in the strongest possible terms 
the attitude of this government, which penalizes the province, 
namely Quebec, applying its own legislation in the best way 
possible. 
The federal government owes $77 million for the application of 
its law in Quebec, and it has yet to pay one cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that unspeakable, and there is no shortage of words to 
criticize this attitude, which is totally unacceptable on the 
part of this government.  True to form, the federal government 
is refusing to pay and it is logical to think that this matter 
will drag on, proving once again that the federal government 
does not honour its commitments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have given an account of the useless reform to the Young 
Offenders Act.  Once again, there are a lot of other things to 
talk about.  Now, I would like to move on to discuss Bill C-37, 
the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without Bill C-37, what is the status of judges' salaries?  On 
April 1, 1997, judges were entitled to an increase of 2.08%.  On 
April 1, 1998, they had another increase of 2.08%, which is 
pretty good, given that many officials and public sector 
employees did not get such an increase.  So that is something 
already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government decided to give the judges, with Bill C-37, a 4.1% 
increase effective April 1, 1997, retroactively, and another 
4.1% effective April 1, 1998, also retroactive.  This means an 
increase of over 13% in the salary of this country's 
magistrates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, there are cuts to health, forced hospital bed 
closings, cuts to transfer payments to the provinces, and a 
surplus of $20 billion in the employment insurance fund.  What 
happens? Instead of returning these funds to the most 
disadvantaged members of our society, to women and children 
living below the poverty line, they decide to turn it over to 
people who, important as they may be, are not necessarily in 
need of a 13%-plus raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that the judges do not deserve a raise in 
salary, nor that they do not do a good job.  What we are saying 
is that, in today's economic and budgetary context, it is high 
time to make some enlightened choices, it is high time to make 
some fair choices.  The duty of all parliamentarians, of all 
governments, is first of all to give priority to the most 
disadvantaged members of society, and this government has 
steadfastly refused to do so, ever since 1993, when they were 
first elected as a majority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of societal choices.  We have seen all this. 
What are this government's priorities?  The money goes to the 
judges, rather than the disadvantaged.  Money is spent on 
denying Quebeckers the right to determine their own future. 
Instead of respecting their commitments and the very logic of 
the Young Offenders Act, which is the rehabilitation of 
delinquent youth, it has been decided to brand them as 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are three examples of the lack of direction, of the lack 
of wise choices, and the lack of judgment demonstrated by this 
government in the area of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let me say that this is proof of how much this 
government is out of touch with reality.  I hope that, when the 
time comes to make choices, and to vote on this, all of my 
colleagues in this House will realize that this request for 
appropriation absolutely must be turned down.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
always a pleasure to speak when you are in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague, the member for Charlesbourg.  I am sure 
you will not mind my pointing out that he is certainly one of 
our more talented members.  I think my colleagues would give him 
a boisterous round of approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two points must be made.  As the member for Beauce is apparently 
not up to it, I will make them myself.  First, there is a 
concern that must be noted, and that is the concern over 
organized crime.  We have spoken about this on several 
occasions. The member for Berthier—Montcalm pointed out how, 
somewhere around 1995—you were already in the House of Commons, 
Mr. Speaker—we fought for anti-gang legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got it, not only because of our perseverance and our powers 
of persuasion in those days, but because we convinced the 
government that it was not possible for us to win this war 
without the help of lawmakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you one thing that could be done, and I would like 
to hear what my colleague thinks of this.  The Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police, which is a fairly neutral 
group—the member for Beauce will agree that we are not talking 
about a pocket of sovereignists or a breeding ground for 
indépendantistes—has asked the government to take one thousand 
dollar bills out of circulation because this denomination 
encourages money laundering and is obviously of no use to the 
average citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I did an informal survey and asked those hon. members who 
have $1,000 in their pockets to raise their hands, it seems to 
me I will find few Conservatives, no Bloc Quebecois members and 
probably no government members either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that we made a very reasonable suggestion to the 
government to fight organized crime and the underworld, but the 
government did not act on it. I think the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg, who is quite familiar with this issue, will agree 
that there are no concrete measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we agree—and this is the real issue—to support the 
budget proposed for a department that did not have the courage 
to take the necessary measures to fight organized crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my nice, attractive colleague from Charlesbourg 
whether he agrees that the government could, among other things, 
have acted on the proposal made for the past two years by the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and withdraw the $1,000 
bank notes. If the hon. member has other ideas, I wonder if he 
could share them with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank 
the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by mentioning why the previous legislature 
passed anti-gang legislation.  It was thanks to the perseverance 
and the initiative of the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who 
was one of the first to raise this important issue in this 
august Chamber. This is the perfect example, one of the 
examples, of the situation where a member decides to push an 
issue and succeeds in changing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the withdrawal of the $1,000 bill, I am sorry to say I 
have never had one in my possession.  A number of my colleagues 
opposite have no doubt had a few in their pocket, but this is 
unfortunately not true in my case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one reason the government is refusing to take $1,000 
bills out of circulation is that one day, in the quest for 
visibility, the Prime Minister might put his face on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, this question obviously warrants consideration.  I 
take note of the proposal by the Association of Canadian Chiefs 
of Police and I am eager to meet with them to discuss the terms 
of such an operation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take part in the debate on the Estimates, 
especially the $193 million allocated to the Department of 
Justice. That is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the surplus in the EI fund, which will 
apparently top $20 billion by the end of the 1998-99 fiscal year. 
I wonder whether we could not have the Department of Justice pay 
for itself, the way EI is expected to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague so aptly pointed out earlier, in reference to 
young offenders, I have always thought that this was an 
investment that could yield dividends.  If the government 
invested wisely and judiciously in solutions to the problem of 
juvenile delinquency, there would surely be fewer inmates being 
housed at government expense, for it apparently costs over 
$80,000 to keep one inmate in jail.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to my main question for my distinguished colleague, 
the member for Charlesbourg.  How does he think the government 
is being fair when it penalizes those who must resort to EI, 
when fewer than 43% are eligible, but must still pay $2.70 for 
every $100 of insurable earnings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, we can indeed talk about 
justice in general. It is incredibly wrong and unacceptable to 
be accumulating a $20 billion surplus in the employment 
insurance fund while the justice department is making all sorts 
of wasteful expenditures like the ones I mentioned earlier, to 
the tune of $194 million. The government will not use this 
surplus to help workers, the asbestos mine workers who are 
asking for a POWA assistance program, for instance, because we 
must realize that on average the 305 workers at the BC mine, 
which has closed down, are over 52 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is morally wrong for the government to accumulate billions 
of dollars in a surplus transferred into the consolidated 
revenue fund while refusing to provide the assistance they need 
to workers who have worked hard all their lives, working day and 
night in mines to put bread and butter on the table for their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It laughs in their face and says “We have a $20 billion surplus 
in our coffers. Never mind you, workers over the age of 52 on 
average. You will not get any help from us. You can die, we 
don't care”. That is what the government is saying. This shows 
that the government does not know the first thing about being 
fair.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is quite interesting to me as we head into the marathon debate 
that is going to 4 a.m. that I am sure the Canadian public will 
understand the importance of our staying in this place and 
debating until 4 a.m.  I am sure we will be even more productive 
than we normally are as the midnight hour comes and we move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain to the millions of viewers why we are 
actually going to be here until 4 a.m. This is the new brand of 
politics that we heard the leader of the Reform Party and all of 
his cohorts talk about during the campaign, how they were going 
to do things differently.  In all the speeches earlier this 
afternoon leading up to this debate we heard— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is a justice discussion and we are not talking about 
elections and things like that.  We are off track.  We should 
bring the debate back to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I bring to the 
attention of hon. members that we are discussing under main 
estimates Motion No. 1 which has to do with the justice 
department's operating expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have asked other members today to stay relevant and on 
topic, I also ask the hon. member for Mississauga West to stick 
to the subject at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think I got two 
sentences out and the member is up on a point of order. Certainly 
I intend to talk about the justice estimates.  To prove there is 
in this situation very little justice I was explaining why we are 
here to this extent going on until 4 a.m. We are here because the 
members opposite seem to think they are the only ones in this 
place who have anything to put into the system of justice in the 
country. 
They come into town riding on their ponies with backs bowed 
because of the weight of the guns at their sides, shooting them 
up in the air.  They are going to solve all of these problems. 
These people are just wonderful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member has been illustrating the reason we are going to 
be here until four in the morning.  We are actually going to be 
here until four in the morning because of a Liberal motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Okay, we are even. 
Let us start all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, would you reset the 
clock.  I would like a full, uninterrupted 20 minutes.  I am sure 
that will be difficult.  It is quite clear to me what the 
strategy is. The thin skinned members on the opposite benches 
simply rise every time a member says something they do not agree 
with.  They interrupt the obvious wonderful flow of the speech in 
an attempt to throw the person off.  What they fail to understand 
is that they simply add ammunition.  So, Mr. Speaker, allow them 
to carry on if that is what they want to do as we debate this 
very important issue of the justice estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member points out in this debate that we are here because of 
a Liberal motion.  He is right.  I think the people should know 
that earlier today, instead of debating the estimates of the 
justice department and every other department, we wasted hours of 
debate because of the members opposite.  They are like the little 
kids in school who know the teacher has an apple in the drawer. 
They are all planning.  They say “You divert their attention and 
when they are not looking, the member from White Rose is going to 
sneak up and steal the apple and he is going to run back to his 
seat”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  White Rose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Well maybe he could not sneak up. 
There would not be much running and there would not be a lot of 
sneaking.  But they are going to steal the teacher's apple. They 
think “Oh goody goody” and they run back.  This is the new kind 
of politics the Reform Party has brought to Ottawa.  Reform 
members are stealing apples.  It is truly a remarkable thing to 
watch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians watch the debate in this place they must wonder 
“What are these guys talking about?  They are supposed to be 
debating estimates and spending”.  The government record is 
quite extensive.  We are supposed to be talking about how we have 
managed the debt, about how when this government took office we 
inherited a $42 billion deficit, get the size of that.  Most 
people would look at that and say there is no hope, there is no 
opportunity, there is no chance for us to get out of this 
terrible hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what this government did.  We reduced the size of 
government by $14 billion.  It is a smaller government.  It is 
more efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to know what this member's speech has to do with 
the motion.  It is supposed to be on justice and on the 
estimates.  What in the world is he offering this House on this 
motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Earlier today I had 
the unfortunate responsibility of asking a member opposite to 
stay on topic because the hon. member was not on topic.  It was a 
difficult time for me because she had friends watching.  The hon. 
member for Crowfoot is quite right.  If we are going to be here 
debating this, then let us stay on topic and debate Motion No. 1 
which has to do with the estimate for the Department of Justice.

estimates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite interesting. 
The members just simply get up and continue to raise the same 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question this debate is on the motion and the 
justice estimates.  It has to do with the entire estimate 
portfolio, indeed the entire reason we are in this place. 
Canadians need to know why we are here.  That is my point.  I 
think it is on topic.  I know the member would not understand.  I 
will send him over the written notes with some crayons if he 
would like, and he can follow the bouncing ball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I want to point out 
to the member for Mississauga West that the Chair agrees with the 
member for Crowfoot that the member for Mississauga West should 
stay on topic.  I do not really care whether you think the 
opposition thinks you are on topic, it is whether the Chair 
thinks you are on topic.  The Chair would ask that you stay on 
topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want you to know that I 
will be on topic. I would not want to lose your confidence. 
Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, you could refrain if I might respectfully 
suggest from accepting frivolous points of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any kind of speech in this place, one must talk about the 
broad range of issues as they affect the Canadian taxpayers and 
the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw a motion in this place on the Reform Party's idea of what 
justice should be in this country. Reformers think they should 
have the control over the judges. Of course that would have a 
tremendous impact I might add on the estimates, on the spending. 
I would suggest that in the Reform Party's attitude toward 
justice—and I do not know how many times you want me to mention 
the word justice but I am quite prepared to do it for the next 10 
or 15 minutes just to prove to you that there is indeed justice 
in what I am trying to say—there is no justice in what the 
Reform Party is putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice I might add is a subjective perspective depending on 
your definition of justice.  My definition of justice in this 
country is a parliamentary democracy with a separate judiciary 
that is not influenced by the kind of nonsense we have seen being 
perpetrated and which results in a lack of fairness and justice 
to the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that members of the Reform Party would bring a 
new way of doing justice to the Canadian parliament.  One of 
their ideas was that they thought it was just and the leader of 
the Reform Party thought it was just which thereby would imply a 
certain amount of justice, if he were not to occupy Stornoway. 
He said “If I am elected I will not occupy Stornoway”.  Where 
is the justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is the fourth time the member has been asked to speak to the 
motion. If he has nothing to say to this motion, then he ought to 
be ruled out of order and go on to the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Crowfoot has made his point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suspect members 
opposite do not like what I am saying.  I am sure they will not 
like what I am about to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole aspect of delivering justice to the Canadian people is 
one where this party would strongly disagree with anything that 
the justice critic opposite or any of his colleagues would have 
to say.  Their solution to providing justice in this country is 
to change the way the government works in terms of the 
relationship with the provinces and municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member might not think it is on topic but it clearly is 
because everything that goes on in the estimates debate has to do 
with what this government is spending.  If there is too much 
spent in one area, it cannot be spent in another.  That is fairly 
fundamental and simple for the Canadian people to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform would do is totally turn our Confederation 
upside down.  I do not see the justice in that. 
Let me share an example.  This is from the so-called new Canada 
act that Reform has brought forward.  For the member's comfort I 
will relate it back to the issue at hand here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's suggestion is that the Government of Canada 
hereby recognize municipal governments as the first level of 
government and agrees to ensure municipal government 
representation at federal-provincial conferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a councillor for almost 10 years.  My wife sits on 
municipal council in Mississauga in the region of Peel.  I have 
very strong roots in municipal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the impact of policing, at the impact of clogged 
up courts, at the backlog that exists in our community and we look 
at the cost of crime in our community, our municipal governments 
are very much impacted by the justice estimates and by the entire 
justice system. The Reform Party suggests it will recognize them 
in some sort of special category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reform does not say is that it is going to transfer all 
powers in this federation to the provinces.  Guess what happens 
when that is done? Guess who takes it in the end?  It is the 
municipalities because they are creatures of the provincial 
governments.  They indeed rely on the fairness of provincial 
governments to redistribute and pass on assistance in the form of 
transfer payments for social services, education, health care and 
justice. Municipalities rely on the provinces.  Yet Reform would 
give with one hand and take away with the other hand and put all 
of the pressure on the property tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we would have I would argue is a justice system under the 
Reform Party that simply would not have the strength of the 
national system.  It would not have the backing of the national 
taxpayer and the strength of a united Canada. Indeed it would be 
put out to the provincial level which in turn would foist it off 
on the municipalities and they would wind up putting it on to the 
property taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care what estimates we want to talk about or debate in 
this place.  I would remind members opposite that there is only 
one taxpayer and that taxpayer pays property tax, sales tax, 
provincial taxes and federal taxes. People just do not buy the 
rejigging that sounds like wonderful stuff by the Reform Party. 
It is a matter of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about who should be responsible for spending 
the justice dollar, because that is what we are talking about 
here, should it be the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Canadian taxpayers trust someone, and those members 
might not like this example, who said “I am not going to do 
this,” and then got elected and immediately did it.  “I am not 
going to accept the limo,” and now rides around in a limo.  “I 
am not going to live in Stornoway,” and now lives in Stornoway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Canadian people trust a party with the estimates in 
the justice department that was actually entering into 
negotiations with the party that wants to destroy the country? 
They would form what was it called, the Re-Bloc party.  Imagine a 
justice system that was run by some coalition, separatists 
yanking power away from the central federation, trying to take 
everything back into their hands so they can do it their way, and 
another party bent on regional disparities.  Imagine what kind of 
a justice system that would be. I was asked to speak about 
justice issues and I am doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the hon. member for Saint John who I was going to suggest 
should indeed be the leader of the united right. There might then 
at least be some type of tempering, instead of the extremists, 
instead of this particular leader of this particular party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is what are the average Canadians' views of 
politicians and what they stand for and what they say they will 
do?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about things that are as critical and as 
important as the administration of justice in this country.  This 
country was built on democratic principles that are envied all 
over the world.  We are not only envied for our justice system, 
we are also envied for the success that we have had with our 
fiscal programs since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the deputy minister of finance, Mr. Scott, appeared 
before the public accounts committee earlier today.  This 
certainly impacts on justice estimates because there is only so 
much money to go around in every department.  Every department 
must get its allocation and we would say that our justice system 
and our justice department should indeed have clear access to a 
fair allocation of the national revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy minister talked about what a job this government has 
done since 1993.  It has put the justice department and every 
other department on firm, sound financial footing.  There is no 
question that without fiscal responsibility there would be no 
justice.  There is no question that without strong leadership 
there would be no justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely clear to me that the policies that are espoused 
by the Reform politicians to totally denigrate the Canadian 
institution, to totally denigrate the justice system and to turn 
it over to the hands of pork-barrel politicians is wrong.  It is 
not justice.  It is not something this government or the Canadian 
people will tolerate, no matter how much they get up with their 
puffery and their nonsense.  The Canadian people know that in 
Reform's policies there is clearly no justice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we endured the rantings of the member opposite for 
the last 20 minutes.  It seemed like a lifetime.  However, he did 
make two very interesting and truthful points in his last 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he said that the justice system cannot survive without 
strong leadership.  We agree with that.  That is why we have been 
encouraging the Liberals to take some leadership and put some 
justice back into the legal system that they created for their 
lawyer friends out there in legal land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing the hon. member said was that there is no 
justice and then he went on to rant about something else.  But I 
caught that phrase and he is absolutely right.  There is no 
justice in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he believes that we have a workable justice system in this 
country, then why on earth are we hearing this huge outcry from 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast, railing against the 
justice system at every opportunity, at every town hall meeting, 
at every rally where they can possibly make their voices heard? 
Why do we have that all across this country if, in his opinion, 
we have a justice system that works? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with the extreme view 
that this group wants to take of the justice system, we get the 
feeling that there is a lynch mob walking down the street with a 
noose.  They are tightening the knot and they are banging on the 
sheriff's door saying “Let me have that person out here.  We are 
going to string him up”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to give that impression.  It is just not the truth.  I 
will admit that there are problems in the justice system, but any 
system with people in it will have problems.  There is no 
question.  There are good guys and bad guys.  There is no 
question that there are difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to ensuring that there is 
stability.  That is the key, bringing stability into the justice 
system.  Do not subject it to the possibility of having a judge 
run for election or giving a parliamentarian the power to 
overturn a judge's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appeal it, yes; repeal it, no.  Stability will maintain good 
justice in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
listening to my hon. colleague, I am reminded of this old Jesuit 
proverb “Those whose thinking lacks depth make up for it with 
length”. We have seen a lot of that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to ask my hon. colleague, in a very friendly way, is 
this. Does he not think that, beyond the statement he made in 
this House in praise of the justice system, there are serious 
flaws in the Canadian judicial system, particularly with respect 
to human rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague agree with the Prime Minister, his 
government and party leader, who said earlier this week that one 
of the differences between the Reform Party and the Liberal 
Party was the fact that the Liberals were in favour of 
recognizing same sex couples while the Reformers took a more 
traditional view of the family? Does he agree with recognizing 
same sex couples, which is basically a human rights issue? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite 
proves that some thoughts are neither long nor deep.  However, I 
would suggest that the question is a fair question.  In fact, the 
Reform Party put the issue under some disguise yesterday when it 
put its motion forward.  It tried to wrap it in the justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants, he could look at my remarks in 
<I>Hansard</I>.  It is my view that one should neither get rights 
nor lose rights because of their sexual orientation.  I have no 
difficulty with that.  It is important that both of those are 
taken in context:  one should neither get rights nor lose rights 
because of their choice of sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not much care what anyone does with their own private life. 
I do not think it drives a political agenda.  We should not 
discriminate against anyone in this country.  It is unfair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask my hon. colleague about gun registration.  According 
to the government, when it started out it would cost $85 million 
over five years.  It has ballooned to $133.9 million and 
counting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would those members not put $133.9 million into front-line 
police officers?  We need them in Saint John, New Brunswick.  We 
need them in every municipality.  Why are we wasting this money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in answer to the hon. 
member for Saint John, I believe that we probably do need some 
assistance in the form of policing.  I know we do in Peel.  In 
fact, the region of Peel police force recently took over the 
policing of Pearson International Airport.  It has to find the 
money to hire an entire division, 101 officers, in the region of 
Peel.  They will be contracted out to run the policing system at 
Pearson, a facility that I am sure members use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's question was about gun control.  I think the 
Canadian people have spoken very clearly on that issue.  We do 
not want to see what we tragically see every day in the news in 
the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goodness, we register our dogs in this country.  We register 
our cars.  We register our boats.  Why in the world would anyone 
object to registering a weapon like a gun that could kill if it 
fell into the wrong hands?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not even know where to start with a guy like this.  I do know one 
thing.  He talked about Reformers wanting to string somebody up. 
The last thing I strung up was a balloon for my grandson that was 
full of hot air, and he certainly qualifies for that job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did not address the previous question at all 
concerning the registration of firearms.  There are tonnes of 
dollars being spent on the registration of firearms as if 
criminals are going to line up to register their guns 
immediately.  It is not going to save one life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have challenged the ministers of the past and the present that 
if they could prove to me that it will save one life then I would 
support it today.  However, they cannot because it will not.  It 
is a big waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a person like this get up and constantly talk about the 
problems we are having in our country, starving families, 
children in poverty and unbelievably high unemployment in regions 
of our land, and still be willing to spend hundreds of millions 
of dollars on a program that will not work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stick to the question on registration and answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I feel I have 
accomplished something in a day if I can get the member from 
White Rose a little agitated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  My apologies, Wild Rose.  He is wild, 
I must say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to talk about this because it is such a simple issue. 
Although maybe it is not.  If it was, maybe they would understand 
it.  The reality is that I am not willing to stand here and take 
this member's challenge.  His challenge is for me to prove that 
this will save one life.  Does that require a death?  Does it 
require that kind of activity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The common sense of this is so clear.  We have hundreds of 
thousands of weapons that are not registered and, in many cases, 
not cared for in this country and nobody should be adverse to 
registering them.  No one should object to this.  As I said 
before, we register our vehicles.  We register ourselves.  We 
register most of our animals, at least the four-legged kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand where these people come from when they say 
we should not register guns.  We absolutely must follow through 
with this.  It is a commitment to the people of Canada and the 
people of Canada spoke in the last election on this issue very 
clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Speaker made comments earlier concerning debate. In debate 
the first person up is the person who is recognized.  The rules 
that apply in question period are not the same rules that apply 
in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In debate it goes 
back and forth.  In questions and comments the Chair will see 
members on the opposition benches before the Chair will see 
members from the same party in debate.  It just makes sense and 
that has always been the case and will continue to be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Obviously the House was really enjoying the question and answer 
session with the hon. member for Mississauga West, so I would 
like to seek the unanimous consent of the House to continue the 
question and answer session with the hon. member for five or 10 
minutes, whatever the Chair sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt has asked for the unanimous consent of the 
House to extend the question and comment period up to 10 minutes. 
Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is not

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, speaking on justice, the member on the government side 
was asking what the definition of justice is.  My first reaction 
was getting rid of the Liberal government.  We are working on 
that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> How interesting, we get a reaction once in a 
while. They appear to feel threatened, and they have every 
reason to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome this opportunity today to speak on justice. There are 
problems in this respect. We often disagree with the Reform 
Party, which claims that this country's judicial system is a 
mess. This seems to be a very serious problem out west, where 
the Reform Party got many members elected. I cannot help but 
wonder if there is connection there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada, we know that the top priority, especially in 
New Brunswick, is job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly serious problems with justice.  As a woman, 
I must also point out that women may have particular grounds for 
concern about justice.  Many women are involved in violent 
situations and our system does not respond properly to their 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak about women because of my own experiences.  But men have 
the same experiences sometimes, and children often do. I shall 
speak mainly of women, however, because we know that there is a 
serious problem of violence against women, whether physical, 
mental or sexual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is sad is that the process a woman has to go through to try 
to get the abuser stopped is a very long one and one that can 
cost her her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, a woman takes her partner before a judge and there 
it is acknowledged that violence took place, that he stabbed or 
shot her, if she is still around to testify.  Sometimes it is a 
matter of threats. 
If threats are involved, the judge issues a a restraining order. 
This is just a piece of paper.  The judge signs it, and hands it 
over, saying “Don't try to kill her next week”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem here.  There should be a system in place for 
when a woman is in acknowledged danger, a process of counselling 
for these individuals.  Just handing over a piece of paper 
saying “Don't try to kill her next week” does not solve the 
problem.  The person who wants to do harm to this woman feels 
justified in doing so.  This must be acknowledged and efforts 
must be made to determine why he thinks that way and convince 
him that he is not justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no justification for attacking someone. There is no 
justification for raping someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When judges have these people before them, there ought to be 
laws forcing them into therapy. 
As things stand now, once they leave the courthouse, there is no 
follow up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened about two years ago in Toronto, and there 
have certainly been other incidents since then.  Every week, we 
hear stories on the news about domestic violence resulting in 
death.  Often, children are involved and are also victims.  We 
must work and make resources available to try to stop this 
vicious cycle.  It is a cycle that is costing people their 
lives, a cycle in which children learn from what they see, and 
our institutions end up full of criminals, and people wonder 
why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I was pleased to learn that our solicitor 
general had announced funding for prevention.  That is a start. 
I must congratulate him.  We will see how the $32 million is 
used, because there are serious problems.  And throwing everyone 
into jail will not solve the problem.  Locking them up is not 
the answer.  The majority of inmates in our institutions will 
eventually be released and an effort must be made to see that 
these people are better and not worse when they get out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution to the problem is prevention with our young people 
and assistance to families that need it.  That is how we will 
lower the crime rate in this country.  We must make sure that 
the government's decisions do not make the problem worse.  I am 
not prepared to say that the increase in the poverty rate will 
help, because when people are poor and have nothing to eat, they 
will perhaps rob the corner store. 
They lack the necessary resources and perhaps did not have the 
access they should have had to post-secondary education.  All 
this adds to crime in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a crime there is poverty in this country.  There should be 
none.  So long as we do not try to eliminate poverty here, we 
will not be dealing with prevention.  First we need good, 
healthy people.  We need people who are comfortable with 
themselves to make good choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to the judges, they too need education.  I was reading 
in the paper this morning or yesterday about a man who may have 
raped his partner because he did not understand that no meant 
no.  He thought she did not mean it, because he had already had 
sexual relations with her.  He was found not guilty, because he 
did not know the difference. 
I did not hear the case, I have reported what I read, but it is 
food for thought.  Even if we said yes yesterday, it does not 
mean we will say yes tomorrow.  No is no, yesterday, today or 
tomorrow.  We cannot have judges in this country who think it is 
all right for the accused to think the other person said yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For sure there are big problems in rural communities, where the 
level of unemployment is even higher.  The solicitor general 
announced the appointment of 1,000 more prison guards in the 
country.  We could call that positive right off, but we might 
ask ourselves why.  No doubt the guards already on the job in 
institutions are happy to have help, because with the cuts in 
this area, help will certainly improve things. 
Poverty is on the rise in this country, the number of prison 
guards is on the rise.  Is anyone looking at the whole picture? 
This worries me, because I see many decisions being taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If I look in my riding, the family crisis resource centre in 
Shediac is working very hard to eliminate family violence and 
family crime in general.  They are all volunteers who work very 
hard.  These centres are well organized, offer good service and 
help people in trouble.  They will find sources of assistance 
for people.  Money is not pouring into these organizations and 
yet, they should have more assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many volunteers get involved in putting together a half-way 
house, a family crisis centre or a crime prevention centre, but 
it takes assistance and money.  Yet the will is there.  There 
are many volunteers raising money here and there. 
Where I come from, people may not have a lot of money, but they 
give generously.  They deserve to be congratulated. But the 
government must not rely on these resources alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is too bad that there are such capable people, 
willing to do something, very dedicated to the cause, who are 
always scrambling for money.  There are many of them.  The 
riding of Kent apparently needs a half-way house.  All ridings 
need them.  There is a need for a very safe place where people 
can go.  The vicious cycles must be stopped.  This is only 
possible through prevention and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I needed a half-way house a number of years ago.  There was one 
in my area in those days.  I was able to stay there for three 
weeks. 
I was able to get therapy.  My son was well treated because the 
resources were available.  Had they not been, I would probably 
not be here today, because I would not have been able to get out 
of the situation I was in, without the necessary help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, when I speak of family violence, I know what I am talking 
about, believe me.  I know how important it is for these women 
to get help free of charge, because not everybody has money set 
aside in case they have to get out of the house.  Services have 
to be there for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can be teenagers too.  There are lots of young people who 
turn up every Tuesday.  It is nearly always the same ones we see 
in court.  But they are salvageable. 
Priority must be given to this, because no child is born bad. 
Society makes them bad, the society we as a government create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we create a society, an environment that is not good for our 
youth, we must accept the responsibility and go back in time to 
see what we did that had a bad outcome.  This must be dealt 
with, or we will create a world that will not be a nice one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pity, in my opinion, because often, the resources are 
not available.  I have often spoken to people in schools, to 
teachers and principals.  They say “We have loads of kids who 
need help, but no resources”.  These are young people that can 
be helped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very rare for a 6, 7 or 8 year old to have decided to be 
bad for life.  There are reasons, and often we need to really 
get inside these children to find out where the problem lies. 
Having a part-time counsellor in a school with 500 students is 
not the way to find out the child's problems.  Not in the least. 
There must be people in the schools who have the time and the 
expertise to work with these young people and their parents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments of this country will one day have to establish 
the priority.  Is it to ensure that major corporations continue 
to make profits?  Is it to believe things are going well because 
the economy has improved, while neglecting social programs? 
Poverty and stress are increasing.  Think of the stress with the 
cutting of 45,000 federal jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are the poor affected, so is the middle class.  There 
is violence in the middle class.  There is violence everywhere. 
Family violence is not limited to the poor.  Violence can be 
found at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with young offenders.  They do not come just from 
poor families.  They come from all walks of life.  Work needs to 
be done with them.  Until it is, we are missing the boat and by 
a long shot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk about registration of firearms.  Our 
constituents are wondering about this too.  There is a need to 
control firearms.  But we should not forget that people who kill 
their partners do not always use guns.  Controlling firearms 
will not resolve all the problems in the world.  It will worsen 
things in certain situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a rural riding, no price is set for registering firearms.  It 
keeps going up and up.  In the regions, cuts continue to be 
made.  That means that hunters have a problem.  Things are out 
of balance.  It is a problem for the people in our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to put all my eggs in one basket and say that 
everyone is safe in the country because the Liberals passed a 
bill on registering firearms.  That is not true.  There are a 
lot of disturbing factors there.  Responsibilities must be 
assumed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we look at the justice system, at what 
works and at what does not work.  It can put someone in jail.  If 
people commit crimes that is their punishment, but have to look 
at why they are there and what brought them to that.  What is the 
percentage of people in jail today who had a terrible past, who 
never worked out their past?  It is a very large majority.  If we 
had caught on to that before they committed crimes we would not 
be paying $75,000 or $85,000 a year for one person in jail.  It 
is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have to look at prevention, not only prevention 
once they are 16.  We have to look at the whole picture: the 
family environment and the policies of governments that perhaps 
make it more difficult, and many policies make it very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make prevention a top priority and provide funds for 
it.  It should begin in the the schools starting at kindergarten. 
All kinds of children may be physically abused or sexually 
abused.  It does not only start at the age of 10 years.  We need 
resources available for them if we want to make sure they become 
a benefit to the society.  Until we do that I have no doubt that 
crime will increase.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise my hat to the member and say to her that we took due 
note when she said that prevention is really necessary and that 
there must be more family-oriented policies. 
Much work must be done, even though the Minister of Justice has 
introduced a multi-million dollar plan for Canadians and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are talking at this point about Motion 
No. 1 in relation to spending in the area of justice.  I will try 
to relate to how much society and government resources are 
committed to the area of justice and then relate that to our lack 
of satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a quick addition of how much we will be spending under the 
justice and the solicitor general ministries.  My addition might 
be incorrect but I came up with $2,889,701,564 that we are about 
to vote on.  That is a tremendous amount of money.  Yet it does 
not represent the money that may be hidden incidentally in other 
departments such as defence, foreign affairs, the environment and 
whatnot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That justice spending does not reflect all the provincial or 
municipal budgets for crime prevention and other service programs 
or all volunteer organizations that do fundraising to provide 
general justice services.  That is a tremendous commitment of the 
resources of Canadian society to justice, peace and public order. 
Yet we have tremendous dissatisfaction and discomfort with all 
the services that are delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to respond to this inequity, to respond 
to how we can have greater value for the dollar and greater 
accountability for what we commit as a society to the judicial 
area so that the public can have a renewed sense of confidence 
that all the resources we spend in this area could not be spent 
wisely in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians are happy with 
the money we spend on justice when we are spending it the right 
way.  Spending it only once a crime has been committed is not 
spending it the right way.  It is not by taking funds away that 
we will fix it.  It is not by privatizing the institutions as I 
know the Reform Party wants to do that we will fix it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is prevention.  We need to give the dollars 
necessary to make sure we have the resources available when 
someone is in need, when we think someone needs counselling and 
there is a need for a teacher to say “I believe this child is 
having problems”.  We need counsellors in the schools and places 
for the kids to go in the evening to play a game or something 
where it is healthy, where there are no cigarettes or alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all part of crime prevention.  How many communities do 
not have a community centre and if they do have one cannot afford 
to pay a co-ordinator for the centre?  Those are important 
factors in our daily lives and our children's daily lives.  It is 
important they have a healthy place to go to instead of just 
hanging around a nice place that may not be nice to hang around.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canada is a success story when it comes to the economy and how we 
as a government handle the finances of the nation.  This success 
is not only recognized as such within Canada but is certainly 
recognized in international circles as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve this there had to be and has to be balance between 
federal services, deficit control, debt management, economic 
growth and other factors.  I was quite amazed to note the motion 
of the opposition member to reduce justice estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough proposes to 
vote down the operating expenditures of the Department of 
Justice.  If the House approves that motion it would prevent the 
Department of Justice from conducting its statutory 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $193.8 million in operating expenditures required in 1998-99 
will allow the department to carry out its responsibility for the 
legal affairs of the government as a whole and to provide legal 
services to individual departments and agencies.  More 
specifically these funds will enable the department to continue 
to meet its responsibilities under three lines.  The first is the 
provision of services to the government.  The second is the 
policy development and administration of the law and the third is 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three main areas where the Department of Justice has 
lead responsibility.  They are criminal justice policy, family 
and youth law policy arising out of marriage and divorce, and 
human rights policy.  The department also has a lead role in 
constitutional law, administrative law, aboriginal justice, 
access to information and privacy law, official languages law and 
the government's mandate for courts and judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice and her department are responsible for 
more than 40 statutes, many of them with major policy 
ramifications.  The department must anticipate future legal and 
societal trends in order to provide timely strategic and 
effective responses, to provide leadership both to the government 
and the public in understanding the changing legal world, and to 
provide guidance in achieving governmental objectives in a manner 
consistent with fundamental rights and freedoms, fairness, 
equality, accessibility, and effective and efficient legal 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice department provides a range of services relating to 
the planning, co-ordination, development, promotion and 
implementation of justice related policies.  The justice 
department is moving forward with a balanced and focused policy 
agenda which responds to the issues Canadians have identified as 
being important to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the areas the department is working on includes the 
crime prevention strategy, youth justice, victims and the rights 
of victims, conditional sentencing, firearms control and many 
others. I will elaborate on firearms control. 
I want to point out that effective implementation of the firearms 
control program is among the Department of Justice's highest 
priorities.  The regulations required to implement the system 
have been made following scrutiny of both houses of parliament 
and the system will be functional by October 1, 1998.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration together with licensing and the other aspects of the 
Firearms Act is aimed at facilitating the continued enjoyment of 
sport by responsible owners using safe practices. This will 
decrease the risk of gratuitous violence and will promote a 
culture which recognizes safety and responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new firearms legislation is a positive and effective 
contributor to the range of criminal and social measures put in 
place by the government to further a safe and secure society. The 
gun control legislation has the support of a large majority of 
Canadians as we all know and is a reflection of a country of 
peaceful communities, safe streets and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act is legislation which its opponents seem 
determined to distort and misrepresent in addition to denying its 
many benefits.  Certainly that is most unfortunate.  The law 
imposes tough criminal penalties on those who choose to use 
firearms in the commission of crimes. Even the opponents of the 
legislation endorse its strong crime prevention aspects.  The 
minimum penalties, four years in most cases, inserted into the 
Criminal Code for offences committed with firearms send a strong 
deterrent message, a message which has been upheld at every state 
to date by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statute is all about regulating lethal instruments, 
articles designed for the most part to kill.  This legislation is 
not about confiscation.  It recognizes that the vast majority of 
firearms owners and users are responsible and prudent people. The 
practices embodied in the statute reflect the prudent practices 
of those responsible people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statute strives to encourage a culture of safety in Canada, 
a culture which is well ingrained in the activities and 
responsibilities of firearm owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legitimate practices of those responsible owners can all be 
continued under this statute. Hunters can continue to hunt, 
target shooters can continue to shoot targets, buyers and sellers 
can continue their activities, collectors and museums can 
continue to function and thrive, and responsible owners who carry 
out their activities safely have certainly nothing to fear in the 
new gun control legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our opponents advocate a situation representing and 
respecting firearms such as that which exists in the United 
States.  It is worthy to note there are 30 times more 
firearms in the United States than in Canada.  A much higher 
proportion of homicides in the United States involves firearms. 
On average 65% of homicides in the United States involve firearms 
as opposed to 33% in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firearm homicide rates per capita in the United States are 7.6 
times higher than in Canada. This is unacceptable.  The United 
States environment respecting guns does not correspond to the 
vision of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act addresses another crucial social situation, 
domestic violence. The Firearms Act requires licensing and 
screening of gun owners and will result in specific checking of 
probation orders and prohibition orders before licences are 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fully implemented, all firearms owners will be licensed. 
They will have taken a course emphasizing the safety and safe 
handling aspects of their sport.  The guns they use will be 
registered and this will assist the police in enforcement 
functions and in tracing the illegal movement or transfer of 
firearms.  It will encourage owners to store their guns carefully 
and it will assist in the recovery of lost and stolen firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new system will reduce by half the paper work and 
administrative tasks which are today performed by police, and 
this will put police back on the streets where they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act embraces all these things and is a positive and 
effective contributor to the range of criminal and social 
measures put in place by our government to further a safe and 
secure society.  The Firearms Act has the support of a large 
majority of Canadians and is reflective of a country of peaceful 
communities, safe streets and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of conclusion, I believe the department is managing its 
resources responsibly and the department's policy will have an 
impact on Canadians' confidence in their justice system.

Canadian government and Canadian society as a whole.

accordingly on this measure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, after 
listening to the hon. member speak on the merits of the 
government's gun control Bill C-68 I have a question.  We are 
going to speak shortly on our own party's position so I do not 
want to get into that.  It is obvious to me the hon. member has a 
certain amount of information in front of him but I do not think 
he understands any of the differences between Bill C-17 and Bill 
C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effective and important measures and the measures that will 
work in this country to prevent crime were all incorporated in 
Bill C-17. When this government brought in Bill C-68 it was 
simply a tax on ownership of firearms. It had nothing to do with 
gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member how a responsible member of 
parliament can consider for a moment that registration of 
firearms of law-abiding owners of this country is going to 
prevent crime. I would like to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are literally thousands of guns on the streets.  It is 
obvious that not one criminal in Canada is going to stand up to 
register their firearms, so how do we go to the people who are 
not abusing the firearm?  Bill C-17 looked after anyone abusing 
firearms.  There is no sympathy from the Canadian public for 
anyone abusing firearms.  There is not one iota of sympathy for 
that person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only people who are going to pay the tax on ownership of 
firearms are the honest people who admit they have the firearms 
to begin with.  How is that going to prevent crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand only too well the issue with respect to firearms 
and the Firearms Act.  I sat for 10 years as a member of the 
Waterloo regional police commission.  As chairman of the Waterloo 
regional police we were very much in favour of having this type 
of legislation in place which would prevent and assist in terms 
of prevention of crime throughout not only our community with 
approximately 500,000 people but across Ontario and across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What amazed me was that the member's party during the last 
election would try to out reform the Reform Party on this very 
contentious issue.  Instead it should have been leading with us 
in the vanguard to ensure that the streets were safe, criminals 
were put away and firearms were protected in a manner consistent 
with the values and norms of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people do not like that, do not want that and do 
not respect that.  What the Canadian people would rather see is 
our society as a safe and caring one with caring communities in a 
manner consistent with what we as Canadians value. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the question from the member for South Shore. I 
noticed there was not an answer given to that question.  I think 
it deserves an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had hand gun registration in Canada since 1935. We have 
a long gun or rifle and shotgun registration system based very 
much on that same principle.  We know there are more hand guns 
used in the commission of crimes than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at that model I am wondering if the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington can tell us how registering rifles and 
shotguns will improve that situation based on the knowledge we 
have that it has not improved the situation by having hand guns 
registered all this time.  I think the member for South Shore 
made a very important point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know criminals are not going to register their long guns. 
They did not register their handguns either, we know that. In 
rural areas like I represent, it is a real inconvenience.  It is 
a high cost for people to register their guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not going to be as simple as some member suggested, a 
postcard style registration mailed back in.  We know over 20% of 
guns do not have proper serial numbers or duplicates. It is going 
to be much more expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question bears repeating. How is Bill C-68 going to cut down 
on crime by causing the registration of riffles and shotguns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything we as a society, anything we as a government, anything 
we as a country can do to ensure there are not firearms on the 
streets in whatever form will make our society a safer place.  I 
and most Canadians do not want to go down the path of the 
Americans in this regard.  We do not want the kind of crime that 
exists in the United States.  Our values and system of norms and 
what we hold dear as a society are very strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we need to ensure we take weapons out of the hands 
of people who commit crime.  In doing that we have put in place 
the kind of laws which enable us to do that. They ensure Canada 
remains distinct in this area, rightfully so, and in the process 
allows police to do the kind of work they are best charged to do, 
to get back on the streets and make sure our communities are safe 
and sound for everyone. Canadians deserve that and we owe that to 
our young people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
once again the member has not answered the question.  He said he 
wants to take weapons out of the hands of people who commit 
crimes.  The people who are registering these guns are 
law-abiding Canadian citizens.  They are not committing crimes 
with these guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the member not understand the question?  It is put about 
as simply as we can possibly put it.  The question is how will 
this expensive registry get weapons off the streets and make 
Canada safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program originally was to cost $85 million or $87 million, 
whatever the magic number was that the justice minister of the 
day happened to invent.  We now know that it is going to be at 
least double that number just for the registration program 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is terminology.  It is called GIGO, garbage in equals 
garbage out.  It is a terminology of slang used in information 
systems.  If you put in garbage, you get garbage out. If you go 
with an imperfect registration system such as proposed by this 
minister and by this government, there is no way the registration 
system will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in my constituency the RCMP has had to try to 
impose fees in order to cover its cost of doing the extra work 
caused by Bill C-68. These are realities and facts.  We are 
talking about millions of dollars, much inconvenience.  The 
question remains specifically can the member tell this House how 
we will have safer streets and fewer guns on the streets as a 
result of this very expensive multimillion dollar registration 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject outright the premise that the registration system will 
not work.  It will work.  It will be a very effective one which 
will be for the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member was not listening when I said this in 
direct answer to his question. We are not about to penalize 
legitimate people in terms of gun ownership, farmers, hunters and 
others.

an overall macro point of view what we are doing as a government

the capability to do their work.  Ultimately, we as a caring

better place and a far, far better Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In view of the fact that the hon. member was asked a specific 
question on three occasions and was not able to respond, I would 
like to ask for unanimous consent that we extend this question 
and comment period for another three minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley has asked for the unanimous consent 
to extend the period of questions and comments for three minutes. 
Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is not 
unanimous consent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too would like to take a moment to point out that the question 
was very explicitly asked three times and no answer was 
forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a different turn on the justice discussion. Quite 
often the justice system seems so gigantic, so distant and so 
impregnable that people feel there is nothing they can do or that 
it might not have an impact on them.  Nothing could be further 
from the truth.  There is nothing more personal than the justice 
system if you have been involved in it or have had to deal with 
it.  The example I will use shows the lack of direction and the 
wrong focus we have in our proposed spending estimates that we 
are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is about people and how it affects them.  I want to talk 
about how the justice system has failed a family in my riding, a 
family that has gone through a great deal of suffering from three 
arms of the justice system.  They have all failed to some degree 
to recognize the situation and to take the appropriate steps to 
help this family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about James Mills who was murdered on July 24, 1991 
while in custody of Corrections Canada.  He was murdered while 
under an arm of the justice system in Canada.  At the time and 
since then, suggestions have been made that there were serious 
errors made at the time of the murder on behalf of Corrections 
Canada.  I do not know if that is true, but the accusations have 
been made about the disruption of the crime scene.  Perhaps it 
was a shortage of training.  Perhaps it was a shortage of staff. 
In any case there was a deficiency that caused an awful problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually the RCMP were called to the scene of the crime, 
another arm of the justice system.  The RCMP have investigated 
this.  It still tells us that there is an ongoing investigation 
but there are still no results.  Again, the third arm of the 
justice system, the crown prosecutor, was involved.  Even though 
charges were recommended on two previous occasions, they have 
never been laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family of Mr. James Mills has waited seven years for an 
answer.  There is no answer.  There is no explanation of what 
happened at the crime scene.  There is no explanation of how he 
was murdered.  There is no explanation of how it could happen 
right under the nose of the justice system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family, especially the father Mr. Robert Mills, has been 
haunted for years and years.  All he wants is an answer.  He 
wants to have an explanation of what happened, why his son was 
murdered, how he was murdered and why nothing was ever done about 
it.  The solicitor general still says and maintains to this time 
that the case is still under investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking for answers, Mr. Mills and sometimes Mr. Mills and 
myself have met with top level senior RCMP officials.  We are 
trying to get answers. The commissioner of corrections came to 
Amherst to meet with Mr. Mills.  We were hopeful that he would 
bring information with him.  That did not arrive.  It did not 
happen.  We did not get any new information, even though the 
commissioner came to Amherst and we appreciated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have brought up questions in the House of Commons month after 
month.  We have been in the media.  We have even used the access 
to information office to try to get information on what happened. 
Where was the deficiency?  Where did the system fail? 
How can the Mills family be let down so badly when their son was 
murdered right under the nose of the justice system?   How did 
the other parts of the justice system fail?  Was it lack of 
training?  Was it—

order. First of all, I apologize to the hon. member for having 
cut him off in midstream, but I think that there is now consent 
for the following motion, and I would invite colleagues to verify 
if they are unsure. The motion would be the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, notwithstanding any standing order or usual practice, the 
business to be considered under Government Orders on Wednesday, 
June 10, 1998 shall be the report stage of Bill C-25; a motion 
relating to the appointment of the information commissioner; the 
third reading of Bill C-30; and the consideration of Senate 
amendments stage of Bill C-4; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, no later than 5 p.m. on all questions necessary to dispose 
of the report stage of Bill C-25, all questions shall be put and 
a division or divisions thereon deemed requested, provided that 
the said division or divisions may not be deferred; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we will vote at 5 p.m. tomorrow on Bill C-25. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That during the remainder of the sitting on that day, no quorum 
calls, requests for unanimous consent or dilatory motions may be 
received by the Chair, provided, for greater clarity, that it is 
confirmed that an amendment proposed to a motion under Government 
Orders is not a dilatory motion and is therefore admissible under 
the terms of this order and provided that, when debate concludes 
on Bill C-4, the question then under consideration shall be 
deemed to have been put, a division thereon requested and 
deferred to 1 p.m. on Thursday, June 11, 1998; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the House shall then adjourn and shall meet at 9 a.m. on 
Thursday, June 11, 1998 and the ordinary daily routine of 
business shall be taken up at that time. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It was my impression that the wording of the motion that 
was agreed to did not include any reference to quorum calls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would put it to 
the hon. House leader that this perchance is something that could 
be debated behind the curtains and we will come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to catch the mood of the House. Does the hon. the 
government House leader have the unanimous consent of the House 
to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been reminded during 
that little interruption that I am dividing my time with the hon. 
member for South Shore. I neglected to say that at the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, we are back to the Mills family who have lost their 
son who was in the custody of Corrections Canada, the justice 
system in effect, investigated by the RCMP, the justice system in 
effect again, and the crown prosecutor of New Brunswick, again 
the justice system.  It has now been seven years that they have 
been waiting for answers, explanations, anything at all, any 
scrap of information, but there has been nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked for a final report from Corrections Canada.  We were 
promised that we would get a final report on November 20 and we 
were to get a report of the investigation and all aspects 
surrounding the death. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 20 we were presented with a report that was mostly 
all blank pages, not an ounce of new information, nothing more 
for the Mills family, nothing to give them a little peace or 
contentment or any information that would allow them to let this 
go away.  In fact three arms of the justice system have failed 
the Mills family:  the RCMP, Corrections Canada and the crown 
attorney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, it has not got enough money to provide the training 
at Corrections Canada or whatever the problem is, or it does not 
have enough officers to investigate the situation properly, the 
government is talking about spending anywhere from $85 million 
for this gun registry process and now it is talking about $133.9 
million this year alone.  In any case, it is going to be hundreds 
of millions of dollars and this money could be spent in adding 
training, equipment, facilities and officers to the police forces 
and Corrections Canada which could really serve a purpose and do 
some good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently announced $32 million crime prevention initiative 
is the same thing.  It is public relations and there is nothing 
in it for the police.  I read in the Toronto <I>Sun</I> on June 7 
“another $32 million down the drain”.  The article went on to 
state “The minister's crime prevention initiative is more of the 
same molly-coddling that has made a joke of the Young Offenders 
Act and if Liberalism at its worst may be defined as public 
boondoggles premised on good intention, then this justice 
minister is a true Liberal having a bad day”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the latest report from the 
Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics states that 1994 had the 
largest decline in police strength since 1962, the year when 
statistics were first kept.  It goes on to state that in 1962 
there were 20 criminal infractions per police officer.  But in 
1994 there were 47, far more than double the number of 
infractions or criminal offences per police officer.  That 
indicates where the money should be going.  It should be going to 
these issues and not the issues where the government has focused 
the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the fewest number of police officers since 1972.  In 
addition to that, the police officers we do have are now 
preoccupied with the long gun registration, the Young Offenders 
Act and all the things the government has brought in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think a better plan would be to take the long gun 
registration money, put more officers on the street and give them 
more tools to work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder people like the Mills family wonder how our justice 
dollars are being spent.  The large amount of money in the 
justice department estimates should be redirected to be useful, 
functional and directed where it is most needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will now turn my time over to the hon. member for 
South Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will have to endure 
the possibility of questions and comments first. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was wondering if the hon. member would like to explain to the 
House who administers and hires and fires policemen.  As far as I 
know it is the municipal authorities and not the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to see why he is referring to our crime prevention 
initiative. It is a collaborative effort of the federal, 
provincial and municipal authorities in order to prevent crimes 
and ensure that we do not need more policemen in the long run. We 
can start preventing crime at the age of zero instead of at the 
age of 17 when it is too late.  We want to prevent crime from the 
very beginning to ensure that eventually there will never be 
crime again in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $32 million will be a shared responsibility between the 
federal, provincial and municipal authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member explain the fact that the hiring and firing 
of policemen is a municipal responsibility, not a federal one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
Certainly our municipal police are hired but some of the things 
the government is doing, such as the gun registry, are going to 
take so much of their time. Instead of being on the street they 
are going to be registering firearms, implementing the Young 
Offenders Act and all the other aspects the government is 
downloading.  The government is supposed to pay half of the costs 
of the implementation of the Young Offenders Act and it is only 
paying 30%.  The municipalities and the local police forces are 
also supposed to implement the gun registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, not all police officers are hired by the 
municipalities.  The RCMP certainly play a big role in my part of 
the country.  It is a federal agency, federally funded and 
federally paid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the $133.9 million already spent on the gun registry 
could supply police officers with better tools to work with or to 
put more policemen on the street.  That is where I think the 
money should be going instead of to these programs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member has considered that there 
are more parts to the country than Cumberland—Colchester.  In a 
city like Windsor, Ontario, which abuts on the great city of 
Detroit, Michigan, we see the impact every day of having no gun 
control and having no gun registry.  Every night when we watch 
the news on television we see shootings in schools being treated 
as though they are car accidents.  I do not want Canada to turn 
out that way.  I want Canada to be a distinct and different 
culture from that of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think by having people wear sidearms and by 
not taking care of things such as crime prevention and our 
children that this will be a better place?  Does he believe that 
municipalities do not pay for the services of the RCMP?  I think 
he is on a stretch here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say the opposite is 
true.  The hon. member asked whether I was aware there were other 
areas than Cumberland—Colchester like Windsor.  I think the 
government is not aware that there are other areas such as 
Toronto, Mississauga, Windsor and maybe even Ottawa.  There is 
also a vast part of Canada that is rural and we do not see the 
need for a gun registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also asked whether I believed in gun control.  I 
certainly believe in gun control.  My government, the government 
I was a part of between 1988 and 1993, brought in very good gun 
control that emphasized safe storage of weapons, training and 
elimination of dangerous weapons.  We did not bring in a gun 
registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all about a gun registry, not gun control.  Yes, I 
believe in gun control.  We put it in and put it in well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I almost hate to interrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Hon. members are getting excited in 
the debate, but we have another matter before us.  The government 
House leader is rising on a point of order which no doubt is 
important and which all hon. members would want to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, some four or five minutes 
ago I read a motion and sought unanimous consent which at that 
time still needed further review by some hon. members.  I will 
put it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you were to seek consent to adopt the motion I put earlier I 
believe you would perhaps receive it.  I will dispense with 
reading it again because the table already has the text and it 
has been read into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The government House leader has asked 
me to put a motion that was read some time ago.  Does the hon. 
government House leader have unanimous consent of the House to 
put the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Read it again, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I will read the motion in a minute. 
Is there consent to put it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no consent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
certainly with much interest that I rise to speak to the motion 
to fund the continued business of the government in power today. 
I would specifically like to speak to gun control and to the 
justice issue which I think are interesting points.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been sitting here listening to the debate and have been 
extremely interested in a lot of the comments coming from the 
government benches.  It is obvious that they have totally mixed 
up gun control.  They do not understand the difference between 
Bill C-17 and Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we had a little lesson in history.  I am going to use 
an analogy.  If anybody in the House happens to be a fly 
fisherman, I would like him to listen to this analogy.  We had a 
situation in 1993 where we had just gone through a major debate 
in the country on gun control and an election. What ensued from 
that debate was Bill C-17 which at the time was a very 
responsible bill on gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  We ran a federal election and we elected, much 
to the chagrin of many Canadians, a disjointed and separated 
parliament.  We did not have an opposition that was interested in 
being an opposition.  We had a government with a huge majority. 
It was bereft of ideas—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will continue with the 
little lesson in history.  It is obvious a great many members of 
the government need to hear this history lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite simple.  In 1993 we had a government elected with a 
huge majority.  We did not have an effective opposition.  We were 
in a situation where we had a government that got elected on a 
couple of items.  I followed that election very closely and I can 
say with some authority that gun control was not one of those 
items.  Gun registration was not even discussed.  It was not an 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were the issues in the federal election of 1993 that 
elected many of the members sitting opposite?  The first issue 
was the GST.  These guys were elected on the GST.  They were 
elected on kicking free trade out of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we get in return for that?  In the first 11 months the 
government took power we discussed gun control in the House of 
Commons. 
We never discussed the GST.  We never discussed getting rid of 
free trade.  We never discussed any of the substantive issues 
they were elected on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to my fly fishing analogy.  Someone who is fly 
fishing knows there is nothing like laying a nice dry fly out, 
letting the line go a couple of times, laying that fly on a 
little ripple and watching a fish come up and snap it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened with gun control.  A group of individuals 
could not believe this was to be rammed down their throats.  They 
could not believe they would see this type of registration from 
honest citizens.  They snapped that fly. The hon. minister of 
justice of the day played that fish for everything it was worth. 
He surely did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it important?  Was it substantive?  Did it help the country? 
No, it did not.  We ended up with 11 months of argument, 11 
months of discussion.  We did not gain one thing.  We obtained a 
bill that was defective, to say the least.  We have a major 
supreme court challenge against it.  We have four provinces and 
two territories that have no intention of abiding by the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone further than that.  We have made a totally separate 
set of rules under Bill C-68 for first nations.  It is not a 
problem.  We can do that.  We can have a separate set of rules 
just by snapping our fingers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will back up because these guys lump everything together. They 
say that somehow if we are against registration we are against 
gun control.  I separate the two.  I am all for gun control.  I 
am a gun owner.  I am a hunter.  I am a farmer.  I am someone who 
actually uses a firearm in a safe and responsible manner.  I have 
zero sympathy for everyone out there who abuses the rights and 
the privileges of owning and using a firearm.  I have no sympathy 
for them at all.  They should be slapped with the full force of 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are not willing to do that.  It is much easier to 
tell all law-abiding citizens of Canada that they have not broken 
the law or done anything wrong and if they register their guns 
somehow it will make things safer.  It does not work like that. 
We have rules, laws and regulations for the people of the country 
and it is extremely important that they follow them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest insult was under a criminal bill.  It was a 
criminal bill.  Do members know what it is now?  Now it is a 
safety bill.  Excuse me if I cannot quite swallow that.  I have 
swallowed a lot of stories in my life but I cannot quite swallow 
that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day what will we have accomplished?  What good 
will it do?  Under Bill C-17 we had responsible gun control.  We 
said to firearm owners, long gun owners, shotgunners and hunters 
that if they wanted to own firearms they had to store them in a 
responsible manner.  They have to prove they are responsible 
enough to own them to begin with.  We do want a lot of firearms 
sold to people with criminal records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of issues were raise today such as domestic violence. 
Nobody in the House is so wrongheaded that they would somehow try 
to justify domestic violence.   What have we actually done to 
avoid it?  Will registration avoid it?  I suggest that it will 
not.  Is there a better way?  Is there another way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had Bill C-17.  We had responsible gun control.  It was never 
given a chance to work.  We had a justice minister who wanted to 
make a name for himself.  We had a government that did not want 
to talk about what it was elected to talk about.  It did not want 
to go down that road.  It did not want to govern on what it was 
elected to do.  It was elected to do a number of things and gun 
control was not in the equation.  GST was in the equation.  Free 
trade was in the equation. 
Somehow we got off track.  If we want to talk about smoke and 
mirrors, there was never a better smoke and mirror act than this 
whole deal on gun control.  That is exactly what it was.  It was 
wrong-headed, it was ill thought out and it is not going to make 
any difference.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are telling the people of Canada to register the guns 
themselves.  They are being told to send their cards in.  I 
thought it was Sunday morning and I was watching TV.  Just send 
money.  It does not work like that.  There is a lot of confusion 
out there.  There are a number of people who did not understand 
Bill C-17.  They certainly do not have the first idea about Bill 
C-68.  What we are going to have is a lot of people who will not 
register their guns.  A lot of them will be taken into the black 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need some clarification.  I will ask for assistance.  How does 
that prevent crime?  The government is forcing a bunch of people 
to do something when they do not understand the rules and 
regulations. It had a law that would have worked, but it did not 
give it a chance.  It is mixing that up with registration and now 
it is saying it is kicking out registration, it is kicking out 
responsible storage and the safe handling of firearms.  That is 
just not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what was discussed to begin with.  Registration is 
not going to change that one iota and members opposite know it. 
We cannot afford it.  People will not do it.  More guns will be 
put on the black market, which will end up in the hands of 
criminals.  I cannot understand how government members can sit 
there and continue to mix up the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government members want to talk about registration 
separately, fine.  But tell me what they have done in their bill 
to prevent domestic violence and the use of firearms by 
irresponsible persons.  That was in Bill C-17, but it is not in 
Bill C-68.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to my hon. colleague.  I am sure 
the House will know that one of the problems with people who tell 
stories about fish is the reputation that these stories have, 
because of course with each telling the tale gets taller, the 
tale gets longer, and the tale gets further and further away from 
the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the very interesting thing about the hon. member's 
remarks was that he was talking about the fly being cast and back 
in 1993 the fish grabbed the bait.  What the fisherman forgets is 
that there was an election in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these issues were mentioned.  I am sure my hon. colleague 
mentioned them when he was running.  The people of Canada spoke. 
The people of Canada said that, over all, the Liberal government 
was doing a good job and it deserved another mandate to continue 
doing what it had promised to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all well and good to talk about fishing, but let us 
remember that he was talking about history.  Let us go back and 
give these people on the other side a history lesson.  Obviously 
my friend over there needs a history lesson because he forgot 
that just one year ago the people of Canada gave us a second 
majority mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about facts.  We cannot see into the future.  We do 
not know whether or not the dire predictions are going to be 
correct with respect to gun control.  All we know is that we are 
going to give it—and I hate to use the phrase—a shot to see 
what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my hon. friend, is it not true, notwithstanding his 
wonderful analogy about fly fishing, that there was an election 
in 1997 and that the people of Canada gave the Liberal government 
a second majority mandate?  Is that not true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for this opportunity because in Nova Scotia the 
people of Canada spoke.  There were 11 Liberals from Nova Scotia 
prior to the election.  There are zero today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the fishing analogy goes, yes, quite often the tale 
does not get blurred, it gets longer.  That is what I am hearing 
from the government side.  It is getting longer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the member's intervention.  I understand 
the fishing analogy but, unfortunately, where I live there are no 
fish left thanks to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, so I 
cannot use that analogy.  I think the member might have the same 
problem in his province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member, does he believe that the reason 
the Liberals brought Bill C-68 into this House and passed it had 
nothing to do with the safety of Canadians?  They knew that full 
well when they brought it in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was nothing more than a deliberate Machiavellian attempt to 
conceal from Canadians the failure of their justice system, the 
failure of their inability to deal with the shortcomings in the 
criminal justice system.  This was a way to try to persuade 
Canadians that the government was actually doing something, when 
nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a justice minister who has for over a year promised 
changes to the YOA and no changes have been made to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a criminal justice system that lets convicted rapists 
walk the streets without serving any time in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not the reason they brought this so-called gun control 
legislation in?  Does it not have more to do with trying to hide 
their own failure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there was a serious lack 
of direction on the government's part.  There was a serious lack 
of alternatives, of new ideas.  They came down an old, worn out 
path and they walked and walked back and forth on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, they are not accomplishing a lot.  The justice 
minister and the government did not have any new ideas.  They 
were not willing to listen to people.  They were not willing to 
look at alternatives.  Here we have this half-baked idea and a 
half-baked system with no hope of it ever working.

consider it a privilege to speak on this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently a constituent of mine forwarded a column by Diane 
Francis contained in the May 18 issue of <I>Maclean's</I> 
magazine.  The constituent was commenting favourably upon the 
article and requested a detailed response.  I thought I should 
respond with some detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The column unfortunately betrays a woeful lack of understanding 
of Canadian history and an appalling ignorance of government 
finances, which is what we are debating tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could forgive Ms. Francis for her lack of Canadian historical 
knowledge, as she was originally an American citizen, however, I 
am unable to forgive her for her limited grasp of the federal 
government's finances and the role of the federal government 
vis-à-vis its citizens in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She states “The federal government is in need of serious 
downsizing.  It need not be involved in health, education, 
welfare, mining, forestry, culture or the fisheries.  They are 
adequately handled by the provinces and the federal role should 
only be one of co-ordination.  On the other hand, Ottawa should 
remain in charge of justice, economic management, international 
diplomacy, defence, internal security and communications 
policy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Francis seems not to understand that the government is not 
involved in health, education, welfare and has entered into 
management agreements with the provinces in the areas of mining 
and forestry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a nationally syndicated columnist this is a woeful 
misunderstanding of the jurisdictions involved in this country. 
The federal government is still involved in culture and fisheries 
because those endeavours do not recognize provincial boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa still remains in other areas of government approved by 
Ms. Francis, although its role in the daily delivery of justice 
services is quite limited.  All in all Ottawa is pretty well out 
of everything that Ms. Francis thinks it should be out of and is 
in everything that Ms. Francis thinks it should be in.  Never one 
to let facts get in the way of a fixed religious belief, Ms. 
Francis goes on to chastise the government for its enormous 
duplication and says that downsizing is not in the lexicon of the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Francis is the editor of the <I>Financial Post</I>.  As such, 
she should have a working familiarity with the budget of the 
federal government.  For hon. members present and for Ms. Francis 
I will go over some fundamentals of the federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a budget of approximately $150 
billion to $160 billion annually.  In fiscal year 1996-97, 30% of 
that money went to service the national debt.  The next 15% was 
transferred to the provinces and a further 23% was transferred to 
other organizations, such as the OAS, ET, et cetera.  That 
amounts to 68% before Ottawa spends a dime on its own programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am assuming that Ms. Francis does not want the federal 
government to default on its debts.  That is possibly not true in 
the province which I come from, however, I am assuming that Ms. 
Francis wants that.  I am also assuming that she does not want 
the amount of moneys allocated under the CHST to be reduced, 
especially to her favourite little buddy Mike Harris, and does 
not feel that the old age benefits or employment insurers are 
overly generous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Francis approves of the federal government having a role in 
defence.  That accounts for $9 billion to $10 billion.  In gross 
numbers on a budget of $161 billion, the federal government 
transferred $41.6 billion to persons, $22 billion to provinces 
and paid $44.9 billion in interest on the national debt.  That 
leaves approximately $50 billion or 33% on which to run all the 
federal programs which Ms. Francis finds so burdensome.  This is 
essentially the only money over which the federal government has 
any real control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Francis apparently approves of Ottawa being involved in 
defence and apparently approves that this is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Are we not supposed to be debating Motion No. 1 which is on 
justice and not on the overall budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Yes.  The hon. member is quite right. 
We are debating Motion No. 1 which deals with the estimates of 
the Department of Justice.  I know the hon. member for 
Scarborough East will get to the point of the motion in due 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
intervention of the hon. member, but you will note that Motion 
No. 1 accounts for $193 million worth of spending in areas of 
justice.  In my riding that is an area of extreme significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are areas of spending with which we have already dealt. 
We are down to 33% of the balance of the federal government's 
moneys, and in those moneys, of course, are justice moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am assuming that Ms. Francis approves of our spending in areas 
of veterans affairs.  I assume she does not wish to cut off 
veterans from their benefits.  I also assume that she does not 
want to cut aboriginal expenditures.  She neglected to mention 
anything with respect to those issues, out of oversight rather 
than any intention on her part.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to get too detailed for fear that the essential 
point will be lost on hon. members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has gone to great lengths to remove 
itself from overlapping jurisdiction and wasteful expenditures 
particularly in the area of justice.  The hon. member should be 
aware that the justice system is largely administered by the 
provinces. Not only is the federal government far leaner than it 
was before, it is now arguably one of the most efficient 
governments in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you read the overblown rhetoric of this particular 
columnist and members opposite it sounds like sound bite 
journalism.  One has to wonder whether members opposite and this 
journalist have been in a coma since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from being one of the most overgoverned jurisdictions in the 
world, just the opposite is true.  Sixty-seven per cent of 
government revenues require virtually no bureaucracy at all.  We 
collect it and then we ship it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I quote Ms. Francis “We have too many layers of 
bureaucracy doing too many of the same things.  We have too many 
municipalities and school boards complicating our lives and 
adding to costs.  We have too many provinces.  We have too big a 
federal government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts point in exactly the opposite direction. To the extent 
that the federal government is able to remove itself from 
overlapping jurisdictions, it has.  In some respects and arguably 
it has become somewhat too remote from the daily lives of 
Canadians.  Absence of a strong federal government to provide a 
sense of being Canadian, Canada will degenerate into a bunch of 
separatist entities which plays into the agenda of the Lucien 
Bouchards of this world, and the Glen Clarks of this world. This 
is the world they— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Following up on the earlier point of order, members opposite have 
been waiting with bated breath to hear the relevance in the 
member's intervention.  We have not heard that.  I would ask that 
we have the speaker speak to the motion rather than going off on 
a rant about Diane Francis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure that the hon. member for 
Scarborough East will want to direct his remarks to the issue of 
the estimates of the Department of Justice which are after all 
the subject matter of the motion now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members have run out of things to say on the justice issue we 
can move on to one of the other motions.  Heaven knows there are 
enough of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one hesitates to say that 
one will get to it in a timely fashion.  It is difficult to 
determine relevance for members opposite since one has to speak 
so slowly to get to the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having elucidated that in fact only about 33% is available for 
federal government program spending and in that program spending 
are justice issues, I would say that is a matter of relevance and 
concern to all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out, absent a strong federal government to provide 
a role of leadership in this issue, we play into the hands of the 
Lucien Bouchards, the Mike Harrises and the Glen Clarks of this 
world who fervently desire the little flag sur le hood exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Francis is a great admirer of California. If we follow her 
suggestion, that is exactly how we will end up, one of the states 
governed by Washington.  That is exactly where some members 
opposite would wish us to go.  I would put a number of members in 
the category of fervently desiring to be nothing other than a 
state of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a 150-year struggle to continue to identify Canada 
as a nation and we are by and large, in spite of members 
opposite, doing rather well in accordance with the United Nations 
identifications.  By any UN standards we are doing very well.

estimates that they also refer to the <I>Fraser Forum</I> for 
bedtime reading.  That in and of itself identifies Canada as a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have been complaining for the longest time that we have been 
speaking to empty seats.  This member's speech has indicated it 
really does not make any difference if they are here or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not understand what this man has against Diane 
Francis.  This rant that was supposed to be going on about 
justice had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask him a question.  He is flanked on either side by 
members who do not seem to understand the meaning of the word 
how.  The question is, how will Bill C-68 and the registration 
make the streets of Canada any safer?  How? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to speak to 
empty seats and it is another thing to speak to empty heads. The 
issue that was raised was the fronting of the Reform Party by 
this particular columnist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go to the member's question, it reminds me of the election 
and particularly of a constituent on whose door I was knocking. 
I was getting quite a beating about this particular piece of 
legislation of interest to the member opposite.  As I was getting 
beaten up I could see that his wife was coming to the door.  She 
had a tea towel over her arm.  She slapped him and said “Don't 
listen to that idiot, he doesn't know anything about gun 
control”.  That was the response of many of my constituents in 
Scarborough East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any piece of legislation, and this is under the how part, which 
removes guns, which makes guns less accessible to the citizens of 
this country is a good piece of legislation by definition. 
During this past election we had a terrible incident involving 
long guns which I know the member opposite is quite interested 
in, resulting in the death of a spouse and four children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care how the legislation is drafted.  I do not care how 
the regulations are drafted.  In my community of Scarborough East 
this is good legislation and it gets guns inaccessible to more 
and more citizens.  Anything that does that, I am in favour of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. colleague for his background on the budget and the 
importance this government has shown toward justice issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too would like to direct a comment and a question to the hon. 
member on Bill C-68 as well.  Bill C-68 is nothing more than a 
record or an accountability of all the weapons or long arms, guns 
that are out there in Canada.  It is not dissimilar to 
refrigerators, automobiles, cars and animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that if we create this data bank of 
weapons, that the police deserve to have access to the knowledge 
of whether or not weapons are located in a house when they go to 
a domestic call?  Does the member think that is a good idea? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would point out that 
statistically most offences involving firearms are committed by 
people who are known to the victim.  It is something in the order 
of 80% or 90%.  Anytime a piece of legislation is being passed 
which makes guns and weapons generally inaccessible to those 
kinds of classes of people, we are ahead of the game.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter of registration.  As loath as I am to adopt the 
remarks of my colleague sitting with me here from Mississauga 
West, I am of the view that this is a simple form of 
registration.  It is a registration that is easily filled out. It 
is similar to a car registration.  It is similar to birth 
registration.  It is similar to other forms of registration which 
a civilized society requires.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
fail to understand the infatuation with Diane Francis but I 
suggest that he might want to give her a call sometime and talk 
to her. I can assure the hon. member that he would probably get 
an education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way suggests that a strong, big, bloated, 
fat central government somehow will serve Canadians much better 
than a decentralized government that is better able to respond to 
the needs of constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to my friend that it was the federal Liberal 
government that broke the contract it made with Canadians with 
respect to how much money it would put into health care and 
higher education.  In the 1993 election this big, bloated, fat 
central government and the Prime Minister said “Oh, no.  We are 
going to continue to spend the same amount of money on health 
care and higher education.  In fact, we will probably increase 
it”.  The Liberals blatantly broke that promise, cutting 
transfers to the provinces by $6 billion.  That is an 
unbelievably abrogation of a contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to my friend across the way that history does 
not bear out his rosy view of federalism.  In fact, if federalism 
worked so well, then why do we have a separatist movement in this 
country today that is threatening to rip the country right apart? 
It is because of their vision of federalism that tries to suck 
all the power into the middle. That is why the separatists in 
Quebec want to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to my friend, instead of worrying about the provinces 
becoming another state, I am concerned about him becoming a ward 
of the state after that nonsensical speech he gave. I say to him 
the provinces were the ones that led when it came to balancing 
budgets. The provinces are the ones who lead when it comes to 
social responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is my friend going to wake up over there and understand 
that all the power in the country does not belong just in Ottawa? 
People at the local level know how to make their own decisions 
and they do not need the nanny state in Ottawa deciding those 
things for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is appalling to the 
extreme that one of the leading members of the Reform Party 
should speak in this fashion.  The two parties that would like to 
lead us into separation sit opposite.  Those are the two parties 
that degenerate this country and make it a very difficult country 
to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's infatuation with Diane Francis, who is nothing 
other than a mouthpiece for the Reform Party, fails to understand 
in its essence the point of my speech.  I can see that the hon. 
member has missed the point of the answers that he has been 
getting from the finance minister in the House of Commons as 
well.  He is obviously not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not listening that the CHST was in fact raised from $11 
billion up to $12.5 billion.  He obviously does not understand 
the point of tax room.  He does not understand that tax room has 
in fact created more money in the hands of the Mike Harrises and 
the Lucien Bouchards of this world.  He just simply does not get 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is typical of the Reform Party members.  They do not get it. 
If we continue to downsize the federal government there will be 
no Canada as we know it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to return to the issue of gun registration.  There seems to 
be a common thread going through the Reform Party's criticism of 
the justice estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a lot of letters being waved around with various 
dates.  In the United States confronted with the increase in 
children killing children, to the tune of about every two hours 
an American child is killed because of a firearm, the NRA 
proposes they send a great big fuzzy bird into the schools, Eddy 
the Eagle they call it.  It is almost like Tommy the Tooth.  This 
is their solution.  They are going to go into the schools and 
they are going to teach kids that if they see a gun they should 
run to their parents.  In other words, the responsibility is the 
child's. That is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do want to refer to the how with a letter here from Scott 
Newark. Members quote him all the time, except when it does not 
suit them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 3, 1998 he said: “Having now seen the registration 
system demonstrated, it is clear it will live up to the claims 
originally made in relation to supply of important safety 
information for both the public and police.  Further, it should 
be an extremely valuable tool in the detection and prosecution of 
stolen or smuggled firearms”.  They listen to the CPA, listen to 
CAVEAT even when it does not suit their agenda.  What would the 
member say about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was a very fine 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I know Eddie the Eagle was a ski jumper with Great 
Britain in one of the Olympics.  I suspect that Eddie the Eagle 
as a ski jumper was not terribly successful, as will this not be 
very successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is that in this justice system, as imperfect as 
it is, it is working.  I argue that crime is down.  The 
perception of crime is up but the fact of crime is down.  That is 
a good message.  That means this government is working properly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the business of supply of the main 
estimates at this time is on Motion No. 1 on the justice.  I will 
confine my comments to the administration of justice. Although 
there is much that I would like to talk about concerning this 
rather weak government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In respect of the motion of the expenditure of funds in the 
general areas of public safety and the administration of justice, 
the justice minister and the solicitor general spend a 
considerable amount of our precious resources.  Specifically I 
want to talk about what is happening with this government in the 
administration of jails.  It is associated with the correctional 
services that it administers.  The history has been a long one 
but it has not been without problems and failures.  Considering 
the difficult and problematic people correctional services deal 
with on behalf Canadians we owe a thank you to the honourable 
record of custodial staff across this country who work in jails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received with satisfaction the government's announcement 
several weeks ago that it was going to hire more jail guards. The 
government has a labour contract in place.  I do not believe that 
it has been fulfilling it in recent years concerning staffing 
strength and being able to meet the standards that it has agreed 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an obligation to all Canadians and to the 
world community to operate prisons according to the standards of 
basic decency and human rights.  Canada has been rather 
judgmental and condescending about human rights in other 
countries but how about how we operate our jails.  Canada may 
believe that we are so much better than others.  There are 
standards that we have committed to and that we must fulfill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correctional Service Canada has an awesome mandate.  The average 
Canadian has no idea what it is like in our major prisons.  I 
have visited a number of those prisons.  I have observed that we 
have our problems but some progress is being made.  We can do so 
much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need confidence in the ability of the government to 
take care of the people's business and to administer prisons in 
full accordance with the commitments and the labour agreements 
made which are well within the bounds of the international 
standards.  A measure of a nation's stature and its civilization, 
among so many other things, is how it administers its prisons and 
treats the basic rights of even the most objectionable heinous 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A budget is being put forward tonight.  Canadians want to be 
assured that this Liberal government, which has been so poor in 
managing its other departments, this weak government through 
these requests and appropriations is fulfilling its mandate of 
public protection and basic decency both for the humane 
environment for the workers who work in jails and for their 
charges.  We must do a comprehensive job of duly considering the 
keepers and the kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this government assure this House that the funds requested 
fulfill completely all its labour contracts and the manuals of 
standards of operations that it has outlined for itself?  Will 
the funds requested permit the speedy resolution of all 
outstanding union grievances?  Is it appropriately taking into 
account the dynamics of stress and administrative pressure? 
The best riot prevention program in a jail is a system that meets 
all standards, that is fully staffed wherein there are no corners 
cut on required staff levels, bed loads and living up to the 
commitments it has made.  We need more capacity to provide a 
greater range of facilities and operations to more innovatively 
respond to the challenges presented by some of these very 
problematic individuals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to expect better of than we have been 
getting so far from this weak government. Canadians need to be 
assured that the money requested fully meets the public 
constituents' needs.  On checking the details the government's 
administration of departments lately falls short of its press 
releases.  The Liberals who smile and pronounce it repeatedly 
have been shown to fail to deliver. So please say it isn't so 
with corrections Canada or the Ministry of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on these ministers to place themselves on the record in 
this House that the administration of the federal corrections for 
instance meets all standards and commitments.  I need not remind 
the minister of what it means to mislead this House.  We have had 
many instances of the government saying one thing but in reality 
it finally turns out to be quite different upon examination.  I 
challenge the Minister of Justice and the solicitor general to 
say it clearly, place it on the line and tell it like it is.  Let 
the average rank and file guard on the tier or the control centre 
personnel read what the minister says.  May what the minister 
says match up to the real experience of staff on the line behind 
the walls.  They are paying attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can it be described how the money is asked for, will be spent 
and that there will be value for dollar?  Will the government 
fulfil its commitments?  It makes its obligations to follow the 
rules.  The shortcomings of the government in its administration 
of justice are well known across the country but the resources 
asked for under the general area we are talking about tonight in 
the estimates are considerable.  Built into that area are the 
mandates of the solicitor general and the justice minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us first review what is contemplated under justice and then 
we will recount what the solicitor general wants.  We should put 
what is being asked for specifically on the public record.  Under 
the Minister of Justice and operating expenditures, the grants 
listed in the estimates in contributions are $477,456,000. 
Related to that are the human rights commission with $12,874,000; 
the commissioner for federal judicial affairs with $4,354,000; 
the Federal Court of Canada with $27,002,000; the human rights 
tribunal with $2,076,000; the Law Commission of Canada with 
$2,791,000; offices of the information and privacy commissioner 
of Canada with $5,760,000; the Supreme Court of Canada with 
$10,090,000; the Tax Court of Canada with $9,304,000; the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee with $1,239,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the solicitor general and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police with $900,459,880; the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police external review committee with $718,000; the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police public complaints commission with 
$3,123,000. It continues in the justice area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be voting on every one of these tonight. For 
the Department of Justice operating expenditures, the grants 
listed in the estimates and contributions total $115,248,185. 
There is also the solicitor general, Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service with $5,580,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the government to respond based on what it has 
requested.  Will it give value for money?  Will the reality 
fulfill its rhetoric and its press releases? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is watching.  Canadians are watching.  What is 
being expended is an astounding amount of money in the general 
area of justice, yet the dissatisfaction about the government's 
justice and public safety agenda has never been worse.  There is 
little public confidence in the justice system and Liberals are 
responsible.  They are accountable.  I challenge the Minister of 
Justice and the solicitor general to justify their spending 
requests to this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the member and his remarks. 
Quite frankly, I felt it was a Liberal speech.  He talked about 
the mandate to make sure that the administration of our prison 
system kept basic standards, kept confidence with our labour 
agreements.  He talked about making sure the keepers and the kept 
are treated with a basic decency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the member's remarks.  I think our prison system 
should be an environment that can foster rehabilitation and 
renewal and not one where people are treated in a way that we see 
in movies where prisons are like dungeons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem I have is that for the last 10 years I have been 
listening to members of the Reform Party and their chant 
constantly about cut, cut, cut, its obsession with the deficit, 
the debt and the fiscal framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a member from the Reform Party tonight pleading the 
prison system of Canada be properly funded.  Is this a change of 
gears from the member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby? 
Does this reflect the position of the party where all of a sudden 
it comes full circle and is now saying the cuts have gone too 
far, which I personally believe, and we are now going to begin, 
which I would celebrate, with the correctional service system of 
Canada and make sure that it is properly funded so that the 
management there, the keepers and the kept, are treated in a way 
that they have a decent shot at rehabilitation and renewal. Which 
pathway are we to choose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was not too long ago 
when we brought attention to this House about how certain prisons 
were about ready to blow as far as riots are concerned and the 
management-staff relations were right on the edge. That has to do 
with funding.  It has to do with administrative attitude and it 
has to do with care of how the government administers its 
prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite pleased to hear that the solicitor general a few 
weeks ago announced something in the order of 1,000 new staff 
across the country would be hired.  We applaud that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no change in message from the Reform Party. We have 
always advocated we needed more facilities, not just brick and 
mortar in building more jails.  We need more of a broader set of 
complex facilities.   Some of them may be without locked doors, 
but a range of facilities to respond to the challenges if we are 
to have a justice system to respond more resolutely to crime. 
That means there will be perhaps some type of custodial 
facilities.  But that does not necessarily mean the old-fashioned 
high tiers with a dome and bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly it does mean the kind of facility that may respond to 
the treatment needs of individuals and also adequately separates 
different offenders from each other, specializes in programs but 
also controls their access to the community.  We also consider 
the protection of the community first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, the Reform Party is bringing the message to the 
country of fiscal responsibility so that we can generate the 
wealth to pay for the social programs that Canadians want, for 
the people's agenda we might say is to provide more facilities in 
Correctional Service Canada. That has been the people's agenda 
but it certainly has not been the bureaucratic top down agenda 
that we have from governments for the last 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has squeezed Correctional Service Canada.  Yet the public has 
been asking Correctional Service Canada to do things when it 
really never had the resources to do. Because of the fiscal 
irresponsibility in other areas and the failure to set 
appropriate priorities, Correctional Service Canada has really 
been in a tough situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have 
been hearing a lot of criticism from the Reform Party today 
directed toward the government's Bill C-68 on the registration of 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little confused.  I have a titbit of information that I 
would like to share and I would like my hon. colleague from the 
Reform Party to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reading from <I>Hansard</I>, November 6, 1991, the comments 
of the hon. member for Edmonton North who was referring to a 
Canadian Police Association survey.  She said that over 90% of 
the respondents believed that guns of all kinds should be 
registered.  She agreed with that and went on to say that she 
thought every Canadian would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just what message is the Reform Party giving?  We hear it 
criticizing the government and now we hear the comments of the 
member for Edmonton North.  I would like the hon. member to speak 
to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know which member 
he was talking about.  We had no Reform Party members from 
Edmonton North in the House of Commons in 1991.  We had one 
member from Beaver River and that was it until 1993 when we had 
the Reform wave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always been consistent in saying that if the gun 
registration program could clearly be demonstrated to be 
efficacious for public safety we would support it.  In view of a 
lack of evidence it clearly appeared to be a misappropriation of 
public money and should be reassigned to other areas of the 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supportive of gun control.  We have had handgun control 
in Canada since 1934 or something like that and we never objected 
to Bill C-17.  However, it was escalated to the final level of 
wasting money on a program which the government has failed to 
demonstrate will accomplish its stated objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is laid aside for a program and it has stated objectives, 
but it has failed to justify that it will deliver the stated 
program objectives.  We are predicting at some point in the light 
of day after we spend several hundred million dollars down this 
blind alley that it will in retrospect be seen to be 
misappropriated money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not spend that money on the Young Offenders Act and 
other facilities rather than waste it on gun registration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not want to name the member, but I found out that at the 
time the member was representing the riding of Beaver River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think that clears it up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague 
opposite and two things caught my attention:  weak government and 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just wondering what he is referring to.  Is he referring to 
the government of 1993 that swept in with a majority?  Is he 
referring to the government of 1997 that swept in with a 
majority?  Which part of history does he not understand?  There 
were two mandates and two majorities, but I will put that aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest that he wants more jail guards, 
rights of offenders and on and on.  I did not hear anything about 
treatment.  Is the Reform agenda more jails and more jail guards? 
Does Reform not have compassion?  Does Reform not understand the 
need for treatment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what history is my hon. colleague talking about?  If he 
wants to give us a history lesson, by all means let us talk about 
1993 and 1997.  Second, what about treatment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief.  We 
are talking about who is accountable and who is responsible. 
We believe we have had very poor administration of public 
business since 1993.

prisoner care.  We got rid of that years ago.  It is not someone 
who has a disease and therefore some kind of treatment or 
medicine is applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we administer prisons or programs we must provide options 
and we must provide consequences.  We can provide opportunities 
for offenders to rehabilitate themselves. In some cases these 
individuals were never habilitated in the first place and were 
the walking wounded in the psychological sense and/or physical 
sense.  We must provide some types of programming, but to say 
that we can just write out a prescription in the medical model 
ideology is a long outdated notion in corrections.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join in this debate.  Let me start by 
saying that in the last election there were two particular issues 
relating to justice and justice estimates on which I campaigned. 
One was gun registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign I ended every debate with these 
concluding remarks:  “If you in this audience do not want gun 
registration, do not vote for me.  Rather, if you are against it, 
you want to vote for the New Democratic Party, you want to vote 
for the Conservative Party or you want to vote for the Reform 
Party”.  In every debate that was one of my concluding remarks 
and the results were 28 points ahead of the Reform Party, 28 
points ahead of the Conservative and the New Democrats were much 
further back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents fundamentally feel that it is not too much to 
register guns in many ways like is done in Europe.  We do not 
want to have the gun culture in this country that exists south of 
the border where all too often we see the tragedy of innocent 
victims being gunned down ruthlessly and needlessly. More and 
more we are seeing young children killing other young children 
and their teachers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make absolutely no apologies for it.  I stand with the chiefs 
of police and with victims groups.  I think our party, the 
governing party, recognizes the need to be dealt with.  We 
definitely do not want to adopt the culture south of our border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get on to another very important part of the justice 
agenda that we will be implementing.  Let me ask members of all 
parties, all members of parliament, to play a role in this 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put together a $32 million community safety crime 
prevention program which will afford opportunity to each riding 
across the country to join in the crusade, to join in the project 
to prevent crime. 
We will do that by working with people at the community level: 
police forces, service clubs, school boards, recreational and 
planning departments of municipalities and various neighbourhood 
groups.  Our challenge is how we as a country can improve our 
record of crime prevention and have safer streets and homes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to being elected to parliament I was executive director of 
an organization called Youth in Conflict with the Law from 1976 
to 1993.  For some who might recall, Youth in Conflict with the 
Law was to be under the youth in conflict with the law act.  It was 
changed to the Young Offenders Act in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to observe the workings of the criminal justice 
system firsthand at the criminal courts.  I also had the 
opportunity to work with other organizations involved in 
community justice and community corrections.  I can say that much 
pioneering work was done in my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Worth, head of the Mennonite Central Committee, worked 
with communities right across the country trying to look at 
alternative ways of dealing with crime and conflict resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked with John Bilton of the John Howard Society.  His 
organization was also very much involved in preventive work.  It 
had anti-shoplifting campaigns which involved young people. Young 
people would be diverted from the court system and would go 
through alternative measures. Not only did this lessen the strain 
on the courts.  It also provided a much more meaningful 
resolutions to the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dean Peachey pioneered community mediation in our community where 
disputants were brought together to see if with a trained 
facilitator they could reach a successful resolution.  While 
originally there was a great deal of resistance to that program 
eventually it was embraced by the courts and the municipalities 
and now a system of conflict resolution exists in schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ken Motts pioneered the first halfway house for provincially 
sentenced inmates in Ontario called Kitchener House. 
Unfortunately that program was closed a couple of years ago by 
Mike Harris and his agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important program pioneered in my community through 
community justice initiatives and the Mennonite Central Committee 
was the victim-offender reconciliation program.  Let me tell some 
of my colleagues how that program works.  It is fundamental to 
the whole issue of preventing crime and creating safer and more 
secure communities.  It also deals with the rights of victims.

young person who broke into a business establishment or a private

break and entry.  We all know the sense of violation the victim 
of that offence feels.  Somebody has come into their home, which 
is their castle, invaded their private space, caused damage and 
committed theft.  Many people who are victims of crime feel a 
personal sense of violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall one of the cases that I worked on under the 
victim-offender reconciliation model.  It involved a 17 year old 
who was under the supervision of our organization, Youth in 
Conflict with the Law.  During the course of the pretrial 
hearing before that person was sentenced for the offence we met 
with the individual whose store he had broken into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a humorous side to the break and enter because the two 
young people broke into a restaurant and somehow managed to lock 
themselves inside.  It took them a great deal of effort to break 
out.  Mind you, they rifled the cash register and took $20. 
Ultimately they were caught because when the police came to 
investigate they followed their footprints which led to the house 
where they lived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first impact of bringing the two people together, the victim 
and the offender, was that the restaurant owner felt a sense of 
relief.  He was looking upon a young person of 17 years of age 
who was not a scholar, who was not particularly accomplished in 
any area.  Some could say that he had some tough knocks in life. 
There was a sense of relief that the person he was dealing with 
was not a Clifford Olson, a Paul Bernardo or whatever one's worst 
nightmare might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After we went through that exercise, the resolution we arrived 
at was that this young person would pay back something like $300 
to fix the cash register and to make restitution for the damage 
caused as well as the money taken.  In this case and in most 
cases of victim-offender reconciliation the money was paid back 
and the young person learned from the experience.  The court 
made sure it was part of the sentence that the money was paid 
back.  As well, the court made sure that the young person did 
community service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, under our Criminal Code, break and enter 
is liable for life imprisonment.  That really does not happen, 
but that is what the law allows.  Any time of incarceration in 
this case would have been a waste of taxpayers' money.  This 
young person would have been sent into an environment where he 
would have been exposed to more negative influences and probably 
would have come out a much more accomplished criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the people who played a very key role in our justice 
efforts was Henry Bloos who was a teacher at Kitchener 
Collegiate.  Henry Bloos used to teach law.  He started a law day 
at KCI that eventually involved the whole regional municipality 
of Waterloo.  Within a few years of its establishment it became 
the single biggest extra curricular day for students in the 
Waterloo region.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a year, starting in 1978, in order to educate the community 
and get people involved in community justice and crime 
prevention, we established what was fondly known as justice 
dinners.  Our 20th justice dinner took place this past April and 
we were fortunate to have the Minister of Justice attend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no longer the people I referred to previously who are 
putting on this justice dinner.  The justice dinner is now being 
put on by the community safety crime prevention council of 
Waterloo region.  That council is a project of my community, 
funded by regional council to the tune of $75,000 a year in cash 
as well as the provision of office space and other resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to say that we have two members of this 
parliament on this side of the House, the member for Kitchener 
Centre and the member for Waterloo—Wellington, who were members 
of the regional council that gave funding to this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project initially was headed by the chief of police for 
Waterloo region.  The council includes people from justice 
agencies.  It includes people from probation and parole.  It 
includes people from community social services, people from the 
school boards, people from the planning departments and the 
commissioner of social services.  It has fairly heavy 
representation from the provincial police.  It includes the now 
mayor of the city of Waterloo, Joan McKinnon, the commissioner 
and director of family and children services, as well as the 
executive director of the Children's Aid Society.  The list goes 
on.  There are 33 members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have taken up the challenge of co-ordinating in our 
community the services of the various governments, be they the 
school board, social services, children's aid, the police, the 
planning departments or the voluntary sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They produced numerous planning documents and strategies to deal 
with prevention in our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first report came out in November 1996.  The second report 
came out in 1997.  The third report came out in 1998.  They came 
up with a proposal to have a unified community response to deal 
with the issue of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec deals with crime much more effectively 
than we do in the rest of the country.  Crime is very expensive. 
The federal and provincial governments spend $9.6 billion a year 
on crime.  If we include the victims and other costs associated 
with crime we are talking about $46 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about in the first year of this crime 
prevention effort is $32 million.  It is a little more than $1 
per capita.  The money that we spend, the $9.6 billion, is more 
than $300 per capita.  Clearly what we are trying to do is to 
start diverting some of the money at prevention so we do not have 
the victims, we do not have the shattered lives.  Then we will 
have contributing members of society, as well as safe homes and 
safe streets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we deal with the the Young Offenders Act and with the 
people who exploit it, be it for economic or political 
considerations, let me say that we imprison 15 times as many 
young offenders as they do in Australia or in New Zealand.  We 
imprison 10 times as many young offenders as they do in the 
western European countries.  But to our shame, we incarcerate two 
and a half times as many young offenders as they do in the United 
States of America.  That is a shame.  That is not the perception 
that the Canadian public has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perception that the Canadian public has, if they watch the 
proceedings of this House or if they watch the media which likes 
to exploit crime, is that we have a system which is in disarray 
and we have a society that is not as safe as it really is.  The 
perception has been driving the agenda and it is time for us to 
get together and make sure that the reality drives the agenda and 
that we work on realistic solutions to make Canada one of the 
safest countries in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague with great interest and 
I was delighted to hear what he had to say with respect to all 
the work that has been done in the region of Kitchener—Waterloo. 
I was impressed with everybody who is concerned.  I was really 
impressed with the effort that is going on in his community to 
make it a better community.  I congratulate him for being there 
20 years for his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with him an instance that occurred in my riding 
right after the Young Offenders Act was implemented.  A young 
offender committed a multiple killing and unfortunately received 
only a three year sentence.  It is in those instances that I 
agree with my colleague, who I hope will find it in his heart to 
agree that moving toward publishing the names of the young 
offenders and bringing them to adult court is something that is 
definitely needed.  If these measures were in place in our 
communities this killing might not have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his intervention.  First, let me say that there is a need for 
prisons to house people who are a danger to the community.  There 
is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague that a three year sentence was not 
adequate.  That has been changed.  Under the changes that will be 
tabled in the House that will be changed again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I point out to my colleague that attempted murder and 
homicide make up one-tenth of 1% of crime.  So we are talking 
about a very small number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the offences occurring under the Young Offenders Act are 
property offences, law and order offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell my colleague that his point is very correct.  We 
have to assure the public that for those offenders, and there are 
not as many as people would have us believe, lengthy jail terms 
are appropriate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening very intently to the hon. 
member for Kitchener—Waterloo and I have a great deal of respect 
for the work that he did within the justice system prior to 
becoming a member of the House.  He has displayed at the justice 
committee a great depth of knowledge in the area of victims' 
rights.  I know he has made a personal commitment and has been a 
part of various systems within his riding.  He encourages 
restorative justice.  He has spoken very eloquently with respect 
to victims.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance, given a choice of priorities, would the hon. member 
prefer to see astronomical and staggering amounts of money set 
aside by his government to further this ill-conceived gun 
registry?  We are talking money in excess of $133 million thus 
far and the amount is still accumulating as we speak.  It will go 
up to the half a billion dollar mark before this is up and 
running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not going to impact in any significant way on violent 
crime.  It has been stated time and time again and I think the 
hon. member will also agree that for crimes committed in fits of 
passion it will not matter whether a serial number is stamped on 
the butt of a rifle.  Violent criminals are going to be loath to 
register their guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member this question in a very non-partisan way 
and on an intellectual level.  Would he not prefer to see his 
government's commitment to justice result in moneys spent in the 
area of furthering the cause of victims or furthering the cause 
of front line police officers, to beef up our justice system in 
that regard?  Would he not prefer putting the money into some of 
the more innovative approaches to justice that he speaks of, some 
of the preventative programs he has initiated in his own 
constituency? Would this not further the cause of justice as 
opposed to this priority decision that has been made on this 
ill-fated ill-conceived gun registry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for 
his question.  I note that he is a former crown attorney.  He 
certainly has some knowledge of the criminal justice system.  I 
very much enjoy working with him.  Unfortunately he missed my 
opening comments where I actually talked about gun control, the 
position I took in the last election campaign and why I supported 
it. To recap, victims wanted us to pass it and they supported 
it.  My community virtually demanded it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue that law-abiding people will register guns 
and criminals will not.  As a crown attorney, the member will 
know that at some point this week there will be a raid on a 
motorcycle club some place.  Chances are there will be all sorts 
of guns around. When a police officer is able to say “This gun 
is not registered and you have committed an offence,” then we 
have done something good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also mentioned that it is too easy to obtain guns in this 
country.  We do not want to repeat some of the mistakes made 
south of the border where children are killing children and their 
teachers.  We must have control of firearms. During the election 
campaign I was very up front. At the conclusion of my remarks I 
said if you do not support Bill C-68, if you do not believe we 
should have gun control, do not vote for me, vote for the New 
Democrats, the Conservatives or the Reform Party.  There was a 
lot of support for it in my community which was attested to by 
the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the expensive cost of crime.  He knows 
that the cost of crime in Canada is $46 billion.  What we spend 
at the government level is $9.6 billion.  What we are talking 
about in terms of crime prevention is really a small amount of 
money. We are talking $32 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that I have lobbied the justice minister 
that we should reallocate some of the money that we have now 
allocated under the federal government budget.  Thirty-two 
million dollars represents 1% of the federal budget for justice 
and the solicitor general.  Let us reallocate something like 5% 
over the coming years. Let us help communities to come up with 
the plans, the strategies and the projects to battle crime and to 
work on crime prevention.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this matter.  I 
notice the member for Wild Rose is lamenting the fact that he has 
not been recognized by the Chair to speak, but I would simply ask 
him to be patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and other Canadians would like to think that what we are 
debating and discussing here tonight is somehow relevant to 
ordinary Canadians from coast to coast.  Yesterday in the House 
what became crystal clear to all Canadians from coast to coast 
and to every member in the House, if they already were not aware, 
is that this House of Commons for all intents and purposes is 
irrelevant.  It does not mean anything.  Decisions are not taken 
in this Chamber.  Decisions are taken behind closed doors, in the 
Prime Minister's office and in the House leader's office.  Five 
men get together and decide what the business of the House will 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday while this House was sitting, not a single, solitary 
government member was present during debate.  As a result of the 
total and complete abdication of its responsibility to govern, 
the opposition parties passed a motion which carried unanimously. 
That motion would prevent the government from introducing any 
form of closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more important is that because of the abdication of 
responsibility of the Government of Canada, and we are talking 
about the Government of Canada.  Think of what could have 
happened yesterday in this House because of the fact that there 
was not a single Liberal member present.  The opposition could 
have declared war yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members laugh and chuckle but as a result of the absence of the 
Government of Canada, the opposition could have completely 
abolished the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The opposition 
could have defeated the government on a vote of confidence.  That 
is the respect the government has for this Chamber, for the House 
of Commons.  Not a single, solitary member was present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Canadians recognize how totally irrelevant the 
House is. That action yesterday crystallized for Canadians how 
irrelevant this place is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an hour or so the government wants to pass through this House 
some 70-odd votes.  It wants authorization to spend billions of 
taxpayers' dollars.  It expects, as a result of a backroom deal 
by five House leaders, that this House will totally expedite all 
the business of the House this evening.  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of York—South Weston put their trust in me.  They 
voted for me in the last election campaign not to be a party to 
backroom deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There were a few points of order today about the relevance of 
speeches.  We are dealing with justice.  I do not hear the word 
justice mentioned and I do not see any relevance in this speech 
to the topic at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member for 
York—South Weston knows that the motion we are debating before 
the House is a motion to concur in the estimates of the 
Department of Justice and that the speeches are to be on the 
subject of justice.  I know that he is coming to that subject 
very shortly in his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I am speaking about 
is justice.  It is democratic justice.  It is criminal justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member knows that the 
estimates of the Department of Justice are a different thing from 
the abstract notion of justice.  They are rather concrete and 
deal with dollars and cents. That is what the subject of the 
debate is this evening.  I invite the hon. member to direct his 
comments to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I started by saying that 
the debate is irrelevant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the justice department and the allocation 
of sufficient funds, some $193 million to fund justice.  What I 
am saying is that it is irrelevant what we are talking about. 
But I will speak about justice and how unjust it is to put the 
House through this debate to talk about the criminal justice 
system. If members want me to talk about the criminal justice 
system, I will talk about it, but it is irrelevant because 
decisions have already been taken in the backrooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a bill before the last parliament to repeal section 745 of 
the Criminal Code.  That bill, to repeal section 745 of the 
Criminal Code which allows convicted killers to apply to have 
their release date reduced from 25 years down to 15 years, was 
passed by the House of Commons at second reading.  It was passed 
by the House of Commons with some 80 Liberals, and I was part of 
that caucus, supporting that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give another example of how irrelevant the House is.  The 
House passed the legislation in principle to repeal section 745. 
That was the intent of parliament.  It expressed its will, each 
member in a free vote.  What did the government do?  It killed 
the bill at committee.  That is what it did.  It pretends to be 
democratic.  It pretends that the private members process is 
important.  It pretends that somehow what we do in the House is 
relevant, but it is irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until and unless members of the House take a stand, our 
parliamentary system will continue to degenerate.  Canadians will 
continue to lose confidence and have contempt for this 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that collectively we are looked down upon by 
Canadians?  Collectively as politicians we are told day in day 
out, justifiably so by Canadians, that they have no confidence in 
this institution of parliament.  They see things like the 
government abandoning its responsibility yesterday and not a 
single member being present.  They see the House of Commons 
passing a bill to ameliorate the criminal justice system with 
respect to 745.  There is the hepatitis C issue, and the list 
goes on and on. Is it any wonder that we have to hang our heads 
in shame? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government with the complicity of the opposition parties 
wants to pass a bill in less than a day to increase the pay and 
benefits for members of parliament.  Think about it.  When it 
comes to our own collective pockets we are prepared to pass a 
bill—we are not, the backroom boys are—and members are not 
objecting.  They come to me.  I have had maybe a dozen or 15 
members ask me as an independent member to please hold up 
consent.  Please do not give unanimous consent to this.  They are 
afraid to speak out because they will be reprimanded by the 
powers that be, by those unelected people in the Prime Minister's 
office who have control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said time and time again that we do not live in a 
democracy.  We say this sometimes frivolously, but the reality is 
we do not live in a democracy.  This is nothing short of a 
glorified dictatorship.  This country is run by half a dozen 
people, half of whom are unelected, as some hon. members have 
said and I have repeated many times.  Unelected people make 
decisions with respect to the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the public interest?  Who is watching for the public 
interest?  I am not setting myself up as some saviour for the 
public interest but I have been given a voice as a result of the 
people's mandate in York—South Weston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pay and benefits, run it through in a day.  Why is that bill 
dealing with remuneration, pensions, salaries of members of 
parliament not being referred to a parliamentary committee?  Why 
is it that witnesses are not being called?

the public interests as opposed to serving themselves?  I would 
like to attend an open meeting an give my views on pay and 
benefits.  There has to be in the process some transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leaders met, all the political parties in this 
chamber, and took a decision with respect to pay and benefits. 
They expect everyone in this House, including me, to support it. 
I think not. I do not intend to. I am going to insist we not 
participate in these votes these evening and that we, as a 
parliament, sit down and find ways to make this parliament more 
democratic.  That is the only way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I woke up this morning I expected three votes at 5.30 p.m. 
today.  I was in Toronto.  Then I get word that there are 70 some 
votes taking place today.  Most members did not know.  They were 
told to hurry back.  Is that any way to run the Government of 
Canada, by having no members present when the House of Commons is 
sitting and then pile up these votes?  Two weeks ago we had about 
100 votes in this House.  I will say without equivocation that 
the majority of members— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am not sure I grasp the relevancy of this debate to the justice 
estimates.  I do not see the connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have already indicated to the hon. 
member for York South—Weston the need for relevance in his 
remarks to the justice estimates.  I know he will go back to 
those estimates very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it appears the government 
does not like listening to what I am saying. Well, tough.  I was 
given voice to speak and I will speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants me to speak about justice.  Let us talk about criminal 
justice.  The member was elected in Etobicoke.  He was given a 
mandate to represent the people of Etobicoke, not to be a trained 
seal.  He was elected, as I was elected, to speak out on their 
behalf, not to defer to some unelected people.  I want to tell 
the hon. member what the people of Etobicoke are saying to him 
and what they expect of him as their member of parliament.  They 
expect him to come into this House, to go to caucus and to speak 
out about criminal law reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member what has he said about criminal law reform 
in the House of Commons.  Has he simply deferred.  The member 
laughs.  Let him laugh.  I hope his constituents recognize how 
ill served they are in the House of Commons.  If I can help in 
any way to inform his constituents I intend to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back to justice.  It relates directly to the comments 
I made about the relevancy of parliament.  If this parliament 
were relevant it would be passing laws to ameliorate, to fix, to 
reform a criminal justice system in this country that is broken. 
It is a criminal justice system that allows an individual who 
raped and murdered 11 children to make a mockery out of the 
criminal justice system by applying and exercising his rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government not stopped and blocked my bill, Clifford 
Olson would not have had the opportunity last summer to make a 
mockery of the criminal justice system.  He forced the families 
to relive the trauma, the feelings of total devastation of 
learning their children were raped and murdered.  This government 
decided that Clifford Olson, not the public, could have a say.  I 
use Clifford Olson because he is probably the most notorious 
example. The member from Etobicoke agreed with the position of 
the Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government supports a criminal justice system that caters 
to the accused, to the convicted, to inmates and to prisoners and 
sets aside the public interest, the interest of victims.  Is it 
any wonder Canadians have lost faith in the criminal justice 
system, in parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can go on about the Young Offenders Act.  The minister kept 
repeating in due course she would bring in amendments.  What has 
she brought in?  Absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has been in office for five years and it has 
done nothing meaningful when it comes to reforming the Young 
Offenders Act which invites 16 and 17-year olds to break the law. 
It treats 16 and 17-year olds like children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you are 16 or 17 you are old enough to drive a car, you are 
old enough to get married, you are old enough to leave home, but 
the criminal justice system in this country says you do not know 
the difference between right and wrong and we are not going to 
treat you like an adult.  What pure nonsense. They know the 
difference between right and wrong and they ought to be dealt 
with in adult court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the line the Liberals continue to throw back, that we 
want to lock up children.  That is a crock.  Subject the 16 and 
17-year olds to the criminal justice system.  Age will always be 
a mitigating factor at sentencing, not with respect to 
culpability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a 16-year old murders or rapes or robs or commits any serious 
offence, once there is a finding of guilt, let the defence make 
an argument for leniency because of age.  This government says 
they are to be treated more leniently.  Is it any wonder that the 
police and those involved with the criminal justice system have 
no confidence in it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know who Paul Bernardo is.  He is rotting in a jail 
somewhere in Kingston, but he is going to have the same right 
that Clifford Olson had.  What about his accomplice? Paul 
Bernardo will be able to apply in about 10 or 11 years to chop 
the families of the victims after the crimes he committed. What 
about his accomplice?  She is eligible for parole today as we 
speak because of the criminal justice system. Talk about justice. 
She will be released from prison and there is nothing the system 
can do in less than eight years I think it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  She can vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  She can vote. She can even have her 
sex changed, believe it or not.  Cable television in their cells, 
computers, photocopiers.  Clifford Olson had access to computers, 
photocopiers.  He was entering poetry contests in the United 
States.  He had pornography in his cell.  He was sending 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the criminal justice system we are talking about.  This 
is the criminal justice system crafted by Liberals, by bleeding 
hearts in the sixties and seventies, and it continues to be 
protected.  This criminal justice system continues to be 
protected by the government.  Is it serving the interests of 
Canadians?  No.  If you ask Canadians what they want done, they 
want a fair criminal justice system.  They want a criminal 
justice system that puts the rights of citizens before the rights 
of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What action has this government taken?  Very little. The 
government is big on photo ops whether it is in Naples or Rome or 
Havana or other parts of the world, but when it comes to concrete 
action here in the House of Commons, the government deserves an 
<I>F</I>.  We are talking about the criminal justice system here 
and I could speak for hours about the deficiencies of the system 
and how the public is not served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have two penitentiary systems. Who is serving the public 
interest?  We have a provincial system.  If you are sentenced to 
two years less a day, you go into the provincial penitentiary 
system, provincial parole board. 
If it is two years plus a day, you go into the federal 
penitentiary system.  Who is being served by that?  It is because 
of turf wars between the provinces and the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a system that does not work.  Is the government prepared 
to fix the system?  No.  We have a criminal justice system that 
provides for concurrent sentencing.  Someone can walk out of this 
place, kill one person, plan in a very deliberate way the murder 
of two, three, five, ten, fifteen, twenty, commit an act of 
terrorism, kill two hundred people and the penalty is the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think if we had a fairer system of justice, 
consecutive sentencing would be provided for.  In the case of 
Paul Bernardo who was convicted of murdering two innocent young 
women, instead of being eligible for parole after 25 years at the 
very least, if we had consecutive sentencing he would not be 
eligible for 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the Liberals do not want to change that.  They do not want 
to change that because the backroom boys have said no.  I know 
individual members of parliament, if there were free votes in 
this place, if this place were relevant, could correct the 
criminal justice system.  We could correct a lot of the 
deficiencies within the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we do that we have to correct this place.  We have to 
make the Parliament of Canada relevant.  It is time for electoral 
reform.  It is time for parliamentary reform.  I know there is 
considerable support for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently in British Columbia where I gave a speech about 
the lack of democracy in this country. When I speak to people in 
other countries or in Canada, when I point out to them some of 
the realities of Ottawa, they become very disturbed.  They become 
very concerned and ask what they can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example in the minute that remains.  We call 
Canada a democracy.  In the last election campaign more than six 
out of ten people who went to vote did not vote Liberal.  They 
did not vote for the Prime Minister.  They voted for other 
political parties.  They voted for other individuals.  They 
rejected the government, over 60%.  Only 38% of those who voted 
voted for the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of our electoral system, one man is given virtual 
dictatorial power with the support of 38% of the electorate in 
Canada.  Is that democracy?  I think not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member referred I 
believe six times to the absence of members of parliament. I 
thought while we were participating in debate we were not 
supposed to refer to the presence or absence.  Since Mr. Speaker 
let it go six times, I decided I would ask the member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is going to have to 
ask questions about justice issues since we are discussing the 
justice estimates.  On two occasions I had to intervene to deal 
with the hon. member for York South—Weston because he was going 
off on other topics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my correction may not have been as efficacious as the 
parliamentary secretary would have hoped, but I am sure he would 
not want to provoke further difficulty for the Chair and that he 
will want to ask about the justice estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in essence, 
I would like to maybe correct the claim of the member for York 
South—Weston that had we removed section 745, Clifford Olson 
would not have been able to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows full well that even rescinding section 745 of 
the Criminal Code would be retroactive and therefore the likes of 
Bernardo or Clifford Olson would not have been taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes we made will prevent Paul Bernardo from applying 
because he has to be able to prove with a certain amount of cause 
that he will be able to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member one question.  He refers to the 
relevancy of parliament.  Is it relevant that he attends the 
House of Commons only on Tuesdays, especially when there are a 
lot of votes, to make his record better?  Is relevancy only for 
members on this side?  Is it maybe relevant for independent 
members to attend parliament on days other than Tuesdays?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is mistaken 
and I would expect the member to at least be honest.  To suggest 
that I am only here on Tuesdays is erroneous and he knows it. If 
he wants to make those statements outside the House of Commons 
where he is subject to slander laws then I challenge him to make 
those statements outside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the hon. member that I will not hesitate for a moment 
to issue a writ against the member.  He has a responsibility as 
an officer, as a parliamentary secretary, not only to be honest 
to the House— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member knows that 
all hon. members are always considered to be honest in their 
dealings in the House.  I do not think he would want to suggest 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will simply consider 
the source.  He speaks of Clifford Olson.  He says that his 
application could not have been denied.  That is not true.  I 
suggest he get an opinion from the Department of Justice.  He has 
access to the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He might have someone's opinion that it might have somehow 
contravened the right of Clifford Olson to apply under section 
745.  I would like the member to address the point that the House 
of Commons passed a bill to repeal section 745.  Notwithstanding 
the argument he is putting forward that Clifford Olson could have 
applied in any event, which is not true, and even if it were true 
that Clifford Olson's constitutional rights would have somehow 
been affected, the House had the authority to use the 
notwithstanding clause to say we in parliament make laws, not the 
courts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Clifford Olson and others like him should not be 
permitted to apply for early release.  We could have invoked the 
notwithstanding clause.  The member knows that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what 
a pleasure it was to hear somebody say exactly some of the things 
I have been saying for quite some time about the way this place 
operates.  I agree fully with what the member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a little discouraging.  I have been on duty all day.  It 
is past 9 p.m.  It could be 4 a.m.  We will go through a pile of 
votes that there is no point in anybody voting on because the 
government has already made up its mind how it will turn out.  It 
has done that behind closed doors.  It will boldly say that is 
how democracy works.  That is hog manure.  I am tired of hearing 
that baloney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the years 1984 to 1993 did the Conservative Party under 
Mulroney do anything different?  The GST people who were kicked 
out, was that an accident or was there an error?  What was the 
difference back then?  What is the difference between the 
Conservatives and the Liberals in the last 20 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member for York 
South—Weston will seek to make the answer relevant to the 
justice estimates, as I am sure the hon. member for Wild Rose was 
doing his best to do with that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could be cynical and 
say there is no difference between the Mulroney government and 
the Chrétien government.  It is not the government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Once again, the hon. member of York 
South—Weston cannot refer to members of the House by name. He is 
an experienced member and he knows that.  I invite him to comply 
with the rules in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we ought not to look at 
the problem from a partisan perspective.  Regardless of who forms 
the government and given the present way we conduct business in 
Ottawa, it will be no different if the Reform Party forms the 
government or the Conservative Party or the NDP.  We have to 
change the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Winston Churchill, perhaps the most learned student of 
parliamentary democracy, often said that in order for 
parliamentary democracy to survive it must continually evolve. It 
must continually be made better and more sensitive to the people 
that it purports to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not ameliorating the parliamentary system. If anything we 
are going backward.  That is the reason public opinion poll after 
public opinion poll rates parliamentarians, MPs, almost at the 
bottom in terms of public respect and integrity.  That is why 
Canadians have so very little confidence in the parliamentary 
system.

parliament could do it—are individual members of parliament who 
will take a stand and say “Enough is enough.  We are going to 
take control.  We are going to democratize the House of 
Commons”.  I intend to do that in approximately 40 minutes 
because I do not intend to give my consent to any motion that 
requires unanimous consent to expedite the business of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government showed its contempt for the people of Canada, for 
the Parliament of Canada— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington on a question or comment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the member for York South—Weston knows and the 
member for Wild Rose ought to know, the issues we are debating 
tonight are considered and deliberated on in committee, either 
the finance committee or the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a direct question of the member for York 
South—Weston.  Does he have the courage to tell the House 
whether in this current session of parliament he has attended a 
single committee meeting and if— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  We are on a debate on 
the justice estimates and I urge hon. members to be relevant in 
their questions and in their comments.  I cut off the hon. member 
for York South—Weston in his reply because in my view it was not 
relevant to the debate before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members want to debate the justice estimates.  That 
is why we are here.  I invite the question to be relevant to the 
justice estimates.  It will be a very short question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope I was not out of 
order but the member for York South—Weston keeps alluding to the 
fact that the rest of us do not work.  My role is not just in the 
House of Commons.  My role is also to work in the standing 
committees, to listen to witnesses and to discuss issues like the 
estimates and the justice issues the member is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for York South—Weston give us a sense of his 
involvement in this type of activity of parliament?  Does he 
concede that it is an important activity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as those who are 
listening have noticed and as other Canadians have noticed, the 
only thing Liberal members can do is to attack me personally as 
they did during the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Let them carry on, Mr. Speaker. In the 
election campaign of a year ago they levelled personal attacks 
instead of speaking to the merits of what I was talking about.  I 
did not attack any individual personally other than the member 
from Etobicoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking to some fundamental issues that all Canadians 
wanted to see addressed.  If all the Liberals can resort to is 
name calling and personal attacks, let them do it because their 
candidate lost in the riding of York South—Weston. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
following the member for York South—Weston is an honour.  I 
certainly agree with everything he said.  I hope members of the 
House do not think for a moment I am trying to reflect on the way 
things are today by referring to what happened in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need changes with regard to justice, the way we do 
business in the House and the way we spend money.  To use a 
phrase from my colleague from Edmonton North, it is not a matter 
of uniting the right.  It is a matter of uniting the bright and 
there are no bright lights on that side of the House.  That is 
why we are looking over here.  We need someone who has vision 
that will work in the justice system and in the country as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is a very high priority on our list.  Therefore I would 
not want to see any reduction in spending.  There are a lot of 
ways we could handle this kind of situation.  All we need to do 
is look at some things that are going on within government in 
terms of spending and come up with some good ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the waste report we get from our colleague from St. 
Albert.  I wonder how many members of the House would like to see 
some of the following money going to justice or to some other 
good cause like feeding hungry children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On transition to adulthood research we spent $105,000.  On 
sexual dissidence, historical content, we spent $23,000.  On 
institutional change and household behaviour in rural China we 
spent $55,000.  On infants and understanding how people act we 
spent $75,000.  On limited editions of Spanish golden age plays 
we spent $44,000.  I really liked what happened about two years 
ago. We spent $116,000 on a committee to study seniors and 
sexuality. Being a senior I cannot say how good it makes me feel 
that the government could find $116,000 to spend on this.  The 
list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about spending millions and pretty soon it will 
be billions.  The government spent close to $2 million on Angus 
Reid, Createc and Ekos Research doing polls in just one year. 
Hopefully it made the government feel good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general we are probably spending $1 
billion on registering the guns of duck hunters, deer hunters, 
trophy hunters and trap shooters.  How can anyone support 
spending that kind of money on a project that will just not do 
the job?  It will not solve a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go through all this waste we wonder how long it has been 
going on.  Is that why we are $600 billion in the hole?  I hate 
to refer to the past but I have to be reminded of why I became so 
disillusioned with the Conservative Party and tore up my card a 
few years back.  I only have to walk down to the museum and look 
at a little red line on a board that costs $6 million to remember 
why.  The same kind of crazy spending was going on at that time, 
much to the objection of many of us in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will it stop?  The government has to get its priorities 
straight.  We could do lots of valuable things with all that 
money.  We have a health system and an education system that are 
crumbling.  We have a justice system that could use help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a look at these misplaced priorities.  I have 
been analysing the solicitor general's department for over a year 
now.  Let me give an example.  Last October 1, a guard from 
Joyceville came to see me who had been pricked by a tattoo needle 
and could have potentially contracted the AIDS virus.  He asked 
the commissioner of corrections to provide guards with puncture 
resistant gloves.  Nine months have now passed and there are no 
gloves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correctional Service of Canada will say that it is still 
researching to find the best possible equipment when the guards 
themselves found appropriate gloves many months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned yesterday that an officer in Joyceville in the visits 
and correspondence unit was stabbed with a needle while he was 
opening mail.  The least we could provide these frontline workers 
with is a pair of puncture resistant gloves.  We could spend some 
money protecting our guards who put their very lives on the line 
day in and day out.  We could do a lot about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A thousand new guards are to be hired.  That is great.  That is 
important.  It is a good decision.  However I hope they do not 
advertise, pull people off the street and spend thousands of 
millions of dollars training them when we have casual workers who 
are already trained and well prepared to fill these positions.  I 
understand that will not necessarily be the case, that it will be 
open advertising.  They will pull them off the street and retrain 
a whole pile of people when they already have trained casual 
workers.  Money should not be wasted doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at the spending to keep inmates comfortable during 
the past four years of touring prisons throughout the country.  I 
have been in every one with the exception of one or two.  The 
facilities provide convicts with three square meals a day, 
complete medical and dental care, big screen TVs, rumpus rooms 
and now in Ferndale a golf course and probably a golf range.  Is 
it good to see that a convicted murderer can reduce his handicap 
while he is behind bars?

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the real world I have met hundreds of people, and I know all 
the members have met hundreds of people, who cannot even meet the 
bare necessities for their own kids let alone have a golf game or 
a pool game or watch anything on a big screen TV.  But this is 
readily available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a while since I was at the Drumheller Institution. I 
met six inmates that day in the little apartment they have which 
they call a prison.  They were marinating beautiful Alberta rib 
eye steaks, one each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the government members to explain to the needy 
children that we hear about from them all the time, the people in 
this country who are starving and suffering.  I would like them 
to explain to all Canadians why it is that convicts can eat 
steaks when a lot of people, including seniors, cannot even 
afford macaroni. I would like that explained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do inmates get free education?  The poor have to wait in 
line for a draw. They call it the millennium scholarship lottery. 
Why can a low income family not take their children to a 
dentist?  Because they cannot afford it, yet there is a dentist 
who makes house calls to Millhaven.  They do not have to worry 
about their teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my own hometown have come to me asking what can they 
do. They have four and five year old kids with rotten teeth and 
they cannot afford to pay the dentist.  They cannot get help from 
social services and they cannot afford a dentist. Yet this is 
done openly in the penitentiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors suffer from poor health.  Convicts can have a sex change 
on demand, but seniors are suffering without health programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really sad that the veterans of the world wars and the 
Korean war are living in absolute poverty.  Some have called me 
saying “I do not understand what is happening.  I have been on 
the veterans pension. Now my wife has reached 65 years of age and 
she has gone on the old age pension and they have taken all my 
veterans benefits away. We are trying to get by on $600 or $700 a 
month”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited the home of one of these veterans.  He had a medal of 
honour and a medal of bravery for World War II which he once was 
very proud of.  He wanted me to bring those medals back here and 
I do not want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, where he wanted me to put 
them.  The kind of language he used to tell me where to put them 
would not be fitting for these kind ladies and gentlemen in this 
place.  These are our veterans from the wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I defy any member in the House to stand up and say he does not 
know of a veteran who fought for this country, for the very 
freedoms we try to enjoy, who is not in the same kind of a 
predicament because they are out there.  We just do not pay 
attention to that.  We have too many more important things to do. 
That attitude has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a look at our military.  Compare that to our justice 
system.  Over the past several months the standing committee on 
defence has heard about the living conditions and the quality of 
life of our military personnel and what they are experiencing. 
The only real reason for this is that successive governments have 
overworked and underequipped the members of our forces and have 
left them grossly underpaid.  The underfunding of defence has led 
to a debate whether to buy essential equipment for the survival 
of our soldiers in the field or to compensate our soldiers with 
the salaries and benefits they deserve.  In trying to do both, 
the equipment is falling apart and our service personnel are 
suffering beyond belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we heard the solicitor general praise our 
prison system as being one of the best in the world.  This system 
provides our federal inmates with the use of miniature golf 
courses, tennis courts, basketball courts, softball diamonds, 
jogging tracks, cable television, big screen TV, racquetball, all 
other kinds of entertainment, weight lifting and automatic gyms 
which cost thousands of dollars, all at taxpayers' expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of our soldiers only dream about all of those activities. 
The possibility of getting involved in these activities is nil. 
The soldiers who are serving in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia get 
relatively few if any of these things, let alone a conjugal 
visit.  Even those personnel posted in Canada cannot afford to 
enjoy the range of goodies afforded to our prison inmates. Our 
soldiers now have to pay recreation fees for the use of the gyms 
and the ice rinks on the bases.  Our soldiers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, April 27, Colonel Jim Calvin appeared before the 
standing committee on defence. He reported that a fully trained 
private, married with two children, after three years of service 
takes home $49 of disposable income per month.  This compares to 
our inmates who receive in the same case a monthly disposable 
amount of $157.50, three times more than what the military 
personnel are forced to get by on. Only a Liberal could smile 
about that.  Only a Liberal could laugh about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that our convicts are given more 
consideration by our government than our soldiers, sailors and 
air crew, an attitude that has to change.  How can we ever hope 
to recruit young people into our services to serve our country 
knowing that those in jail are treated better? Some of these 
soldiers have to stand in line at a food bank in order to get 
enough to feed their families.  It is absolutely ridiculous. They 
do not enjoy the luxuries that many of the inmates do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the parole system.  Over the past month the solicitor 
general and the commissioner of Correctional Service Canada have 
been quoted at length listing the reasons why imprisonment is so 
debilitating and that parole is the answer. They claim that there 
is no link between incarceration and public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner was at a loss to understand how the federal 
inmate population has gone up by 23% over the past five years and 
the crime rate has fallen by 13%.  It never entered these two 
expert's minds that maybe if we put the criminals behind bars, 
then the crime rate may fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, it reminds me of a study which the New York mayor 
did before he implemented the brick, broke and pain philosophy to 
try to improve the situation.  He did a big study.  He wanted to 
know the causes of crime.  He spent lots of money going into the 
causes of crime.  Eureka, he found out the number one cause of 
crime.  Do you know what it was, Mr. Speaker?  Criminals.  Is 
that not hard to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alternative the government is promoting to keeping them in 
is that it only costs $9,000 a year to supervise an inmate on 
parole. That is well and fine when public safety is guaranteed. 
But when the National Parole Board's record of releasing 
dangerous offenders who go on to commit murder while on parole is 
questionable because of what has happened in the past, it is not 
a valid solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government's own statistics which it provided 
to my office, from 1986 to 1997, 2,292 people were murdered, 
assaulted, taken as hostage, forcibly confined or robbed by 
offenders on parole.  Of those 2,292 people, 217 were murdered. 
We never hear these statistics from these masterminds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at those kinds of figures, it simply is too big a 
price to ask society to continue to support that kind of result. 
What kind of sacrifice do we expect of Canadians?  Accept the 
parole system where there are only 2,200 victims every 10 years 
and 200 or so murdered.  Accept it as good because after all only 
about 10% of those who were on parole did that.  The other 90% 
were all good. That kind of figure is too big a sacrifice to ask 
Canadians to pay.

not.  It would have been nice if the government had asked me.  I 
could have told it right at the beginning and it would have saved 
$100,000.  Seniors and sexuality.  The sad part about it is I did 
not get a copy of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to be here tonight.  There are a few things I need to 
get off my chest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at “The Waste Report” and look at the public accounts to 
see where some of this money is going.  Look at the whole 
scenario.  Almost every day in the House of Commons for the last 
five years government members have talked about the suffering in 
the cities, families who need help, starving children, people who 
are suffering and who need help.  The Liberals stand in this 
House saying we have got to do something about it and then 
miraculously the government finds some billions of dollars to 
give to Bombardier.  It finds $25 million to give away free 
flags.  It finds $116,000 to form a committee on seniors and 
sexuality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These decisions are coming from the Liberal Party of Canada, the 
governing body of this country. The people of this land need to 
know that.  I hope that in the next election they kick them right 
out of here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe you will find unanimous consent to deem the question 
to have been put, a division requested and an order deferred 
until 10.00 p.m so that we might spend more time debating the 
next item on the Order Paper.  I believe there is unanimous 
consent, if the Speaker would request it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for the 
proposition put forward by the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is not consent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot believe what I have been hearing.  My colleague from Wild 
Rose has been complaining about his sexuality.  I want to say 
that there is some quick help on the way.  Viagra is just about 
to hit the waves here.  He may have an opportunity to re-examine 
this issue. We heard a lot of rubbish from him tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great difference between this party on this side of 
the House and his party on the other side.  We are a party that 
looks toward the future with optimism.  That party on the other 
side looks to the future with pessimism.  It lives in the past. 
It does not look forward, it looks backward.  It has absolutely 
no vision.  Every time we hear one of these guys speak, we get 
depressed.  We feel absolutely terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose is the same guy who wanted to tie 
10-year old children upside down and beat them to discipline 
them.  That is his definition of law and order.  It did not 
matter what the child did.  He wanted to put the child behind 
bars.  That is his way of disciplining.  His way of dealing with 
law and order is to jail them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Reform Party there are two classes of people.  They are 
either law-abiding citizens or they are criminals.  It does not 
matter. The Reform Party views all who are accused as criminals. 
Look at its famous bill of rights which clearly states that. Look 
at its opposition to the charter of rights and freedoms. It 
opposed the charter of rights and freedoms because it gives the 
people the right to be protected by law in Canada. 
The member for Wild Rose stood up over and over again in the 
House of Commons to attack the government on issues of law and 
order and the protection of victims.  When the Minister of 
Justice introduced legislation in the House—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has nothing to say 
on the issue.  Every time the Minister of Justice has introduced 
a measure to protect victims, members of his party voted against 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is he against gun control as a measure to protect 
communities?  Why is he against the initiatives of the government 
which deal with the protection of our society and with the 
prevention of crimes in our society?  Why is it that I only hear 
doom from this member and his colleagues over and over again and 
about the terrible things that happen in our society?  Never once 
have they proposed something that is tangible, that is positive, 
to deal with the problems at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society is in good hands.  For four years in a row crime has 
decreased.  What does he have to say to that?

word, then we are out of here.  Is that correct?  I do not know 
any other way to say it, except I never saw more people who are 
strangers to the truth than the members across the way.  It is a 
shame that it has to be that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I loudly and clearly said that $1 billion for the registration 
of rifles and shotguns of duck hunters and deer hunters is a 
waste of money.  It will not be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have challenged the government:  show me where it will save 
lives and I will support it tonight.  Show me where the 
registration of a shotgun or a rifle will save lives and I will 
support it tonight.  I have challenged the government for four 
years.  It has not been done.  It cannot be done because, number 
one, criminals do not register their guns.  They do a lot of 
things with their guns, but they do not register them.  It is 
pure and simple.  To spend $1 billion under the umbrella of what 
the government thinks is protecting society is just not the 
answer, but the government does not listen.

listening to what the member for Wild Rose was saying and I have

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must understand when we deal with Bill C-68 and a lot of 
other legislation that we cannot keep drugs out of our prisons in 
Canada.  We cannot keep heroin out, we cannot keep methadone out, 
we cannot keep marijuana out, we cannot keep LSD out, we cannot 
keep anything out of our prisons.  They are not ordinary 
buildings.  They are buildings that are surrounded by barbed wire 
and great big walls.  That is relevant.  That is part of the 
reason the Canadian public has no faith in the justice system.  I 
would like the member's comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is easy to determine 
why prisons are full of drugs.  It is not that we cannot, it is 
that we will not.  The reason we will not is because we do not 
have people on that side of the House with the intestinal 
fortitude to implement that kind of measure.  They would rather 
sit back and not get too intrusive with the inmates in the 
penitentiaries.  I am sure they would find some way to say that 
it offends the charter of rights.  They would want to check that 
out very carefully.  Would it be a right to be a heroin addict in 
the pen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad part about it is that about 80% of those people are 
there because of drugs.  That is what put them there in the first 
place.  In prison it is more plentiful than you could ever 
imagine. I might as well sentence my Uncle Henry who is an 
alcoholic to the wine cellar for the rest of his life.  It does 
not make a bit of sense.  That is the problem with the entire 
group over there.  Most of the things that happen just do not 
make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When drugs are the cause of putting a person in a penitentiary, 
then why do we not work hard to get it out of the penitentiary 
and save these people from their own fate?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Wild 
Rose was cited as saying that if we put more criminals behind 
bars the crime rate may fall.  I think I am quoting him exactly. 
I would like him to explain why the American theory does not 
apply.  They have the highest number of penitentiaries, yet they 
also have the highest number of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a hard time 
trying to understand the stats we get from these guys.  It 
usually takes a little interpretation.  They are difficult to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In California we have learned that the crime rate is down by a 
huge percentage.  In New York City it has gone down even further, 
simply by starting the broke and pain theory.  That is the picture 
in those two areas.  The only reason I know about them is because 
I read the reports in the newspapers.  I try to keep track— 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to enter the debate on the justice estimates.  I 
find it strangely ironic that the member for York South—Weston, 
who is not in the House at the moment, would come into this 
House, someone who has championed, as he would put it, the rules 
and regulations of the House, to speak on a topic totally 
unrelated to the justice estimates.  I will not do that.  I will 
immediately proceed to the justice estimates because that is what 
we are here to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get into two areas with respect to the justice estimates. 
One is gun control.  The other is the question of drinking and 
driving that has come up in the House over the last little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should support the justice estimates.  With the budget 
that the justice department will have, if it passes the House, it 
will be able to get on with implementing a number of very 
important initiatives.  Gun control is but one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that this is a very useful, efficient and effective 
program and it is supported by Canadians very broadly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the effects of it already.  The police in my riding 
in Etobicoke are already reporting some of the very positive 
effects of some of the early measures that were implemented and I 
am confident that more will come.  I am totally convinced of 
that.  We register pets and we register bicycles.  I do not know 
why in the heck we should not register guns.  They are lethal 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other very important initiatives like the changes we 
are making to the youth justice system that this budget will 
allow our government to implement.  With the changes now before 
us, youth 14 years and older who are repeat and violent 
offenders, who are convicted of murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault will receive an adult 
sentence unless a judge can be persuaded otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in my riding of Etobicoke North that people are concerned 
about repeat young offenders.  I think the justice minister and 
the department have come forward with very pragmatic and 
excellent solutions to this very serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes will also permit the publication of the names upon 
conviction of all young offenders who qualify for an adult 
sentence.  Publication of the names of 14 to 17 year olds who are 
given a youth sentence for murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault or repeat violent 
offences could also be permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these are very important measures and this House should 
support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn briefly to the question of drinking and 
driving.  It is a very topical subject and I am sure it will be 
before the justice committee in the not too distant future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in this House I am sure is very concerned, very 
saddened and shocked when they see individuals who are injured or 
who die as a result of being hit by a car driven by a drunk 
driver.  We should be concerned about that.  It is a very serious 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the ensuing months when we debate these changes, I think that 
we should avoid simplistic solutions.  Moving the tolerance level 
from .08 to .05 or to zero does not really address the problem. 
The problem is the repeat offender, the chronic drinker, the 
drinker who drinks and drives repeatedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drinker who drives and gets into serious accidents is 
sanctioned by society through either a criminal sentence, a 
serious fine, or through the repeal of their licence. Immediately 
they jump back into their car, go down to the local bar, gets 
drunk, go out and maybe injure or kill someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem.  It is not the casual responsible drinker. 
If the level were dropped to .05 or to .00 it would mean that 
people could not even have a beer and get in their car.  Why 
should we be designing laws in this country to deal with the 5% 
or the 3% of society who are irresponsible?  Why do we not use 
tougher sanctions on them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed when I see drivers who drink and who get into 
serious accidents.  Their licence is revoked, but they are caught 
a few months later in a car without a valid licence.  Why do we 
not put people like that into jail?  To me that is the solution. 
Why do we have to penalize people for having one drink 
responsibly in an evening, getting in their car and driving home 
in a very safe and cautious manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be thinking about those kinds of solutions.  If we 
went with no risk policies it would mean that people would always 
leave their cars at home.  They would not get into an aircraft. 
They would not cross the street.  We cannot design policies to 
deal with every single risk in life.  I think we need to have 
pragmatic policies that deal with serious problems, but they have 
to deal with the offenders of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind, the problem is not the responsible drinker, it is 
the repeat offender who just turns their nose up at the justice 
system.  They have been convicted of an offence, they have had 
their licence revoked, and they get back into a car, go out and 
drink and drive, and behave irresponsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that a coalition has been formed which includes 
MADD, Mothers Against Drinking and Driving.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I declare Motion No. 12 carried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder if there are any rules in the House that would allow the 
member for York South—Weston and his five conspirators from the 
Reform and Conservatives to be charged the $40,000 it has cost 
the Canadian taxpayers for this farce tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, given the hour of the 
evening I wonder if I could get unanimous consent of the House to 
allow our pages to go home if they so choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I need them to help me up here for the most 
part.  I need them to get through the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not say anything 
when the member for York South—Weston got up from his seat when 
we voted on Motion No. 3.  Nor did I say anything when he got up 
from his seat on Motion No. 6.  Nor did I say anything when he 
used his cellular as we were voting on Motion No. 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the current motion, Mr. Speaker, if you consult 
Beauchesne's it says that the member should remain in his seat 
until the division is complete and the result announced.  I 
believe the member left his seat before the result was announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will address myself to the hon. member for 
York South—Weston.  Did he vote according to the rules of the 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is quite 
right.  I was absent as was the House leader of the government. 
I would expect his vote to be nullified.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I should add that on several of those matters I voted with the 
government.  Many members of the House throughout the evening 
have absented themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know voting this late in 
the evening is very stressful for us.  I also know that you are 
very concerned, as are the rest of us, about decorum in the 
House.  I would appreciate it very much if you would rule on the 
propriety of the member for Medicine Hat and the member for 
Edmonton North playing cards in the House of Commons while the 
Leader of the Opposition looks on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I agree that it is a long night and I would 
appeal to my colleagues.  We are going to go through this 
exercise unless the House decides not to go through it.  I would 
suggest that we have to keep decorum in the House.  I would hope 
all hon. members would conduct themselves accordingly as members 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Points of order are being raised.  I will hear the points of 
order because it is the right of members to raise them, but I 
would hope you would reflect on the points you are raising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member for London North made comments that were not in order 
when he referred to the member for York—South Weston and said 
that he and a few Conservatives and Reformers know— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ruled that the hon. member did not have a 
point of order and therefore that ended it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that 
things seem to be breaking down on that side.  I would like to 
make the point that we will be voting.  We will be standing up—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. Historically the phrase on division has come to mean 
something.  It has been parliamentary tradition.  That means that 
rather than taking a roll call vote and requiring every member to 
stand in his or her place to cast a ballot, the political parties 
agree that the motion is to carry without the opposition 
suggesting it is voting in favour, that there is opposition to 
the motion.  That is what the words on division— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I made the decision that it would be carried 
on division because there were not five members standing. 
Therefore I said that it was on division.  I made the ruling and 
it will stand.
