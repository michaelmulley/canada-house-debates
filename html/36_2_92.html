</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the federal government should 
encourage the CRTC to establish regulations that require 
telephone companies to assist community agencies with providing 
affordable voice mail service to Canadians who cannot afford or 
do not have access to telephone service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be in the House 
today to speak to my motion.  The purpose of this motion is to 
mandate phone accessibility and phone service for low income and 
homeless Canadians who, as it stands today, have absolutely no 
access to this very basic service that most of us take for 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion before the House today was inspired by a project that 
was initiated a couple of years ago by a very well known 
community organization in Vancouver's downtown eastside, the 
Downtown Eastside Residents Association, which started what was 
called a community voice mailbox system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In starting up this system, the organization found that many low 
income and homeless people who had no access to phone service 
were incredibly limited in terms of being able to find employment 
or make contact with doctors offices or even family members. This 
organization worked very hard.  It was approached by a young man 
who had developed a computer software program to create the 
program.  For a very modest amount of $1,500, it received the 
computer and the software program, the voice mail service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization found that many people, not just in the 
downtown eastside but in other neighbourhoods in Vancouver and on 
the lower mainland, desperately needed access to phone service. 
As a result of providing this service over the last couple of 
years, about 1,200 people are now registered.  The use of the 
service is increasing on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics provided to me by the organization are quite 
interesting.  They show that approximately 79% of the users of 
this service are single men and that 60% of the users have annual 
incomes of less than $8,000.  I would ask anyone in the House to 
imagine what it would be like to live on less than $8,000. It 
would mean no money for bus fare, no money for a phone and no 
money for the basic necessities of life.  It basically would mean 
scraping by and surviving day by day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most interesting is that more than half of the users of 
this voice mail service have said that having a community voice 
mail and having one's own phone number has given them a starting 
point for having more control over their lives.  I cannot 
emphasize enough what that means to an individual. Imagine what 
it would be like living on welfare and looking for work or maybe 
living in a homeless shelter and looking for work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I experienced this last year when I travelled across the country 
and visited emergency shelters and spoke to homeless people and 
front line service workers.  I was told many times by people that 
they felt humiliated when they did not have an address or a phone 
number.  If they wanted to apply for a job and the prospective 
employer needed a phone number, they had to reply that they lived 
in a homeless shelter.  They had no chance of receiving a phone 
call back from the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a program that gave them access to their own phone number 
and their own voice mail messages enabled them to provide a 
possible employer with a phone number.  When an employer called 
that number it would be their voice recording on the phone asking 
the caller to leave a message.  They could then dial into that 
from any location by hopefully using a free phone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having their own phone number or voice mail gives people a sense 
of dignity, a sense of worth and a a starting point for them to 
find employment and put their lives together.  This is a very 
basic but important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad irony is that the federal government has many job 
creation initiatives to help lower income Canadians.  But it is 
provided on a very spotty basis.  Industry Canada has spent 
millions of dollars getting Canadians on line.  I know a lot of 
agencies that have accessed funds from Industry Canada to help 
set up Internet access for low income Canadians. That is 
something I agree with.

doing that and sees it as a priority, on the other hand we have 
information from Statistics Canada which shows that 157,000 
Canadians have no phone.  That is a very conservative figure 
because it does not include the homeless people who are not 
listed in the census.  Here we are in our modern society getting 
people on line, but there are still hundreds of thousands of 
people who do not have this basic access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the downtown east side in my riding on Friday and 
visited the DERA service.  I met with the folks who run it and 
with people who use the service.  It was really amazing to see 
how this operates.  They can walk into the office and for a 
minimum cost of $3 a month, which is what it costs, with no 
questions asked, they can sign up for their community mailbox. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I met a young man who had walked into my into my 
constituency office on Main Street.  He came from Saskatchewan 
and moved into east Vancouver.  He was looking for work.  I said 
he was welcome to use my office if he wanted to send a fax or 
anything.  He said he was really glad that at least he had a 
phone number.  I said it was great that he had a phone in his 
place.  He said “No, no, I have voice mail”.  Sure enough it 
was the DERA voice mail.  He came to Vancouver looking for work 
and had somehow managed to find out about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that this service is only available in Vancouver. 
The Government of Manitoba has just announced a very good 
initiative where, with the co-operation of the Royal Bank and 
other private partners, it is setting up a province-wide 
community voice mail service.  Other than that there is really 
nothing that exists.  It seemed to me in bringing forward this 
motion, and based on my travels and talking to homeless people or 
people who have totally insecure or inadequate shelter, that to 
have a program that is mandated through licensing through the 
CRTC is something that could be easily done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this parliament we debate big issues.  We debate things that 
are very complex.  Yet, here we have a tool, something very 
straightforward that could help hundreds of thousands of low 
income and homeless Canadians by simply saying to the CRTC that 
we want to make sure that as part of the CRTC licensing the 
telephone companies, it mandates that there be funds provided or 
phone lines that are given over as access to local community 
agencies to set up these projects across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DERA community voice mail system has 12 phone lines.  I 
could actually see the information on the phone lines which were 
in use as people were changing their greeting or accessing their 
voice mail box or dialling in to retrieve messages.  Just think 
of what that would mean to Canadians from coast to coast who are 
living in communities where they feel isolated and cut off 
because they do not have that basic service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this motion is to say that here is an easy, 
straightforward, simple, logical, reasonable way of ensuring that 
Canadians have access to the most basic phone service that we all 
take for granted in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that this issue is very much linked to people who 
are living in poverty.  Because people are living way below the 
poverty line, they cannot afford to have the basic phone service. 
As I have mentioned, in many instances it is related to 
employment and the need to get employment that they need that 
phone number.  Also, I have come across examples and instances 
where it is a matter of personal health and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DERA folks told me of one instance where one of its clients 
was in hospital.  The doctor phoned and said that he was ready to 
be released, but he would need to have a phone by the his bed so 
if he got into trouble there was somebody he could call.  This 
gentleman did not have a phone so he faced the prospect of 
staying another six weeks in hospital until the doctor was 
assured that he was completely better before he went home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it happened, the DERA advocacy office spent countless hours 
dealing with the local welfare office trying to get this man a 
telephone.  I believe it was eventually successful, but how much 
time and energy was spent to get one person a phone so he could 
go home from the hospital which was costing thousands of dollars 
a day. 
The contradictions and the ironies in these are just simply 
astounding.  If it were not so serious it would be laughable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to encourage members to think about the motion and to see 
the wisdom of supporting it as a way of doing something 
straightforward and simple that will actually help people in a 
real concrete way on a day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few days time we will bear witness to the 10th anniversary 
of the Liberal task force report on affordable housing that was 
chaired by the now finance minister and then an opposition 
Liberal member.  Ten years ago the Liberals in opposition wrote a 
darn good report with 25 recommendations talking about the needs 
of Canadians in terms of housing.  Here we are now 10 years later 
and we know that during the period between 1984 and 1993 we lost 
more than $2 billion in housing funds in the country.  Then in 
1993 the same member, who was the chair of that Liberal task 
force on housing, at the finance committee wielded the axe and 
ended the construction of social housing in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of that, because of increasing homelessness and 
because more and more Canadians, something like two million 
Canadians, are paying way more than 50% of their income for rent 
that people do not have enough money to pay for a phone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw that comparison because this issue of phone service is 
very much related to the issue of the housing crisis in the 
country and the shameful record of the government in abandoning a 
national housing strategy and abandoning the construction of 
desperately needed social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to go to another shelter.  I do not want to have 
to talk to another person who says “I want a good place to live. 
I want to go to work.  I want to be employed.  I want to have a 
phone so that I can have some sense of dignity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That story is all too familiar for hundreds of thousands of 
Canadians.  I urge members of the House to put aside the partisan 
politics.  From time to time we come together and we say “Yes, 
this is the right thing to do”.  That is what we should do here. 
We should say to the CRTC “Get on this.  Make it a requirement 
of licensing.  Make sure that every telephone company across the 
country ensures that they require some lines or some funds that 
can be dedicated to a community organization to open up access to 
phone service for low income and homeless Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for the support of members to do just that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on Motion No. M-361 that was just 
outlined before us by the member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member would like the CRTC to establish regulations that 
would require telephone companies to provide voice mail services 
to low income and homeless Canadians.  My understanding is that 
voice mail service is something like an add-on, like power 
windows on a car.  Basic telephone services is quite a different 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the motion was inspired by a very worthwhile 
project in the member's Vancouver East riding.  The Downtown 
Eastside Residents Association project to provide a secure voice 
mail service for $40 a year is an innovative program.  By 
facilitating communication for low income residents and the 
homeless, I have no doubt the Vancouver project has increased 
their opportunities for employment as well as their access to 
community and medical services.  It is a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Motion No. M-361 is another example of the NDP's 
deep fondness for centralization and regulation as the answer to 
every problem.  The Canadian Alliance on the other hand believes 
that the market is the best place to respond to the needs of 
individuals for telephone service, not top down government 
intervention from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a need—and I understand in this case the member 
certainly demonstrated that in her riding—to expand this type of 
service in other communities, the Vancouver project can be a 
model for other communities wishing to assist the homeless and 
low income residents in their area.  However, community groups, 
municipal governments and in some cases provincial governments 
are much closer to the people and are best positioned to tackle 
these local issues, such as telecommunication services for low 
income and homeless Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think she gave a good example of how the group in her riding 
served a need that was out there.  I think there are many methods 
to address this concern.  I would suggest that the one in her 
riding of Vancouver East that was serviced by the Downtown 
Eastside Residents Association is the best vehicle for this 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the real failing of Motion M-361 is that it is 
not clear why another federal regulation governing the 
telecommunications industry is necessary for communities to 
launch similar projects.  It can be done now.  Therefore, I think 
that is the better approach.  This motion flies in the face of 
the current trend in the telecommunications industry which is to 
move toward less regulation and more competition and I would 
endorse that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the CRTC's publication “Vision” stated that the agency 
hoped to reinvent itself and rely more on market forces to permit 
fair and sustainable competition and to move from detailed 
regulation to broad parameters.  That certainly is something we 
in the Canadian Alliance support.  From that perspective Motion 
M-361 would be a step backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the CRTC, I would love to debate the 
effectiveness and the necessity for much of the CRTC's mandate. I 
certainly would not fall for the blunt regulatory tool of CRTC 
intervention in this case, as in Motion M-361, for that purpose. 
The Canadian Alliance would like to review the mandate of the 
CRTC to see greater accountability and responsiveness in the 
CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the CRTC's mandate is out of date and new developments 
in technology have made the CRTC irrelevant in many respects.  My 
colleague, who is the deputy industry critic from Calgary Centre 
and who is our spokesman in this area, has pointed out on many 
occasions that the CRTC's bureaucratic pace makes it ill-suited 
to effectively respond to the needs of the fast moving 
telecommunications industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance would like to take this opportunity to 
call for a larger debate on the role of this agency into the 21st 
century in Canada rather than remaining stuck in the old mindset 
that more government regulation will solve every problem.  I 
suggest that community organizations are also great vehicles, 
much closer to the people which can provide service that 
government may not be able to provide with the same flexibility. 
Therefore, I am not in support of this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, Motion No. 361 that the member from the NDP is bringing 
forward requires the CRTC to mandate the provisions of subsidized 
voice mail service to community agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go a little more in depth and quote verbatim 
what Motion No. 361 is all about.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the opinion of this House, the federal government should 
encourage the CRTC to establish regulations that require 
telephone companies to assist community agencies with providing 
affordable voice mail service to Canadians who cannot afford or 
do not have access to telephone service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what Motion No. 361 says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the opportunity to quote Motion No. 361 for the purpose 
of telling the House and through you, Madam Speaker, the country 
as a whole that this type of motion that comes forward, which is 
a non-votable motion, is not necessarily a step that has to take 
place here in the House.  It is great that it comes to the House 
and is discussed, et cetera, but this government, previous 
governments and future governments are not the instrument by 
which this request should be put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission could be asked by any individual, community, or 
organization to look into the possibility of having these 
services provided.  As I have said in the past, this is an arm's 
length relationship.  The member would do well to work as 
aggressively as I know she can and has in the past with the area, 
with the community, to bring this issue to the attention of the 
commission and indeed move positively forward to carry out the 
hearings.  As we know, and I want to point out, on some of these 
avenues there has been public consultation on an ongoing basis to 
look at specific areas, the types of needs, et cetera, so that 
indeed if the commission and the findings are there, service can 
be provided.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not take up much more of the House's time but I wanted to 
clarify this issue.  Without going into the details, our 
government will continue to make sure that each and every 
Canadian no matter where they live has the tools needed to carry 
on their daily lives.  We will continue to address some of the 
concerns that communities and individuals face, whether they are 
health, community, business or personal issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that with Motion No. 361 the intentions of the member 
from the NDP are honourable and good and I commend her for that. 
However, there is a vehicle, a venue, and that is to bring this 
request to the commission so that it can have more consultations. 
As I said earlier, there has been a lot of consultation.  If it 
warrants, it shall be done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very proud to participate in the 
opening discussions on this Monday morning.  We are debating the 
important topic of providing basic phone services to those in our 
society who probably need them the most in terms of their own 
personal security but also in terms of providing them with a very 
important vehicle to obtain employment opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most of us in the House it is second nature to have a phone 
stuck to our ear, whether it is a cellphone, a regular phone or a 
headset.  Most of us spend a good part of our waking day talking 
on the telephone to our constituents or receiving calls from 
people on various issues.  We certainly know the importance of 
telephones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phone companies and the telecommunications sector in general 
have expanded greatly in the past number of years.  As the 
economy globalizes and as society becomes much more of a global 
village, communication plays a crucial role in our everyday lives 
now more than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend from Vancouver East made the point that people 
now are online and have personal websites, e-mail and all sorts 
of sophisticated telecommunications techniques to communicate 
with others, but it is hard to believe that there are still 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians who do not even have a simple 
telephone in their homes.  Why?  Because they do not have the 
money to pay for it. Many Canadians simply do not have the income 
to afford basic telephone service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most of us in the House, it is hard to imagine a world 
without a telephone.  Our house has three telephones and they 
seem to be busy most of the time.  Of course anyone who has 
children can forget it if there is only one telephone line, 
because the chance of getting in touch with that household is 
minimal.  That household might have two or three telephones as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when society itself has appreciated the value and the 
importance of communication, as my hon. friend from Vancouver 
East has indicated, there are at least two million Canadians who 
use more than half of their income to pay for their housing. A 
good percentage of those households would not have additional 
funds to access basic telephone service.  Tens of thousands of 
people who live on the streets do not even have homes.  Obviously 
those people who do not have homes do not have telephones, and if 
they do not have telephones they are out of touch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important is when people apply for a job and make an effort 
to find meaningful employment.  An application form asks how to 
get in touch with the applicant and if there is no way of doing 
that, it poses a problem.  Not only does it pose a problem, but 
it is probably the end of the line.  If a company cannot 
communicate with a person to come to work, it will probably go to 
the person who has a telephone number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can society level the playing field?  A level playing field 
is a very apt phrase these days. 
This is fundamental New Democrat philosophy.  We have always 
wanted to level the playing field so that everyone in society has 
an equal opportunity to be the kind of citizen they ought to be 
and to have the same opportunities, whether they are education, 
health care or employment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Vancouver East for putting the 
motion on the record this morning.  In this motion we are saying, 
let us give all Canadians an equal opportunity, a level playing 
field to access the job market.  To do that these folks have to 
have telephone access. The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the federal government should 
encourage the CRTC to establish regulations that require 
telephone companies to assist community agencies with providing 
affordable voice mail service to Canadians who cannot afford or 
do not have access to telephone service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may ask who does not have access to telephone service. They 
are looking at a member of parliament who has a number of 
constituents who do not have access to basic telephone service. 
They live in relatively remote areas or areas where there is 
simply no telephone line. It is hard to believe that in the most 
wired country in the world there are still a lot of people who 
live in areas that do not have access to a telephone line, but 
that is a fact.  They also do not have access to cellphones 
because there is no cellphone service in these remote areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people conduct businesses and they certainly live very 
full lives, yet they have no access to a basic telephone.  We 
have to provide some assistance. The motion concerns just that 
and thus today's debate in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has this been applied anywhere?  My hon. friend from Vancouver 
East has indicated that in her constituency, the Downtown 
Eastside Residents Association has a program where people in that 
area who cannot afford or are unable to access telephone service 
can have access to voice mail. Imagine the difference that makes 
in people's lives when others can get in touch with them.  People 
can leave a phone number and they can get back to them with a 
message or important information.  The association has found a 
way to do it at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members probably know, the Government of Manitoba has 
initiated a program over the past number of days which will 
encourage similar opportunities to exist in Winnipeg and other 
places throughout Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says that if it works well in Vancouver East and if 
the Government of Manitoba thinks it is needed, why not make it a 
national program?  Will this be a major imposition on the 
telephone companies?  The answer is clearly no.  This simply sets 
aside a number of lines for community based organizations or 
others.  It makes the case that these services ought to be 
provided by the various telephone companies across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I cannot imagine going to Telus, which is one of 
the telephone companies based in British Columbia, and it would 
not endorse this enthusiastically.  It would be a great public 
relations exercise.  That is one thing we ought to consider as 
well.  This is something the telephone companies ought to be 
offering people within their jurisdiction.  I am sure the 
telephone companies would fall over themselves to initiate these 
kinds of programs, perhaps with a little encouragement by the 
CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in accessing employment opportunities, we all appreciate 
how important a telephone number is.  The hon. member for 
Vancouver East has come up with a very creative solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friends in the Reform Party have some concerns about 
the motion.  My hon. friend who made the presentation on behalf 
of that party spoke in favour of the concept, that this would be 
useful for anybody, but that party has some concerns on the 
mechanism.  I wonder if my friends in the Reform Party would not 
agree at least to this small measure that while we are debating 
this motion today, perhaps even all of us, not only the Reform 
Party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The Canadian Alliance party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Excuse me.  It is the Canadian Alliance. 
My apologies to my friends in the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than simply let this issue die today at the end of this 
debate, which it will be destined to do, at least we should agree 
that the member ought to write to the CRTC to ask if it would be 
prepared to initiate further talks with the telephone companies 
or to take this issue to another level as opposed to letting it 
die here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to all the political parties.  We all agree with 
the intent.  We all agree with the idea.  Everybody says it is 
good.  Let us face it.  Who would not support providing telephone 
access to someone from a low income family who is trying to get a 
job or a homeless person who wants to get a job and needs a 
telephone number in order to qualify?  There are also the 
personal security aspects my friend raised and health reasons and 
so on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we agree with this, I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Commons at least to consider not referring this motion to the 
committee as would be done normally, but that we encourage the 
member for Vancouver East to write to the CRTC and ask if it 
would consider this issue and find ways and means of resolving 
it. Maybe her idea is not the best one but it is a good one. 
Others have said there may be other ways but at least we should 
not let this issue die because I think all of us would agree it 
is an important initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of today's debate perhaps my colleague for Vancouver 
East could ask for the unanimous consent of the House to do that. 
All we are saying is that we would ask for permission of the 
House of Commons for the member to write to the CRTC.  We are not 
endorsing anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What is stopping her? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  It would be nice to have the voice from 
the House of Commons.  Let us get away from this mindless 
partisan bickering where we fight each other for no particular 
reason when there is a good idea.  We could all share in this, 
that the House of Commons has encouraged the member to write to 
the CRTC.  That is all we are asking.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois is in favour of today's motion by the hon. member of 
the NDP that the federal government should encourage the CRTC to 
establish regulations that require telephone companies to assist 
community agencies with providing affordable voice mail service 
to Canadians who cannot afford or do not have access to 
telephone service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois member responsible for this issue being on 
official duties outside the country, I will merely offer my 
support to this motion in his absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to the telecommunications system is not a luxury these 
days, but a necessity.  In fact, the Telecommunications Act 
states clearly that access to telecommunications is in the 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these times of technological revolution, it has become 
indispensable for everyone to be connected to the world, in one 
way or another, via the telecommunications system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC has adopted certain measures, including those to enable 
schools to have access to Internet services at lower cost.  It 
must see that all Canadians and all Quebecers have access to the 
telecommunications system.  Where community initiatives have 
been developed, particularly those to connect the homeless and 
the disadvantaged, these must be studied.

take pleasure in speaking to the private member's motion put 
forward by my colleague the member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiative for this private member's motion comes from the 
Downtown Eastside Residents Association of Vancouver.  The member 
represents her constituents in that area so well. It is a coming 
together in support.  The motion calls on the Canadian 
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to assist with 
providing voice mail for low income and homeless Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Vancouver East said in her opening remarks, 
telephone companies should be required to provide community 
service as part of their licensing.  Providing access to 
affordable voice mail for homeless people and low income 
Canadians would be an invaluable community service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reference point for the private member's motion is the voice 
mail project of the Downtown Eastside Residents Association.  It 
allows anyone in the lower mainland to set up a secure telephone

</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic cost is only $10 for three months, a mere pittance. It 
benefits more than 1,000 users, mostly based in the downtown east 
side.  We are getting a tremendous potential return for a very 
modest outlay of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is calling in her motion today for the CRTC to 
act as a vehicle and a lobby toward the telephone industry, much 
of which has been privatized in recent years, encouraging it to 
come up with a voice mail project that would benefit people who 
do not have access to telephones in order to help them to get on 
their feet and to find employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has made a tremendous difference in peoples lives in the 
downtown eastside.  The executive officer of the DERA Voicemail 
project, Terry Hanley, has said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voice mail has made it easier for people to get in touch with 
potential employers, with family members, and to access community 
and medical services.  It provides previously marginalized people 
with a way to reconnect.  That's not only good for them—it's 
good for the community at large. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of voice mail should be expanded and made available 
to low income and homeless Canadians across the country.  While 
governments and industry spend millions to get Canadians and 
Canadian households on line, some people are without very basic 
services in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear from the Minister of Industry and the Minister of 
Finance that the goal for the country is to become the most wired 
country in the world as quickly as possible.  We on this side do 
not object to that, but at the same time we do not want to leave 
other people behind in this process.  Folks who are without 
homes, basic shelter and telephone service are the folks who are 
most at risk.  We see the disparities growing between the haves 
and have nots.  This is a very modest attempt to try to bring 
those people along and get a minimal amount of service for people 
who do not have access to telephones at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pick up on the valuable point my colleague from 
Kamloops made a few minutes ago.  We in the House do not have the 
greatest reputation in the world if one listens to Canadians who 
sit in on Oral Question Period.  They hear the bickering and the 
back and forth that go on all the time.  It would behove us to 
pay some attention to doing the right thing.  If that means 
encouraging the CRTC to encourage the mostly privatized telephone 
companies across the country to get involved and onside with a 
project like this one, I think it would be a benefit to each and 
every one of us.  The motion before us states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House, the federal government should 
encourage the CRTC to establish regulations that require 
telephone companies to assist community agencies with providing 
affordable voice mail service to Canadians who cannot afford or 
do not have access to telephone service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all my colleagues in the House to support this very 
important motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, as the member for Vancouver Kingsway I wish to commend 
my colleague from Vancouver East on her Motion No. 361 to 
encourage the CRTC to provide affordable voice mail service to 
Canadians.  However, the CRTC is an independent federal agency 
responsible for the supervision and regulation of 
telecommunications in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC has a process by which such suggestions are heard.  The 
public consultation process is available to all Canadians, 
including the hon. member.  It is the best and most appropriate 
way to address the relative benefits of providing voice mail 
service to community agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC has already run a number of hearings on this issue.  In 
October 1999, after an extensive consultation process involving 
public interest advocacy groups, telecommunications companies and 
the local community, the CRTC released its high cost service area 
decision.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this decision the CRTC identified a basic level of telephone 
service to which all Canadians should have access and took steps 
to ensure that over time those few areas of the country that are 
unserved or underserved would have access to the level of service 
currently available to most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic level of service is defined as individual line local 
service with touch tone dialling; the capability to access the 
Internet at a low speeds without incurring long distance charges; 
enhanced calling features and services including privacy 
protection features, access to emergency services and a voice 
messaging relay board services for the hearing impaired; access 
to operator and directory assistance services; access to the long 
distance network; and a copy of a current telephone directory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision will require significant investment by telephone 
companies to upgrade networking in rural and remote areas.  In 
addition the CRTC has implemented a local service subsidy based 
on contributions from long distance carriers along with other 
measures to ensure the continued affordability of basic telephone 
service.  As well, the introduction of competition has benefited 
Canadians at all income levels through lower prices for 
telecommunication services, more innovation and more choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver East has a good idea for use by low 
income families, but I suggest that she should go through the 
public consultation process like any other group of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be brief today in full support of the 
motion put forward by my colleague from Vancouver.  She has 
brought it forward based on the bedrock principle of our party 
that people in society should have, if not equality because we 
know that is not a practical possibility, equality of 
opportunity.  We should do what we can to provide that for people 
in whatever ways we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely surprising and incredible as the hon. member 
and other members have said that in a country which is probably 
the most wired country in the world thousands of people do not 
have even basic telephone service.  We are not only talking basic 
telephone service but about the ability of people, even if they 
do not have a telephone.  The member is not saying that everybody 
has to, because that is a practical impossibility, but access to 
voice mail which is becoming almost as basic a service for many 
of us as telephones are.  The member is asking that we look at a 
creative and inventive way for people to have access to voice 
mail service, even if they do not have a telephone.  She has 
given some examples in her city of Vancouver where a project like 
this is under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to add a great deal to what other members have 
said about the importance of staying in touch.  Let us think how 
important it is now to be able to access and use voice mail 
service and how great a disadvantage it would create to anyone 
who does not have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about equality and accessibility for people who 
do not now have it.   We are talking about their ability to make 
improvements in their lives, which most people want to do.  We 
hear stories of people moving to cities where they are actually 
working but the housing is so expensive that they cannot purchase 
housing.  Calgary is an example.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who are actually working but cannot afford 
housing.  From where will they get their telephone service?  How 
will they have the opportunity, if they are looking for new work, 
to have messages left for them so that they might apply for that 
work?  How will they have the opportunity to stay in touch with 
loved ones and take messages, if they have moved across the 
country from Cape Breton to Calgary to work but do not have a 
telephone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague is trying to find a solution to this problem 
in an inventive and compassionate way.  There has been mention 
this morning of various problems which might be associated with 
this kind of idea.  I urge members, rather than simply looking at 
something and saying there are problems and asking how we can do 
it, to spend more of their time on the how and begin to talk and 
look at exactly how we might put something like this into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion as it reads is not prescriptive in that way.  That 
would come later once members of the House pass the motion, as we 
hope they will.  Then we can begin to work on approaches to the 
CRTC and perhaps approaches to telephone providers to see how 
such a concept might come into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically I find this to be a very exciting and inventive idea. 
I offer my hon. colleague my full support.  I urge other members 
of the House to think about it again and to give that support as 
well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank hon. members of the various parties in the House for giving 
their comments on the motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of reply, when motions come forward it is easy for any 
one of us to say this bit is wrong or that bit is wrong, or this 
would not work and in effect shoot it down.  The issue is whether 
we understand that this is a very basic issue affecting low 
income and homeless Canadians.  I have heard all representatives 
who spoke basically say that they understood there was a problem 
in that hundreds of thousands Canadians do not have access to 
basic phone service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we agree on that, the next question is whether it is a good 
idea to do something about it.  Various comments have been made 
and some of the hon. members on the government side have said 
that we should go to the CRTC.  I certainly will do that.  I 
absolutely will follow it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I want to get the support of my 
colleagues.  This is about generating debate and support for 
ideas that are reasonable and sound and asking if we can work on 
it together.  In that regard I reply to the Alliance members who 
say it is just another idea of centralization from the NDP.  That 
is not what it is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Alliance members who said that the DERA model 
is the way to go, but are we saying that small underfunded 
community organizations dealing with huge demands in their local 
communities should spend a year or two years trying to get a 
small project like this under way?   Let us be realistic about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of going to the CRTC and asking to make this part of 
the licensing requirement is to say that it could be easily done. 
Yes, we could go to a group in Saskatchewan, in Newfoundland or 
in Ontario and say to go ahead and try to set it up, but the fact 
is that the DERA organization is actually subsidizing the 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being requested in the motion is to suggest to the CRTC 
that it should look for ways for these huge telephone companies 
to provide some support to local communities, for example by 
providing access lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DERA project has 12 lines that are in constant use but it 
has to pay for those lines through Telus communications, which 
used to be B.C. Tel.  It would be so easy for that telephone 
company to say that it is on board and will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for bringing the motion forward was to look at a 
creative way of asking whether it would be a good idea to ensure 
easy access to Canadians.  It has nothing to do with creating 
regulations for regulation sake.  It is about creating equity in 
society.  It is about creating justice.  It is about saying to 
organizations that we mandate, the CRTC, that part of its job is 
to ensure there are basic levels of service in the country, 
whether it is health care or education. 
Here we happen to be talking about phone service.

agree that it an idea that could be followed up with the support 
of members.  I will certainly follow it up because I am very 
committed to doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion by my hon. colleague from Kamloops is a very 
good one and is something the House could do.  I thank the member 
who spoke from the Bloc who clearly understood what this issue 
was about and is willing to support it.  I think other members 
obviously have some questions.  Frankly, I was surprised to hear 
the comments from the member for Vancouver Kingsway because there 
are low income members in that particular riding who would love 
to have this kind of phone access.  To say that the CRTC is 
already doing this is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members not to let this go by the boards but to find a 
way to support this motion.  I ask for the unanimous consent of 
the House to support me in writing to the CRTC asking it to give 
this matter consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member is

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 16 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-11, an act to authorize the divestiture of the assets 
of, and to dissolve, the Cape Breton Development Corporation, to 
amend the Cape Breton Development Corporation  Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other Acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee, and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, it is with some sadness 
that I address Bill C-11, an act to authorize the divestiture of 
the assets of, and to dissolve, the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation, to amend the Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain why I feel this sadness. On January 28, 1999, the 
federal Minister of Natural Resources announced the closure of 
the Phalen coal mine and the privatization of the Prince mine, 
both located on Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Island and managed by 
a crown corporation, Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, close to 1,700 miners were working for the crown 
corporation. About 1,000 people find themselves out of work, in 
a region where unemployment is already at 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the minister announced $110 million in 
assistance to be used for severance pay and early retirement 
programs for the miners, as well as $68 million for economic 
development in the region. The Government of Nova Scotia 
announced in the fall that it would be investing $12 million in 
the long term economic development of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that Devco workers are not pleased 
with the severance package and with the proposed payments. For 
well over a year now, since February 1999, they have been making 
representations to the federal government, asking it to 
reconsider its decisions and to improve its proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, on December 23, a committee made up of representatives 
from all parties in the legislative House of Assembly of Nova 
Scotia called on the federal government to improve its offers 
and increase the amounts proposed to workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One million dollars is a lot of money, but when 1,000 people 
find themselves without work, one million divided by 1,000 is 
only $1,000 each.  This will not pay the grocery bill for very 
long, or the rent, and it will not put clothes on children's 
backs for very long either; $1,000 will be gone very quickly. 
These 1,000 employees are going to end up on social assistance 
fairly quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are being offered more than $1,000, but nothing that will 
really keep them going for much more than a year.  These 
families will be in a very shaky situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to depart from my prepared text and share with the 
House the conversations I had with those representing workers at 
the time last year when I myself was the Bloc Quebecois' natural 
resources critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to meet with mothers who had travelled here to 
Ottawa to make parliamentarians aware of the fate in store for 
their husbands, their partners or their sons if the Devco mine 
were to close.  Let us look at the broader picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Devco mine is basically a coal mine.  Coal is less popular 
than it used to be.  It is a fairly polluting substance. 
Therefore, planning to shut down a coal mine, when coal is less 
in demand internationally, for the reasons I have just given, is 
not, in itself, illogical.  The problem is the approach being 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time now, the Devco mine has been run for the federal 
government. 
When we are dealing with a region like Cape Breton and more than 
1,000 people who are going to lose their jobs, this is 
catastrophic in a community where there are not many employment 
alternatives.  In short, the federal government is, with its 
good intentions of terminating operations for the extraction of 
a raw material, coal, no longer in fashion in the world market, 
committing the huge mistake of penalizing a region, with 
catastrophic results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, once the people have exhausted their benefits, 
their separation payments, the outcome will be despair and a 
complete lack of job opportunities.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will then have two choices: taking their families and 
settling elsewhere in Canada, in order to make a living, or 
remaining where they are, in most cases dependent on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By using this bill to close the mine under the present 
circumstances, the federal government is, to all intents and 
purposes, thrusting a region of Nova Scotia into a disastrous 
economic situation, one that will be very long term.  This is 
not something that will be remedied in six months or a year.  It 
will take decades to be rectified, if ever, because its very 
clear consequences will be an exodus of families and increased 
poverty in this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier, I had the opportunity to meet the wives of 
the miners and mine workers who are unemployed.  The problem 
could probably have been lessened in various ways, and the 
unions made proposals—and it was not just the unions that made 
proposals—that, for the most part, meant that many of the 1,000 
workers could have faster access to their pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a number of ways to go about it.  The pensions could 
have been beefed up for those close to retirement, within two or 
three years of it—and there were several hundred of them—other 
workers could have been kept on working in the mine, while the 
facilities were being shut down.  From what I understand, the 
facilities will be closed by an outside corporation, that may 
perhaps hire these people for a short while, but will not 
contribute to the pension fund they have already accumulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, there were solutions.  They could really not have cost 
more in the medium term.  They could definitely cost less in the 
long term.  The government thinks it is only in the very short 
term that savings will be made, and making a saving in human 
terms in the very short term is really wasting human capital and 
thus wasting resources in the medium and long term.  This is 
exactly the situation we are in with Bill C-11, to close the 
Devco mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how the House could influence the minister to 
change his decision.  I have the impression that things are cast 
in stone.  It is really with great regret and sadness that I 
realize that the representations made by the people of Cape 
Breton who came to explain the situation, by the union 
representatives and by the members of the House, have not had 
the results we had hoped for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the short term saving made by the government will be 
replaced by waste and numerous expenditures in the medium and 
long terms, particularly for the Province of Nova Scotia, which 
will have to support, through social assistance, families that 
will find themselves in a precarious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not like this situation. The Bloc 
Quebecois has a heart and it wants the government to also have a 
heart. I will conclude by expressing my sympathy and wishing the 
best of luck to those brave Devco workers, who, unfortunately, 
are being mistreated by the Liberal federal government, which 
has no heart.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend the hon. member for his comments and I thank 
his party for the positions it has put forward on behalf of the 
working people in Cape Breton.  It is one of the few friends, 
other than the New Democratic Party, that the working people in 
Cape Breton have found to voice their concerns in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions for the member.  First, he talked 
about money.  The government of course will say it is offering 
$111 million as an incentive package for the miners who are 
leaving.  I point out that in 1996 our gross domestic product was 
$820 billion, and it is more today.  While $111 million may sound 
like a great deal, in relative terms it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that the government will say it has offered $68 
million to Cape Breton for future economic development.  I point 
out that the Minister of Canadian Heritage recently announced $48 
million to build the war heritage museum here in Ottawa. 
For the entire island of Cape Breton and its future economic 
growth, we get the value of about one building in Ottawa.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important though, I would ask the member to comment on the 
following.  This is not the first time crown corporations have 
been shut down by the government. In each and every case there 
were benefits offered to those employees as the government 
extracted itself from whatever industry it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of areas we could compare, but let us just 
take health care benefits.  These people are miners for the most 
part. They have gone underground.  They have suffered injuries. 
Let me just cite some comparisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When VIA Rail was shut down, the employees of the crown 
corporation not entitled to retirement benefits were eligible for 
100% pension contributions and full health benefits packages for 
five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When CN was shut down, the employees were entitled to group 
benefits and life insurance for a maximum of two years and the 
company paid the full cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When AECL was shut down, there was an extension of benefit 
packages with Blue Cross for health, dental and life insurance 
costs which were covered by the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Devco shuts down, which the government says is justified, 
the employees who suffer from a number of ailments because of the 
kind of career and work they did, there are no provisions in this 
government package for extensions of health, dental or life 
insurance benefits.  Those who have sick children, those who 
suffer from illnesses that they received in the mines, those who 
suffer from lung cancer, those who suffer from black lung will 
not be afforded the rights that were afforded other employees of 
crown corporations when the government withdrew from those 
corporations.  That is just in health benefits.  I could go on 
and compare others.  I would be interested to hear the member's 
comments on those issues. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member just 
mentioned a number of very real consequences relating to health. 
Indeed, this is what I pointed out earlier in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a will to save federal dollars in the short 
term. Incidentally, these dollars come from the taxpayers' 
pockets. There is no Santa Claus in Ottawa that prints money. 
These dollars come from the pockets of those who pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to save that money, but in 12, 24, 36 
months and more, there will be families having a hard time 
putting food on the table and buying clothes for their children, 
with the result that these children may not do as well as they 
should in school. The federal government is sacrificing a whole 
generation to save a few dollars, primarily because of a lack of 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just a dollars and cents issue. It is also a matter 
of heart. One must have a vision that comes from the heart but, 
unfortunately, the government opposite does not seem to have 
such a vision, a vision that would ensure that families can 
continue to live, grow and thrive on Cape Breton Island.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, there has 
been a lot of debate about Bill C-11 that did not focus on Bill 
C-11, but on the fairness of the $111 million human resource 
package that was announced in January 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This funding was announced for a workforce adjustment program to 
deal with the loss of jobs associated with the closure of the 
failing mine.  Unfortunately, the failing mine closed last 
September, about one year earlier than planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important that the House understand the status of 
this issue so that we can move on to deal with the issues 
surrounding Bill C-11 and the sale of Devco's assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 2000 Devco and its four unions agreed to form a joint 
planning committee, as per part III of the Canada Labour Code. 
Devco and the unions are continuing to follow the process as 
outlined in the labour code for resolving the workforce 
adjustment issues.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently this process led to the appointment of an arbitrator. 
Devco and its unions have agreed to a process to deal with the 
labour issues.  The decision of the arbitrator will be final and 
binding on all parties.  There is a process to deal with the 
labour issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a lot of effort, interest has been identified in Devco's 
assets.  We are now at a stage where we should move forward with 
the process of considering Bill C-11.  Now is the time to move 
the bill to the committee stage so that it can be examined in 
more detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sales process announced by the government in January 1999 
and initiated by the Cape Breton Development Corporation is at a 
stage where the private sector has come forward with definitive 
proposals for Devco's assets.  Devco has a real opportunity to 
move its operations to the private sector and the step that is 
required by the House is to move forward with Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate I have heard a lot of support for 
privatization from both sides of the House.  It is important that 
we seize the opportunity to enable a private sector operator to 
acquire Devco's mining assets so that jobs can be maintained in 
coal mining.  With the progress that Devco has made and the 
investments that prospective purchasers have made in carrying out 
their due diligence, time has now become of the essence in terms 
of moving forward with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sale process will involve substantially all of Devco's 
assets.  Subsection 90, part II of the Financial Administration 
Act stipulates that no crown corporation shall sell or otherwise 
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets unless 
authorized by an act of parliament.  That is the reason for Bill 
C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to obtaining the authority to sell substantially all 
of Devco's assets, the bill will provide for the winding up of 
the affairs of the corporation and its eventual dissolution; 
provide for legal proceedings against Devco to be brought against 
the crown; maintain the general advantage of the Canada clause of 
the existing Cape Breton Development Corporation Act, thereby 
ensuring that the Canada Labour Code will apply to a private 
sector purchaser, and amend the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation Act to remove provisions that are no longer 
applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a relatively simple straightforward bill.  The first 
five clauses of the bill are the divestiture and dissolution 
authorization.  Most of these clauses are standard for this type 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next is a series of amendments to the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation Act that are of a housekeeping nature that reduces 
the number of directors on the board.  Finally, there are 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now time to study these aspects of the bill in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Before recognizing 
the last speaker, I should have told the House that from this 
point on we are getting into 10 minute speeches with no questions 
or comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill C-11.  The issue 
of Devco and that of the whole coal mining industry in Cape 
Breton is one that has been grappled with by successive 
governments, particularly over the last 30 years when government 
involvement in Cape Breton coal mining reached a greater level in 
the late 1960s and Devco was formed as a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a very difficult period in recent years with the 
decline in the coal industry and the resulting impact on Cape 
Bretoners, particularly in industrial Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that we are in the midst of a transitional 
economy, from a resource based traditional industrial economy 
into, and we are well into it, a knowledge based economy where 
most of the opportunities in the 21st century will come not from 
bricks but more likely from clicks. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really look at some of what is happening in the global 
environment, we have to ensure that while we are preparing new 
generations to participate in the global knowledge based economy, 
we are not denying them the ability to take care of themselves 
and their families during a very difficult time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several concerns about Bill C-11.  We in the 
Progressive Conservative Party are supportive of the direction 
that the government is taking in a general sense in addressing 
the issue of the Devco situation.  There are some significant 
problems with the compensation packages and some real fairness 
issues that have not been addressed in this legislation.  If we 
compare the treatment of one coal miner to another depending on 
the length of time the miner has worked and the age of the miner, 
the formula seems to be in need of a significant amount of work. 
The fairness issue within the network of people who will be 
receiving benefits is clearly inadequate and wrong headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also heard some other members speak today of the 
comparative disadvantages of the pay out packages compared to 
similar situations with other precedents that have been set by 
government or crown agencies in the past.  Again, as a member of 
parliament, I would hope, expect and demand that Cape Breton coal 
miners be dealt with fairly at this very difficult time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also urge the government to do more work with the 
knowledge based economic players, whether it is the incubators 
like the University College of Cape Breton and Dr. Jacquelyn 
Thayer-Scott who is working with the University College of Cape 
Breton to create a greater level of economic opportunity in the 
new economy there.  I would hope that the government recognizes 
the value of that very important incubation infrastructure for 
the new economy and continues to increase levels of support for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also hope that the government would look at ways to 
obtain a more competitive or advantageous tax structure.  Tax 
advantage zones can be created within Canada in places like Cape 
Breton.  Many people compare Canada with Ireland and the 
tremendous growth that has been seen there in recent years. 
Ireland has had a 92% growth in GDP per capita over a 10 year 
period.  This is not really a very good comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we compare Ireland to pockets in Atlantic Canada, 
particularly Cape Breton, and consider Ireland's relationship 
with the EU in the context of Cape Breton's relationship with 
other parts of Canada through the equalization system, I think we 
can quite quickly see a parallel of opportunities.  If the 
government were to develop some type of tax advantage for 
companies to locate in places like Cape Breton, a similarly 
advantageous tax structure to what has been accomplished with 
Ireland's economy using some of the funding from the EU could be 
created.  These are the types of things we should be looking at. 
The Atlantic Provinces Economic Council and the Atlantic 
Institute for Market Studies have done some very credible work on 
some of these areas and alternatives in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some significant flaws in the fairness issue related 
to Bill C-11.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to be vigilant in not putting on 
any logical blinders when dealing with these kinds of issues. It 
is a difficult time for the coal miners of Cape Breton who are 
losing their jobs.  We must ensure that they are dealt with as 
fairly as those in previous situations in other precedents in 
Canada with crown agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further urge that we continue working toward creating an 
economic environment for Cape Breton and all Canada where people 
can find greater levels of economic opportunities and prosperity 
within some of the new emerging industries as we begin the 21st 
Century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in the House with the same sense of outrage and 
frustration that has been expressed by other members.  We are 
debating a bill that is of vital importance to the people of Cape 
Breton, to the people who have worked in the Devco mines and to 
the people who live in the communities that have supported those 
mines, and, I think for the 66th time in this parliament, we are 
facing closure on yet another bill.  This will cut off debate and 
the life line that those miners have to voice their expressions 
of concern in this parliament about what is happening to them and 
their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here in parliament to defend and uphold democracy. 
Whenever we have closure on debate and whenever debate is cut off 
and opposition members are cut off from holding the government 
accountable for the legislation it brings in, it is a sad day not 
just in this parliament but for all Canadians and something to 
which we should pay attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating Bill C-11, the bill that means the death and 
dissolution of Devco, a program of this government to carry out 
policies that will have a very dramatic impact on the people of 
Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the federal NDP from Nova Scotia but 
particularly from Cape Breton, the member for Sydney—Victoria 
and the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, have stood up in 
parliament and in the community in solidarity with the people of 
Cape Breton to fight this closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with two issues in my comments.  One is the myth 
that surrounds the mining operations and what has taken place 
over many generations.  Second, I will talk about the impact that 
this closure will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a myth that this mining operation is somehow a losing 
proposition and the government had no alternative but to step in 
and shut it down.  The reality is that for over 300 years mining 
has been a part of this community.  For over 300 years mining has 
sustained good paying union jobs for which miners in many cases 
have fought and died, for health and safety, for better wages and 
for better working conditions.  In many instances they have given 
their lives to that community by working in these mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years these mines have also provided great economic 
benefit.  I am not from Cape Breton.  I am from Vancouver East. I 
am from the other coast, the west coast.  Yet the story that I 
see in Cape Breton is a story that is all too familiar across the 
country.  In my own community of East Vancouver we have seen the 
government set up the proposition that somehow a community 
economic development operation that is getting a government 
subsidy, it is too late, it is too bad, we have to take the 
subsidy away and we have to somehow make it profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that over the past 30 years the government has 
invested about $1.7 billion into the Devco mines.  What has been 
put back into that local economy from spin-offs and the support 
that it has created in local communities has been more than $5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from watching the news reports on television and 
listening to my colleagues from Cape Breton that in the local 
community they know the truth. 
They know this mine could continue to be profitable and that the 
decision by the government to withdraw from this operation, 
devastating the lives of the local communities, is one of the 
worst things that has happened in this parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the impact, I have to ask myself what would happen 
to a local community where there is an employment environment, 
whether it is a mine, or a fishery, or the woodworking industry 
in British Columbia, if that was suddenly withdrawn.  I think 
last Christmas we saw an inkling of what that impact would be. 
Many of us were back in our ridings.  I was paying attention to 
issues that were going on in Vancouver East and dealing with many 
important things.  Every day I watched the national news and 
watched the miners who, in desperation, were trying to draw the 
attention of the government to their plight and what would happen 
as a result of these mine closures.  It was really awful to 
watch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The miners wanted to be home with their families.  They wanted 
to get ready for Christmas, to buy Christmas presents and to 
celebrate with their families and friends.  What were they doing? 
They were holding sit-ins and taking desperate measures because 
they felt like they were at the end of the line and had no 
options left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that our members in Nova Scotia and Cape 
Breton were there standing in solidarity with those miners. They 
understood what was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of times in the House we debate issues around poverty, 
child poverty and the 1989 resolution to eliminate child poverty 
that was passed unanimously in the House.  It seems that on 
occasion there is a sense of goodwill from the House that this is 
an important Canadian priority.  We do not want to see children 
go hungry.  We do not want to see children living in communities 
where there is economic and social devastation.  However, with 
this bill, through deliberate conscious public policy, the 
government has created that kind of social and economic 
devastation.  There will be more poor children in Cape Breton, a 
community that is already suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Bras d'Or—Cape Breton told me that to even 
come close to the level of what is happening on the mainland, 
Cape Breton will need another 13,000 to 14,000 jobs.  Why would 
this mine closure make any sense?  Why would this bill make any 
sense?  Even the terms of the closure are disastrous in terms of 
not involving the miners and not developing compensation 
packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago we heard from our colleague from 
Sydney—Victoria who said that the miners, who have worked there 
for decades and who have literally given their working lives to 
this industry, will not be compensated, recognized or 
acknowledged in terms of their own health.  They will leave this 
industry with no job, no protection for them or their families in 
terms of health care, no dental plan and no ongoing training. 
What a catastrophe.  What does it say about the priorities of the 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the impact on this community, I am sure there will 
be increasing anxiety not only about the closures but about what 
will happen at this point.  We have already heard speculation and 
rumours that one of the mines might be up for sale and that it 
might be bought by a multinational corporation. It is insane that 
we have a government that is not willing to sit down in good 
faith with the local community, with those workers, their 
families, community leaders and the local members of parliament 
to find a way for this operation to continue.  The miners were 
greatly interested in getting together and forming co-operatives 
and associations that would have allowed the mine to continue. 
They wanted to ensure that there was local control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk a lot about community economic development.  Here was an 
instance where the people in the community were committed, had 
the knowledge and the expertise.  Did anyone else have more 
expertise than those coal miners to know how the operation should 
run and how it could be profitable?  They were completely 
ignored by the federal government. 
We are here today debating the dissolution of these operations 
under an order of closure to cut off debate with speculation 
about a multinational corporation moving in.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal NDP wants to know what the federal government is 
doing to investigate potential buyers who may be there and come 
forward.  We understand that there are multinational corporations 
looking at this particular operation and may want to put in a 
purchase offer.  One of the rumours we have heard is that one 
such corporation buys its coal from Colombia.  What we need to 
know is who will be mining that coal.  Will child labour be used? 
Has the government done any investigation to assure the local 
community that whatever buyers are there are actually 
organizations and corporations that have legitimacy, credibility, 
a track record and are not using child labour in other countries 
or violating environmental standards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst part is that we should not even be considering foreign 
buyers.  We should be investing in this local community.  We 
should be saying that these jobs have value and meaning and that 
the people of this local community have a right to come together 
to determine their own economic future.  That is what we stand 
for in this party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move the following amendment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by deleting the words “Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations” and 
inserting the words “Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities” 
following the words “subject matter”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  At this point, I will 
reserve my ruling on the amendment as there may be a question of 
wording that may not be receivable.  I will get back to the hon.

<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to again stand in the House to debate Bill 
C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I last spoke to the bill on November 15, 1999, I have 
had an opportunity to visit Cape Breton and talk to the 
stakeholders in this issue.  I met with union representatives, as 
well as two local bidders whose bids were rejected by Nesbitt 
Burns Inc.  I also visited the mine sites, the coal wash 
plant and the old Sydney steel mill site.  The visits certainly 
gave me a more indepth understanding of the issues surrounding 
the sale of Devco and how it will affect Cape Bretoners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the government's stated commitment to a speedy process 
for this bill, Bill C-11 seems to have totally dropped off the 
government's legislative radar until today.  Everything else seems 
to be a priority for the government except for a bill that has 
so far-reaching and drastic effects on the lives of Cape 
Bretoners. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might also suppose that a bill of such importance would be 
given due process and time, but no, yet again the government has 
decided to wait until the last moment before invoking time 
allocation to run the bill through the House of Commons as fast 
as it possibly can.  After all, the government does not care to 
allow all members the opportunity to rise in the House and speak 
their concerns, or more important, the concerns of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only wonder why the government is suddenly in such a hurry 
to speed Bill C-11 through the House.  After all, it has always 
been acknowledged that before the sale of Devco could proceed, 
this bill had to be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me wonder if the rumoured American buyers are getting 
impatient to claim their prize.  We know how chummy the Prime 
Minister likes to be with anyone south of the border. What else 
would motivate the government to suddenly move so quickly? 
Certainly it could not be the interests of Cape Bretoners and 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fully aware that Devco was created as a vote getting 
measure, despite the fact that as far back as 1957 it was 
recognized that the coal industry alone simply would not be 
sufficiently viable to sustain the entire economy of Cape Breton 
on a long term basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1966 the government announced a $55 million package to phase 
out coal mining in Cape Breton over 15 years, yet in the very 
next year massive expansion occurred within the region with the 
creation of Devco. Even as Devco was being created it was obvious 
that the coal mining industry in Cape Breton would not be viable 
if Devco had to accept the full liability of past generations of 
Dominion Steel and Coal Company employees who were abandoned when 
these ventures went into receivership. So began the government's 
involvement, what I would call interference, into the economy and 
viability of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the next 30 years the government continued to support Devco 
through a variety of subsidies and grants until finally in 
January 1999 the government announced that it was putting Devco 
and all its assets up for sale.  That is 30 years of families 
coming to rely on the industry they believed would support them 
as they had supported Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not just talking about a nine to five job that the miners 
can walk away from without any costs.  A well known fact is the 
toll that coal miners pay with their health to work in coal 
mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the costs, the miners went ahead and did their jobs 
believing they would have jobs in the industry which is all many 
of them have ever known.  Yet the entire time the government has 
known differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years through different governments which have come and 
gone, one thing has not changed regarding Devco.  It simply was 
not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sustain the economy, one could suggest to flow votes from 
Cape Breton to the government, the government continually sunk 
more and more money into Devco with the expressed intention of 
making the industry work.  At the same time, an examination of 
the annual reports of Devco indicated that the government was 
intentionally manipulating the shutdown of Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that manipulation, Devco families have faced numerous 
shutdowns, failures to meet production targets, and stunning 
financial losses.  It is those families in the Cape Breton 
community as a whole who are suffering from devious management 
manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first rose in the House to speak to Bill C-11, I raised a 
number of concerns regarding the accountability measures included 
within the bill.  As I have just mentioned, governments over the 
years have done little to ensure that Devco was not used as a 
patronage plum.  I would hope that in the final days of Devco, 
the government could at the very least assure Canadians that 
their hard earned money was not going to waste in some Liberal 
crony's pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 20 a committee established to suggest ways to spend the 
$80 million set aside to cushion the collapse of Cape Breton's 
coal industry released a report which stated the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton Island has experienced poor economic conditions many 
times...but none can compare to the present day.  People are 
showing a lack of confidence in the future.  Immediate action is 
required to both illustrate government's understanding of the 
problem and its potential to help. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind everyone that such a situation is exactly 
what was predicted back in 1957.  Here we are on May 8, 2000 and 
we are still looking at second reading of this bill, albeit in a 
rather drastic hurry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was released almost a month and a half ago and the 
government is just now realizing it had better hurry up and do 
something about the situation in Cape Breton. After all, the 
Prime Minister has promised an election within the next year.  I 
question the timeline of the government and its dedication to 
providing due process and consideration for the miners and Devco 
employees affected by the sale of Devco.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the sale of Devco, I have a few questions regarding 
exactly how the sale is taking place.  Let me provide a bit of 
background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2(2) calls for subsections 99(2) to (5) of the Financial 
Administration Act not to apply to the disposal or sale of Devco 
assets.  Back in November when I originally spoke to the bill I 
voiced my concerns as to why the FAA needs to be suspended for 
this sale to go through.  More important, what will replace those 
controls?  The FAA ensures that a sale such as this happens in an 
open, accountable manner. If these restrictions are removed, what 
will control such issues as who gets the successful bid, was a 
reasonable amount paid for the assets, was the transaction made 
in the best value for money interests and will the money return 
to the public coffers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I raised in November was that only bidders and 
cabinet will have access to the bidding process.  No one else can 
get information about how much the assets are worth. How will we 
know if the final price truly reflects the value of the assets? 
The reality is that whoever takes over the assets will not just 
get non-viable leftovers.  After having invested millions of 
dollars over the last 30 years and thanks to governments never 
seeing any kind of return on investment, Canadians at least 
deserve to know the terms and conditions of the sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to state that I believe many of my fears regarding 
the process of the sale of Devco are being realized. Mr. Joe 
Shannon, currently on the Devco board of directors, was first 
appointed by cabinet on July 4, 1995 to be the chairman of the 
Devco board for a three year term.  On July 26, 1995 cabinet 
authorized the board's decision to have Joe Shannon act as 
president of Devco.  Mr. Shannon was reappointed to the board of 
directors for another three year term on August 26, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Shannon has obviously done fairly well through his 
appointments. At the same time he was leading Devco he was also 
president, director and chief executive officer of Seaboard 
Transport. While Joe Shannon was head of both companies, Seaboard 
Transport received a multimillion dollar contract to transport 
coal from the mines to the Nova Scotia power plants and the wash 
plant, a clear conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the end of the story of Mr. Shannon.  He is 
currently participating with Nesbitt Burns assessing bids for the 
sale and divestiture of Devco assets.  Mr. Shannon clearly has a 
vested interest in ensuring his own interests are considered by 
whoever takes over.  Judging by his lack of qualms in sitting on 
both the Devco and Seaboard Transport boards, I am doubtful that 
Mr. Shannon will suddenly find himself a conscience and act on 
what is truly in the best interests of Devco, Cape Bretoners and 
Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do I have concerns regarding the goings on in the 
boardroom, I have serious doubts regarding the bidding process 
for Devco and how decisions are being made as to who is seriously 
considered.  In the March 20, 2000 edition of the Cape Breton 
<I>Post</I> a letter from Kevin Murphy, vice-president of the Cape 
Breton Miners Development Co-operative Limited, stated the 
concern of many Cape Bretoners that the bidding process for Devco 
is freezing out local bids.  Mr. Murphy stated the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that handing off the Nova Scotia Power Inc. supply 
contract to foreign suppliers is an unacceptable situation and we 
decided back in May to do something about it by forming a workers 
co-op and subsequently submitting a bid for the Devco assets 
through the Nesbitt Burns process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our bid was rejected, as was a bid put forward by Donkin 
Resources Limited, which is determined to press on with opening 
the Donkin mine with the support of the community and groups such 
as our co-op, which is ready to invest in the project to ensure 
that at least some of the NSPI coal is supplied by Cape 
Bretoners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Murphy went on to question why the federal government would 
rather hand over a lucrative contract to a foreign company when 
the coal could be supplied locally.  He concluded that “there is 
money to be made in the industry and that it should be reinvested 
here for the future of our people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted extensively from Mr. Murphy because I do not think it 
could be said any better.  Cape Bretoners are ready, prepared and 
anxious to rebuild their economy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. I must 
interrupt the hon. member.  Ten minutes has elapsed, 
unfortunately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a great honour to speak to this very important 
bill, Bill C-11.  It deals with Devco, the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation divestiture authorization and dissolution 
act.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to put this matter into some context in the 
sense that subsection 90(2) of the Financial Administration Act 
stipulates that we need to go through this process in order to 
meet the requirements under that act.  It is very important that 
we proceed accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat heartened by the member for Kings—Hants.  He 
spoke in very reasoned tones and appropriately so. It was 
important that he went on record as indicating that the party 
opposite was in agreement with how the government was acting. It 
certainly made a great deal of sense to me. It is important that 
we proceed accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little disappointed with the Canadian Alliance member, 
the member for Athabasca, who talked in terms of the Americans 
and how they interact with Canada.  If anyone should be looking 
in the mirror when it comes to the Americans it is the alliance 
party.  That party is in favour of a two tier American style 
health system.  Members of the Canadian Alliance should be the 
last people in the House to talk about Canada's interface with 
the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Athabasca seemed to drag a few people and the 
process through the mud today.  I take exception to that.  It is 
inappropriate and not very beneficial to the debate.  Quite 
frankly it is typical of those alliance members in what they do, 
how they say it, and the kind of actions they seem to take 
delight in making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I have been to Cape Breton a number of times, 
at least three times and most recently twice. It is very 
important to meet with the people there.  I have met with people 
in the area, union people, local officials, families.  It is 
important that we on the government side listen carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded by the NDP member for Vancouver East and the 
outrageous things she said about bringing in the end to this 
debate and proceeding forward. She knows full well, as do all the 
NDP members opposite, that we have had a number of hours of 
debate in the House on this very important bill.  Instead the 
member said that we are somehow abusing the system when in fact 
it is the contrary.  What we are doing is bringing closure to 
this very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the member talked about poor children.  She talked about 
child labour in other countries.  She talked about rumours that 
she had heard.  Imagine, in this great parliament of ours members 
opposite, especially the NDP who should know better, getting up 
and dealing in rumour and innuendo. Is that not typical of the 
NDP members who always are delighted in throwing tons of money at 
everything.  Instead of taking a reasoned, natural and good 
rational approach to things, they always throw money at them, 
which is a typical NDP philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we on this side of the House are putting a process in 
place for the benefit not only of the good people of Cape Breton, 
of Devco and those people who are in need but by extension for 
all Canadians.  That is important to note. It underscores the 
commitment of the Government of Canada in this all important 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP members in this debate have been twisting this fact and 
I find it reprehensible that they would do it. I want to point 
out that on October 1, 1999 the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation advised the federal Minister of Labour that it would 
be terminating the employment of approximately 600 employees due 
to the closure of the Phalen colliery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 13 the company and the four unions representing Devco 
employees agreed to form a joint planning committee as per part 
III of the Canada Labour Code. The committee met in an attempt to 
reach agreement on the terms of an adjustment program that was 
unsuccessful, which was unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employee representatives on that committee notified the 
Minister of Labour of their inability to reach agreement with the 
company. On March 14 the Minister of Labour appointed a person as 
mediator to assist in the negotiations and failing agreement, to 
advise her on the matters appropriate for arbitration pursuant to 
section 224 of part III of the Canada Labour Code.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at that point and into binding arbitration.  As most 
members of the House know, it will be binding not only on the 
company but on the members and the employees involved, as well as 
on the Government of Canada.  We expect that report some time in 
the very near future and some talk as early as the end of May. We 
need to proceed in that fashion.  It is important and it makes a 
great deal of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It astounded me when I heard the Alliance member, the hon. 
member for Athabasca, talk in terms of little or no consultation. 
That really is an out and out falsehood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Members from the NDP know that as well. 
Listen to them caterwauling instead of listening to the speech. 
They are caterwauling and trying to stir things up.  They should 
listen.  What I am about to say is worth listening to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister met with all kinds of officials in that part of the 
country.  He met with management.  He met with unions.  He met 
with business and community leaders.  He met with local clergy, 
for that matter.  He met with representatives of the provincial 
government.  He has gone out of his way as have other members of 
the government, instead of stirring things up, trying to 
undermine the process and trying to act on rumours, innuendo, 
falsehoods and myths like members of the NDP.  Instead of doing 
that, we on the government side got our facts and listened to the 
people to ensure that we were involved in great consultation by 
way of process and how best to deal with the good folks in that 
part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, is it perfect?  I do not think so. 
However at the end of the day we have put in place a great 
process which makes sense ultimately.  It will assist that part 
of Atlantic Canada and, more to the point, Cape Breton.  It will 
do so in a manner consistent with the values of people in not 
only that part of our country but Canadians wherever they live in 
our great land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we have done it in a methodical, wise and 
reasoned way, instead of operating as some members of the 
opposition have, that is by way of falsehoods, stirring things up 
and making mischief, quite simply, which I think is absolutely 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan is in place in a way that Devco has now received 
definitive proposals for its assets.  The corporation is at a 
stage of evaluating and clarifying one of the proposals with a 
view to finalizing the broad terms and conditions of the sale. 
Hopefully that will be done in the very near future, and again 
there is talk of as early as June.  Negotiations concerning a 
final detailed purchase and sale agreement would follow 
accordingly, as would be the normal course of events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is following what the minister, the officials and 
government have seen as appropriate in terms of this important 
issue which strikes to the heart of a great many people in that 
part of Canada.  We understand that.  We respect it and we have 
tried to deal with it in a sensitive and reasoned way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prospects for transferring the assets of Devco to the 
private sector and for maintaining coal mining jobs in a private 
sector commercial operation are very real.  That has been a goal 
of the government from the outset.  Instead of trying to create 
mischief and doing those kinds of things, with a steady hand the 
government is trying to ensure that we can carry on with 
employment in an area that requires our assistance.  We as a 
government have always tried to do the right thing, which is to 
assist people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike others in the House who might try in a Darwinian economic 
sense to let people hang out to dry, we have never done that, not 
through history and certainly not now.  We will do the right 
thing to ensure that the transition from the jobs of the past to 
the new economy will take place in a way consistent with the 
values that are appropriate to Canadian society.  So it is that 
we proceed in this important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great friends in Cape Breton with whom I have talked 
repeatedly.  I have visited there on a number of occasions.  It 
is important that we deal with the matter in a way consistent 
with not only what those people want, because obviously they are 
important in this equation, but in the best interest of the 
country as a whole.   It is with great honour that I say we will 
now bring the bill forward, vote on it and get on with the 
business at hand.  Why do we do that? 
We do it because it is ultimately not only in the best interest 
of the people of Cape Breton and specifically the employees of 
Devco, but it is in the best interest of Canada as a whole.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  At this point I would 
like to advise the House and the member for Vancouver East that 
the amendment to the amendment she proposed earlier is not in order 
because it would render the amendment unintelligible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on Devco.  I wanted, 
especially after the last speaker, to put before the House and 
others who may be listening what is at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the direct loss of close to 1,500 well 
paying jobs.  We are talking about the loss of almost $80 million 
per year in wages and salaries to that region.  We are talking 
about the loss of $28 million a year in Canada pension, 
employment insurance and income tax.  We are talking about a 
total estimated annual economic loss, direct and indirect, as 
high as $300 million for the region of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker would have everybody think that this is a 
very minor bill that will through and what is the problem. As I 
understand it this is the 65th time the government has introduced 
time allocation or closure, as most Canadians know it. Not 
everybody, but most of us know that 65 is the age of compulsory 
retirement for humans in Canada.  We think it is time to retire 
this kind of time allocation and allow debates to be held in the 
House on a timely basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February we on this side of the House endeavoured to have an 
emergency debate to discuss the matter, and of course it was 
denied.  Here we are two and a half months later and we have time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leading up to the debate in February there were newspaper 
stories that Canada Steamship Lines had expressed interest in 
purchasing the Cape Breton Development Corporation, and we know 
who heads Canada Steamship Lines today.  The story in the 
newspapers is that Canada Steamship Lines is now purchasing new 
ocean freighters from a low wage Chinese shipyard. This is just 
days after a ship was launched in Saint John, New Brunswick. Many 
workers there feel it is the last ship that will ever be built at 
those docks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about and what members opposite do not want 
to talk about is almost certainly the imminent sale of Devco. 
They say they have to get on with it, but they are not saying who 
is the prospective buyer.  We know almost with certainty that it 
will be a foreign buyer, almost certainly an American one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend a few minutes telling the House what has been 
happening in the last few years in Canada with regard to foreign 
ownership.  The fact of the matter is that for a relatively 
stable number of years, several years, the inflow of foreign 
ownership into this country roughly matched the amount of 
Canadian investment overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 1998, foreign ownership in this country jumped 
fourfold to $24 billion.  In 1999, according to Statistics 
Canada, the figure was $36 billion or six times what it had been 
three or four years earlier.  We are seeing the selling off of 
the country, the takeover, the buying out of our low dollar that 
has now dropped below 66 cents.  This, coupled with the surging 
American economy, has made Canada a haven for buyouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see it again with Devco.  We see the figures indicating 
that it has been losing money in the last number of years.  Where 
did we hear that kind of story before?  Canadian National was 
losing money on paper until it was taken over.  Now 75% or 80% of 
it is owned by Americans and, wonder of wonders, it has turned 
the corner and is making a handsome profit.  We will see 
absolutely the same scenario with the Devco operation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The most telling of points for Canadians would be the very 
graphic television images of people who went underground to 
protest what was happening around Christmastime last year in Cape 
Breton Island.  They stayed there until we thought a deal could 
be sorted out.  These are the images regarding this issue that 
will stay with Canadians for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other costs cannot be calculated. They include an 
increase in out migration from Cape Breton, a region that over 
the past decade and a half has seen a population decline of over 
7% and a drop in employment opportunities resulting in the 
closure of Devco.  The $68 million that have been committed by 
the government to encourage sound, long term economic development 
in Cape Breton is far less than the close to $300 million 
generated in the Nova Scotia economy annually by Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's commitment to work closely with the 
province and the community to identify strategic investments for 
the $68 million is a farce.  After more than nine months of 
silence and inaction, the few weeks of public consultations is an 
absolute insult to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has repeatedly stated that no decision on the 
future of Devco would be made without prior consultation with the 
stakeholders and the community.  Yet no meaningful consultation 
has taken place to date.  That is what we have been after.  That 
is what my colleagues, the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and 
the member for Sydney—Victoria, were demanding when they asked 
for an emergency debate in the middle of February that was denied 
by government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is correct to say that the federal government has put more 
than $1.7 billion into Devco over the past 30 years, but Devco 
has generated over $5 billion in return into the economy. It has 
been a very happy and convenient arrangement for the people of 
Cape Breton.  Before I sit down I move:

on the courage of our war veterans who fought so that we could be

abused and forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years, some military personnel were used as guinea pigs by 
the Department of National Defence for mustard gas experiments. 
This is a source of national shame, a tragic example of 
bureaucratic immorality and a story of human suffering.  Yet the 
government has never apologized to those it deemed fodder for 
chemical warfare tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government finally acknowledged the assault that was 
committed on the lives of these men in a Suffield ceremony on May 
5, 2000, but many are still battling for some form of 
compensation.  This is outrageous.  Not only should these 
experiments never have happened, but the victims should not have 
to fight veterans affairs today.  Surely they have suffered 
enough indignity, personal loss and injustice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 1 Nortel Networks Corporation emerged as a widely held

virtually all of its ownership interest in the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nortel is a global company with deep roots in Canada and in 
particular in my riding of Ottawa West—Nepean where it had its 
beginning decades ago as Northern Electric.  The Ottawa region 
has the largest concentration of Nortel employees in the world 
and is the focal point for advanced research in all its business 
lines.  It is the largest private sector employer in the national 
capital region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In just the first four months of this year Nortel added more 
than 2,500 new employees and has now announced a new investment 
to create space for another 2,500 R and D staff in the national

he is killing jobs in their provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Clarenville regional sportsplex was a $1.2 million election 
time windfall in a Liberal member's riding in Newfoundland.  The 
ACOA grant was supposed to create 40 full time long term jobs. 
Guess what?  In two short years the centre drove a competing 
restaurant right out of operation.  It angered most of the other 
business people in town.  Now it is closed due to “mechanical

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, why is the hon. member attacking the three Conservative 
premiers in the Atlantic provinces?  They are the ones who 
invited the Prime Minister to take part in the trip to promote 
trade with the Atlantic provinces.  They said they were delighted 
to have the Prime Minister go with them.  They feel he is a real 
plus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the hon. member is asking this question.  That 
is no way to get support for the alliance in the Atlantic 
provinces, by attacking Conservative premiers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, meanwhile back at Clarenville, 
remember that the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister 
responsible for ACOA were two guys who voted against ACOA when it 
was brought in by the Tories.  I am sure they had visions of this 
sportsplex or something like it in mind when they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bren Powers was the mastermind behind this particular scheme. 
His longtime Liberal connections clearly paid off again; $1.2 
million for a facility even though it drove competitors right out

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again the official opposition does not 
understand exactly what ACOA does.  Since the Liberals took over 
in 1993, ACOA only gives out loans and not grants in its core 
funding.  It is not the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the official opposition said last time I mentioned 
this.  It said that a grant is like a loan.  It is not.  If it 
were then we would have no national debt.  We could just say all 
those loans were grants.  Maybe that is why they call themselves 
the alliance party, the al-li-ance party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Please be very judicious in our choice of 
words, my colleagues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister responsible for ACOA can 
chuckle it up all he likes but he knows he was the very member 
who called it the Atlantic Canada overblown agency.  I would like 
to know why he is defending it so much now.  In fact, he forgot 
to mention also in his discussion a few moments ago that it is 
not a loan, it is a non-repayable loan.  That to me equals a 
grant in my thesaurus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again ask the minister, why is it when there is a Liberal in 
need to win an election, we just cut the cheque when an election 
is going on?  Who cares if it drives another business out?  Who 
cares if the project will fail anyway?  Why is it so important 
for this government to pay bucks for ballots? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency),

what I did say when I was in the opposition and the Tories ran 
the ship.  When the Liberals took over, the program was 
completely revised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a byelection going on in Newfoundland.  That is why 
there are these questions today.  Imagine running being opposed 
to ACOA, being opposed to direct transfers, being opposed to 
everything and wanting to cut money from senior citizens grants.

Nothing has really changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader, the heritage minister, the minister 
of public works and the Deputy Prime Minister all voted against 
the creation of ACOA.  Even the minister who is now responsible 
for that program mocked it when he was in opposition.  Yet after 
seven years in government, they are still writing ACOA cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims that the program no longer hands out grants, 
just non-repayable loans.  In fact, ACOA handed out 123 grants 
totalling more than $12 million in the past three years alone. 
Maybe the minister can explain why taxpayers' money goes to job 
killing projects. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, when the Liberals 
took over we changed the grants to loans.  That was the first 
thing we did.  Why?  Because the auditor general had pointed out 
that was exactly what we should do. The second thing we did was 
we put a limit on those loans.  The limit today is $500,000. That 
is why ACOA has a better record in Atlantic Canada in its program 
than the chartered banks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, of course the minister forgot to mention that there was 
a 1997 election to win in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about creating jobs.  In fact, the Clarenville 
sportsplex killed lots of jobs. And it is not like the Liberals 
believed in ACOA.  They tried to stop its very creation. Even the 
minister responsible for Shakespearian responses cannot hide the 
fact that he himself condemned ACOA when in opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and

official opposition refers to and the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation I think refers to which goes up in 1996 and 1997, the 
figures for ACOA core funding actually went down.  The blip was 
caused by the TAGS program from the previous year.

comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the co-operation between the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency and the RCMP, I have always told the House that 
co-operation between the two organizations was exceptional in all

courage to appear on television and say everything he did about 
the absence of co-operation, despite the possibility of 
reprisals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Revenue tell us that he is co-operating

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary

redundant, but it is really the question that is, rather than

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot comment on a specific case, because of a fundamental 
rule, the rule of confidentiality, which the government will 
always protect and which all Canadian taxpayers wish to see 
protected as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in relation to this question, I have the impression that 
those on the other side have not looked at the RCMP press release 
of May 4, 2000.  This press release states that there is a strong 
collaborative relationship between the two organizations, that 
the CCRA is co-operating with RCMP investigations according to

that, on the one hand, we must protect the principle of

she censored: HRDC paid claims without proper verification; its

not monitored; financial statements are not reviewed regularly; 
and, most serious of all, the law of the land, the Financial

Minister who will be aware that last week Statistics Canada 
released a study revealing a significant increase in foreign 
ownership and foreign control of our economy over the past 10 
years.   He will also recognize that the trend continues and, 
with our low dollar, it is in fact accelerating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada now has one of the highest levels of foreign ownership in 
the OECD.  As research and development and top executives

point will the government intervene and say that enough is enough 
and call for a national debate on this very crucial issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we can have a national debate at any time.  The real 
point is that what we see in those numbers is a continuing global 
trend.  Not only are there more international acquisitions of 
Canadian companies but more than ever Canadians are acquiring 
interests abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last several years, as a real measure of its maturity as 
an economy, Canada has been an exporter rather than an importer 
of capital as more Canadian investment has flowed out than 
foreign investment has flowed in. That is an example of the fact 
that Canada is very much in the forefront of globalizing trends. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys,

Canadian investment goes into the United States it is like a 
pebble going into a pond.  When American investments come into 
Canada it is like an avalanche of boulders coming into our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference today is that now CEOs of major corporations are 
indicating their concerns.  Peter Lougheed, the CEO of Manulife, 
Willard Estey and many others are now saying that this has 
reached significant proportions and some action is now required.

mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, let us think about some of the things that have 
happened over the last few years.  Nortel acquired Bay Networks. 
Now, there is a pebble.  As a result, in the last few weeks a 
Canadian company was named by a British research organization as 
the world's top multinational corporation. 
That is what Canada can benefit from.  Yes, there are reasons for 
us to be concerned but it also provides an amazing opportunity

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B> (a) The Government of Canada is aware of the special 
difficulties experienced by older workers in the labour market. 
The Government of Canada takes seriously its responsibilities 
toward older workers and is taking action on several fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) First, concern for older workers has been frequently raised 
in the federal-provincial arena. At the 1998 annual premiers 
conference, premiers agreed that “the situation of older workers 
should be addressed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Forum of Labour Market Ministers, FLMM, established an ad 
hoc working group on older workers composed of representatives 
from the Government of Canada and from provinces and territories 
in December 1998. Quebec and Canada co-chair the ad hoc working 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ad hoc working group on older workers is responsible for 
developing a diagnostic of labour market adjustment issues faced 
by older workers, including issues specific to each 
province-territory. The ad hoc working group also co-ordinates 
pilot projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) Second, the Governnent of Canada underscored its commitment 
to assist older workers who lose their jobs and have a difficult 
time finding new employment by announcing the older worker pilot 
project initiative on June 18, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada committed $30 million over two fiscal 
years, 1999-2000 and 2000-01, to held older Canadians who want 
to stay in the workforce but who are facing difficulties. This 
money has subsequently been reprofiled to accommodate 
provincial-territorial starting dates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Forum of Labour Market Ministers meeting on September 30, 
1999, ministers agreed to put in place pilot projects to assist 
older workers to get back into the labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The older worker pilot project initiative is a partnership 
approach between the Government of Canada and the 
provinces-territories in searching for innovative approaches to 
assist older workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b)The parameters and key features of the older worker pilot 
projects initiative include the following: test innovative 
measures designed to reintegrate displaced older workers aged 55 
to 64 who have an attachment to the labour force or older workers 
threatend with displacement into sustainable employment; focus on 
active measures; a variety of approaches designed to meet older 
workers specific labour market needs, to be tested: awareness, 
promotion, prevention, adjustment, and labour force 
participation; and that all pilots will be evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pilot projects will be developed and implemented by provinces 
and territories expressing interest in participating in the 
initiative. Participating provinces and territories will also 
commit resources to the pilots. Projects will not duplicate or 
overlap existing federal or provincial employment programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Currently, as of April 14, 2000, several jurisdictions have 
entered into negotiations with the federal government. However, 
jurisdictions vary widely in terms of where they are at with 
developing their pilot projects. Some provinces are still 
fleshing out ideas they have for pilots. Some provinces have 
developed their proposals and have submitted them for review, 
while still others are close to finalizing their agreements. It 
is anticipated that jurisdictions close to finalizing their 
agreements will be able to undertake their pilots in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parameters of all proposals are to fall within the 
guidelines described in the key features. See answer to part (b). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The Government of Canada is not currently studying passive 
measures such as income support measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has been adopting active employment 
measures in assisting Canadians. The older worker pilot project 
initiative is designed to assist older workers experiencing a 
difficult time to find new employment. This initiative is intended 
to actively assist older workers back into the labour force. See 
answer to part (b) for details. Passive income supports are not 
featured in the older worker pilot projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Pilot projects will be developed and implemented by provinces 
and territories. Projects that are proposed by the Quebec 
government, once approved that they adhere to the key features 
developed by all jurisdictions, would be available to older 
workers in Quebec that are interested in participating. Potential 
candidates could express their interest to the appropriate 
representative in their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) The province is responsible for proposing and seeing the 
pilots implemented. The procedures to propose the projects have 
been described above. See answer to part (b).

community of Sydney in Cape Breton.  It is never a pleasure to 
talk about that.  Also, today the government introduced closure 
on this debate.  It is never a pleasure to rise to talk about 
that and to talk in circumstances where the government has put us 
under the gun for the 65th time in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the NDP caucus have detailed the situation in 
Cape Breton.  I am not going into that in much detail.  They 
talked about the history of mining there.  They talked about the 
importance of mining to the local economy and to the provincial 
economy.  They talked in some detail about the sordid history of 
how the government conducted itself in putting these mines and 
assets up for sale.  On one hand the government wants to walk 
away from its responsibility of many years and sell off these 
mines to the private sector.  On the other hand the government 
wants to do so in a way which does not fairly compensate the 
people who have worked in those mines for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member for a constituency in Saskatchewan in the prairies 
and parklands area, I have not followed this debate perhaps as 
closely as I might have if it were grain transportation or the 
wheat board.  I have left much of the heavy lifting to my 
colleagues in the NDP caucus, particularly those from Cape 
Breton.  They have done a fine job of bringing the situation to 
light, holding the government's feet to the fire and standing 
shoulder to shoulder with the workers in the mines in Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon closer examination recently, I was actually shocked at what 
the government has done and what we often call the process.  The 
process is often as important as the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk a bit about what happened.  One of my colleagues has 
described what the government announced in January 1999 as a 
drive-by announcement, saying it was getting out of the coal 
business and closing the Phalen mine by the end of 2000 and 
beginning a process to sell the Prince mine as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Sydney—Victoria made a convincing argument 
that the federal government already knew what it was going to do 
in 1995.  It might well have delayed its announcement because of 
an impending election in 1997, but it knew what it was going to 
do. It had all sorts of time to consult with the community rather 
than engage in what my colleague called a drive-by announcement 
which pretty well took everybody by surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the government's severance and training support package 
is inadequate.  The economic development package that came along 
with it which is in some way supposed to make up for the loss is 
inadequate.  It was put together without consultation with the 
stakeholders despite the fact that the government said after the 
fact that it was going to do that.  In fact, it appeared that the 
Minister of Natural Resources was not interested in meeting with 
the miners or with people in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly review, after about a year of frustration, what 
happened so that things could finally start to move a little. 
Last December there was a shutdown of the Phalen colliery.  This 
resulted in a protest.  A little later on in January there were 
wildcat strikes.  The miners had finally had enough.  They 
stopped operations and blocked coal shipments to Nova Scotia 
Power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 8 several miners went underground and stayed there. 
It took that for the Minister of Natural Resources to start 
meeting with these people and getting serious about negotiations. 
That was more than a year after the announcement that the mine 
was going to be sold.  We can imagine and understand why people 
in Cape Breton were so frustrated.  It was that kind of heroic 
action that finally forced the minister to begin negotiating a 
pension settlement and agree to go to binding arbitration in the 
case of conflicts.  It was said across the floor this morning 
that they had gone to binding arbitration.  Yes, they did after 
the miners sat in, stayed in the mines and said they were not 
coming out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move on to something that I find particularly 
disturbing.  I am going to focus my remarks for the last few 
minutes on this.  Late in January this year reports surfaced that 
Canada Steamship Lines was hauling coal from Colombia and the 
United States to Cape Breton and that it was interested in 
Devco's assets.  People in the House and in the country will be 
familiar with the owner of that company, a rather high ranking 
person in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Ask the Minister of Finance why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  That is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about the fact that coal from Colombia is 
coming into Cape Breton.  If we are importing coal, what about 
the mine in Cape Breton which has not yet been mined out and 
could produce a lot of coal, the Donkin mine which is shut in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Steamship Lines is delivering coal to Nova Scotia Power 
from Colombia.  I have two things to say about that.  Let us talk 
about the Colombian side of it first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend the leader of a miners union in Colombia, Francisco 
Ramirez Cuellar, the president of Sindicato de Trabajadores de la 
Empresa Nacional Minera, was in Canada meeting with our party and 
the labour movement.  He told us about the coal coming in from 
Colombia.  He told us that coal miners in Colombia earn wages as 
low as one-tenth of what coal miners in Canada earn.  He talked 
about Colombia's environmental protection laws which if they 
exist at all are not enforced in the coal mining industry.  He 
talked about the labour which is used.  The equipment is very old 
so people have to work very hard under very unsafe working 
conditions, which many of us simply could not think of working 
under.  We take safety for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of all this, Colombia can sell coal at about half 
the price of what it is produced for in Canada.  That is one 
thing.  The conditions under which coal is mined in Colombia 
would make it rather attractive for a company which is going to 
buy the Devco assets but which would not mine the coal nor 
produce jobs in Cape Breton, to import the coal mined by people 
who earn effectively starvation wages.  It gets worse. We were 
told that 80% of the union leaders assassinated in the world each 
year are Colombian union leaders. Government sponsored 
paramilitary squads frequently displace workers who continue to 
express an interest in organizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation here is that the Devco assets are up for sale by 
the government.  There may be a company which is going to 
purchase those assets, but there is no guarantee that hole is 
going to be mined in Cape Breton.  We may well see a further 
devastation of the coal mining industry in that province.  Why? 
So that a private company which buys the assets from the 
government can simply purchase coal offshore to supply Nova 
Scotia Power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of thing which has not received the attention 
it deserves because the government has not been interested in 
having a full scale inquiry into what is happening. Rather, it 
has tried to write very circumscribed legislation and push it 
through the House as quickly as possible into committee where we 
would look at the legislation it has written but not at the wider 
context of what has happened and what is happening in Cape 
Breton.  When I talk about the wider context, an example is what 
I have just been speaking about, Colombia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the contention of our caucus, ably represented by 
the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria and others in Cape Breton 
and Nova Scotia, that we should have a real inquiry and a real 
look at this industry.  We are extremely disappointed that has 
not happened.  We are even more disappointed that the government, 
rather than have this issue debated fully, has moved closure for 
the 65th time in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coal mining industry has had a long and illustrious history 
in Cape Breton.  There is a lot at stake here, people's jobs, 
their lives, their dignity, the health of their communities.  The 
government has not consulted with them although it said it would. 
It has manipulated people and the process aimed at dissolution 
and divestiture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the NDP caucus is so opposed to closure and to what 
the government is doing.  That is why we feel so strongly that 
the situation has to be studied.  This goes beyond the rather 
narrow confines of the bill as the government has outlined it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as has been mentioned 65 times for closure in 
regard to different bills is getting beyond the point of being 
ridiculous. Anyhow we are here to discuss Bill C-11 and the 
impact it will have on the eastern part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government's latest attempt to ruin the economy of 
Canada's east coast, especially Cape Breton.  Let it be clear 
that I am not in favour of government running much of anything, 
especially a mining company.  This has been proven time after 
time after time by the utter failure in results when government 
gets involved in things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's latest so-called success story is to travel 
there to announce the creation of a new call centre.  Does he 
seriously believe it makes good use of the talents and skills of 
Canadians and of the natural resource of coal to ask the miners 
of Cape Breton to become telephone operators?  Or should the 
miners sit at home and let their wives earn the family bread and 
butter? These are some of the questions that are being asked down 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I first came here in 1993 when the constituents of 
Okanagan—Shuswap sent me to Ottawa, delegations from Cape Breton 
have been asking parliament to do something to save the coal 
mining industry. Studies show there is plenty of coal in the 
ground.  The location and facilities on hand for export are 
great.  Skilled workers are on hand.  There is a long tradition 
of mining coal and a fully developed community infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing B.C. had for its northeast coal was the coal 
itself hundreds of miles from the coast, but B.C. has been 
exporting to Japan.  It built the infrastructure from scratch and 
had to convince workers and families to move there.  Cape Breton 
had all of that but government has done such a poor job of 
managing the mines that the taxpayers have been on the hook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about that just for a second.  Let us look at the 
money that has been poured into Devco.  The miners have not seen 
any result of that.  The mine is being shut down. Taxpayers and 
members in the House of Commons would like to know what happened 
to all of the funds and what is happening to all of the assets. 
Let us have a public inquiry. Let us see where the money has been 
going.  Let us see who has really benefited. Let us find out to 
whom they are related. Let us find out what has been going on at 
Devco because for sure the miners have not been getting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has held hearings and studies have been done but the 
government has ignored the most basic thing, running the business 
well.  Even excellent businessmen have a tough time with today's 
high payroll taxes and red tape business climate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government decided to appoint its own mismanagement team and 
had that team send one year plans and five year plans to Ottawa 
for approval. In some of its decisions, despite building great 
port facilities and having a unique location beside the ocean, it 
chose to abandon all foreign markets.  Let us look at it.  We 
spend years to develop foreign markets for customers.  When a 
conscious decision is made, as the people the government 
appointed to run Devco made, to let the foreign markets go, to 
let those markets slide and not care, the markets turn away. When 
we go back to them, those markets have already found other 
countries that will supply the coal that we denied them. Try to 
get those markets back. That is not the fault of the miners; it 
is the fault of those the government put in charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, union representatives went along with management to 
visit Mexico. The united mine workers promised there would be no 
work stoppage if Mexico would buy Cape Breton coal.  Mexico 
signed on but the government team signed off.  Union workers even 
agreed to take significantly less than standard coal mining 
wages.  It is a tough, dirty, dangerous job but they agreed to 
take lower wages to ensure our coal could compete and the 
community could keep the jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Devco, I have never seen management-labour 
relations so bad.  In fact, they are the worst I have seen. 
Devco even refused to show the union its books to work out 
acceptable contracts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to admit on some grounds the work was tough.  They had 
problems in some spots, particularly in the hanging wall, the 
roof of the tunnel.  They kept shutting down time and again.  It 
was run so badly they finally had to eliminate all customers 
except Nova Scotia Power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supply of coal got so low that Devco agreed to allow 
American coal to be imported directly by Nova Scotia Power. It 
was raised already in the House, but I really have to wonder when 
we have the coal and can supply the coal but somebody makes the 
decision that we have to import the coal, we have to look at who 
is involved and how much money is involved in the transportation 
of the coal.  We know it is not from people in Canada.  We know 
the coal is coming in from offshore so we have to stop and think 
who would haul that coal for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The NHL? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  No, it is a shipping firm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Is it CSL? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Yeah, it would be CSL.  That is held

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The finance minister of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Yes, the finance minister of the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, being nice, honest and hardworking people, I have to 
wonder when we talk about job creation and helping out the miners 
just exactly what the government has been doing.  I would say 
that it certainly gave the miners the shaft while it closed the 
mine down.  That would be my way of looking at it.  I do not 
think I am wrong but I am willing to accept that maybe I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile out in Alberta, to comply with the government's 
promises made at Kyoto, Japan without adequate consultation with 
business and industry here at home, at least some great 
experiments are being done to reduce carbon dioxide from burning 
fossil fuels.  In Alberta technology has been invented that can 
actually bury carbon dioxide in the coal seams so that for every 
molecule of carbon dioxide taken out in order to clean up our 
air, we get back two molecules of usable methane gas.  Experts 
predict this will allow Alberta to bury, they call it sequester, 
all carbon dioxide from all the coal they export and expect to 
burn in their coal fired power plants in the next 500 years and 
make money while doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the new technology for coal back east?  Instead of 
technology it brings in call centres.  I go back to what I 
originally said.  The government is trying to force the miners of 
Cape Breton to become telephone operators.  I have to wonder 
exactly where the government got the brilliant idea to go this 
route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually the government got the brilliant idea to privatize 
the coal mining operations.  Would we not expect the 
privatization to be completed before it did a shutdown, before 
the workers left because they lost hope of making a future for 
themselves and their families in that part of Canada, before they 
gave up their foreign markets?  That was so tough to get in the 
first place but the government gave it away lock, stock and 
barrel. Here we are today looking at Bill C-11 which is trying to 
get the government off the hook after so many years of 
mismanaging one of the country's greatest natural resources, the 
coal of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Men who went down to the mines as teenagers still do not have 
enough years of service combined with their ages to qualify for 
any pension under the plan because they are still too young. 
These men are supposed to be retrained.  Maybe they will become 
telephone operators at the Prime Minister's new call centre but I 
doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the Liberals will move in some other centre, like New 
Brunswick's role as the registration centre for all Canadian 
firearms, and the Prime Minister can turn Cape Breton coal miners 
into federal bureaucrats.  Maybe that is the game plan, I do not 
know.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I close I would like to quote Mr. Murphy: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that handing off of the Nova Scotia Power Inc. supply 
contract to foreign suppliers is an unacceptable situation. We 
decided back in May to do something about it by forming a 
worker's co-op and submitting the bid for the Devco assets 
through the Nesbitt Burns process.  Our bid was rejected, as was 
a bid put forward by Donkin Resource Limited, which is determined 
to press on with opening the Donkin Mine with the support of the 
community and groups such as our co-op, which is ready to invest 
in the project to ensure that at least some of NFPI coal is 
supplied by Cape Bretoners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Murphy also goes on to question why the federal government 
would rather hand over a lucrative contract to a foreign company 
when the coal could be supplied locally.  That is the question. 
Why would the government do it, unless there is something for 
somebody else's pocket? 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-11.   When I spoke to 
the bill originally I said that it was a day of shame in the 
House, that the Liberal government should be ashamed because it 
had betrayed the legacy of Lester Pearson.  I say today that 
Lester Pearson would be shamed again, as the government closes 
down debate on the issue and forces it through the House of 
Commons without appropriate debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a legacy.  The Liberals who are watching the debate today 
and those who will be reading <I>Hansard</I> should write to their 
members of parliament and to their party presidents to ask what 
happened to what was once a democratic party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a bit about the agreement because that is the 
substance of the debate.  Why should this matter not be voted 
upon but go to a special committee or to the human resources 
committee?  Let me begin by explaining what the negotiation 
process was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain the process, but first I suggest that I 
do not think we have quorum in the House.  I would ask you, Mr. 
Speaker, to call in a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Call in the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  I am surprised the minister 
responsible for ACOA did not rush to his seat to hear what I have 
to say when he saw me on the television screen, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the agreement.  Members on the other side of the 
House will say that is there is a fair and final settlement for 
the workers at the Cape Breton Development Corporation.  There is 
a history of some fair settlements for crown corporation workers 
as crown corporations have been folded by the government.  Let us 
look at what happened in some of those cases and compare them to 
the workers at the Cape Breton Development Corporation to see if 
in fact it is a fair agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with how this crown corporation was wound down. The 
Minister of Natural Resources came to Cape Breton in January.  He 
walked into the Delta Hotel and basically said that it was the 
end of the process, that they were getting out of the coal 
industry and would have some consultations that would last for 
about a week or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Marine Atlantic was folded as a crown corporation there was 
a special workforce restructuring agreement negotiated between 
the unions and Marine Atlantic.  When portions of CN were folded 
as a crown corporation there was a special workforce 
restructuring agreement negotiated between the unions and CN. 
When VIA Rail was folded as a crown corporation there was special 
workforce restructuring agreement negotiated between the unions 
and VIA Rail.  When Transport Canada's work was taken over by Nav 
Canada there was a special workforce restructuring agreement 
negotiated between the unions and the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not for the Cape Breton Development Corporation?  Why not 
for the miners of Cape Breton?   Why was the same negotiation 
process not used for those workers when there is a precedent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the other comparisons.  I have already 
mentioned in my questions today the extension of medical benefits 
and what was provided to other employees of crown corporations 
and has been denied the miners of Cape Breton. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the education allowance.  In many situations when 
crown corporations were shut down the employees were entitled to 
an education allowance.  For VIA Rail the corporation paid up to 
$4,000 in tuition to a recognized institution.  The employees 
could receive up to 90% of their salary and full benefits for 24 
months.  They also received a relocation allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The miners in Cape Breton will get $8,000 if they do not get a 
pension.  That is both their relocation amount and their training 
amount, $8,000 to go and find a place to live in another part of 
the country if they are lucky enough to get a job mining or to go 
back to school. I do not know what kind of retraining that will 
pay for in this economy, but I can indicate to the House that it 
will not be retraining that will provide a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early retirement plans again there was discrimination 
against the people who worked in the mines in Cape Breton.  At 
VIA Rail there was a transition retirement for eligible employees 
with five years early retirement.  The employees were eligible 
for benefits of between 90% and 70% of wages.  There is no such 
consideration for Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home purchase plans were provided to employees of other crown 
corporations, not provided to the miners in Cape Breton.  Special 
termination incentives were provide to other crown corporation 
employees, not provided in Cape Breton.  The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the reasons we think that if the government 
were fair, and that is all we are asking, it would look at what 
it has done in other situations.  It would look at precedent. One 
of my colleagues across the way who is a lawyer and knows about 
precedent should know that there is nothing wrong with looking at 
other crown corporation agreements and applying them in the same 
case.  He knows that from his law school days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at why the government is in such a rush to push this 
matter through.  We have until December 2000 before the 
government withdraws.  I will tell the House why it is in such a 
rush.  I think it is because it has a foreign buyer.  I am not a 
young man.  I am in my forties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  That comes as a great shock to members 
in the House, but when I was a young man the Liberal Party 
actually talked about things like Canadian ownership.  Let me 
tell the House what we are facing on Cape Breton Island today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has plans to sell the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation and its most useful asset, a contract with Nova 
Scotia Power.  The government is to sell it to a foreign company. 
Do we know what that will mean?  It will mean that ships will 
come into Sydney harbour with foreign coal while there is a 
reserve worth a billion dollars at the Donkin coal mine.  Cape 
Bretoners will not mine that coal.  That foreign coal will feed 
the contract with Nova Scotia Power.  The provincial government 
is looking at selling the steel corporation to foreign ownership. 
While we were happy to have EDS locate in Cape Breton and bring 
some jobs, it too is a foreign corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we talk about betrayal.  I remember when the Liberal Party 
once believed that Canada should belong to Canadians.  Here we 
see a complete reversal, a sell off of assets so that foreigners 
and foreign companies will once again control the economy of Cape 
Breton.  The miners and steelworkers in Cape Breton died fighting 
foreign ownership.  For 30 years we made some progress.  In the 
stroke of a pen and by bringing in closure the government is 
undoing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very other important issues.  For example, there 
is the pre-existing pension plan.  There is money now.  Many 
retired miners are receiving their pension.  Who administers that 
pension?  One might ask the Liberal members of parliament if they 
know that since they are so anxious to vote on closure.  I 
challenge them.  If they do not know the answer to that question, 
I challenge them tonight to vote against closure. 
If they do not know the details of who administers the ongoing 
existing pension fund, if they do not know the details of who is 
the buyer, if they do not know where this corporation will be at 
the end of the day, I challenge them to vote against closure, to 
be responsible members of parliament and to ask the hard 
question.  I do not think they will do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  I know I am right.  I have one minute 
left and I have much to say.  Maybe I will move another amendment 
to the amendment so that we can move on with it.  Let me just say 
it is a sad day for Canada.  There is a future in Cape Breton and 
we can build on it, but we cannot build when we are discriminated 
against by the government in the way we have been discriminated 
against.  If anybody wants the proof, as I have said, they need 
only look at the other crown corporation agreements and compare 
them to this one.  It is not fair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
look forward to the opportunity to engage in this debate. 
Essentially the point I want to bring before the House is that 
enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to engage hon. members in the summary of the bill which 
says that this is an act to provide for the disposition of 
substantially all the assets of the corporation and for the 
dissolution and the winding up of its affairs.  The purpose is to 
enable the private sector to acquire the mining assets so that 
the government can exit from the coal mining business; to provide 
for the continuation of existing jurisdiction with respect to 
labour relations, occupational health and safety, et cetera; and 
to permit legal actions to be brought against the crown, which is 
no small matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most relevant clauses are clause 2 which provides for the 
sale or otherwise disposition of all or substantially all of its 
assets and to do everything necessary for and incidental to the 
closing out of the affairs.  Clause 3 has to do with the 
continuing liability of the crown for outstanding issues relating 
to the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rather hoping that <I>National Post</I> is not listening to 
the debate, because those who say the issue is that the 
government has no business in these kinds of enterprises may well 
have a case with respect to the particular enterprise.  I am not 
one who simply says that we walk away from all our social 
responsibilities to communities, but there are points at which we 
say enough is enough.  Surely we have come to a point in our 
history where government cannot or should not continue to support 
businesses that are no longer viable.  Surely enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think you would find that we do not have a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Call in the members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There being a quorum, the debate 
shall continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
intervention of the member opposite who has now produced an 
audience for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My essential point was the question as to when is enough enough? 
To listen to members opposite, one questions whether enough is 
ever enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the last 30 years, the Government of Canada has 
put $1.6 billion into this enterprise.  In addition, the 
Government of Canada has put in an additional $44 million in the 
fiscal year 1998-99, another $86 million has been allocated for 
the year 1999-2000 and an anticipated $86 million is set aside 
for the fiscal year ending in the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian taxpayer has a legitimate question:  When is enough 
enough?  When should the government get out of this business? 
When are the good people of Cape Breton, the capable people of 
Cape Breton, going to recognize that this is no longer a viable 
enterprise, recognize that there is a new economy, that they can 
participate in the new economy and enjoy the prosperity seen in 
many other parts of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the bill is to organize the affairs of Devco so 
that it can be sold.  The member opposite is concerned about the 
issue of whether it will be sold to a foreign buyer.  I suppose 
if this was such a viable enterprise, there presumably are 
Canadian buyers available to purchase the assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also mentioned the fact that there is $1 billion 
worth of coal.  There may well be $1 billion worth of coal—I do 
not dispute his figure—but if it costs $2 billion to get to $1 
billion of coal, then it does not make a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make this as viable a transition as possible, the 
government engaged the services of Nesbitt Burns Inc. to sell the 
saleable assets.  The assets include the Prince and Phalen 
collieries, the Donkin mine site, the corporation's coal pier and 
railway, its coal preparation plant and related mine 
infrastructure.  Hopefully the purchase of these assets will 
occur sooner rather than later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make this a viable sale, the government has 
acknowledged that Devco has liabilities and is transferring the 
liabilities unto itself.  There is something in the order of an 
expectation of $100 million environmental cleanup.  No purchaser 
is going to purchase this mine with that liability.  The 
government has taken on that liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the government has set aside something in the 
neighbourhood of $100 million for workmen's compensation claims. 
Again, no purchaser, whether Canadian or foreign, whether there 
is $1 billion in the ground or not, is going to take on that kind 
of liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the government has set aside something in the order of 
$200 million plus for future pension liabilities.  Again, no 
purchaser is going to take on these kinds of liabilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers get to be a little staggering after a while.  We 
talk about $1.6 billion over 30 years, then add in another $44 
million in 1998-99, another $86 million in 1999-2000 and another 
$86 million in 2000-01.  We set aside another $400 million or 
$500 million for liabilities which may arise by virtue of 
environment or workmen's compensation or future pension 
liability, but apparently enough is still not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to what the government directly takes on, there are 
additional issues that the government takes on in an indirect way 
through such organizations as the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency, or ACOA as it known so well by members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1987 ACOA has put $249 million into the riding.  It is 
anticipated that it will put another $39 million into the island 
over the course of the next four years.  Again, it is a 
considerable sum of money to adjust the living conditions of 
those who will be affected by this closing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation, or ECBC. In 
the past 10 years ECBC has put $97 million into the island. It is 
anticipated that it will put a further $36 million into the 
island over the course of the next four years.  Again, what is 
enough?  Apparently to members opposite it is never enough. There 
is never enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought that in the last election and in subsequent polling 
the taxpayers were pretty darn clear with the government that 
these kinds of things cannot continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are quite prepared to be responsible with assistance.  We are 
prepared to be responsible with assistance so that people can 
enter into the new economy, but this will not continue to be a 
continuous gravy train and a continuous drain on the resources of 
the government and the taxpayers' generosity.  I would submit 
that in fact the taxpayer has been extremely generous with this 
situation for some arguably legitimate reasons, but there are 
times when one has to bring things to a close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was kind of perplexed when one of the previous speakers from 
the Canadian Alliance said that that the moneys which were 
recently put in, something like $12 million recently announced 
for a call centre, was a total waste of money, yet the member for 
Sydney—Victoria who spoke immediately prior to me was quite 
praiseworthy of the government's initiative in his riding to put 
that call centre there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a call centre may not be the leading edge of high 
technology, it is, however, a significant response to people who 
are needful of jobs.  It may even be arguable that people who 
have been in coal mines for 20 or 25 years may or may not be 
suited to working in a call centre, but I suspect and I submit 
that not all people are coal miners and that the people of Cape 
Breton, in particular the children of the coal miners, might like 
the alternative of working at a call centre or the spinoff 
industries which result from the existence of a call centre in 
the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Government of Canada has been most generous 
in this area.  May I say that that has spanned a period of 30 
years, that has been Liberal governments and Conservative 
governments, and that substantial commitment to the area has been 
an effort to make this kind of industry viable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I submit that there are points at which one has to say 
enough is enough and $1.6 billion over 30 years is, in my 
submission, enough; $44 million in the fiscal year 1998-99 is 
enough; $86 million in the year 1999-2000 is enough; $86 million 
in 2000-01 is enough; $39 million for the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation is enough; and $36 million for ECBC over the next 
four years is enough.  Those moneys are substantial.  They 
reflect an enormous commitment on the part of the Government of 
Canada and in my view this bill deserves support from all members 
of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this debate 
sadly is faced with closure and that really has been eating at me 
because democracy is about talking.  It is about working through 
issues.  It is about taking the time.  Every time the government 
invokes closures, it is like being told “Sit down and be 
quiet”.  It is really tiring.  There have been so many debates 
in which I have not been able to participate because the 
government has invoked closure.  That is not what democracy is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when one can understand that possibly a debate 
should be closed, but not after two hours, not after two days, 
not after two weeks.  We are here, elected to represent the 
people who put their faith in us and every time we want to say 
something we are cut off.  I had the good fortune to be able to 
make it in on this debate, but on so many others I have not been 
able to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon in Oral Question Period I listened to the 
Minister of Industry talk about all the benefits of globalization 
and how Canadians should be so thankful for globalization and the 
fact that foreign investment is at an all time high in this 
country.  What the people in Cape Breton are facing is 
globalization.  Their mine is going to be sold and the people who 
live in that community, who wanted to put together a co-operative 
approach to buying out the coal mine and using it for their own 
benefit to benefit their community, are not even being 
considered.  We do not know who is being considered, but it is 
certainly not the people of Cape Breton Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic provinces and Cape Breton have a long history of 
driving their people out, of having no place for their children 
to stay to work and live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father was born in Cape Breton and had to leave.  He came 
from a big family of 21 children.  There was nothing for him to 
stay for in his home province.  He had to leave and go to the 
Yukon where he lived out the rest of his life, but his heart was 
always in his home.  It was always in Cape Breton and it was a 
place he saw only once again after the end of the second world 
war in which he served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe our country should be doing that to its 
citizens, making efforts to drive them out rather than keeping 
opportunities within the places where they were born.  This is a 
huge country and it is very culturally diverse.  People from Cape 
Breton are very different from people in the Yukon.  The people 
of the eastern Arctic are completely different culturally from 
those people in the prairie provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have mobility in this country but it still does not make it 
easy to be able to afford to move.  It does not make it easy to 
be humiliated and driven out of one's own province to seek work 
elsewhere, probably with barely a penny in one's pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are facing is a possibility of Colombian buyers 
purchasing this mine.  What would that mean for the people of 
Cape Breton?  Certainly not putting their own people to work in 
these mines, if the mine even stays open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the Canadian government has spent about $1.6 billion or 
$1.7 billion on the mine.  That is not a small amount.  It is a 
very significant amount and it has meant that people from that 
area had a chance to work and live.  But the mine gave back as 
well.  Up to $6 billion over those years went back into the 
community, back into people's lives, funding schools, health care 
and post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we have before us a bill that will shut down the mine and 
deal with the assets?  How is it dealing with the employees, the 
people who have put their lives, blood and health into the coal 
mining industry which has a very proud and long tradition, not 
only in Cape Breton but through the Yukon and the north of 
Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Miners have a tradition.  They know that when they go down into 
the ground, their lives are at stake and they do that often not 
for extraordinary wages but to put food on the table for their 
families.  These people who have worked and lived and put their 
souls into this industry are not going to get the same benefits 
as other Canadian agencies that have been sold off.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>VIA employees will get a five year deal of 100% of their pension 
and health benefits for their families, but why are the Devco 
employees not getting those same benefits?  Is this returning to 
the whole idea of globalization just to get away with whatever we 
can, to give our citizens, our employees the least that we 
possibly can so that those who would benefit from globalization, 
the very rich, get everything and the very poor get a few scraps 
that come from the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cape Breton, the men in those mines, have had to 
stand up over and over again to demand even basic courtesy for 
the work they have done.  They have had to go underground in 
protest and say that they will not come out until they get 
fairness.  They have had to go on illegal strikes to even have 
ministers listen to them.  It took ages and ages for even the 
basic courtesy of a meeting to go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These decisions were made in 1995.  It was only made public 1999 
that these families, the people of Cape Breton, would be facing 
the loss of their jobs and again an out-migration from their 
communities.  They would have to watch their children and 
grandchildren leave and not stay to build their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I want to stress that I am really upset that the 
government has again invoked closure.  It is becoming a routine 
practice.  At one time it was considered absolutely extraordinary 
for closure to be invoked on a debate. I am tired of being told 
to sit down and be quiet, that I have said enough and that they 
do not want to hear from me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected to come here and to be a part of a democracy. 
Whether the government wants listen to me or not, I have the 
right to have a say, which is what democracy is about.  However, 
it is being taken away from us over and over again because the 
government does not want to listen.  It does not want to hear. It 
does have the power to say sit down and be quiet but that goes 
against our tradition of democracy and a fair hearing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the 
debate.  I find it a very tough issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I decided to become a member of parliament 13 years ago, 
one of the things I said I would try to do as a member of 
parliament from downtown Toronto was not just to talk about 
issues or concerns that were specific to my community or my 
region, but to attempt, from time to time, where it was 
appropriate, to speak on issues that concerned every region of 
the country and especially speak on issues where people's voices 
really needed to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is the essence of this Chamber.  We respect, we 
admire and we do not want to hold back those in our community who 
are advantaged.  Ultimately we are here in this Chamber to speak 
out for those men and women in our country who are experiencing a 
moment when they are truly disadvantaged.  That is why I am in 
this Chamber.  I am here for no other reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in front of us today a situation where we have 1,500 
families whose voices need to be heard.  I applaud and I want to 
let the member for Yukon and other members know that we on this 
side of the House have a duty and a responsibility, even though 
we are in government, to listen and to care about what is 
happening to those 1,500 families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should let Canadians know that after the debate in the House 
today this bill will go to a committee of the House of Commons. 
We all know that in committee the government has the opportunity 
to amend, alter or change legislation if constructive and 
creative ideas are put forward that can meet not only the local 
interests but also the national interests.  It is important for 
us today to let Canadians know that when we go into committee 
that some of those creative and constructive options can be 
explored.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on the floor of the House of Commons two ideas 
today that could be explored in committee and which the 
government might consider the possibility of accepting.  The 
first idea has to do with the board of directors that will be 
managing the pension fund for those 1,500 miners, those 1,500 
families that are involved in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from downtown Toronto where pension boards and pension 
situations are constantly being upgraded and renewed in this day 
and age.  I do not think it is an unreasonable request, an 
unreasonable consideration that we have a representative from the 
coal miners on that board.  If that is an instrument by which we 
can create hope, transparency and some feelings for those 
families, then we should debate and explore that idea in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other idea that I believe needs consideration has to do with 
the tar ponds, the environmental disaster with the toxic pool 
that exists in that community.  There is a real environmental 
opportunity that might exist in this disastrous situation that we 
are facing.  Why could we not consider the idea of giving many of 
those miners, those who want to be involved in environmental 
renewal and environmental change, the opportunity of working on 
the tar ponds disaster? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to deal with this crisis sooner or later. Why could 
we not begin considering using some of that highly productive and 
useful workforce from that island?  Why could we not employ them 
as part of an environmental force? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, when that disaster is ultimately cleared up, it 
could give them a capacity to work not just in their own 
community but it would give us an expertise that we could use in 
other regions, not only of Canada but other regions of the world. 
In other words, we could use that environmental disaster as a 
test case where once we do clean it up, the men, the women, all 
the environmental engineers and so on who were focused on dealing 
with that problem could be an export possibility in terms of the 
human capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, some of these ideas are not my ideas. They are 
thoughts and ideas that have come from members of parliament who 
have served that community and served that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the three minutes I have left I want to tell a story about an 
author I have grown to love over my years as an MP.  His name is 
John Howard Griffin.  He wrote a book entitled <I>Black Like 
Me</I>. 
He was a white author from southern Texas who wrote in the 
mid-forties.  He specialized in discrimination and racism. One 
day some of his black neighbours and friends said to him “You 
will never understand what black is about until you are inside 
our skin”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>John Howard moved to New Orleans where he had his skin 
pigmented.  He lived and worked in a very tough situation.  Six 
months later he went back to his own community where he used to 
do the Sunday mass collections.  His own best friend rejected him 
because he did not recognize him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House have to understand the difficulties faced by 
those 1,500 families in Cape Breton.  We have to use the House 
and the committee of the House to come up with constructive and 
creative opportunities so we can continue as a nation to always 
be there for the people who really need a voice when they are up 
against difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take this bill to committee, I appeal to members to 
design some constructive and doable ideas so that the people in 
Cape Breton will feel as proud, as excited and as hopeful about 
their community as any other community in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I speak on 
this issue with a degree of knowledge, since I was the Bloc 
Quebecois critic for natural resources for a while, in fact, at 
the time the government decided to shut down Devco's operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the Liberal Party member, who hopes that 
the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Government 
Operations, or perhaps it will be the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development, will review this bill and propose 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major problem here is that a committee, and I say this with 
all due respect for committees, will sometimes come to certain 
conclusions. However, if cabinet and the Prime Minister do not 
agree, the committee will unfortunately have to forget about its 
good recommendations and go in the direction shown by cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, since money is involved—the amounts are important 
but not exorbitant; on the contrary, they are too small—I am 
afraid that the minister's directives will be rather strict and 
the committee will have little leeway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party member suggests, among other things, that the 
miners could be represented on the board, perhaps by a union 
representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that a single representative on a board may be 
listened to but, no matter how well informed the representative 
from the mining sector may be, he can never convince the board 
to overstep its mandate, which will be defined in the 
legislation, since the act specifies the amounts involved. It 
cannot increase the moneys that would otherwise be available to 
the miners who are being laid off in this sad episode.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already some lessons to be learned from this 
situation. For years the federal government has been meddling in 
regional development. As early as 1960, it was recommended to 
diversify the economy of Cape Breton, which was essentially 
based on coal mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these recommendations were never implemented and 
the federal government kept on pouring money into coal mining. 
Hundreds, thousands of jobs were created this way, but strictly 
in coal mining.

this industry, which sadly has not been profitable for years, we 
can see the economy collapsing in the area because the 
diversification announced and expected 40 years ago did not take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is by no means the only misguided example of the federal 
government's interference in regional development. A case in 
point is Atlantic groundfish. There is no more cod. Sadly, it 
was over-fished while the federal government was responsible for 
ensuring the sustainability of the stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases, the federal government may not be the best actor, 
it may not be in the best position to know what is important for 
a particular region. Here in Ottawa, everything is fine, of 
course. 
We look around us.  The economy is relatively prosperous; the 
number of research centres is increasing.  Just because things 
are going well in this bubble all around Parliament Hill does 
not mean the same is true everywhere. The Gaspé is another place 
with a number of problems which have made the headlines in 
recent weeks. Today, we are talking about Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not just the laid-off workers to think about.  These 
1,000 workers have families.  If we look at the impact of the 
economic collapse resulting from the Devco shutdown, we are 
talking about approximately 6,000 people—men, women and 
children—who will suffer the consequences.  This is tragic in an 
area where Devco held up the whole economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the Liberal Party member mentioned that these employees 
could perhaps be put to work cleaning up the ecological 
aftermath.  This labour force could indeed be used, but this is 
to lose sight of what should have been done and what the unions 
suggested at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devco employees have vested rights.  For one thing, they have 
been paying into a pension.  Some of these employees are a few 
years away from retirement; others have much longer to go.  If 
Devco itself had made an effort to do something about these 
clean-up operations, Devco employees would have been assigned to 
these duties as part of their regular duties. Their pension 
would have continued to grow and at some point these people 
could have retired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the union had done some fairly specific 
calculations showing that retirements would be staggered out 
over the period between now, when the mine is being closed, and 
the time the clean-up was complete.  The work force could thus be 
gradually reduced to a minimum.  All these employees could have 
retired with a reasonable pension, with families looked after, 
with children who could have continued to grow up in their 
community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By abruptly pulling the floor out from under these workers,  the 
security they have accumulated has just disappeared.  Even if 
they are given jobs, they will not have the assurance of a 
decent retirement on a reasonable retirement income, no matter 
how hard they work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the committee could manage to convince the minister that he 
needs to sweeten his offer so that the workers can remain with 
Devco, this would be a considerable improvement, and the 
ecological cleanup referred to by the Liberal member could be 
carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that the committee will manage to do so, but I sometimes 
lose hope when I see the best ideas and the best initiatives 
running headlong into a wall of misunderstanding, for reasons 
that we do not know and cannot understand.  The plan may seem to 
make some economic sense in the short term, but in the medium 
and long term it will result in personal disasters on an 
unacceptable scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I do not have much time left.  Hon. members will have 
understood by now that Bill C-11 is unacceptable to the Bloc 
Quebecois, both from the legal point of view—and we will be 
coming back to that—and from the human point of view.  This bill 
is, first and foremost, unacceptable in the way it treats human 
beings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
would like to begin my remarks by commenting on the terrible 
state of affairs in the House of Commons when the idea of time 
allocation and closure is entered into so lightly and so 
frequently.  Instead of being the exception to the rule, it has 
become the norm, at least in the short period of time I have been 
in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot tell the number of times I have had to stand here and 
criticize the government for abusing the idea of free and open 
debate in the House of Commons by invoking closure and time 
allocation anytime it is convenient for the government to do so 
or anytime it is worried about being politically embarrassed by 
the subject matter at hand. Since 1993 I believe it has been over 
60 times that the Liberal government, the ruling party, has 
invoked the idea of limiting debate in the House of Commons.  We 
came here to take part in the democratic process, to speak freely 
and raise the issues we believe are important and not to be 
silenced every time we turn around by a heavy-handed ruling party 
that sees fit to silence people when debate is clearly so 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having heard the members who actually reside in Cape Breton 
speak passionately about the bill earlier today, the people of 
Nova Scotia do not want the debate to be terminated.  The people 
who live in the communities in Cape Breton want their voices to 
be heard.  They want a free and open debate that explores all the 
aspects of the closure and the bill which will oversee the 
shutdown of the Devco corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In what limited debate there has been we have heard from the 
government side misinformation that borders on negligence in not 
having had the courtesy to find out what the true facts are about 
Devco before the government invokes measures that will see its 
termination. We heard speeches earlier today that border on being 
intellectually dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member say that the government has poured $1.7 billion 
of what he called taxpayer generosity into these coal mines and 
that enough is enough, that we have to terminate this flushing 
good money after bad.  The hon. member failed to point out, 
whether deliberately or through naivety and if it was through 
naivety it would be irresponsible naivety, that the Devco 
corporation was not just a coal mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone who does not live in Cape Breton realize that Devco 
was not just a coal mine?  When it was founded Devco was a coal 
mine and an economic development corporation. The coal mine in 
fact was successful as a stand alone enterprise.  For many years 
it showed a profit.  It served a valuable function by providing 
coal for the Nova Scotia Power Corporation and it operated in a 
viable manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of Devco in the years from 1967 to 1980 was 
economic development.  All kinds of things were tried on the 
island to stimulate and diversify the economy.  Some of those 
ventures succeeded and some of them failed. Not all of that $1.7 
billion went into coal mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been a lot more honest had that been pointed out 
at the front end.  We would have expected someone from the 
government side at least to have been honest enough to portray 
those figures in an accurate way.  The government also failed to 
point out that in that same period of time, the coal mining 
aspect of Devco produced $5 billion worth of product and economic 
activity in Cape Breton, $5 billion with a spinoff effect. 
Everyone knows that a dollar spent in today's economy gets spent 
four times before it reaches its final state of repose, which is 
usually in some American shareholder's pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in the middle of my speech and a lot of the comments I am 
making are being addressed to the government side.  I cannot help 
but note there are virtually no government members in the House 
of Commons.  it would be irresponsible for them to push this 
legislation through and not even have the courtesy to be in the 
House of Commons to listen to what little debate we are going to 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member said that there are virtually no government 
members listening to or participating in the debate.  The record 
will show that is not accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  What is a problem is when members 
make these references to the presence or absence of members.  We 
do get into trouble.  It is against the rules to do that.  I can 
only admonish all hon. members to comply with the rules and avoid 
reference to the fact of who is not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have other things to do besides sit in the House.  I am 
sure there are committees sitting as we speak.  Members have 
other obligations.  To point out absences is not helpful and, I 
would point out to all hon. members, is contrary to the rules of 
the House. We will avoid that, I know, in future remarks.  The 
hon. member for Winnipeg Centre has the floor and I know he will 
want to get away from that topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the only reason I raised the 
relative shortage on the other benches was by way of introducing 
the calling of quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I will certainly be glad to call 
quorum, but the way to do it is to avoid reference to who is here 
and who is not, because then we get into disagreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see a quorum.  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for at least 
going through the exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began my remarks by talking about what a shame, what a tragedy 
and what a travesty it is to limit the debate on such an 
important subject.  What I was getting around to was not just the 
face value of the argument about the closing of the Devco coal 
mines, but the fact that this is an issue of much larger 
significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things have not even been raised.  The secondary impacts of 
shutting down Devco have not been dealt with and they will not be 
dealt with in any detail in the House because the debate has been 
limited by moving time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the natural things which comes to mind, one of the 
obvious consequences of selling off Devco and closing Devco is 
the whole issue of foreign ownership, economic sovereignty, loss 
of control of our own industries and our inability to control our 
own destiny when it comes to matters regarding the development of 
our natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we have seen in this country in recent years is an 
absolute epidemic of foreign takeovers.  In part a low Canadian 
dollar has led to this, and in part it is because there are 
people lurking just across our border who are willing to gobble 
up any aspect of our natural resources they possibly can. This is 
one of the predictable consequences we are going to see, I 
believe, as we divest ourselves of the Devco operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An even more frightening spectacle in my mind is that the whole 
idea of Devco was to feed coal into the Nova Scotia Power 
Corporation to generate electricity and to have a vertical 
integration. We would enjoy that benefit and the secondary 
benefit of the labour created by the mining of coal, that we 
could create electricity with that coal.  There was a natural 
customer for the product.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia Power Corporation will now be in the unenviable 
position of trying to buy its power elsewhere.  Where?  It will 
probably be from the eastern seaboard of the United States.  Mr. 
Peabody will supply the coal, I presume, to Nova Scotia.  Who 
will ship the coal from the eastern seaboard of the United States 
to Cape Breton?  It will be Canada Steamship Lines.  The Minister 
of Finance and steamships will be going into Sydney harbour 
loaded with American coal to burn in Nova Scotia Power 
Corporation.  If this seems shortsighted, if it seems 
economically perverse, I put it to members that it is.  That is 
why this needs to be debated and that is why we need more time in 
the House to deal with some of these predictable consequences of 
shutting down the whole Devco operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a trade unionist and have been a union representative for 
much of my working career.  I find in cases like this the best 
way to convey the true impact of this sort of economic move is to 
try to personalize the issue by looking at the actual people 
involved.  If we try to visualize in our minds the actual 
families and workers who are being displaced by all of this, it 
is useful to look at a profile of the Devco employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we try to get in our minds who these people of the United 
Mine Workers are, and there are four unions involved, of the 
actual members of the United Mine Workers of America union, 414 
out of 500 or so have grade 12 or less education.  The average 
age is 44.5 years.  They have industry specific skills that make 
it very difficult to relocate into other industries.  I raise all 
these factors to point out the difficulty of trying to 
reintegrate the displaced employees into other industries, et 
cetera, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we see such an overwhelmingly low level of 
education in people who are fairly my contemporaries, where it is 
not usual for there to be over 80% of them with grade 12, is that 
they were seduced into quitting school and going to work at 
Devco.  They were told the big lie.  People came into their 
classrooms and virtually said “You can sit here and finish high 
school or you can go to work tomorrow with a good $12, $14 an 
hour job with grade 8 or grade 9 and we will keep you employed 
for life, until you retire, working in the Devco coal mine 
operation”.   That was bad advice and it has complicated the 
reintegration of some of these displaced workers into alternative 
lines of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those lines of work ironically will be the next subject 
that we debate here today because we have been told that the 
government side will not put up any more speakers on the subject 
because it wants debate to collapse on the subject so that we can 
move on to the next subject which is tourism.  What it really 
wants all the Devco miners to do is grow long, red pigtails like 
Anne of Green Gables so they can be cute little tourism oddities 
maybe.  If they can learn to play the banjo or something they 
could entertain American bus loads of tourists who drive to Cape 
Breton to see them because there will be very little else for 
them to do, given the callous way that this whole issue has been 
treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we had more time and had we been given the opportunity to 
debate this issue further, I am sure other important subjects 
would be raised.  But as it is now, once again we can hear the 
jackboots marching to the drums of closure and time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  In accordance with Standing Order 38 
it is my duty to advise the House that the item to be taken up at 
the hour of adjournment later this day is the following one: the 
hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, The Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have already raised this point a couple of times.  This 
is an important debate to the people of Cape Breton and I would 
call quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see a quorum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise once again on this bill. 
Considering that I did not have an opportunity to finish my 
comments this morning on this issue, I would like to have a few 
minutes to further investigate the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I think it is absolutely imperative that the bill be 
given time for adequate debate in the House and also time for 
adequate investigation of the whole issue in committee and to 
call all the witnesses that we need to call simply because of 
some of the mystery surrounding the whole bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge number of unanswered questions on the issue of 
the disposition of Devco's assets and the rumoured purchase of 
its assets, particularly by American interests, which seems 
curious.  Clearly, Nova Scotia Power has the need for huge 
amounts of coal for the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the need for coal and that coal exists in Cape 
Breton which will last for as long as Nova Scotia Power could 
probably envision using it, it makes no sense to me to shut down 
the mines in Cape Breton and essentially sell the contract to 
supply coal to Nova Scotia Power to an American interest, aside 
from the fact that the finance minister's ships are hauling this 
coal.  Why have the Americans supply coal and have it transported 
to Cape Breton when the coal is in Cape Breton and can be mined 
as economically as it can be in other parts of the world?  There 
is something really rotten about this whole deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not only the issue of whether whoever buys the mines 
would operate them for any length of time, but there is some real 
question about the intentions of the people buying it.  What 
about the coal reserves that are available and strip mineable in 
Cape Breton and Nova Scotia?  There is a substantial reserve of 
coal which is available without the undersea mining process that 
is taking place in the Prince mine and proposed Donkin mine. 
Those questions have to be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the questions of drilling rights for the gas that is 
available, not only the methane gas in the coal seams in Nova 
Scotia but the other natural gas reserves that are rumoured to be 
available as well.  All of those questions have to be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the question of a lawsuit that is currently before the 
courts.  It has been brought in by Donkin Resources Limited 
because of promises the government made to those people who were 
doing an assessment of the feasibility of opening the Donkin 
mine.  It cut them off at the knees.  There is that whole issue. 
How can it sell Devco before it settles the whole legal issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found the suggestion by the member for Broadview—Greenwood 
interesting.  He suggested that they set up a government board to 
oversee the pension fund and give Joe Shannon the chairmanship of 
the pension board on top of everything else.  That was really 
interesting and really made a lot of sense.  He did make some 
sense in the suggestion that a lot of these issues could be 
explored in committee with witnesses if the government allows us 
time in committee to do that.  That is the question and one that 
has to be answered before we can accept that idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of all those reasons, the limited time of debate and the 
secrecy surrounding the suspension of the Financial 
Administration Act that guarantees us some transparency in this 
whole thing, it is imperative that we have the opportunity to get 
answers to these questions at some point in the process.  It is 
the only way Canadians are ever going to understand what this 
deal was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Cape Breton I met with the mine workers union. It 
showed me in black and white that obviously over a number of 
years the management of Devco was deliberating sabotaging the 
operation of the mines.  We could quite clearly see from year to 
year where it cut off capital investment.  Machinery was not 
replaced or repaired.  There was down time from poor equipment. 
We could clearly see that, instead of preparing another coal face 
to be mined when the one that was currently in operation was 
completed was not done.  When the operating face was mined out, 
the whole mine had to shut down while they moved and set up to do 
the process of preparing another face.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government do these things?  That is not an 
efficient operation.  That, in my view, was a deliberate attempt 
to make Devco appear to be as uneconomical as it possibly could, 
so it would be easier to shut down when the time came.  Someone 
has to answer for those things.  We have to have a committee. Joe 
Shannon, the chairman of the board of Devco, has some serious 
questions to answer about his role and how he got a multimillion 
dollar contract to move coal as he sat as chairman of the board 
of Devco.  That has to be a sweetheart deal.  I do not know how 
he possibly could do that.  He also has to answer why as chairman 
of the board with a vested interest like he has he is sitting and 
assessing the bids with Nesbitt Burns Inc. in Toronto.  He again 
is clearly in conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to hear from the Donkin Resources group that put a bid 
in and was rejected, in their words, because it was a Canadian 
bid.  Being a Canadian bid should not be the reason to reject it. 
It should have been the reason to move it to the top of the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had breakfast with another individual who put in a wholly 
owned Canadian bid that was rejected for similar reasons.  He had 
some very interesting proposals tied in with his bid for Devco in 
dealing with the Sydney tar ponds and a lot of other things we 
have heard talked about today.  I would like to hear from that 
side of the issue at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is so much being hidden that needs to be revealed 
and needs to be discussed about the whole Devco issue and what 
the government has been doing and what the government's 
intentions are with this that I certainly support the NDP motion 
to hoist the bill and move it into committee before we are 
finished second reading.  I think it is a valid proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not really care which committee it goes to.  As far as the 
amendment to the amendment, I am ambivalent on that.  However, 
the idea of getting it into committee and having a thorough study 
of the issues that surround this I certainly would support.  I 
think the whole issue has a bad smell about it that needs to be 
clarified.  I hope the government will allow us to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to again discuss the issue of Devco.  Some may 
wonder why I am interested in this issue.  It is because I have 
had the opportunity to visit Sydney—Victoria and the great 
island of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to the people when I was there about a year ago. They 
were upset about the passing of a part of their history.  They 
also looked at the future with a new challenge of what they could 
do to once again make a viable economy on the island of Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard some of the members say “We don't want to make 
telephone operators out of all of these miners”.  Indeed that is 
not the intention.  When a company like EDS wants to invest money 
in Cape Breton, it is a positive and good thing.  It tells us 
that company thinks there is a future in Cape Breton as the 
people themselves think there is a future in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of discussion about abandonment of the 
workers.  It is interesting to note from statistics that the 
number of miners is divided into three groups, as I understand. 
We have one group which has made 75 pension points and they are 
over 60 years of age.  Approximately 140 of them are going to 
benefit from an early retirement program with pensions over 
$20,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second group who are approximately 49 years of age with less 
than 25 years experience are going to have work.  This seems to 
be the essence of the problem.  Apparently some in the opposition 
would prefer these people to be pensioned off.  It is assured 
that there will be at least 500 jobs for these people, so there 
is no unemployment.  In fact there are jobs to go to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is another regrettable group, 42 years of age and 
under, the last people hired by the pit.  They are receiving 
three weeks salary for every year that they worked.  Plus, if 
they worked over 20 years, they get four weeks salary for every 
year over 20. 
Quite frankly this is better than almost any severance plan in 
the country.  The government has been generous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned about the people of Cape Breton and their 
ability to change their economy.  Often speeches in the House 
have been on how to keep the past going, how to keep the mines 
open just one more month or one more year, how to keep a way of 
life going that in fact has changed.  The reality is that the 
coal industry in Cape Breton, as is the case in Britain which I 
visited recently, has gone by the wayside.  The same members 
speak in the House about the terrible aspect of fossil fuel 
emissions and the environment and maintain the importance of 
keeping a coal industry.  In my opinion these comments are 
terribly inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just about coal mining in Cape Breton.  One listening 
to the debate in the House would think that is all that goes on 
in Cape Breton.  However in Cape Breton approximately 3,000 
people are employed in the forestry.  Close to $1 billion of 
private money is invested in Stora in Port Hawkesbury.  In 1999 
tourism witnessed the strongest year in its economy with $230 
million being gained in tourism in Cape Breton alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about knowledge based industries?  Some 44 businesses have 
set up on Silicon Island, employing 300 people.  What about 
Precision Finished Components in North Sydney?  It is making 
money and expanding.  Also located on the north side is a company 
that manufacturers plastic for markets in Canada and the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on and on.  Poly Tech Windows in Baddeck employs 
40 people and exports its products to the United States and all 
over the world.  Finewood Flooring in Middle River employs 20 
people and exports its products to Germany and the United States. 
MacPherson Bros. in New Waterford exports prefabricated homes to 
Spain and Germany.  The list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tells me that the people of Cape Breton are adaptable.  In 
fact the people of Cape Breton have changed their economy.  It 
may well be that members of parliament do not seem to realize 
this.  We should be happy that Cape Bretoners have turned their 
efforts to creating a new economy in Cape Breton.  They went back 
in history.  They went back to the mines and kept the mines open 
just one more month, just one more year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems strange to me when I hear members of the Canadian 
Alliance Party complaining about the system.  They should be 
celebrating that Cape Bretoners have found the courage to deal 
with their misfortune and the ability to go forward.  Certainly 
it was not without some unease.  The industrial revolution was 
not easy on a lot of people.  People had to make significant 
changes, which is not easy to do midway through life.  I would be 
the first to admit that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To keep on going with something that is not working is not 
reality.  The reality is that they require change.  As I 
understand it, more people in Nova Scotia are engaged in teaching 
today than either the fishery or the forestry industries. 
Economies change and they change with the times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cape Breton are up to that change.  They have 
accepted the fact that their economy cannot continue to rely on 
coal as a basis of sustenance for them.  As a consequence, they 
have tried to experiment and they will continue experimenting. 
The government, in spite of the discussion about turning miners 
into telephone operators, will continue to find ways to encourage 
private industry to establish in Cape Breton to the betterment of 
the people there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to be part of a government that has made a tough 
decision to dispose of the coal mining operations, but it is the 
right decision.  All of us realize that governments are not the 
best operators of coal mines whether in Cape Breton or anywhere 
else.  It is time to move on.  It is time for a new future.  The 
people of Cape Breton realize it and the government realizes it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, it is with a great sense of both sadness and anger that 
I rise to participate today in the debate on this important bill, 
Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rising to participate in the debate I want to make a couple 
of preliminary points.  First, as my colleagues from the New 
Democratic Party have noted during this debate, particularly 
today, it is absolutely shameful that once again on legislation 
this fundamental, this significant, the government is bringing 
down the hammer of closure before there has been any significant 
movement for dialogue with the workers who are affected and the 
communities that will be devastated by the results of the 
decision of the government.  This is becoming a habit with the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the House for almost 21 years, I vividly recall 
Liberal MPs standing when they were in opposition and condemning 
the Conservative Party in the harshest of terms for its recourse 
to closure, to time allocation.   This government, particularly 
in this parliament, has resorted to closure far more times, and 
who would have ever imagined over 60 times, than the 
Conservatives ever did.  What we see is blatant hypocrisy and an 
attempt to more and more marginalize democracy itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know best is the attitude of the government:  we know best 
for the people of Cape Breton; we know best in real terms for the 
corporate interests that are just waiting to get their hands on 
the resources that are the vital part of this decision.  I want 
to condemn the process the government has embarked on to shut 
down this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I pay tribute to my colleagues, particularly my 
colleagues from Cape Breton, for the tireless campaign they have 
waged both within the House and across the country in their home 
constituencies of Sydney—Victoria and Bras d'Or—Cape Breton to 
make Canadians more aware of just how significant and how 
important the issue is for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent an urban community on the other side of the country. 
I have the great privilege and honour of representing Burnaby. I 
have visited Cape Breton on more than one occasion and have been 
tremendously impressed by the strength and the resilience of the 
people of Cape Breton in the face of incredible adversity.  That 
strength, that resilience and that eloquence are certainly 
reflected in our caucus in the representation from Cape Breton by 
the member for Sydney—Victoria and the member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note as well the extent to which many of us were moved by the 
writing of another Nova Scotia member, a member of our caucus, 
the hon. member for Dartmouth, in her powerful play <I>The Glace 
Bay Miner's Museum</I>.  She wrote about some of the impact in 
intensely human terms of the uncertainty and despair that 
affected many families as a result of the corporate decision 
making, the insensitivity and the inhumanity of decisions that 
were made solely on the basis of the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the ultimate obscenity of that approach with the death of 
the Westray miners, death which was clearly attributed to 
corporate greed.  I hope the House will in the very near future 
adopt the amendments the leader of the New Democratic Party 
proposed which would make it very clear that we view it as 
criminal wrongdoing when corporate interests are put ahead of the 
lives and the safety of workers in mines and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak today with some albeit very limited knowledge of mining 
myself, having working as an underground miner at a very young 
age, as a young university student, in northern Ontario at the 
Dickenson gold mine.  I worked underground in Balmertown, 
Ontario, in a mine which had an appalling safety record. 
Certainly in a very small way I can relate to the uncertainty 
faced by miners as every day they put their lives on the line 
when they go underground. 
All they are asking for is some sense of being treated with some 
dignity and some respect.  Instead of that we see the government 
railroading the legislation through the House of Commons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As opposed to the original legislation tabled in the House, the 
original Devco Act, we know there is no provision in the bill 
that would compel the government “before closing to ensure that 
all reasonable measures have been adopted by the corporation”, 
that is by Devco, “to reduce as far as possible any unemployment 
or economic hardship that can be expected to result therefrom”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not radical.  That is not revolutionary.  All it is 
asking is that there be an assurance that Devco, which has been 
in existence for over 30 years, shows some respect, consults, and 
engages in dialogue with the workers and the communities affected 
by its decision to make sure that the unemployment, the loss of 
jobs and the economic hardship are minimized.  Why is the Liberal 
government not prepared to even make that commitment to these 
communities on Cape Breton?  It is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I are attempting 
to ensure that when the bill goes to committee we put back that 
basic commitment to the workers, to the people and to the 
communities of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there is a great deal of uncertainty in those 
communities.  There is currently an arbitration process under 
way.  Instead of the government respecting that arbitration 
process and putting the bill on the back burner while the process 
proceeds to its conclusion, what does it do?  It rams through the 
legislation and says to hell with the arbitrator.  The Liberals 
say they know what is best for the people of Cape Breton and they 
know what is best for their communities.  The reality is that 
they know what is best for the corporate interests that stand to 
gain from the dismantling of this corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it shocking, as my colleague from Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, 
my colleague from Sydney—Victoria and others have made very 
clear, that there are big corporate interests just waiting to 
move in and dismantle the corporation, to pick up the pieces and 
to profit from this misery.  We know that foreign ownership of 
these resources is a very real possibility.  More and more, as my 
colleague from Kamloops pointed out today during question period, 
we are losing control of our own economic destiny, our own 
future, our own ability to make decisions about the best interest 
of the people of Canada.  We see that now in the case of Cape 
Breton as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a debate about figures or statistics.  It is a 
debate about flesh and blood people and families who look to the 
future and feel a tremendous sense of uncertainty.  They are 
asking to be treated with some dignity and respect.  Folks who 
are perhaps in their fifties and sixties know that it will be 
almost impossible for them to find another job but they at least 
want a decent pension.  They do not want a job at a call centre. 
They want a decent pension and they want a future for their kids. 
They do not want their children to have to leave that beautiful 
part of our country to find a future, and they should not have to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we in the New Democratic Party are appealing to the 
government even at this late time to reconsider its approach, to 
pull the bill back, as my colleague for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton 
suggested in an amendment that she proposed in February 2000, to 
give the government and Devco an opportunity to enter into that 
dialogue with the people of the communities affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, what those communities face with the closure of all 
Devco mining operations and the eventual gutting of the 
corporation is devastating.  They face the direct loss of about 
1,500 good quality, well paying union jobs.  Spin off jobs will 
be lost as well.  Two or three times as many small businesses 
will be hit particularly hard.  They face the loss and the 
expenditure by Devco of as much as $50 million annually in that 
region to contractors and suppliers.  They face the loss of 
almost $80 million per year in wages and salaries.  In a 
community that is already economically depressed, imagine the 
kind of impact this has.  Yet the Liberals insist on just 
ploughing ahead. 
It is a loss to Ottawa and to taxpayers of some $28 million a 
year in Canada pension, unemployment insurance and income tax. It 
is a huge economic loss of over $300 million to that region 
alone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see you signalling me that my time has come to an 
end.  I am quite prepared to continue for another half hour or 45 
minutes if the House would give me leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas has asked for the consent of the House to extend 
his time for debate by 30 minutes.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No.

<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
would have been very pleased to listen to our colleague from 
Burnaby—Douglas, whose eloquence and concern for workers is well 
known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to rise today, although the topic at hand is 
of grave concern to us. I say that I am pleased because workers 
across Canada know that, historically, they can count on the Bloc 
Quebecois. We have given them our support both through our 
colleague, the member for Portneuf, our natural resources critic 
when the issue was first raised a year ago, and the tireless 
dedication to workers shown by our colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, our human 
resources development critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw a parallel with a situation I experienced in 1993 
as a young MP. My colleagues may remember that in those days 
Montreal was undergoing a process of industrial obsolescence that 
had started in the 80s. There was a program called POWA, which 
was totally inadequate for Montreal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that in those days, in Montreal, there was the 
Vickers shipyard, at a time when there were 30% too many ships on 
the seas and workers in my riding had to be retrained. It was a 
time also, in the late 80s and early 90s, when the whole textile 
industry in Montreal was in trouble due to its obsolescence. It 
has since picked up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must once again draw a parallel between my experience in the 
90s and what is happening in Nova Scotia. With Bill C-11, the 
government is getting ready to privatize Devco, turning over two 
coal mines to the private sector, and putting close to 1,000 
workers out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This causes us to wonder what our duty is, what our 
responsibility is, as parliamentarians, when this sort of thing 
goes on in regions we might describe as one industry regions. The 
coal industry, the mining industry, the coal mining industry is 
not marginal in the Cape Breton community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen the figures on this.  I am told that it was a really 
major industry.  This is all the more of a concern since the 
government is saying today “It is no longer as cost effective as 
we would like it, as we think it ought to be, we will privatize 
it.  We will let the private sector take over this industrial 
sector, but we do not want the responsibility of knowing how 
these workers are going to go about finding a second job”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will say that the government set aside a certain amount 
for separation bonuses. According to our information, and the 
members of the government side will correct me if I am wrong, 
there are some 230 miners with 25 years' experience. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy.  When you have 25 years of experience, of 
seniority, when you have worked have worked in the same firm for 
25 years, you have a certain know how, knowledge in an industrial 
sector.  It also means that you may be 45, 50, 55 or perhaps even 
60, and it is then not easy to relocate or to find another job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 does not resolve the problem of 225 or 230 miners with 
25 or more years of experience with Devco, who are excluded from 
early retirement programs as currently defined.  This is where 
our parliamentary responsibility calls out to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask Liberal members: what if it were your brother, your father 
or your best friend who had given 25 years of work to a company 
and who, all of sudden, found himself without an income because a 
government has decided to withdraw from that industrial sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more disturbing—and the hon. member for Portneuf alluded 
to this earlier—is what is happening now, this relative loss of 
momentum in the coal industry. We understand that anything 
related to the primary and secondary sectors of our industry is 
experiencing difficulties of one degree or another. This is what 
we call the “tertiarization of the economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy is increasingly a service economy. This means that 
certain sectors including the coal industry, that used to be very 
important are now experiencing problems. Earlier I mentioned the 
textile industry, but I could have included the leather and linen 
industries, Vickers in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, and the shipyards 
for which the hon. member for Lévis fought hard and even 
introduced a bill in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the fight led by the member for Lévis, the 
representations being made by the NDP members for Dartmouth and 
Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, and the battle that I fought as a young 
member of parliament regarding POWA, in 1993-94, have in common? 
They all illustrate the responsibility we have as 
parliamentarians not to let older workers down, because it is 
harder for people who are 45, 50, 55 or 60 to find a new job. 
That is what I cannot understand about this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been said, once again we are dealing with an 
extremely authoritarian manner of carrying out House business. 
What is the procedure which characterizes the most dictatorial of 
governments?  Let us not mince words, it is imposing gag orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our audience, who are less familiar with the way the House 
works, what does this mean?  It means that, with a cavalier 
gesture, without regard for the freedom of expression of 
parliamentarians, which is part of our mandate from the public to 
rise to speak in this House on behalf of the best interests of 
our fellow citizens, the government, the Liberals, these 
pharisees, these whited sepulchres, have decided through their 
parliamentary leader to impose a gag order so as to limit the 
speaking time of the members of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that we are speaking today of the immediate 
and future earnings of the mine workers.  When we are dealing 
with the income of the family wage earner, we are of course 
dealing with the situation of entire families who would, if it 
were not for the vigilance of the opposition parties, be in 
difficulty.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we shall be adding our voices to that of the NDP because 
we are an enlightened opposition and understand that Bill C-11, 
while it does not concern Quebec directly, obliges us to 
solidarity.  We have always been there in solidarity when workers 
were being threatened.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful to the NDP members for waging this battle today. I 
want to tell the workers of Cape Breton that we are with them and 
that we care about their destiny and their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we want done? We want the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources and Government Operations to give some thought to the 
fate of the part of Canada known as Cape Breton, which relies on 
a single industry, or just about, and we want better solutions to 
be found to this industrial transition, which has meant that the 
coal industry is not as important in the year 2000 as it was in 
the 1960s and 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that this industrial transition cannot be achieved 
without serious support from the government.  We understand that 
jobs will not be found as easily for some workers and that it is 
the responsibility of this parliament to ensure that they have an 
adequate income, in recognition of the contribution they have 
made to the economic development of their region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want these workers to know that we will not forget them and I 
say shame on this government, which once again has failed to 
support those who need the help of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I may be wrong, but we do not appear to have a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Portneuf is right.  We do not have a quorum. Call in the members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we just had a quorum call to make sure 
there were sufficient members of parliament in their seats to 
allow the debate to continue.  Let us face it, this is a very 
dark day for Cape Bretoners, a very dark day for democracy and a 
very dark day for parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, in spite of the fact that this legislation will 
profoundly impact on the lives of hundreds and hundreds of 
families in Cape Breton and will mean a difference in the futures 
of hundreds and hundreds of families in this hard-pressed part of 
Canada, the government has decided that it does not want to hear 
any more debate, that it has heard enough.  The government has, 
some 60 times in this session, again muzzled the duly elected 
representatives of the people of Canada from 301 constituencies 
who will have no further chance to participate in this debate. 
The government is saying that it has the understanding, the 
knowledge and the comprehension to say that enough is enough and 
that it has heard enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that there are many people here who want to speak 
to this legislation.  The fact that the government has said that 
it is not interested in allowing debate any longer is a dark day 
for this institution.  I know you, Mr. Speaker, must also be very 
said.  I know Canadians are sad.  I know parliamentarians are 
sad, at least on this side of the House.  At least in our party 
we are making an effort to keep the debate going. I know others 
are very sad.  I can see their heads shaking. This is a bleak, 
black, dark, gloomy day for democracy and for the parliamentary 
system in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a dark and mysterious day for Cape Bretoners. This 
has to be one of the most mysterious debates when people are 
raising questions that logically do not make any sense. For 
example, the government has decided that selling Cape Breton coal 
for Nova Scotia to generate power does not make any sense.  It 
has decided that it makes more sense to import coal from 
Columbia, from Venezuela, from foreign countries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine how the people of Cape Breton are going to feel when 
those ships roll up to those docks in Cape Breton to unload coal 
from Colombia.  It has to be embarrassing.  We are going to bring 
coal from Colombia to Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess whose ships are going to be hauling that coal. This has to 
be a sad day for political leadership in the country when we find 
that the shipping company of the Minister of Finance is going to 
be used to ship coal from Colombia to Cape Breton.  As a matter 
of fact, it has been shipping coal for a long time.  There are 33 
ships shipping coal from Venezuela, the United States, Colombia 
and other foreign countries to provide fuel for the power plants 
for the people of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not enough, in today's newspaper we find that the 
Minister of Finance is a little short of ships and has to build 
some new ones.  Does he select Canada's shipyards to build ships? 
No.  He goes to the low wage shipyards in China.  That is where 
he is building his ships.  The Minister of Finance is building 
his ships in low wage China, using Philippine labour, and the 
ships are flagged in Liberia or some place in the Caribbean.  The 
Minister of Finance is supposed to be setting a model for 
economic behaviour.  There is a lot of puzzling around this which 
we have to get to the bottom of in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is going to buy this?  I know that the workers who are going 
to lose their jobs wanted to make a deal so that they could 
essentially run the new company.  They wanted to find ways of 
raising finances.  The Government of Canada said “Hold it, that 
is not good enough.  We want a foreign buyer”.  It is part of 
the theme of Canada being up for sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning Statistics Canada revealed that takeovers by 
foreign companies have now reached breakneck pace. We are in 
passing gear.  Our low currency and the big for sale signs all 
over the world mean that foreigners are coming here to buy and 
control our economy like they never have before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Minister of Industry say about it?  He is happy. 
He is one happy camper.  He says that he loves that foreigners 
are buying up our economy and he loves that foreigners are 
controlling our future.  I can say that we in the New Democratic 
Party do not like the idea of foreigners controlling the destiny 
of this country's next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to take Canada back.  The problem is we had a made in 
Canada solution and the government said that it was not 
interested.  It would much rather have a mysterious foreign buyer 
come in to take over the operation.  This does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people who over the years fought for this country in wars, 
who fought and died for democracy, and those leaders of our 
country from coast to coast to coast who struggled to build up 
economic sovereignty must be turning in their graves right now. 
They cannot believe this is happening in our country. It is a sad 
commentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard some of my Liberal colleagues, who have given 
rather embarrassing presentations today, say that the people of 
Cape Breton should be thankful for this handout.  You have been 
to Cape Breton, Mr. Speaker, probably many times.  Most of us 
have been there many times.  As a matter of fact I was there 
recently.  We will never meet a prouder group of Canadians who 
are prepared to work hard for their incomes.  They are working 
hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are talking about hundreds of people who go down into 
those pits underground.  They go down into those dark, wet, 
dangerous pits day after day and make modest amounts of money to 
provide income for their families.  They have been tossed on the 
coal heap.  Some 1,500 families have been told “Sorry folks, we 
do not need you any longer”.  We are not talking about 1,500 
jobs.  That is the obvious number of jobs.  We are also talking 
about spin-off jobs, because for every miner who loses a job, a 
dentist, a teacher, a shoemaker and somebody else are losing 
their jobs.  We are probably talking about 5,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Prime Minister roared into Cape Breton and said 
“Listen, I know 5,000 of you have just lost your jobs or are in 
the process of losing your jobs.  We have got a great idea.  We 
are going to open up a call centre so that at least 400 of you 
can be telephone operators”.  The government expects people to 
cheer for this. 
To be fair, it is nice to have some kind of an infill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about men and women who work hard.  For 
generations people have been going down in those coal mines 
working hard to provide for their families.  The idea of sitting 
in a call centre with a phone headset on for minimum wage is not 
that attractive but that is the best we have.  We have to deal 
with this in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard others say that today.  For goodness sake, we are the 
most connected country in the world.  Our banks are overflowing 
with money.  We have talented and trained individuals.  This 
country has the best minds. If we cannot find a better way to 
provide for the people of Cape Breton than what is in this piece 
of legislation and what the government has announced, something 
is very wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put the proper economic strategy in place, if we included 
the proper industrial strategy along with an economic strategy, 
if we established a business plan for Cape Breton, we could turn 
Cape Breton into the showcase of economic development in this 
country if the will was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are talented, hardworking, well trained and educated people 
who are prepared to work hard.  They are prepared to create 
something of hope for their children, but they need a government 
on their side, not a government that is prepared to toss them out 
the window. That is another reason we have to get this bill to 
committee and deal with it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Cape Breton with some of my colleagues from the New 
Democratic Party.  We met with individuals, mining specialists 
and people who know the Devco operation inside out.  They all 
said the same thing.  The theme which was emerging from all of 
our deliberations in all of our meetings was the systematic 
program to demonstrate that Devco was uneconomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today many people have shared with us their personal 
experiences, the way they were approaching the coal faces, the 
way they set up those strategies and so on.  In other words there 
was a scenario to enable Devco to be financially inept and 
therefore something the government had to sell off. That is 
definitely not the case.  We have to expose that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we say to a group of people who say they know they are 
going to get some measly severance arrangement?  As a matter of 
fact I heard a government member say that those people are going 
to get $8,000 a piece to retrain themselves.  Where do people 
retrain for $8,000?  Maybe for a call centre job to learn how to 
put on a headset properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight thousand dollars is a bit of an embarrassment. As my 
fiends from Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and Sydney—Victoria pointed 
out, all sorts of other government settlements have been much 
fairer in how the men and women involved were treated.  Cape 
Bretoners get shortchanged.  Cape Bretoners do not get a fair 
deal.  The government says to Cape Bretoners that it is not 
interested in giving them the same kind of deal it gives 
everybody else. Why is this?  Why does the government treat the 
people of Cape Breton in such a cavalier fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of questions.  We are up against closure today 
and not many more of us will have a chance to speak. Let us just 
hope and pray that when the bill gets to committee and witnesses 
come before the committee to explain some of these questions and 
provide new information that the government does not use its 
muscle in committee and close that debate off as well.  That 
would be the darkest day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the threat of closure is about to strangle us here in a 
few more minutes, we hope that when the bill goes to committee we 
will have a chance to debate it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for 
recognizing the constituency of Okanagan—Shuswap.  Mr. Speaker, 
imagine sitting around in Cape Breton or anywhere in Canada 30 
years ago with your coffee buddies, your friends and you were 
talking about what would be happening in Canada 30 years later. 
If somebody said that all the coal mines in Cape Breton would be 
shut down, somebody would have called for an ambulance and a 
white jacket.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing today?  We are talking about exactly that.  We 
have to stop and wonder how this all took place and what 
exactly happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to go to Cape Breton.  I have also 
had the opportunity to go down into the mines with the workers, 
and hardworking and dedicated people they are. Not one of them I 
talked to was asking for a handout.  When I talked to them they 
were asking for the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. It might 
have been that my subconscious knew that the member for 
Okanagan—Shuswap had already been on his feet speaking to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, but not on the 
subamendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  But not on the sub- 
amendment.  According to the infallible records of the clerk 
it was.  We could ask for unanimous consent for the member to 
speak for another eight minutes and that would solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  I was just going to talk about the 
mismanagement with regard to Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Unfortunately our 
records indicate that the hon. member for Okanagan—Shuswap has 
already been on his feet.  I am sorry it took that long to figure 
it out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
again to speak to Bill C-11 with some sadness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I spoke on the bill was in November.  I raised 
questions about the basic misunderstanding of the problems in 
Cape Breton by the government.  I spoke about the fact that many 
Cape Bretoners who still consider themselves Cape Bretoners no 
longer are able to live there.  They now reside in my community 
of Dartmouth or in Montreal, Calgary or Toronto, or they have 
been forced to leave the country.  They go to Boston or elsewhere 
in the United States because of the government's approach to the 
problems of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach has been that it is time to move on; it is time to 
leave the island that they love; it is time to lower 
expectations, to know that what the coal miners have wrested from 
the rock with their sweat and with the lives of their fathers and 
grandfathers is not worth the government's attention any longer. 
What it is really time for is the government to stop being so 
arrogant and to stop being so patronizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I last spoke on this bill a number of things have 
happened. The people of Cape Breton finally got the government's 
attention by taking direct action.  They took control of the 
mine.  These men had finally had enough and the spouses and the 
families of the men had had enough. Together they took control of 
the mine.  I do not blame them.  They were not prepared to let 
the legacy of sweat their forefathers had left go without a 
fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to salute the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton for her 
levelheaded and hands on approach to the workers who took that 
dramatic action.  I think the situation may have descended to 
violence had she not been there to keep communications between 
the parties going during that very tense situation.  That took a 
lot of guts on her part and it took a lot of guts on the workers' 
part to take the action that they did.  They brought the 
attention of the entire country to their plight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to thank the member for Sydney—Victoria for the 
brilliant defence of his constituents and his articulate, 
eloquent and passionate representations made to government 
members, sadly to no avail.  The Liberals seem hell-bent on 
destroying Cape Breton island.  They told the workers down the 
mine that they would send their reasonable grievances to an 
independent decision maker to get them to end the strike and 
allow the coal to flow once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was strange that when the coal stopped flowing the power 
supply to my constituency became uncertain. Still the Liberals 
say that shutting off the tap of Cape Breton coal is a good 
thing.  Maybe I should be a little more charitable.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is willing to let Devco go simply so an American company can 
have the privilege of buying the supply contract which will keep 
my constituents' lights on.  However, from what I am hearing here 
and back in Nova Scotia, the government has never fulfilled this 
promise to the brave workers who went down that mine.  I am not 
surprised, only saddened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing the government has done is assured workers in 
Cape Breton that they will be provided jobs in call centres.  The 
Prime Minister himself flew to Cape Breton on the eve of a 
provincial election to tell people in Cape Breton that he would 
get rid of good paying jobs without providing decent severance 
and let them work for crap wages in call centres.  The Prime 
Minister called this the best kind of patronage.  I call it 
arrogant and patronizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While being a playwright, I had the great pleasure to write a 
play about characters living in Glace Bay, called <I>The Glace 
Bay Miners' Museum</I>.  It was based on a very important story of 
the same name by Sheldon Currie. This bill presents to me a whole 
new scenario, a comedy of course, a farce I guess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  A black comedy, absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have visions dancing in my head of a whole new industry being 
put together in Cape Breton by the Government of Canada because 
it believes in patronage first.  First it announces call centres. 
Hundreds and hundreds of jobs all over Cape Breton for former 
coal miners to sit behind desks and explain to callers from 
Alabama how to fix their washing machines or how the good people 
of Mississauga can order their lingerie in the right size or 
colour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then a problem surfaces.  The call centre company's quality 
control police at head office in Dallas or Singapore notice that 
these call centre workers have Cape Breton accents, probably in 
both languages.  This greatly offends their sense of global 
commercial homogeneity and the companies are not happy.  The 
government believes, above all else, that companies be kept 
happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a group of concerned ministers and a legion of advisors 
huddled around the Prime Minister discussing accent problems. 
What is the result?   We have a whole new private sector industry 
being subsidized by HRDC to train Cape Bretoners not to have 
accents.  The Prime Minister himself will give the final exam 
because he believes in hands on patronage for Cape Breton, and 
according to many comics I know, he is an expert on accents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Prime Minister personally flying into Sydney and Glace 
Bay on each and every graduation day to congratulate the new 
accentless Cape Bretoners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also see problems with some of the companies accounting for 
all the money they were given, but that would be another story, a 
different story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually, the government, for the benefit of Cape Bretoners, 
will encourage them to leave the island, after all they no longer 
had accents and the call centre business was now moving farther 
offshore due to newly signed trade agreements negotiated by the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that some of this has been in jest, but less than one 
would think.  The underlying theme, that this government is 
destroying Cape Breton, its culture, its lifestyle and its soul 
with this bill, is not a joke.  It is forcing people in 
industrial Cape Breton to make a choice:  accept less and maybe 
not be forced to leave or leave and maybe not be forced to accept 
less.  This is no real choice at all.  It is torture.  It is 
cruel, cynical and unjustifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even at this late stage of debate, even during the tyranny of 
closure, I call on the Liberals to think about what they are 
doing and pull this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to this 
amendment on Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to tell the House, on behalf of the Canadian 
Alliance, how absolutely aghast we are at the government for once 
again moving closure.  The government has now hit the record for 
the number of times closure has been moved.  It has tied the 
record of the Mulroney regime that preceded it, and in a much 
shorter time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  That's nothing to be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  That is nothing to be proud of.  What 
does closure mean?  It means that the government is cutting off 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue.  There will be almost 1,600 families 
affected by this legislation.  We have talked for a little over 
five hours on this issue in the House. 
There is no reason in the world why we should not have the 
ability to talk about something that so fundamentally affects the 
people of Cape Breton as does Bill C-11.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the House that there have been many other times 
when the government has prematurely moved closure.  Let us 
consider Bill C-20, the clarity legislation.  We talked about it 
for 18 minutes before the government moved closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is outrageous that the Liberals continues to do this and is 
not embarrassed about it.  They seem to think it is fine if it is 
them pushing the legislation through.  They should be absolutely 
ashamed.  This is anti-democratic behaviour.  On an issue that is 
as important as this one, it is absolutely ridiculous.  The 
people of Cape Breton should be outraged by what we have seen 
from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to more specifics in Bill C-11.  I have been 
to Cape Breton but I do not pretend to know it as well as some 
colleagues in this place.  Cape Bretoners are wonderful and warm 
people.  They live in a beautiful part of the world.  Given an 
even chance, they would have an outstanding economy.  As far as I 
can tell, Bill C-11 seems to be the final chapter in a legacy of 
broken promises by successive governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What started out many years ago as a plan to help out Cape 
Breton, instead seemed to be a situation where the government 
kept hanging the carrot in front of their nose causing them to 
move forward but ultimately to never realize their goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the goal of Devco and all the money that was put into 
Cape Breton?  It was to build a sustainable industry in Cape 
Breton.  Obviously, that has not happen.  A lot of money has been 
poured into this and people have spent years in those mines 
building what they thought was a career.  Now it has all come 
tumbling down around their ears.  They have families and they 
expected to have a future in that place.  It is now gone.  The 
government should be absolutely ashamed for allowing this to 
happen over this long period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could recount reasons for for this, but it boils down to a 
lack of transparency and honesty from this government and 
previous governments about what would happen and what the chances 
would be of having a sustainable industry.  Even today my 
colleagues have pointed out that there is no reason to believe 
that those mines could not be profitable.  Because of government 
policies, that has not happened.  Who pays the price for that? It 
is the workers at Devco and the people of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose there are many ways we could try to fix this.  I do 
not pretend to be enough of expert to talk about those in great 
detail.  However, I do believe there is hope for the people of 
Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and Atlantic in general.  It does not 
lie with governments that do not give people the straight goods. 
It does not lie with governments that build peoples' hopes up 
only to dash them later.  It lies in the private sector. It is 
time we gave the people of Cape Breton the same tools that many 
of the more developed areas of the country already have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are those things?  The people of Cape Breton need to enjoy 
some lower taxes.  Cape Breton is a beautiful and gorgeous part 
of the world.   With a trained workforce and with people who know 
how to work hard, it has the ability to become a prosperous part 
of the economy that some parts of Canada now enjoy.  How do we do 
that?  We do that in a number of ways.  First, let us clean up 
the mess at Devco.  Let us get it behind us and ensure that 
people get a proper severance package, one that will not leave 
them high and dry if they are near retirement but do not have the 
number of years that would allow them to have that package.  Let 
us treat them decently and put this issue behind us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us go about allowing the economy to produce jobs 
that these people can rely on.  How do we do that?  We begin by 
lowering taxes for one thing.  I am not saying that is the only 
thing.  We must give people a decent severance package so they 
can pay for retraining.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must be allowed to remove the barriers that 
prevent so many companies from investing in places like Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that some parts of the country do extraordinarily well 
while others languish?  One of the reasons is that the 
governments looking after those areas have all kinds of 
impediments in place that do not allow those areas to prosper. 
Cape Breton, I would argue, is a victim of those sorts of 
policies.  Sadly, that has happened at the provincial level.  I 
will not reflect on whether it is happening now.  It has 
certainly happened at the federal level over a long period of 
time when areas like Cape Breton were operated like a fiefdom by 
certain Liberal members of parliament and senators.  That is 
crazy and it has to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not in the 20th century any more.  We have to step into 
the 21st century and give these people the tools they need to do 
the job:  lower taxes, fewer regulations and a commitment to 
training the people of Cape Breton and Nova Scotia, which should 
primarily come through provincial levels of government.  This is 
probably an area where I disagree with my friends on other sides 
of the House, but I think it needs to come through the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people need to be well trained.  If this begins to happen, 
we will perhaps see the sorts of things that have happened in 
other parts of the country begin to happen in Cape Breton. People 
will come to a beautiful place like Cape Breton because the 
impediments are now gone.  They will want to enjoy the quality of 
life that a place like Cape Breton can offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an island that people from across Canada and from around 
North America flock to because it is so beautiful and a wonderful 
part of the world.  The people are great and have a unique 
culture.  Cape Breton has every potential to become a powerful 
economic area.  However, it will not happen if we continue to go 
down the same tried and failed road we have gone down so many 
times before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Help is not going to ultimately come from governments.  If there 
is any lesson to be learned from the last 30 years in Cape 
Breton, it is that the government cannot be relied on.  What 
happens time after time is that nobody wants to do what is right, 
they only want to do what is easy.  They want to do what they 
think will get them re-elected, only to find out years later that 
they made promises they could not keep.  For crying out loud, let 
us not go down that road again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, let us give these people the tools.  Let us lower their 
taxes, leave more money in their pockets and let the 
entrepreneurial spirit shine in Cape Breton.  I believe it can. 
We have seen it happen in many other places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by simply saying, especially to my friend across 
the way who has been responsible for moving closure so many 
times, that it is time to allow a little democracy to flourish in 
Canada.  This is the House of Commons, the Parliament of Canada. 
If democracy should be evident anywhere, it should be evident 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, freedom of speech is apparently something that is 
anathema to the government.  It does not want to hear about 
people getting up and speaking out on issues that are important 
to the people so it moves closure and shuts down debate.  It has 
now moved closure as many times as the Mulroney regime, and it 
should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton has the tools to do the job.  Unfortunately, it has 
been pounded by government after government suggesting that help 
will come from Ottawa.  It has not.  Promises have been dashed by 
this government and other governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cape Breton need a new vision, a vision that 
embraces the private sector, one that has provided so much 
prosperity for the rest of Canada.  Let us hope that the 
government will see the error of its ways and allow the people of 
Cape Breton to really flourish in the future.

addressed the issue this afternoon. Only opposition members are 
talking about it. If the Liberals are proud of the job that they 
are doing, if they are proud of having found the solution for 
Cape Breton people, they should at least rise and defend their 
position. They are closing that mine, but they have no good 
reason to do so, they have no reason at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have no reason to do that to people who have worked in the 
mine for over 30 years, people whose lives totally depend on that 
mine. This closure will affect over 1,500 families, not to 
mention the spinoff it will have on all the other jobs related to 
that mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Newfoundland's Premier Brian Tobin said “It is not the 
people of Atlantic Canada who let the Liberals down, it is the 
Liberals who let Atlantic Canada down”. That is the problem for 
the Atlantic provinces. The Liberals let them down.

As a former miner myself, it is something I have to say today in 
the House of Commons. I said it last time and I say it again 
today, I have a lot of respect for these miners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members say they supported Cape Breton all those 
years. The people of Cape Breton got up every morning to go to 
work. They have put their health and their life on the line. 
They have sacrificed their health for this country. Today, 
people like the finance minister are benefiting from what is 
happening in Cape Breton, as his ships are bringing in coal from 
abroad. What is going on in this country is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People went on a hunger strike to get the attention of the 
Liberal government. We will recall minister Dingwall, who was 
turfed out by my colleague from Bras d'Or—Cape Breton. 
The same government that is currently in power has hurt seasonal 
workers in Atlantic Canada and across the country by cutting EI 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While in opposition, Liberal members used to say that, should 
they ever form the government, they would never do as the Tories 
did. They used to say economic problems ought it be attacked, 
not people. This is what the Prime Minister used to say when he 
was in opposition. But once in office, the Liberals gutted 
employment insurance. They squeezed out seasonal workers who are 
faced with the black hole, the so-called gappers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Liberals have done. They followed in Brian 
Mulroney's footsteps. There is a good reason why we can hear a 
Liberal member singing. He is unable to rise and make a decent 
speech in support of the closure imposed by his party. The 
Liberals have invoked closure in the House of Commons 65 times. 
Shame on them. This is an all time record. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real shame that the government put closure on this 
legislation so we cannot debate this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> What is the difference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  There is no difference. 
The parliamentary leaders in the House of Commons know better 
than that.  It is a real shame how the people of Cape Breton are 
being treated today.  The Premier of Newfoundland, a good Liberal 
and a good friend of the Prime Minister, said that the people of 
the Atlantic provinces did not drop the Liberals, the Liberals 
dropped them.  We could see that is what happened with employment 
insurance

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals were in opposition in the spring of 1993.  The 
present Prime Minister said at that time to some people in Quebec 
that the Conservative Party attacked the wrong people by cutting 
the employment insurance.  They should attack the economy is what 
he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 2000 we heard the Prime Minister at the Liberal 
convention saying “We lost the Atlantic provinces because we cut 
the employment insurance.  We have to give it back if we want 
some votes”.  He did not say he wanted to give it back because 
he heard the people, the seasonal workers.  That is not what he 
said.  We might have said that was a good thought on his part and 
that the Liberals will make some changes because they now realize 
they have hurt families in this country from coast to coast to 
coast.  That is not what they said. 
Now they are saying that the Atlantic is for sale.  I have a 
surprise for them.  The Atlantic is not for sale and our people 
in the Atlantic will not be bought out by the Liberals, I can 
tell hon. members that much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember not too long ago the Liberal caucus in the Atlantic 
provinces said “Let us catch the wave, and to catch the wave we 
have to change the employment insurance because when we changed 
the employment insurance we lost the Atlantic.  Let us catch the 
wave”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Liberals catch the wave and that they start to 
understand that in the Atlantic provinces we are still part of 
this country.  We are human beings in the Atlantic provinces and 
we have kids who have to go to school.  The kids will go hungry 
because of the decisions of this government.  The government 
dropped them, that is what it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame what the Liberals have done to Cape Bretoners.  It 
is a shame what they did in my riding where people are caught in 
the gap and then left on the street.  Shame on the Liberals for 
what they have done to the people in the Atlantic provinces and 
across the country who are not fortunate enough to have a full 
time job.  Shame on the Liberals for what they have done. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should really be ashamed of the way they treated 
the people who are not lucky enough to have a full time job.  I 
offer as an example all those who have seasonal jobs in the area 
of tourism.  The New Brunswick provincial government is now 
telling loggers “In the short term, the only solution is to go 
on welfare”.  I am sure the same thing is going on in Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude of today's governments has to change.  I know that 
people alone will be able to bring about this change by putting 
the Liberals out of office once and for all and by showing them 
the real road so they will understand what it means to be a 
family in misery, instead of all of them coming from Ontario, 
where things are prosperous and where they are lucky enough to 
have people who work all year long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they go to northern Ontario, perhaps they will understand 
too.  Even Liberal colleagues say that people have been 
mistreated by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this amendment will be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development so that we can look at 
the human side of this situation and the way people will be 
affected by what the government has in mind. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will agree to this amendment and send it 
to the committee on human resources because we have to look at it 
as a human problem for the people of Cape Breton.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not the first 
time I have had a chance to speak after my good friend from 
Acadie—Bathurst.  I appreciate the emotion and the colour he is 
able to put into his speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add a few remarks as we come to the conclusion 
of speeches on second reading of Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 15, 1999, the Minister of Natural Resources 
indicated to the House that fundamental change is required in the 
coal industry in Cape Breton and that Bill C-11 is an important 
component in the reshaping of that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides the legal authority for the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation, or Devco as it is commonly known, to 
sell all or substantially all of its assets.  The bill is 
consistent with the recommendation from Devco's board that a 
private sector buyer should be sought to purchase Devco's assets, 
as agreed to and announced by the government in January 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finding a strong private sector owner who can maintain a 
commercially viable operation over the long term is viewed as the 
best and most realistic way to sustain as many coal mining jobs 
as possible in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate of this bill, considerable support has been 
expressed by members on both sides of the House for a private 
sector commercial operation.  I am pleased to tell the House that 
the firm of Nesbitt Burns Inc., which is managing the sales 
process for Devco, has been successful in identifying private 
sector interest in Devco's assets.  In fact, prospective 
purchasers have toured Devco's facilities as part of their due 
diligence process and definitive proposals have been received for 
Devco's assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devco is at the stage of evaluating and clarifying one of the 
proposals with a view to finalizing the broad terms and 
conditions of a sale in June.  Negotiations concerning the final 
detailed agreement of purchase and sale would then follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prospects for transferring Devco's assets to the private 
sector and for maintaining coal mining jobs in a private sector 
commercial operation are real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now more important than ever with purchasers on Devco's 
doorstep that we move forward with this bill.  Timely passage of 
Bill C-11 will allow Devco the legal authority to finalize a 
sales transaction with the purchaser.  Most important, a sale 
will confirm the maintenance of good, solid private sector coal 
mining jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate there has been some concern expressed about 
the fairness of the $111 million human resources compensation 
package for those Devco employees, estimated at approximately 
1,000, who will lose their jobs because of the need to close the 
Phalen mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January of this year, in response to requests from its 
unions, Devco's management agreed to establish a joint planning 
committee which is following the process as outlined in the 
Canada Labour Code to resolve issues related to the existing 
human resources package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process has led to the appointment of an independent third 
party arbitrator whose decision will be binding on both parties. 
That decision is expected around the end of May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond providing the legally required sale authority, the bill 
creates no new ministerial powers and no delegated authorities. 
It maintains what is called the general advantage of Canada 
clause which will ensure that the Canada Labour Code will 
continue to apply, a point which is important to Devco's unions 
and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sale proceeds, as with any other funds provided to Devco, 
will be expended under business plans which will be approved by 
the Government of Canada.  The Financial Administration Act 
requires that Devco operate within an approved business plan, 
summaries of which are tabled in the House.  The bill will not 
change that requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concern has also been raised by some hon. members about Bill 
C-11's elimination of section 17(4) of the Devco act.  Let me 
remind my colleagues of two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Canada Labour Code, as well as collective agreements 
between Devco and its unions, contain provisions dealing with 
workforce reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the economic development responsibilities of Devco's 
former industrial development division were transferred to 
Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation in 1988. 
Although Devco has continued to make a significant contribution 
to the Cape Breton economy, it has not been an instrument of 
economic development for over 10 years.  However, economic 
development on Cape Breton is continuing to be addressed by the 
government.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, to support economic development in Cape Breton and in 
response to the requirement to close Devco's Phalen mine, the 
Government of Canada has already committed $68 million.  The 
Government of Nova Scotia also contributed $12 million for this 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new federal funding is in addition to any job creation or 
economic development activities that would normally be undertaken 
by either the Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation or the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency, or any other federal agency or 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already the existence of this fund has made it possible to 
attract jobs to Cape Breton.  On March 21 the Prime Minister 
announced the DES Sydney centre, a contact centre that will 
create up to 900 full time jobs over the next four years.  As 
requested by Cape Bretoners, local consultations have been 
undertaken to obtain the very best possible local advice about 
how to use that new funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel that was assigned to conduct these consultations with 
Cape Bretoners has submitted its final report to ministers. 
Federal and provincial officials will use that information as the 
basis upon which to design an economic investment strategy for 
Cape Breton.  The initial elements of that strategy should be 
operational this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as an aside I would point out, and I would like to make 
comments contrary to those of the member for Dartmouth who 
exhibited very little confidence, I believe in the workers of 
Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sheelagh Whittaker, who is president and CEO of DES Canada, when 
it was announced that this new major project would be undertaken 
in Cape Breton, said this:  “DES customers, major global 
corporations and telecommunications manufacturing and financial 
services will come to rely on this centre for rapid and 
responsive support.  The customer service professionals here”, 
and she meant there in Cape Breton, “will be trained and 
equipped with cutting edge web and wireless technologies and the 
DES centre itself will be nothing short of a showcase featuring 
the latest thinking in both technology and customer service 
processes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe she was clear in saying she was making a bit of a joke 
I guess of the situation unfortunately, but I would ask her to 
revisit her words and instead say that the people of Cape Breton 
and the workers in the coal industry are capable people, capable 
of adjusting to a new world and in fact as we begin this new 
millennium proceed with a confidence that I believe and we all 
believe is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows the enormity of the challenges now facing the 
people of Cape Breton.  The Government of Canada is committed to 
assisting in every reasonable way to help building a more secure 
and durable future.  Legislation now before us is the key to 
moving that process forward.  The future hinges in large part 
upon that process being successful in finding a buyer who will 
make a tangible and long term commitment to Cape Breton and to 
Cape Bretoners and to its workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 is relatively simple and straightforward.  By allowing 
a private sector operator to purchase Devco's mining assets we 
are taking a tangible step to try to maintain the maximum 
possible number of coal mining jobs in Cape Breton in a 
commercially viable context for the long term.  Now is the time 
to get on with the important business of examining the bill in 
more detail in committee.  Now is the time for us to show 
confidence in Cape Breton and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In responding to the amendment with reference to the HRDC 
committee, I believe its proper place is with the Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations which is 
fully capable of examining this bill.  While I remind the House 
the bill is a simple bill, a straightforward bill, it does not 
create any new authorities for the minister.  It does not 
delegate any authorities.  It is a bill which will allow for the 
evolution as it must of the coal mining industry in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I see that my time is up, Mr. Speaker.  I ask all 
members to support the bill, including my colleagues across the 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr.

time with the hon. member for Halifax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, all the mindless moralizing, tongue clucking and 
finger wagging that we are hearing from this side of the House is 
the same attitude that came with the announcement that 1,100 coal 
miners in Cape Breton were out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The so-called analysis of the event wafting out of all the ivory 
towers west of our island could barely contain a content for coal 
miners, the whole tribe of poor cousins east of the Gaspé.  Our 
sin, to hear the chattering elite tell it, was twofold:  first, 
we were poor; second, and even worse, we were undeserving poor, 
the kind that is able enough but unwilling to do much for 
themselves, always expecting others to take care of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do such ideas come from?  I have never met a coal miner 
who believed the world owed him a living—not my Dad, not my 
Uncle Ronnie at the bottom of Number 26 colliery, not any of my 
relatives who went down in the mine, not any of the miners on the 
street where I grew up, not any of the miners I know anywhere in 
Cape Breton.  But what do I know?  I am not a newspaper editorial 
writer or a television news anchor.  I do not get paid to 
pontificate.  I am a coal miner's daughter who grew up in Glace 
Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the sensibilities of people who dig abstractions 
for a living.  I know about the men who dig coal for a living in 
Cape Breton and what I know is that the last thing any of them 
ever got was a free ride.  What I know is that they had worked 
like hell for every single thing they got and still do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know they did the best job in the world, year in and year out, 
until their bodies were broken by the work.  The men took it and 
came back for more.  They battled the bosses when they had to, 
but always did the work.  Whatever it took to dig the coal, they 
did it.  Through the long days of summer they did it.  Through 
the short days of winter when they got up in the pitch black of 
the dying night to descend into the pitch black of the mines, 
finish their shift and come up as pitch black as the coal itself 
to the home in the pitch black of the new night, they did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did it for their wives and the kids and for the almighty 
company overlords of the British Empire Steel and Coal Company 
and the Dominion Steel and Coal Company and the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation and for Canada.  They did it to get a 
paycheque and earn their way.  They went into deep, dark holes in 
the ground where the earth creaks and the pit props groan.  They 
endured dust and heat and wet and cold and noise and vermin in a 
hell that no devil ever dreamed of.  They gasped for air and 
staggered to the surface after bumps that squashed their friends 
to pulp or blew them to smithereens, turned around, worked in a 
rescue, cleaned it all up and then went back underground again. 
They did it to pay their way and because we counted on them to do 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the wars came, we implored them do to it.  Coal was life 
and death.  Coal was the margin of victory.  Our world ran on 
coal. Every comfort, every convenience, every essential service 
was tied to coal and Cape Breton miners provided whole mountain 
ranges of it.  They served us all well.  They never, ever got 
something for nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clifford Frame, who built the Westray Mine that vaporised 26 
miners in the early morning of May 9, 1992, got to walk away to 
live in the sunshine without a scratch.  Miners were not that 
lucky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say Devco is unprofitable, whatever they mean considering 
the source and however significant such an assessment can be 
considering our island's political history.  To date we have been 
left with only the word of the federal government.  But if it 
truly is unprofitable, it is not because of the miners.  God 
knows enough of them died trying to make it otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking away our living is an injury all Cape Bretoners will have 
to bear.  Blaming us for the loss is an insult that sears our 
souls.  It is cruel and callous to expect us to submit to the 
snide chiding of self-appointed pundits who see us as latter day 
cargo cult civilization, always watching the skies for gifts from 
the gods of government.  Give us the respect we deserve.  Do not 
add the indignity of insult to injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We earned everything we ever got.  We earned it with our sweat, 
our blood and our tears—oceans of sweat, lakes of blood and 
rivers of tears.  There was a time when it was enough to earn us 
a living.  It should forever be enough to earn us respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to share the time with my 
colleague from Bras d'Or—Cape Breton.  I do not have the direct 
ties to coal mining in my immediate family as does the hon. 
member who just preceded me and that is why she speaks about the 
issue so eloquently and so passionately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say very briefly why I was prompted, and I guess I would 
say provoked, to enter the debate that is before the House at 
this time.  There are really three things that provoked me to do 
that.  One was recognizing and watching the government invoke 
closure yet again, I think for the 65th time in this session if I 
am not mistaken, outdoing the Mulroney government's record for 
heavy handedness and disregard for the importance of dealing with 
an issue like this in a thorough and comprehensive way.  What a 
legacy for the current federal Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I have been listening and watching members across the 
way, most recently the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, talk about the lives and livelihoods 
of Cape Bretoners, in particular the miners and their families, 
as if they are a commodity, a commodity to be disposed of, to be 
traded away.  The focus of attention has been so much on the 
notion of transferring assets, completing sales, finishing deals 
and finding buyers.  If there were ever an eloquent reason for 
referring this legislation as the subamendment before us proposes 
to the human resources committee, it is that.  We are talking 
about the future of a generation of people and the next 
generation coming from behind them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said “Well, I believe that Cape Bretoners are 
capable of adjusting to change”.  You are darn right they are 
capable of adjusting to change, but we are talking about human 
lives being lived in a community and what the economy of that 
community is going to look like.  This government does not even 
have the sensitivity or the decency to understand why issues as 
complex and as sensitive as this should be brought before the 
human resources committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the third reason why I was provoked to enter 
this debate at this time.  On Friday I was in Windsor, Ontario. I 
was participating in a forum, a teach-in really, around the 
upcoming meetings of the OAS that are going to take place in 
Windsor.  One of the speakers at that forum was the president of 
the mine workers from Columbia.  That trade unionist who risks 
his life to come and talk with us in Canada about what is 
happening to coal mining, not just in his own back yard, not just 
in his country, but around the world, used the issue of Devco and 
the government's handling of Devco as one of the most dramatic 
examples of what is wrong with the corporatization of our economy 
both locally and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he described is absolutely true.  While this government 
presides over the elimination of large numbers of jobs in the 
coal industry and puts at further risk the opportunity for future 
work in the coal mines by saying “Well, the private sector will 
do it just as Westray, the families of the survivors of Westray, 
did about the privatization of coal mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this trade union leader from Columbia talked about is while 
the federal Liberal government knowingly puts the jobs and the 
futures of those coal miners of Cape Breton at risk, what it does 
is drive the race to the bottom and turn around and import the 
coal from Columbia, one of the worst countries in the world with 
regard to labour standards, working conditions and human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to end by pleading with the federal Liberal government to 
understand the simple concept of treating the lives of Cape 
Bretoners and the future of those miners and their families, and 
others who are dependent upon the mining industry as a human 
issue to be considered by the human resources committee, not as a 
commodity, not just something to be traded away.

with dignity recognizing that they are indeed a human resource is 
going to be the key to a prosperous and stable economy in Canada 
based on human rights and decent labour standards.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this spring the Pembina Institute for 
Appropriate Development released a study that exposed the 
government's failing record on climate change.  The institute 
reported that Canada's worst polluters are spewing out more 
greenhouse gases than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nine companies, most of them petrochemicals, joined a voluntary 
program to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels.  They did so 
following Canada's promise to do just that at the Rio de Janiero 
conference in 1990, but seven years later these companies were 
belching out substantially more pollutants than they had earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the companies that are dragging their feet.  The 
same report shows that of 88 measures passed by federal and 
provincial governments to combat global warming, only one-third 
of them have ever been implemented.  Many of these programs are 
for public awareness or consultations and have fallen short of 
expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year our Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide and similar 
gases are expected to reach 694 million tonnes.  That is 15% 
above the level Canada agreed to stabilize at 10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in 1997 with great fanfare that Canada signed the Kyoto 
protocol.  That committed us to a substantial reduction in our 
emissions of greenhouse gases.  As of today, Canada has still 
failed to ratify that pact.  In fact, it appears that we are 
backing away from our original commitments because of our failure 
to get there to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amazingly the government continues to rely on the voluntary 
efforts of individuals and corporations.  It refuses to promote 
alternative technologies which, according to the Suzuki 
Foundation, could reduce our country's greenhouse gas emissions 
by as much as half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refuses to talk about the regulation of 
greenhouse gas emissions and instead puts its trust in companies 
like Petro-Canada.  Members may be aware that this company's new 
president and CEO said last week that his investors have put 
money into a company for its shareholder value and not “for us 
to solve a global problem”.  It is going to take more than 
volunteerism here.  It is going to take government action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Climate change is no longer something for Canadians to worry 
about tomorrow.  The changes are already with us today.  The 
polar ice caps are thinning.  Nearly 300 square kilometres of a 
large ice shelf in Antarctica have disintegrated since October 
1999 because of steadily increasing temperatures.  In our own 
polar region, Inuit hunters and elders report that hunting is 
becoming risky because of thinning ice and melting permafrost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Weather patterns are also changing and the economic effects can 
be devastating.  Earlier this spring NASA reported a shocking 
decline in the ozone layer over northern Canada.  Despite a 
worldwide ban on ozone depleting chemicals, it is expected that 
ozone layers over Canada will take decades longer than we had 
expected to return to normal.  Again this is because of 
greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not good news for our children who already face high 
cancer risks.  Climate change is upon us, yet the government 
refuses to take action.  There have been consultations and talks 
and talks and consultations, but there is no national plan to 
reduce greenhouse gases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are waiting for options to help reduce these 
greenhouse gas emissions.  I urge the government to move beyond 
consultations, to ratify the Kyoto protocol and to set some 
targets to meet our promises.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for taking the issue of climate change and 
the emission of greenhouse gasses as serious.  It behoves all of 
us as members of parliament and as responsible citizens of this 
country, indeed responsible citizens of the world, to convey the 
message to our colleagues and fellow citizens that this is a 
serious issue.  It does demand a serious response not just from 
us in Canada but from the global community.  It is a global issue 
and an issue that cannot be fully resolved without concerted 
global action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada generates only about 2% of the world's global emissions, 
but on a per capita basis we rank much higher on the list in 
terms of global emitters, so we must do our part to deal with the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning with the Kyoto protocol, we have put together a 
process that has engaged 450 Canadians in more than 16 issue 
tables to examine every dimension of the greenhouse gas issue 
vertically by sector and horizontally by the cross-cutting theme 
to make sure that we had before us at various levels of 
government a complete menu of well thought out, well researched, 
factually based policy options from which to choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That work is now virtually complete.  The ministers of energy 
and the environment federally, provincially and territorially are 
meeting throughout this year to select from that menu the policy 
options that we will pursue in the future.  Canadians can be very 
assured that the Government of Canada is very serious about the 
issue.  We intend to perform to international standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.17 p.m.)
