<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-10, an act to 
implement a convention between Canada and Sweden, a convention 
between Canada and the Republic of Lithuania, a convention 
between Canada and the Republic of Kazakhstan, a convention 
between Canada and the Republic of Iceland and a convention 
between Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark for the avoidance of 
double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect 
to taxes on income and to amend the Canada-Netherlands Income Tax 
Convention Act, 1986 and the Canada-United States Tax Convention 
Act, 1984, as reported (without amendment) from the committee. 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
the bill be concurred in. 
(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  When shall the bill 
be read a third time?  By leave now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<A NAME="LINK6">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
the bill be read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, as you have indicated, this involves tax 
treaties with a number of countries including Denmark, Iceland, 
Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Sweden and The Netherlands, but most 
important or certainly most in the news has been the amendments 
involving our treaty with the United States of America.  This 
important amendment is taking place in terms of social security 
benefits which are paid by the American government to people 
living in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effects of this tax apply basically to about 60,000 
Canadians.  About one-third of these are low income residents of 
Canada who are still in receipt of U.S. social security benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current law the Americans are entitled to withhold 
25.5% of these social security payments they make to people 
living in Canada.  Where these recipients, approximately 20,000 
of them, lose out is if they were taxed at ordinary Canadian 
income tax rates on these benefits, their tax rates, because they 
are in lower income brackets, would be much lower. 
Therefore, this blanket withholding of 25.5% by the Americans is 
a detriment to these particular residents of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we have undertaken on their behalf to renegotiate 
this treaty to ensure that they can be taxed not by the source 
country, the United States, by way of withholding, but in Canada 
where they would be taxed on their net income.  Many of these low 
income residents of Canada will end up paying no taxes 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For recipients of U.S. social security benefits who are in 
higher tax brackets, there will also be a relieving position 
which comes about because only 85% of the benefits will go into 
taxable incomes, rather than 100%.  This is mirroring the way the 
United States would tax its residents on this income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has gone through the House for second reading where it 
received great support from all sides.  It has gone to both 
committees where they have sent it back unamended. It is of 
course important that we enter into these new treaties with new 
trading partners so that Canada can continue to be at the 
forefront of avoiding double taxation and encouraging 
international investment, international flows of currency, 
international jobs, but particularly in terms of our provisions 
dealing with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we make these relieving provisions so 
that we can get on with the job of making sure that these people 
are treated fairly by both the United States and Canada as it 
relates to their social security benefits. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat what the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques said about 
getting the co-operation of all parties because the main purpose 
of this bill is to remedy a fundamental inequity for low income 
persons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect that as soon as this passes—and we certainly hope to 
have the unanimous support of all members of the House—that it 
will be signed into law very quickly and receive royal assent. We 
understand that the United States has done all that is necessary 
except receive presidential signature on this bill.  As soon as 
it goes through, we would expect that within a few weeks, or in 
as short a time as possible, refund cheques will be sent out. 
Revenue Canada will be co-operating with the U.S. revenue 
authorities to track down every person who might have been 
unfairly prejudiced over the last two years by these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect, with the support of all members, to be able to 
correct this inequity and to make sure that the taxpayers in 
Canada who have been unfairly prejudiced are going to get their 
refunds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all members of this House for their splendid 
co-operation on this excellent bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on behalf of the official opposition to address 
Bill C-10, an act to implement the convention between Canada and 
Sweden, a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Lithuania, a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Iceland and a convention between Canada and the Kingdom of 
Denmark for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention 
of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and to amend 
the 1986 Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Convention Act and the 
Canada-U.S. Tax Convention Act of 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague, the insatiable 
snack-packer from Calgary West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the proposed conventions with Sweden, 
Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Iceland and Denmark are important tax 
treaties. Neither myself nor any member of the official 
opposition would argue that these conventions are in and of 
themselves bad fiscal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thought of unchecked tax duplication is enough to make any 
of us a little uneasy.  Much of Bill C-10 concerns simple— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the hon. member 
would forgive me, I think I heard that the hon. member would like 
to share his time.  At this particular point in the 
interventions, we, without unanimous consent, cannot split his 
time.  I just wanted to make you aware of that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Can I seek the unanimous consent of the 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, much of Bill C-10 concerns 
simple parliamentary housekeeping.  I think my hon. colleague 
from Calgary West would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as my hon. colleague from Calgary Southeast has pointed 
out in past debates on this bill, part VII of this act concerning 
tax treatment of social security payments from the U.S. social 
security fund to Canadian residents reveals another Liberal tax 
gouge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am losing track but I think this is tax hike number 38, what a 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arguments have been made in this House and in committee that this 
bill will make amendments to the 1995 third protocol that will 
increase tax fairness and provide tax relief for lower income 
Canadian seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief and fairness for low income seniors is an important 
and noble goal but unfortunately it is a goal that will not be 
achieved through this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I find it difficult to belief that tax relief is the 
goal of a Liberal government at all because the very tax treaty 
that imposed a 25% flat withholding tax for U.S. social security 
payments coming to Canadian residents was negotiated and agreed 
on by this government, the very government whose members are 
saying that it was an unfair agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To fully understand this issue, I have to review the history of 
public policy on social security payments and taxation.  It has 
given me a pretty clear idea of the low quality of the 
legislation before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1984 U.S.-Canada Income Tax Convention Act allowed 50% of 
social security payments to Canadian residents to be included for 
purposes of Canadian taxation.  That made a lot of sense because 
it was the same treatment that U.S. recipients of social security 
have. That is to say 50% of their social security payments were 
included for the purposes of taxation.  With only 50% of their 
social security payments included for taxation, many low and 
middle income seniors avoided paying any taxes on their social 
security income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy was changed in 1995 when the government entered into 
negotiations with the Americans to produce the third protocol 
which imposed a 25% flat withholding tax on those payments being 
made to American residents retiring in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For low income seniors, this meant 25% of their income 
disappeared.  After Canadian seniors let this government know 
that their treatment under the third protocol was completely 
unacceptable, the government went back to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth protocol, the results of which are included in Bill 
C-10, would see the inclusion rate of U.S. social security 
payments rise from 50%, as it was before 1985, to 85%.  That is a 
70% increase on the inclusion rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every senior who pays taxes will now pay more under this 
legislation.  It is not just wealthy seniors, it is all taxpaying 
seniors who will be hit by this tax grab.  This very fact was 
admitted in committee and, while I was not privy to the 
discussions, it was a matter of public record.  Section 7 of part 
VII of Bill C-10 is clearly another Liberal tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When seniors suffering under the 1985 treaty asked for tax 
fairness, when they asked the government to do something about 
the 25% withholding tax, they were not looking for a 70% tax 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this policy will do is penalize any and all seniors who 
have private savings that supplement their incomes so that they 
are at least within the lowest tax bracket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle income seniors who have made sacrifices and wise 
financial choices about their retirements are being punished. 
This is not exclusively the very rich.  It is every senior who 
pays taxes and who collects the U.S. seniors benefits, whether 
they make $10,000 a year or $1 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that this point will be ignored and my colleagues from 
across the way will remark that Reform is protecting the 
interests of the wealthy.  This is simply not true and I would 
ask my colleagues to think about the facts before they perpetuate 
misunderstandings and misinformation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to the issue of U.S. social security payments to 
Canadian residents it must be known that unlike CPP payments that 
are taxed only as income when they are withdrawn, U.S. social 
security payments are taxed at the time they are made and not 
when they are withdrawn. So Canadians receiving U.S. social 
security benefits have already paid taxes on those benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian working in the U.S. would pay taxes on his or her 
premiums but would pay little or no taxes when he or she claimed 
the benefits. This makes sense since seniors are less able to pay 
the taxes when they are on a fixed income in their retirement 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that worker who contributed to the U.S. social security 
system moved back to Canada he or she would have to pay taxes on 
85% of his or her social security income. They are being taxed 
twice. This is not only unfair, it violates the intended goals of 
our tax convention which is to eliminate any tax duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress some key points before I conclude. First, this 
legislation was rushed through the industry committee. The critic 
for this bill, the hon. member for Calgary Southeast, only 
discovered that Bill C-10 would proceed through the industry by 
chance at the last minute. This makes me pretty suspicious that 
this legislation contains merely house cleaning matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as I understand, the chair of the industry committee 
disallowed the hon. member for Calgary Southeast to request that 
seniors affected by Bill C-10 be allowed to testify before the 
committee.  If there were nothing offensive in the legislation, 
the government would have nothing to fear from being transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another unfounded concern that came up in committee is that 
Reform is trying to delay the issuance of cheques owed to seniors 
by not allowing Bill C-10 to be fast tracked through the 
committee.  Bill C-10 provides for the partial or full refund to 
some seniors of the IRS to a 25% withholding tax which occurred 
because of the original Liberal bill that was flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also said that Reform is doing this in an 
attempt to protect a small group of high income seniors from 
taxes. This is not true. The facts are every senior who receives 
U.S. social security and who pays taxes will pay more under this 
legislation.  The inclusion rate for calculating taxable income 
moves from 50% under the pre-1996 convention to 85% under this 
bill, the fourth protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By suggesting that Reform somehow wants to protect its idle rich 
supporters by supporting this bill, the government apparently 
feels that any senior who pays taxes is a high income senior and 
an idle rich supporter of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, let me remind the House that demographic studies 
show that the Reform supporter on average is less wealthy than 
the average Canadian.  Our supporters are not very rich. They are 
average Canadians who are hurt by the heavy burden of taxation. 
However, I am not here today to speak exclusively on behalf of 
Reform supporters.  I am here to speak on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring the attention of the House to the fact 
that the committee reports contain a clear statement by senior 
tax bureaucrats that the inclusion rate would rise from 50% to 
85% under Bill C-10, and that this rise would cost all taxpaying 
seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform resents the suggestion that we are responsible for 
delaying Bill C-10. We did not create the problem in the first 
place; the government did. Reform did not delay bringing forward 
this legislation until after the election; the government did. 
Reform did not wait three weeks since the debate to bring Bill 
C-10 to committee; the government did.  And Reform did not refuse 
to hear witnesses explain the impact that this would have on 
their livelihood; the government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not naive to the fact that government backbenchers followed 
the lead of their cabinet.  But an issue that involves raising 
taxes of Canadian seniors is just the sort of issue that should 
compel hon. members of the House to either change their 
caucuses or defy their caucuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian seniors need a unified voice in the House, a voice that 
will speak resolutely whenever the government reaches its hands 
into their pockets.  I fear that they do not have this voice with 
the government. This is not just about money, it is about seniors 
with retirement dreams and it is about seniors who will face 
their retirement years in government imposed poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> For the benefit of

Speaker, I was under the impression that the Reform Party was 
going to put forward another speaker.  However, I appreciate 
having the opportunity to speak in support of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, any attempt which this House makes to simplify the tax 
acts of Canada is something which I support and celebrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 would organize tax treaties for efficiency and 
fairness where there is a specific benefit to seniors in Canada. 
However imperfect, I believe it should be supported by all 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pick up from where the hon. member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona left off in his remarks.  He talked about 
the fact that members on the government side of the House should 
debate and challenge the tax system of this country.  The fact of 
the matter is we do.  This party is not made up of lemmings. The 
government is not asking members to suppress creativity on how to 
improve or reform the tax acts.  Quite frankly, I think the hon. 
member for Edmonton—Strathcona knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is purely coincidental today. There is a book which a group 
of us put together called “The Single Tax System” back in 1990. 
When I look at the acknowledgements of the people who 
contributed I notice the name “Rahim Jaffer, Ottawa”.  I 
acknowledged the hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona as one of 
the people who helped me put this effort at tax reform together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona is here as a newly 
elected member of Parliament.  I celebrate his being here.  He is 
a creative, intelligent and thoughtful individual.  However, I 
think that the challenge for the opposition is not just to 
criticize the flaws which exist in legislation, it is also the 
responsibility of the opposition to put forward constructive 
alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened attentively to the member's remarks during the last 
10 minutes and all he did was criticize this piece of 
legislation. I have never seen a piece of legislation which was 
flawless, but not once did the member talk about a constructive 
alternative.  I am beginning to wonder if the hon. member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona has gone soft on the notion of comprehensive 
tax reform.  He is in the index of this book as being one of the 
strong supporters of a single tax system and comprehensive tax 
reform, but not once during his remarks did he talk about what he 
would put forward as his alternative or his party's alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day that the member was elected I was happy and hopeful that 
when he came to this Parliament he would be a champion of 
comprehensive tax reform.  I thought that the member and the hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast, the former head of the Canadian Tax 
Foundation, were passionate supporters of the single tax system 
before they were elected.  We have been here for months and we 
have heard barely a peep out of those members. 
All they do is criticize.  They do not talk about comprehensive 
tax reform any more.  They do not talk about the single tax 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened attentively to the member's notice that there may be 
a couple of flaws in Bill C-10.  I repeat myself.  There could be 
areas requiring improvement in any piece of legislation, but I 
think we need to hear from the opposition parties on an issue 
like this one where they stand on comprehensive tax reform. Are 
they going to whisper about it from time to time, or are they 
going to get passionate in the House about real reform? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time is right.  We hear right now that not a day goes by in 
the United States that Democrat and Republican senators and 
congressmen are not looking at the notion of comprehensive tax 
reform.  If the United States government has a simplified tax act 
because it flushed out and cleaned up many of the credits buried 
in the tax act, we know that we must follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not avoid taking advantage of this opportunity.  We 
should get right into the debate, put our best creative minds 
together and see if we can create some momentum and some 
political will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 10 years I have watched our government and the 
previous government cut, cut, cut, offload all direct grants; but 
the fact of the matter is that the biggest or the largest grants 
to individuals or corporations are buried in the Tax Act of 
Canada.  There is no accountability or very little accountability 
in these tax preferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand here today appealing to the Reform Party to stand up for 
comprehensive tax reform, the same way they did before they were 
elected.  I also say to the Reform Party that it is fair ball to 
critique a flaw or two in a piece of legislation, but I appeal to 
my friend from Edmonton—Strathcona to put forward a constructive 
alternative.

Since the beginning of this Parliament, looking back to when the 
government has presented bills, it has on a number of occasions had 
the complete co-operation of the Bloc Quebecois because not only 
were the rights and obligations of Canadians being advanced, but 
Quebeckers were also demanding to be properly represented and 
defended.  That the Bloc has done.  We have done it since June 2, 
and even before that, since the 35th Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the member was referring only to a member of the 
Reform Party or to the Reform Party as a whole and not to the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, Bill C-10 is another example of the Bloc's leading 
the way in asking the Liberal government to act in this area, given 
its importance for a number of Quebeckers and Canadians.  This is 
another area where Canadian and Quebec interests merge, and this 
bill is a striking example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this bill about and what does it contain?  It 
implements a series of tax conventions between Canada and other 
countries in order to avoid double taxation. 
Furthermore, Bill C-10 amends the 1984 tax convention between 
Canada and the United States, resolving the problems of Quebec and 
Canadian retirees receiving American pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois and 
Quebeckers because I am in a good position to do so.  A number of 
Quebecers worked in the U.S. and decided, on their retirement, to 
return to their homeland, the beautiful country of Quebec.  They 
returned to Quebec and received American pensions.  Because they 
had problems with taxation, these people were taxed in the United 
States and what little they had left from their pension was then 
taxed in Canada so they were doubly penalized and doubly taxed. 
Something had to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Berthier—Montcalm is not near the American 
border, like other ridings along the Canadian border and the border 
between Quebec and the States.  Despite that, there is a 
municipality in my riding called Rawdon where there are a number of 
anglophones who have worked in the States.  For a while in the 35th 
Parliament, a number of my constituents in Berthier—Montcalm 
contacted me to draw my attention to this tax inequity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members of the Bloc were also contacted.  We thus became 
aware of the problem and rose on a number of occasions in this 
House with questions and worked in committee to oblige the 
government to act quickly.  It did not act as quickly as we wanted, 
but it did act.  A sin confessed is half forgiven.  At least the 
government acted and introduced a bill. 
You know how the Liberals across the way are. With them, nothing is ever 
simple. You know how the many Liberals listening to my remarks today 
are. They had to cloud the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bob Kilger:</b> We are all here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</b> You are all here. Fine, they are all here 
listening carefully to what I am saying. They should listen more 
carefully, this way they would speak less nonsense than they have in the 
past little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, more seriously, the government confused the 
issue somewhat by putting together a bill containing a series of tax 
treaties between Canada and various countries which we cannot all treat 
equally because of their respective tax systems. 
Around the world, there are countries with tax systems very similar to 
that of Canada and countries with completely different tax  systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked—this is admittedly a criticism I am making 
this morning, but a constructive and very positive one—Bill C-10 to 
deal exclusively with the American issue, a second bill to deal with 
other countries with a tax system similar to ours and a third one to 
deal with countries with a tax system completely different from ours.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this would have been less confusing and, 
particularly given the urgent, pressing need of many Quebeckers and 
Canadians and the fact that the United States are withholding money, I 
think that a tax convention, a bill dealing specifically with the U.S. 
would have helped expedite matters. These people who have been waiting 
for a cheque from the U.S. would have received it by now if we had 
worked diligently on preparing separate bills to expedite the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Liberals crammed everything into a single bill. For 
example, the purpose of parts 1 to 5 is to implement income tax 
conventions that have been signed with Sweden, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, 
Iceland and Denmark. 
These are countries with taxation systems that are, by and large, 
quite similar to Canada's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of these conventions is to avoid double taxation 
and prevent fiscal evasion.  They are based largely on the OECD 
model. It is not a case of reinventing the wheel.  What is good is 
retained and used in the conventions with these countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also other countries with taxation systems less 
similar to ours, however, and a convention has also been produced 
to help in these cases.  There is a tax convention signed with 
these countries.  But many of them are considered to be countries 
where the rich hide their money, so-called tax havens.  It is 
somewhat disappointing that they have all been lumped into one 
bill, Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare Canada's taxation system with the taxation 
systems of these countries.  As I said earlier, a comparison of the 
maximum corporate and individual income tax rates reveals some 
differences and some similarities.  For instance, the maximum 
corporate rate in Canada is 30.74% and the maximum individual rate 
is 52.94%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Sweden these percentages are similar.  But in Lithuania, 
while the maximum corporate tax rate is 29% instead of 30.74%, not 
a major difference, the individual tax rate is 35% compared with 
Canada's 53%.  You can immediately see the clear advantage for 
businessmen with a bit of money to pay their taxes in Lithuania 
rather than in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are rather significant differences at various levels. One 
thing which is not really a concern, but which must be addressed is the 
fact that, over the years, Canada has signed many treaties with other 
countries. The figures I am quoting were given at a meeting of the 
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, held on April 
24, 1997. As of April 24, Canada had signed 57 tax treaties that were in 
effect between Canada and various countries, while 34 other ones had yet 
to be ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the opposition, one wonders—again, this is not a 
negative criticism, on the contrary—whether the government allocated 
adequate resources to ensure a follow-up on all these conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax treaties signed between countries are usually not for the 
benefit of ordinary citizens. Ordinary people do not have bank accounts 
in Switzerland or in Barbados, and they do not do business with 
Lithuania, Denmark, the Netherlands or the United States. 
Usually, the provisions of these treaties are used by multinationals, or 
by very wealthy people who have accounts here and there, such as in 
Switzerland or Barbados, and who travel frequently.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an opposition party, we are the keepers of this government's 
sometimes deficient moral rectitude, and we have the right to wonder 
whether there are sufficient resources. With 57 treaties already signed 
and 34 other ones to be ratified—and more have probably been signed 
since April 1997—we wonder how many public servants are following up 
on all these conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I hope you are firmly seated in the Chair, because the 
committee learned that only one public servant was conducting this 
follow-up work. Thankfully, this person is working full time, which is 
something, given the cuts made by the government. 
We know there is an official monitoring this full time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not being critical in a negative way to say that more than 
one official would have been better, considering what has gone on in the 
past and how people have been tricked in Canada and in Quebec. I think 
taxpayers, Quebeckers and Canadians, have been had in the past, 
including at roughly this time last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I am referring to the scandal of the family trusts. 
Everyone knows that it is rather frightening when officials, just before 
Christmas, can have a little meeting and decide to allow companies to 
send money outside Canada without paying any taxes. We are not talking 
here about $100, $1,000 or $100,000, we are talking about billions of 
dollars. 
I think that taxpayers, in these difficult times, could legitimately 
expect that there would be fair treatment for these companies but that 
they would be treated fairly too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have means, who have two billion dollars in liquid 
assets and who want to transfer this money can afford to pay for very 
good legal advice, for good lawyers, but also for good tax experts. I am 
not saying that what they did was illegal, but it was certainly immoral, 
I want to state that very clearly, especially since everyone in Canada 
and in Quebec has to pay taxes, their fair share of taxes. I do not 
think it was proper for them to transfer this money without paying their 
fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also other examples, when tax treaties are applied, when 
companies can afford good advisers, we see that certain people, certain 
companies can sidestep the law and avoid paying their fair share of 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, I will give you a small example everyone knows about, 
Canada Steamship Lines. Everyone knows what that company is. Everyone 
knows that it is a Canadian company, but that its ships fly the flags of 
other countries, including Barbados and various countries. But why is 
that? It is to avoid paying their fair share of the taxes that they 
should be paying in Canada. This is not normal, especially considering 
who owns these ships. It is not normal that in Canada people should do 
such things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Bloc's criticism negative? No, this is positive criticism. 
We want as much as possible— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</b> I do not understand why the Liberals 
are not applauding me this morning, when what I am saying is a 
self-evident truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is normal for the opposition parties, including the 
Bloc Quebecois, which are seeking the greatest equity for the 
people of Quebec and Canada, to try to get legislation that is as 
free of flaws as possible.  We want to remedy those flaws.  These 
two examples, I think, are striking.  What is involved here is not 
to have huge quantities of international tax conventions. We just 
want to have quality tax conventions so that there can be proper 
follow-up and everyone can pay his or her fair share of tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the government member, the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood, was criticizing Reform members.  He was 
accusing them of giving up on tax reform. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand why he did not say this about the Bloc Quebecois, 
because we have been talking about tax reform for a long time for 
both corporations and individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look more specifically at this morning's topic, 
international tax conventions, I can refer you to two proposals 
made by us in the fall of 1996 focusing on corporate taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could have been included in international treaties as 
part of a mini-tax reform. 
It did not have to be a major reform, but they could at least have 
shown some degree of good faith in ensuring that it is not always 
the same ones who have to pay.  I believe that a certain equity 
must be sought, and I can understand the taxpayers who are sitting 
in their living rooms and watching the government members over 
there.  They are saying that the same ones always end up paying, 
and I understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has thus missed a great opportunity to show its 
good faith with this bill.  One of the proposals made by the Bloc 
Quebecois in the fall of 1996 is the deductibility of interest 
charges.  When a Canadian company has a branch in a tax haven, not 
only does it first of all take advantage of very low tax rates on 
profits earned outside the country, but it can also deduct from its 
income earned in Canada the interest on loans used to invest in 
that offshore branch. 
We think the tax system is too generous in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also have liked the government to amend the Income 
Tax Act to put a stop to this abuse.  I think everyone has got the 
point, but so people understand better, I will give you a specific 
example.  I have a company in Barbados; I borrow money in Canada to 
invest in Barbados to increase my profits in Barbados; I pay 
practically no taxes in Barbados, but, moreover, I deduct my 
interest costs in Canada.  This is a bit crazy.  I think the 
government could help people by putting a stop to these tax 
shelters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other proposal—and I will be brief, because time is 
passing quickly—concerns the deduction for intercorporate 
dividends.  When a Canadian company has a subsidiary in a country 
Canada has a convention with, the dividends paid by the subsidiary

There are certain conditions, but they are easily met.  This 
Canadian rule is much more generous than what is done in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the federal government to amend the Income Tax Act in 
order to tax foreign subsidiaries in Canada and to give a credit to 
them for tax already paid.  That did not come about, but you know 
how determined the Bloc is.  When we have an idea we do not let go 
of it, especially when it is a good idea like Quebec sovereignty 
and income tax issues.  We will continue, we will keep at the 
government and perhaps soon, the government will concede as it did 
with Bill C-10 on the tax convention between Canada and the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, and I conclude on this point, this was a real battle

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I believe 
the hon. member has just mentioned the importance of this bill 
and the time urgency of it as it affects Canadians receiving U.S. 
social security.  This includes all Canadians, not just seniors 
but those who are disabled and spouses and children of those who 
worked in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member has already partially corrected the 
record where the member for Edmonton—Strathcona earlier said 
that it was rushed through the industry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair of the industry committee I want to confirm that I 
spoke to every member on the steering committee, including the 
member who represents the Reform Party.  It was agreed by all 
parties that we would have no witnesses because of the urgency of 
this bill and get it back to the House as quickly as possible for 
debate.  It was not that witnesses were disallowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For two years this bill has been debated. For two years this 
issue has been out there.  If the Reform Party wanted to do its 
research, it would see that this has been going on for two years. 
As the member for the Bloc said, it has been going on too long. 
It is now before the House and we must deal with this as quickly 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all members will recognize the importance of getting 
the refunds back to people as quickly as possible.  We must 
recognize the importance of this bill to put Canadians on parity 
with their neighbours who live next to each other whether they 
are seniors or not seniors, that those who receive income will 
pay their taxes based on what they should pay. 
We recognize that they pay tax on U.S. social security by the 
fact that they are only going to include 85% and not 100% of 
their income whereas their Canadian neighbours who worked in 
Canada and receive only Canadian benefits will pay tax on 100% of 
their income.

not hearing witnesses in order to speed up passage of the bill, 
given the Bloc Quebecois' repeated demands, given that we 
understood that we would not be getting separate bills, as I was 
saying we would have preferred, but so as not to further delay 
implementation, given that the government had not acted as quickly 
as we would have liked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal machine can only move so quickly, however.  We 
therefore did agree with the government not to hear witnesses. 
These were issues the Bloc Quebecois and the Liberal government 
looked at very closely. 
We therefore knew where we were headed.  There were precedents: 
Canada had signed several international treaties; that was also on 
the agenda.  There were also treaties with the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it all boils down to is that we have this bill.  It is 
not what we would have liked, but I think that at this stage, in 
the interest of speed, all parties, government and opposition 
alike, should cooperate in order to ensure the speediest possible 
passage of this bill, the purpose of which is to have everyone 
paying their fair share of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean, however, that there is no need for 
vigilance.  It does not prevent the government from taking a very 
close look at its tax system to ensure that corporations taking

watched very closely. 
We are therefore going to cooperate in ensuring that this bill is 
passed as quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, two things happened this week to indicate that the 
wheels are falling off the Liberals' gun control scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a brief presented to the justice committee, the Canadian 
Police Association said the Liberal government misled them into 
believing that police could get into the firearms computer system 
when making emergency calls. After hearing this criticism the 
Liberals now say that the police on call will have computer 
access to the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also learned this week that the justice department's mail-in 
registration system will be so unreliable and unsafe that it will 
actually endanger policemen into providing inaccurate 
information. For example, justice officials claim that any 
firearms serial number incorrectly recorded on a mail-in 
application and then put on a registration certificate will still 
make the certificate valid.  This is ridiculous.  This means 
police will be unable to count on the accuracy of vital 
information entered into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Liberals not face it?  Their gun registration system 
is falling apart and must be scrapped immediately. 
It is becoming obvious that this sloppy gun registration system 
gives police no security but instead greater risk.

<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, this 
government has had months to prepare for the Kyoto conference. 
The environment minister has over 4,000 bureaucrats at her 
disposal and a budget of $.5 billion.  The conference starts on 
Monday and she still does not even know what position she will be 
arguing for or against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months this minister has said that she is taking the matter 
very seriously.  Canadians do not believe her any more.  If she 
really did take this seriously she would have released Canada's 
position long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What possible excuse does this minister have for not having a 
position ready to take to Kyoto? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member said, Canada's position will be 
stated publicly on Monday, but this will still be timely in terms 
of discussions at the official level and it will be very timely 
in terms of when the decisions are made by ministers.  This will 
be at the end of the conference and the ministerial portion does 
not even begin until December 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's position will be known well before that time.  It will 
be a clear position.  It will be a good position, unlike the 
Reform which has stated they do not know what they are talking 
about at all on this subject. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
this gets more and more curious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal government cancelled its announcement planned 
for today it needed a pretty big excuse.  It had already used up 
all the little excuses along the way.  What excuse did it tell us 
all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It said that a small detail had to be ironed out, an extremely 
minor point.  What could that detail be?  Could it be perhaps how 
much would this Kyoto deal cost Canadians or was it how much 
would it cost and who would pay or perhaps how would this deal be 
forced down the provinces' throats? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just which minor point was it that caused such a cabinet split 
and cancelled the announcement for today?  What went wrong on the 
way to Kyoto? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</b> Mr. 
Speaker, what has gone wrong with the Reform Party?  When they 
were asked their position they said our position does not count. 
So what details are holding up the Reform Party in stating their 
position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the Official Opposition.  They are there, they claim, 
to be some day, and it will never happen, an alternative 
government.  They have just proven why they will never be a 
government and they will not even be a party after the next 
election. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
obviously there is a hot air problem within cabinet at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked this government nearly 100 times to detail its 
position for Canadians.  I think that is reasonable.  One hundred 
times it has said that Canadians are going to have to wait just a 
little longer.  We are sick of waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government promised again to release its position.  Again, 
today it failed to do so but it has not cancelled its trip to 
Kyoto.  Of course not, the government is going to go.  It does 
not have a position.  Nobody knows what it is going to cost, but 
it is going to go off and sign a deal, whatever the deal might 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of the Environment, if she would 
care to answer this.  How can she leave for Kyoto this weekend 
when the government still does not have a made in Canada 
position?  Will the Minister of the Environment—

Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</b> My friend 
is totally wrong.  The minister is leaving at the end of next 
week as scheduled because the ministerial portion of the meeting 
does not begin until December 8.  Our position will be known 
publicly well before that time and yet there will still be no 
Reform position.  They do not count. They do not care.  Why do 
they not take responsibility to come to the table with a 
consensus to help Canada have a good deal?  Where is the Reform 
Party?  Absolutely nowhere. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, we 
just have to keep going.  This Liberal saga on Kyoto just 
continues.  The Liberals have painted themselves into a corner. 
For months they have been saying they would sign a deal in Kyoto, 
before they had decided what Canada's position would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They agreed to a deal before they had seen it and worse still, 
before they had even come up with their own policy.  Now they 
have fallen victim to those rash promises.  They are boarding 
planes and they are still writing their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this minister board the plane for Kyoto?  How can she 
sign a deal when she does not even know what the national 
position is? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, guess what, this government does have a 
position.  We have been articulating it for months.  The Reform 
Party refuses to listen that this is a real and serious issue, 
that this government is committed to legally binding targets in 
Kyoto that are realistic, achievable, that will be applied 
equitably in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday we will let Canadians know what the targets and time 
lines are in order to go to Kyoto.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
delay after delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question now is on behalf of the people that have been shut 
out of this insane process.  Two weeks ago the provinces agreed 
in principle to emission deadlines by the year 2010, but last 
week the federal government said it had unilaterally changed that 
to 2007.

How can it possibly come up with a nationally agreed to plan in 
the next 48 hours?  This is too incredible.

without getting provincial agreement first?

business, industry, environmental groups, municipalities and 
Canadian citizens.

if things go on as they are, she is going to need it to communicate 
the government position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She tells us that she is negotiating in good faith, but what 
credibility will she have on arrival in Kyoto if, right up until

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment,

Canadian government is very well respected for our efforts at 
negotiating important consensus.  It is more important that we 
come out of Kyoto with a consensual agreement world-wide on how 
we as an international community are going to reduce greenhouse 
gases.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  It has to do with 
the fact that many Canadians are embarrassed, and indeed many 
Liberals are embarrassed, by the rather cryptic remarks of the 
Prime Minister with respect to the pepper spraying of 
demonstrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the Deputy Prime Minister would care to defend 
the Prime Minister's remarks.  I wonder if he would also at the

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canada as host of the APEC conference has an obligation 
under international law to defend the integrity of the precinct 
where the meeting is taking place.  With respect to the use of 
pepper spray, the RCMP has announced that is under review.  I 
understand the concerns of Canadians about whether appropriate 
procedures were followed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister has refused to condemn the 
requiring of peaceful demonstrators to sign pledges not to do 
things unpleasing to the government.  The theory of the Liberals 
is that trading with other countries helps them to adopt our 
values.  The government is not worried that what is actually 
happening is that we are adopting their values.  We are getting 
more like them instead of them getting more like us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</b>  Mr.

appropriateness of the matter of signing these undertakings.  I 
am sure more will have to be said.  I understand the concerns

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is about Canadian retailers and small business who 
will soon start one of the most important periods of the year, 
the month of December.  What is the government trying to 
accomplish with policies of high payroll taxes, with an increase 
of 70% in CPP premiums, with an increase in interest rates this 
week and further increases in interest rates, and a postal strike 
to add to business people's pain?  What message are they sending 
to Main Street business people in Canada who are trying to earn a 
living? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

that our government was able to announce a 20¢ decrease in the EI 
tax. This is a major breakthrough.  It is a major concession 
because it has cost us $1.4 billion.  How can he say that this is 
negligible? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister must be out to lunch.  Today he will probably find out 
that a major union in this country is pursuing this government, 
that it is bringing the government to court over the abuse of the 
EI system in using it for the purpose of reducing the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this government seems to be encouraging further increases 
in interest rates, is it really saying to Canadians that even if 
the unemployment rate were at 8% that it is okay to have well 
over a million Canadians out of work.  It is fine with this 
Liberal government.  As long as it meets its deficit numbers it 
does not actually care whether there are more poor children, 
whether there are people out of work, or whether we have a lower 
standard of living.

been to create over one million jobs since we have taken office. 
We realize this is not enough and we want to see it go even 
further.  In terms of interest rates, Canada today as a result of 
the sound economic policies we have pursued, has the lowest 
five-year mortgage rate in history.  We have the lowest 30-year 
rate on our debt.  These are sound accomplishments on behalf of 
all Canadians.

question is to the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when 57% of the unemployed are not eligible for 
unemployment insurance, the Liberal government is reducing the deficit 
on the backs of the unemployed. Because the Liberals do not care what 
happens to the unemployed in this country, the CSN had to submit a 
petition to the Federal Court to seek an end to the government's raiding 
of the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we really reached the point where it is necessary to go to 
court so that the unemployed can receive what they are entitled to, that 
is more generous benefits? Or is the minister willing to promise that in 
the future, the surplus will benefit only the unemployed?

employment insurance reform. We feel that the reserve is absolutely 
necessary. I believe it is important that there be such a reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we came to office, when the Conservative government was in 
power, the employment insurance fund went from a surplus to a deficit of 
$6 billion. A reserve is necessary because it reduces the need to 
increase premiums in a full-blown recession.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK167">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-10, an 
act to implement a convention between Canada and Sweden, a 
convention between Canada and the Republic of Lithuania, a 
convention between Canada and the Republic of Kazakhstan, a 
convention between Canada and the Republic of Iceland and a 
convention between Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark for the 
avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion 
with respect to taxes on income and to amend the 
Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Convention Act, 1986, and the 
Canada-United States Income Tax Convention Act, 1984, be read the 
third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to speak at third reading on C-10 that implements the treaty from 
tax conventions with a number of countries such as Sweden, 
Lithuania, Denmark and Kazakhstan.  It amends tax treaties or 
conventions with the United States and the Netherlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Primarily a housekeeping bill, but a very lengthy and detailed 
one, it prevents double taxation in many cases and it works to 
prevent fiscal evasion by citizens.  For the most part, we 
support the direction of the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have major concern with part VII of the bill.  It is 
the amendment with the United States and it concerns over 80,000 
people who receive social security benefits from the U.S. but who 
reside in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening to them is unfair because it is done 
retroactively.  These problems resulted from Bill S-9 in the last 
Parliament.  Bill C-9 was layered with different taxation items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thrust of our efforts in attacking the bill focused on 
the tax loopholes for wealthy individuals and corporations. 
However, many seniors were taken off guard when they experienced 
a drastic and unanticipated reduction in their social security 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1996, as a Canadian citizen living in Canada and 
receiving U.S. social security benefits, they had to report all 
these benefits on their Canadian tax return.  Fifty per cent of 
these benefits were then deducted.  Therefore one ended up paying 
Canadian taxes on the other 50%.  The benefits however were not 
subject to any U.S. income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Bill S-9 was ratified, U.S. social security benefits were 
no longer subject to Canadian tax.  One still had to report these 
benefits as income on their Canadian tax returns, but could 
deduct the entire amount under “other deductions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convoluted calculation is done because the government still 
needs to include benefits in total income for purposes of 
calculating the GST credit, child tax benefit and the provincial 
tax credits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was bad news for pensioners was that their U.S. benefits 
were now subject to U.S. tax.  The tax was taken right off the 
top at 25.6% of the total benefit.  This tax could not be 
recovered because it is treated as non-resident withholding tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lot of legitimate protest after the passage of the 
bill because it unfairly attacked the incomes of some 80,000 
Canadians who had done their retirement planning and had based 
their livelihood on a set of rules in place when they were 
working in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protest continued for a fair amount of time.  Last April the 
government made the announcement that there would be change. 
Indeed, that change has been made in the bill which is before the 
House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, instead of the United States taking off the withholding tax 
of 25.5%, the government and the country where the citizen 
resides will be taxing the citizen on the social security 
payment, the Canadian government in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the flip side of the coin, the American government will tax 
American citizens receiving the Canada pension plan or the Quebec 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government did not do was go back to the pre-1995 
taxation level which was 50% of the social security payments. 
Instead, the government will be taxing 85% of the social security 
benefits, 85% instead of the previous 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could make the argument that in many cases this is better 
than it was a year or so ago but is still not nearly as good as 
it was prior to 1995.  This is very unfair.  This was done 
without properly consulting the people who were affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An organization called the Canadian Association of Social 
Security Seeking Equality is involved in this issue. It lobbied 
on this issue, and it was an important one, particularly in the 
Windsor area, for the election of June 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These citizens were not properly consulted.  They certainly did 
not approve the change.  For these people, the change is not 
good.  They did their planning based on the rules and then the 
rules change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that this government and its twin in the official 
opposition only push for tax reform that will benefit the very 
wealthy.  For this reason, for the reason that the bill does not 
go far enough, we will be opposing Bill C-10. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-10, an act to implement tax conventions 
between Canada and the states of Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, 
Kazakhstan, Lithuania as well as amending income tax conventions 
between Canada and the countries of the Netherlands and the 
United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party supports the agreements and the intent of this 
legislation would ratify in terms of income tax conventions 
between Lithuania, Sweden, Kazakhstan, Iceland and Denmark to 
avoid double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Progressive Conservative Party raised concerns 
earlier in the House surrounding the retroactive charges this 
legislation holds for the 1984 Canada-United States Tax 
Convention Act that was amended in 1995 by this Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts in the matter are the following.  Part VII of this 
bill is intended to uphold the promise made by the finance 
minister on April 9, 1997, a promise made during a host of 
pledges laid out by his government just days before the federal 
election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, the reaction by the affected groups to the 
announcement was extremely positive.  However, now that the 
legislation has come forward, there are still some serious 
problems that have yet to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us take a look at how the Liberals came to this 
point.  Right off the top, I want to be on the record commending 
the Liberals for admitting they made a mistake.  However, the 
Liberals, after changing the tax protocol in 1995 and setting the 
legislation effective January 1996, have now conceded they were 
wrong and are retroactively setting January 1, 1996 as the date 
effective for the current legislation, giving credence to the 
saying “if you do not succeed at first, try, try again”. 
Although they are trying, unfortunately they have 
unsatisfactorily succeeded here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed increase from 50% to 85% inclusion of social 
security benefits is ambiguous because the government has stated, 
more often than not, that under American tax protocol Americans 
are taxed at 85%.  However, that 85% is a maximum and in fact the 
majority of the people who fall under this provision are still 
taxed at a 50% inclusion rate in the United States.  In fact, on 
page 4 of the U.S. Social Security Publication 915, it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxable part of your benefits usually cannot be more than 
50%.  However, up to 85% of your benefits may be taxable, only if 
the following situation applies to you:  the total amount of 
one-half your benefits and all other income is more than $34,000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are American dollars not Canadian.  I would never suggest 
that we follow the American lead, but just for information it 
would be interesting to know what the income tax bracket 
threshold would be for people required to pay over 50%. When 
asked in committee, the officials could not give an equivocal 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this increase does not take into account that in 
the United States social security premiums are taxed when earned 
and not taxed deferred as is the CPP in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Minister of Finance has stated publicly to those 
affected that the social security aspect of the third protocol 
was revenue neutral.  If this is the case, why is the new change 
increasing the inclusion amount by 70%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I have noticed that the retroactive change would not 
cause Canadians to pay back taxes to Revenue Canada and those 
owed money would be paid dually.  For this I congratulate the 
government.  However, it is unfortunate that a consistent policy 
cannot be followed.  The reason I mention this is that recently 
caucus colleagues of mine have had calls from constituents 
involving a very similar situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation involved contract buyout packages whereby a 
mistake by the government—notice in both instances a mistake by 
the government was the cause of the problem—miscalculating 
Treasury Board's buyout of the formula caused hardships to 
thousands of Canadians.  However, unlike C-10, in this particular 
incident the people were required to pay back the money to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incident I am referring to is the forces reduction plan 
carried out by the Department of National Defence.  Why were 
people adversely affected by this defence buyout when the 
Department of Finance is capable of writing off debt?  These 
constituents were given just 30 days to make arrangements for 
payment on debts ranging anywhere from $100 up to $1,500 before 
interest started to accumulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former defence minister applied to the Treasury Board to 
have the debt remitted last January and that request was denied 
in March.  One month later, the Minister of Finance announces the 
contents of C-10 and is able to find money to retroactively pay 
these retirees. 
I realize the two instances are separate and need to be handled 
on their own merit.  However in my opinion the same standards 
should have been used for military service personnel.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party believes the avenue the finance minister has used to 
rectify the third protocol mistake he initiated two years ago is 
flawed.  These retired individuals do not deserve a 70% tax grab 
by the finance minister who, while wavering on tax cuts, seems to 
have no problem with tax hikes for retired people, as evidenced 
by Bill C-2 and Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some constituents have even commented on the fact that 15% is 
non-taxable.  These constituents have asked for the bill to 
included a minimum of 15%.  I understand it is improper to make 
any change to new legislation, but that is something the 
government should revisit in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, Bill 
C-10 makes me angry for several reasons.  First, the Liberals 
tried to convince people this was merely a technical change. They 
tried to hide the fact that it was a tax grab.  Second, the 
Liberals tried to force the bill through committee so that nobody 
would be able to recognize it as the tax grab it was before it 
was okayed in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about Mr. Farrel Mok.  He receives a disability 
pension from the United States.  He is legally blind. He has 
recently undergone a liver transplant and his medication costs 
are very high.  Prior to 1996 Mr. Mok's pension was treated as 
tax exempt, but that is no longer the case.  Under the third 
protocol there was a 25.5% tax at source.  He was totally 
unprepared for the tax grab the government quickly imposed 
without warning in the new fourth protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mok says the disability pension is his major source of 
income and he is incapable of working.  The imposition of the tax 
on his revenue has caused “tremendous hardship” as described by 
Mr. Mok.  The fourth protocol will cause even greater hardship 
since he now must include 85% of his pension in his taxable 
personal income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mok says that although his situation is bad he knows that 
others are much worse and that it will be even harder for persons 
who receive disability pensions and are residents in health care 
facilities.  These people are in danger of being forced to leave 
the facilities because they will no longer be able to afford the 
cost of the care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It basically goes to some of the tenets of what the Liberal 
Party stands for in this regard.  They are arrogant and out of 
touch.  They are elitist because they think they know better. 
When it all comes to naught and we scratch below the surface, 
they are tax and spend Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the second protocol Canada taxed about 50% of what was 
coming in, in U.S. social security benefits.  Then under the 
third protocol it was split between the two governments.  They 
both had a crack at roughly 25% of the money that was coming in. 
Now with the fourth protocol we have not only gone back to the 
process whereby Canada has full jurisdiction on this taxation so 
it can once tax 50% but the Liberals have upped it.  The Liberal 
government has upped it to 85%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxman had the whole arm of seniors.  Then that was changed 
by the third protocol and the taxman shared the arm.  The United 
States got half of it and the Canadian tax man got the other 
half.  Under the fourth protocol the Canadian taxman has the 
first part of the arm he had to begin with and the part the 
United States used to have before.  Since it has been tacked up 
to 85% he is taking an extra share of what the seniors have left. 
That demonstrates exactly what is going on with Bill C-10, the 
tax protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard people across the way say that the bill has been 
out there for two years.  There is nobody to blame for the bill 
being out there for two years but the Liberals.  Liberal tax 
increases have been out there since Confederation.  I wish people 
would finally realize what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some questions about legislation as it comes before the 
House. 
These are litmus tests which I believe can be applied to most 
legislation that comes before the House.  The first question is 
who wants it.  The 45,000 to 50,000 seniors who receive their 
social security benefits from the United States do not want an 
85% inclusion rate.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the other stakeholders.  Is it the 50,000 
people across the boarder in the United States who receive OAS 
and some of our Canada pension plan benefits?  No, they do not 
want it either.  If it affects people who collect social security 
benefits in the United States, there is a good chance that it 
will have impact on Canadians in the United States who are 
collecting some of their benefits.  That is a total of 100,000 
people who do not want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only other stakeholder in the group is the Canadian 
government, the taxman, the finance minister and the revenue 
minister.  They are the only people who want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have to ask who will pay for it.  The American 
government will not pay for it.  The Canadian government will not 
pay for it.  The people who pay taxes are the seniors who planned 
on receiving the benefit and not having it taxed at an 85% 
inclusion rate.  That is who will pay for it.  It will be on the 
backs of seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Liberals have brought in 37 tax increases.  The 
Canada pension plan increase is the 38th.  The government has a 
record of tax increases since it took office in 1993.  Once again 
the taxpayer will pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time it is particularly insidious because it is not hitting 
all taxpayers.  The government is going after a small group of 
taxpayers, 50,000 senior citizens.  They are the ones who will 
pay the bill.  Those people who have worked and helped build the 
country are being taxed at an 85% rate of inclusion when it used 
to be 50%.  The Liberals have the audacity to claim it was 
somehow a technical change and not a net tax grab.  When taxes go 
from 50% to 85% it is a huge tax grab, tax hike.  Shame on the 
Liberals for calling it a mere technical change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will slip through the cracks?  The Liberal said they would 
give a tiggly-wiggly rebate to some people.  What about the 
people who moved?  What about the people who die?  What about 
those people who were not on the government records for the 
rebate?  Those are the ones who will slip through the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals think that by putting through the legislation and 
calling it a technical tax bill somehow they will be able to pull 
the wool over the eyes of Canadians and slip this through.  My 
alternative is not to impose an 85% inclusion tax rate.  That is 
the Reform solution.  The government does not need more money. It 
spends it unwisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</b>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rob Anders:</b>  If the member across the way would like 
to engage in a debate about how poorly his government spends tax 
money, I would do it.  I raise it now because it is relevant to 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who slips through the cracks?  The 50,000 seniors are the ones 
who will get nailed by this measure.  We should be concerned 
about them and not the revenue minister or the technicalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it solve the problem it was intended to address?  What was 
the problem?  There was a complication.  Both the United States 
and Canada had joint jurisdiction in taxing social security 
benefits.  Under the second protocol Canada had a crack at 50%. 
Under the third protocol the United States and Canada both had 
relatively equal cracks at roughly 25% each.  That was complex 
and proved to be too problematic so people were calling for a 
change.  They asked for it to be taken back to the time when 
Canada had full jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Liberals agreed to do that, but rather than moving back 
to the 50% they had in the second protocol, they brought in a tax 
hike and hit everybody with 85%.  Does it solve the problem of 
the complexity?  Yes, it makes sure Canada has sole jurisdiction. 
Only the Canadian taxman, the finance minister and the revenue 
minister on the Liberal benches will get the money. 
It no longer goes to the United States.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they solve the problem by bringing in a tax hike, a 
built-in 70% top up in terms of what was coming in before as 
revenue.  It is the 37th tax increase the government has 
implemented since it took office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, if there are problems with a bill, the Liberals should 
be running with their tails between their legs, realizing this is 
a tax grab that they will be nailed for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list gets worse.  Now it comes to how much it will cost. The 
seniors affected say it will impact them to the tune of about 
$2,000 each.  It could be much more for many of them.  If we take 
that round number and multiply it by 50,000, we are talking about 
millions of dollars which the government is milking from a small 
select group of seniors.  It applies to anybody who makes more 
than $7,000 a year.  This impacts a wide spectrum of seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of those 50,000 people collecting U.S. social security benefits, 
those who make more than $7,000 per year will be impacted by the 
Liberal tax grab.  Anyone who makes beyond the basic tax 
exemption will be nailed by members across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have the audacity to claim that this is a technical tax 
hike.  It is not.  It is impacting on every person of the 50,000 
who qualify for U.S. social security benefits above the basic tax 
exemption of $7,000.  It is tough for me to imagine how one would 
be able to live on $7,000, but some seniors obviously do it. 
Government members say that anybody who makes more than $7,000 
will be taxed at an 85% rate of inclusion on their U.S. social 
security benefits.  Shame on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not have the courage to raise this issue before the 
election.  No, they dillied and they dallied.  They brought it in 
as one of their first measures after they formed the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did they bring it in right after they secured their mandate 
in an election?  Why did they raise CPP premiums?  Why did they 
do these things?  It is because they know these things are 
unpopular. It is a classic example of government reserving tax 
hike decisions until after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they were campaigning in Windsor where it will impact a lot 
of seniors I did not hear the Liberals talking about how they 
would suck tax money out of seniors who live in that neck of the 
woods.  They did not have the courage to do it.  They knew it 
would impact on votes, the bottom line for Liberals.  They left 
the decision until after the election.  Just like the CPP tax 
hike, they are bringing it in right on the heels of the election. 
They are hoping seniors will forget by the time it comes around 
to the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak on behalf of seniors in Windsor, for those people who 
are being taxed beyond the second and third protocols.  I hope 
these people remember and take it out on the Liberals in Windsor 
who did not stand up for them or talk about it previous to the 
election.  They brought it in on the heels of their mandate.  I 
hope they lose their seats for what they have done to seniors in 
Windsor and across the country who will be taxed at an 85% rate 
of inclusion, 70% higher than they were taxed under the second 
protocol.  Shame on the Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</b>  Madam Speaker, I want to 
correct the record.  The hon. member obviously does not have his 
facts correct.  The 85% inclusion policy was announced in April, 
before the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member from Essex county, just outside Windsor, it was in 
my campaign brochure for everyone to see.  They knew exactly what 
they were voting on.  I wanted to ensure my constituents knew we 
had gone to bat for them and that we had incurred a change they 
wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not only affect seniors.  It also affects disabled 
Canadians.  On average they receive $6,000.  Overall those 
earning low incomes will pay less tax under the new proposal than 
they did under the 25.5%.  Some will pay no tax.  The majority 
will be better off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rob Anders:</b>  Madam Speaker, once again I am going to 
apply that litmus test question to that Liberal MP across the way 
with the quavering voice because she knows exactly what she did 
to those seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is who wants it.  I cannot personally believe that 
she had seniors in her riding begging for an 85% inclusion rate. 
I can believe that seniors in her riding were asking for a 
simplification.  There is no way they were asking for that rate 
to be jumped from 50% to 85%.  Shame on her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a 70% jump in the rate and I bet my bottom dollar that 
not a single senior went to her office or spoke in a town hall or 
read her literature and said “by Jove, I want to see a jump in 
the rate I pay on this”. Shame on her. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</b>  Madam Speaker, with all 
due respect to the hon. member, I think he should be aware that I 
have discussed this with thousands of people in my riding.  I 
have knocked on doors and talked about the issue.  And no, no one 
would like to see it go from 50% to 85%.  However, we want to 
treat all Canadians on parity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians, especially those seniors he talked about who use 
our health care system who live in Canada, should pay their fair 
share of taxes.  An 85% inclusion rate still recognizes that 15% 
of it is not taxable.  They live in Canada and they use our 
health care system.  So their neighbours are going to pay on 100% 
of their income and they are going to pay on 85% because we are 
recognizing that they paid tax dollars on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the majority of my constituents know and believe 
they want to be treated fairly and equitably with their 
neighbours.  In case the hon. member is not aware, I have direct 
family members who are affected by this.  We have discussed this. 
They have told me they want to pay their fair share of taxes. 
They do not want special treatment. As well, some of my family 
members are going to be under the amount that will have to pay 
taxes and they do not deserve to pay taxes, disabled Canadians, 
and they will be getting their money back, and the sooner the 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The longer the Reform Party holds this up, and that is exactly 
what it is doing by delaying and delaying, these people will not 
get their cheques.  I say to the hon. members across the way 
please support this bill and get it back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rob Anders:</b>  Madam Speaker, I have just heard the 
admission I need. She made it right here in the House. She said 
no senior stood up and asked her for an 85% inclusion rate. Yet 
we have the government bringing this bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That says to me, it screams it out loud, I asked the question in 
the House but she just admitted it here, the only people who want 
it are her, the revenue minister and the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While she has consulted with seniors, and nobody asked for an 
85% inclusion rate, she stands here with pride in the House today 
and bellyaches about how she wants to see an 85% inclusion rate, 
how it is fair, but that nobody asked for it, nobody demanded it, 
nobody wanted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only people who want are this Liberal MP and some of the 
people she is defending in terms of the finance minister and the 
revenue minister.  In terms of equity, where is the equity when 
those people in the United States were putting in their tax 
money?  They were being taxed at the point of source. They were 
being taxed on putting money into this fund and now they get 
taxed again on taking it out, but this time it is by the Canadian 
government.  They got taxed by the United States going into it 
and they are getting taxed at an 85% inclusion rate by this 
government, by the Liberals, on the way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I just want to drive it home for the seniors in 
Windsor.  They said it in the House today.  Nobody asked for an 
85% inclusion rate but this government is doing it to them 
anyhow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Susan Whelan:</b>  Madam Speaker, I believe the hon. 
member has confused the record once again.  What the seniors in 
Windsor and Essex County said, and very clearly at the meetings I 
was at, is that they did not want a 25.5% withholding tax.  They 
wanted that system changed.  We told them up front that they 
cannot go back to the 50%.  We have to do something new.  We sat 
down with them and worked out the numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally the majority of the people from the case group 
thought the 85% inclusion rate was fair because it benefited low 
income and middle income seniors. The people who are going to be 
affected or are going to have perhaps higher taxes than under the 
25.5% are those who are in the upper income the hon. member 
speaks on behalf of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone in the middle or lower income under an 85% inclusion rate 
will pay little or no tax and will pay a lot less tax than under 
the 25.5% withholding tax.  We cannot go back three steps.  We 
have to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were dealing with a 25.5% withholding tax.  We have to go 
into the future and that is what we are doing.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to remind the House of the way Bill C-5 was drafted. 
The bill is the result of an initiative by users, that is, the 
co-operative sector.  It comes from people who know best what it 
takes to maintain the vitality and dynamism of the co-operative 
movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operatives sector in Canada sought a consensus among 
its members on their needs in order to survive and prosper in a 
competitive market.  This bill is the outcome of hard work and 
devotion by the members of the co-operative movement in an effort 
to modernize legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was well received by all parties at second reading. 
In addition, it received the general approval of the committee, not 
only of the witnesses appearing before it but of the members 
sitting on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has three main objectives.  The first consists in 
revitalizing the rules for managing co-operatives.  Accordingly, 
the bill gives co-operatives access to tools other businesses 
already have.  Furthermore, it simplifies the process of 
incorporation and reduces government intervention to a minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second objective is to give co-operatives access to new 
forms of financing.  For example, it authorizes them to issue 
participating stock on the stock exchanges enabling them to borrow 
on the financial market if they wish to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third objective is to reinforce the distinct character of 
co-operatives, by ensuring that only those organizations 
operating according to co-operative principles may be constituted 
as co-operatives.  The bill also reinforces the control exercised 
by members and empowers them to decide on the structure of the 
co-operative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will enable Canadian co-operatives to 
operate effectively.  It will help to stimulate investment, 
economic growth and job creation in numerous communities throughout 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operatives have been anxiously awaiting this reform. 
They have done their part.  They did all of the ground work 
themselves.  They have clearly pointed out what they wanted in this 
bill, and worked hammer and tongs to attain that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work done by the co-operatives has considerably 
facilitated the process of studying the bill. 
The effects of this can be seen in the support it has received on 
second reading and in committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry committee heard from several witnesses.  It heard 
from two national organizations representing co-operatives, the 
Canadian Co-operative Association and the Conseil canadien de 
la coopération. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, it heard from specific members of the co-operative 
sector, the Alberta Wheat Pool and the Manitoba Pool Elevators. 
Finally, it heard about the cross-country consultations on this 
initiative with grassroots members of the co-operative sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One substantive issue was raised at committee.  It concerned the 
ability of a co-operative to pay out a member who dissents on a 
proposal for a fundamental change or a change to the articles. 
Some members of the co-operative sector raised concerns that the 
right of members to dissent and be paid out could potentially 
jeopardize the capital base of a co-operative.  These concerns 
were expressed in committee by the Alberta Wheat Pool and the 
Manitoba Pool Elevators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the true spirit of co-operation, a consensus was arrived at 
within the co-operative sector itself to deal with this issue. An 
amendment was proposed to allow a co-op to set out in its 
articles a time period for payout to a dissenting member as long 
as the time period does not exceed 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment also ensures that the rights of members are 
protected by stipulating that any payout made will accumulate 
interest at rates set out in the regulations.  This amendment was 
passed in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five other amendments were passed in committee.  These were all 
technical in nature and did not raise any debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to commend the hard work done by all committee members 
from all parties to bring Bill C-5 to fruition. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be pleased to address the second amendment in a few 
minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, during 
second reading, the Bloc Quebecois expressed its agreement in 
principle with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It pointed out, in particular, certain concerns raised by the 
bill.  It is true that this bill started with a request from the 
co-operatives, but it must be kept in mind that Canadian and Quebec 
co-operatives, which, like the other co-operatives in the world, 
have to adjust to economic changes, have been involved in serious 
debate among themselves.  They are torn between wanting to be 
flexible enough for the new economy, and not straying too far away 
from co-operative principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, and this is a finding I want to report, arising out of 
the work of the committee, that the Conseil québécois des 
coopératives, which encompasses all Quebec co-operatives, agreed 
with the bill in the end, but only after negotiating and winning a 
number of points it proposed. 
At report stage, the Conseil québécois pointed out that one of the 
points on which it had not won out related to the powers of the 
general assembly of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the 
first amendment, which suddenly popped up after this lengthy 
process, which took two years, and after the end of the committee's 
work at report stage, without our having heard a word about it 
beforehand, is a new one.  It must be pointed out as well that this 
amendment diminishes the power of the general assembly of members 
and confirms the concerns I have expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the report stage, in the light of the discussions going on 
in the union movement, I said I still had some concerns about this 
bill.  The representative of the Conseil québécois des coopératives 
did not say I was wrong to have concerns.  He said he shared them, 
but that out of solidarity he would agree with his Canadian 
colleagues, pointing out that very few co-operatives in Quebec are 
federally chartered.  To my knowledge, there are only six of 2,900, 
if we count all the co-operatives and 1,650 if we count the non- 
financial ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is not insignificant.  It eliminates the use of 
general meetings to replace members who themselves were replaced by 
the board of directors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250
<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to make this a bit clearer.  When a board member 
appointed by the general meeting has to resign or be removed, one 
of two things can happen: either they wait until the next general 
meeting or they are replaced.  The bill provided that a replacement 
be found just until the next annual meeting.  The first amendment 
eliminates the “until the next annual meeting”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec law, and I checked, very specifically provides that, in 
such an instance, the vacancy is filled until the next annual 
meeting, or—to put it another way—for the remainder of the 
mandate. 
So I feel quite justified in saying that it is deplorable that, 
after this process, which must be commended, we end up reducing 
members' powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I add that, for Quebec members, the powers of the members at 
the general meeting had been reduced compared to what is provided 
in Quebec legislation, because in this attempt at modernization, 
non-members may hold capital.  Under Quebec law, these non-members 
may become board members, because they provide capital, but their 
appointment must be approved by the annual general meeting.  This 
is what the Conseil wanted in the federal legislation, but it was 
denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, not only will there be members on the board of directors 
who have not received the approval of the annual general meeting, 
but, if a member is replaced, the bill does not say it is only 
until the next annual general meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, I am strongly opposed to this amendment and 
once again I do not understand why a government that has boasted 
about giving co-operatives what they wanted shows up with this 
amendment at the last minute.  It confirms the fears I had, because 
co-operatives, of course, have to come up with the means to operate 
as best they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important sector of our economy. 
It is a sector that is exceptional for the collective ownership 
by the members, and for the corporate characteristic of putting 
longevity ahead of short term profits, through transferability, 
purchase, sale, and so forth.  It is therefore an important 
sector of the economy that needs to evolve, but it cannot do so 
by abandoning its fundamental principles.  One of these 
principles is the power of the annual general meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore oppose this first amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be speaking to the bill in general and certainly to the 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been encouraged by the whole process surrounding this 
bill, particularly by the way it was handled by the committee and 
the way the government listened to the concerns of the co-op 
members. I think the co-op sets a good example for all of us. The 
whole co-op structure is based on accountability to the members. 
That is part of the reason why the whole process works so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed to the bill and the total bill really 
were birthed out of concerns of the co-op management and members. 
The co-operatives recognized there was a need for change. They 
are in an increasingly competitive environment.  They realized if 
they did not make some changes their viability was at risk for 
the long term.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They realized they were competing against larger entities with 
smaller management hierarchies and less bureaucracy.  They 
realized they had to be more customer focused and more efficient. 
They realized that some investment dollars were needed in order 
to sustain them for the long term. I thought it was interesting 
that this realization caused them to actually bring forward the 
legislation in this bill, even to the point in our committee of 
fine tuning some of the amendments that we have here, to make 
sure there was not one thing that was not addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments here today were not something that the 
government so much brought forward as the members of the 
co-operatives themselves did.  The management of the 
co-operatives brought them on themselves.  This shows the 
accountability back to the members and that the government is 
listening to the needs of this industry and this group worked in 
this case.  It was quite encouraging to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to see as a take-out of this whole endeavour 
is the lessons learned on the positive side.  I encourage the 
government also to deal with some of the realities that Canadians 
are faced with and look at the model in this bill:  a 
responsiveness to membership, a responsiveness to the people that 
put the directors of the co-operatives in place and the people 
that put us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns as I look at this bill and I compare it to what 
I see us in the House and the government doing. We talk about the 
fact that there is no deficit outstanding, we are hoping, yet we 
are sitting on a $600 billion debt and we see interest rates 
threatening to creep up on us.  We are sitting on an interest 
rate time bomb.  We pay $45 billion a year in interest. I was 
doing a calculation on this and that is enough money to put four 
million young people through a four year degree program at 
university.  That is a lot of money and we pay that in interest 
every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all realities Canadians have to face. When I look at 
the co-operative situation and I look at what is happening in our 
government, I do not see the same kind of responsiveness here in 
the House of Commons. When I look at the throne speech with 29 
new spending initiatives and we have that reality as far as the 
debt and the interest goes, it just does not line up for me and I 
do not think it lines up for a lot of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking for us to deal with the realities that are 
needed in Canada today.  Less government, not more. The 
co-operatives have demonstrated this in the management of their 
own operations.  We do not seem to be able to do it in this 
House.  We need to consider allowing Canadians to be heard the 
same way that members of the co-operatives were, to allow this 
government to encourage an environment where Canadians can plan 
for their future like the co-operatives have planned for theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we do not seem to be listening here and a 
lot of Canadians are pretty frustrated about that.  What we get 
instead is what I have heard on and off in the debate in this 
House in the last couple of days and actually over the last 
several weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a plan for the CPP that is going to bail it out they 
say, but it has been there for 30 years and 30 years of 
government management has left a $560 billion unfunded liability. 
The money that goes in at one end pays for those who receive it 
at the other. There really is no equity there to draw from, even 
though we have been paying into it for 30 years. There was a 
study done in <I>Maclean's</I> not long ago that 66% of Canadians 
do not believe it will be there for them when it comes time for 
them to collect.  This is pretty tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of listening to some of the proposals we put forward and 
some of the other strategies that are out there in the world that 
have bailed out government funded pension plans and that are 
working, the government's answer is to increase the premiums by 
73%.  It will keep grinding the old engine hoping it is going to 
work one day.  The fact is that it has not for 30 years and it is 
very unlikely it will go forward.  Ten percent of every 
Canadian's paycheque is going to be going into a plan that has 
not worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is equally tragic about this whole thing is that we are not 
listening.  The government is not listening to the people, 
especially when we consider that youth unemployment is sitting at 
16.5% to 17%. 
Here is our answer.  We are going to hike up payroll taxes.  We 
are going to hike up CPP.  It is a mistake on the government's 
part.  It will hurt the youth of this nation more than we can 
fully comprehend.  They are the people who are keen to get out 
and apply their skills and energy.  If that is cut off it will 
have negative reverberations in our country for years to come. 
The hope of our youth is being crushed with high payroll taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In hoping to make us feel better about it, the government 
introduced a CPP investment board to manage the funds.  Many of 
us have seen the results of government appointed boards.  It is 
more of a concern than a consolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians really want is something like the co-operatives 
are doing.  They want the ability to manage their own affairs. 
They want to manage their own money.  We should remember that it 
is, in fact, their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could do it successfully.  Many people have their own 
investment plans, their own pension plans, which are available in 
other countries.  Those plans have worked three to four times 
better than what we are seeing in government-run plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would give Canadians a chance to plan for their future, 
just like the co-operatives are attempting to do.  They are 
planning for their future in a very competitive marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing the co-operatives did with this very 
interesting bill and these amendments.  They looked for a way to 
protect themselves and to survive for the long term.  That seems 
to be very wise in this day and age.  Canadians want to have the 
same opportunity to protect themselves and to establish security 
for their families in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon government, particularly the Government of 
Canada, to do all it can to move that along.  However, the 
government is holding it up.  It continually says that is what it 
wants to do, but we are over-governed, we have a debt and 
interest problem, we have the highest tax to GDP ratio of all the 
G-7 countries.  Twenty-nine new spending initiatives were 
announced, even in the face of that.  CPP has been increased 10%. 
We have another government appointed board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are not the answers that Canadians are looking for.  We do 
not need more bricks on the load, we need relief, especially in 
the face of youth unemployment at 16.5% and using the EI surplus 
to pay down the debt and balance the budget. These are not the 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some hope.  The hope is that the government was able to 
listen to the co-operatives and is responding to the needs of the 
co-operatives.  That tells me that there is a ray of hope here. 
When government is ready to listen and frees itself from 
political patronage and influence and concerns itself with where 
Canadians are at, there is hope. The co-operatives are allowed to 
plan for their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this bill, not only for what it does for the 
co-operatives but for what it represents.  It represents the kind 
of approach to government that is responsive to the voters and 
will bring about resolutions and improvements to serve the needs 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take this simple bill and use it as an example— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Churchill River. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
stand on behalf of my party to support Bill C-5, as amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments up to now, until the recent amendment which was 
moved quickly, were consistent with the co-operative way of doing 
business.  The co-operative movement during consultations was 
challenged to support the bill as it was drafted, as well as the 
amendments.  It went two rounds in the co-operative sector before 
it went one round in the federal sector.  That shows great 
respect for the co-operative movement. 
These amendments seem to be all but technical issues.  The 
co-operative sector actively discussed the amendments as did 
officials from Industry Canada, the co-op secretariat of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and there was a representation 
from the co-op of national organizations.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the position that the co-op sector has had in 
its gatherings as representatives, this bill seems to be a great 
step for our country.  I would like to talk to the whole 
co-operative movement about how it will deal in light of the 
increasingly globalized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many federated co-op activities in Canada in areas 
related to fuel and food and many other items that meet the basic 
economic needs of people in this country.  There is one key 
phrase among these items, “Truly Canadian”.  That is probably 
the most powerful message of the co-operative movement.  That is 
a unity message for us.  Even our fellow representatives from 
Quebec showed support for a co-operative movement in their 
provinces.  That co-op supports the idea that people should 
combine their efforts, their resources and their visions in an 
effort to create and support our economy.  An entrepreneur from 
downtown New York would never imagine helping someone in small 
town Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Arctic co-ops shine.  They are groups of 
partisans and craftsmen who have gathered their crafts and their 
marketing skills and have shown the world that as Inuit artists 
they could not do it singlehandedly.  An individual could not 
create the energy or the economy or the resources, but many 
individuals could create collectively.  As a collective the Inuit 
artists can be seen as a spotlight of this nation throughout the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the House's attention to some of the experiences the 
co-ops have created in this country.  In my neck of the woods, 
the Boreal Forest, the fur industry was a major activity.  It was 
handled through Hudson's Bay and the Rupert's Land agreements of 
the British North America Act.  All of a sudden the fur trade 
began to wither away.  Nobody represented the trappers.  All of a 
sudden their whole economy was falling apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fur marketing board started up in northern Saskatchewan and 
the province of Saskatchewan through the CCF movement saw the 
light that could empower the people to market their own product.

co-operatives, as reported (with amendments) from the committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have heard stories from my parents and grandparents about the fur 
trade and the creation of a co-operative movement to try to 
market their furs.  Unfortunately, we lived in the backwoods of 
the Churchill River, far removed from the garment makers in 
Montreal.  In those days it was way beyond anyone's means to 
transport or communicate in order to co-operatively market and 
envision ourselves as a world leader in garment development in 
fur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operatives have taken on challenges.  They have made 
mistakes by trying to develop economies through a collective 
effort in the communities.  We cannot blame them for that because 
the effort was worth it.  Individual markets and the 
globalization of multinationals who take out of our markets and 
economies is probably our nation's biggest fear.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the success of the agricultural co-ops, the pools in 
marketing their grains and agricultural products worldwide.  It 
is a major success.  We have a wealth of resources in this 
country, resources in our people and our ideas.  We have our 
timber, mining, water and other natural resources and 
non-renewable resources, all living resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like members to pay attention when they go to the 
parliamentary restaurant and turn to the right as they enter. 
They will see a picture highlighting the capital of this nation 
and its pyramid load is on the land, the resources, the timber, 
mining and fish.  That image should be drawn up in a co-operative 
measure as how to go forward into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the crown corporations.  We have been selling off our 
railroads to American interests.  All of a sudden Omnitrax owns 
major tracks of railroads in western Canada.  Why did we not give 
the first option to Canadians?  Maybe a Canadian co-operative 
could have taken up the transportation sector.  Why not challenge 
ourselves in a co-operative perspective and give the first option 
to truly Canadian people as opposed to outside offshore 
interests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to speak on behalf of all the New Democrats and 
support this growing process of the co-operative movement in our 
nation.  I encourage all Canadians to support their co-operatives 
in their regions.  We must keep the process of negotiating these 
bills and amendments by taking it to the co-operative leaders and 
representatives and let them design and structure the necessary 
bills and legislation to come before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment which came in late, unfortunately may have missed 
the opportunity.  However, I think it is truly a technical 
oversight on the part of legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, there are issues on the multilateral agreement on 
investment that will impinge on our national ability to improve 
the economy and the strength of our Canadian companies because 
outside interests can actually test the favouritism of our 
Canadian corporations and co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties have united in supporting the co-operatives bill. We 
are looking to the government and the collection of all 
representatives of Canada to see the co-operatives flourish in 
this nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</b> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-5, an act representing co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's history respecting co-operatives dates back to the 
mid-1800s with the formation of the Farmers' Mutual Fire 
Insurance Company. This was a result of the recognition by 
farmers that they too could have the same security in producing 
and marketing their products as seen by successful large 
businesses. The farmers decided to band together to gain better 
control over the marketing of their products and purchases. This 
was the birth of co-operatives in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party is pleased to support this legislation. Let me 
highlight some of the main characteristics of Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 redefines and widens the definition of co-operative 
basis. The principles of co-operative basis date back to 1844 and 
were set out by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in 
England.  These principles formed the basis of most Canadian 
provincial legislation for over 50 years before they were adopted 
by the federal government in the Co-operative Associations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new definition under Bill C-5 is in keeping with the 1995 
statement on co-operative identity issued by the International 
Co-operatives Alliance and sets the tone for all proposed changes 
to the act.  The new definition includes the principle of open 
membership. 
There is also some flexibility added to the one member, one vote 
principle with regard to delegate voting.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore the principle of member funded investment is 
expanded under Bill C-5 in order to provide for co-ops issuing 
investment shares.  The principle of using surplus funds to 
extend the operation of co-operative enterprises is also added. 
Finally, the principle of education is included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 makes changes to the rules governing incorporation.  It 
permits co-operatives to incorporate provided they operate on a 
co-operative basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act currently requires a memorandum of association for the 
granting of incorporation status.  This memorandum is submitted 
to the minister.  He then decides, provided the application meets 
all technical requirements and conditions, to either grant or 
deny the right of incorporation.  This paternalistic approach 
works against the co-operative philosophy of group decision 
making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-5 they will be acting under the same principles of 
the Business Corporations Act of incorporation as a right and not 
at the discretion of the crown.  The proposed system is simpler 
and would streamline the administrative practices.  This would 
also reduce the costs currently associated with incorporation for 
all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 introduces the concept of natural person when 
describing co-operatives.  As a result, they are awarded the same 
rights and privileges of a natural person.  This is instead of 
detailing the various rights, powers and privileges individually. 
It is also in keeping with the same rights now awarded to 
business corporations and mirrors the powers some provinces 
already offer co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Record keeping under Bill C-5 is simplified and streamlined. 
This again is in keeping with similar rules found in the Business 
Corporations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 simplifies the rules governing amalgamations with other 
co-operatives or corporations.  For instance, Bill C-5 will allow 
provincial co-operatives to merge with federal co-operatives 
provided that the end result is a federal co-op. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, co-operatives will have similar rights to those of 
business corporations under the Canada Business Corporations Act. 
When applying for an arrangement, the courts will have the power 
to order an arrangement or reorganization and not the crown. This 
is a change from the current situation where members apply 
directly to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 also includes provisions specifically for worker and 
housing co-operatives.  Currently they are governed under general 
rules in the existing act.  The industry has identified several 
gaps in the current legislation which does not address the needs 
of these two types of co-operatives.  Bill C-5 attempts to 
resolve this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am pleased to support Bill C-5.  I believe that 
it will benefit co-operatives and in turn, millions of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, because I sit on 
the industry committee, which considered this bill, and 
particularly because I am the member for Lévis, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Why Lévis?” you may ask.  As all Quebeckers know, Lévis is 
the cradle of the Mouvement Desjardins.  The first Caisse populaire 
Desjardins was founded on December 6, in 1900 I think.  The 
centenary is coming up.  Over four million Quebeckers belong to the 
Mouvement Desjardins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Eugène Bellemare:</b> And Ontarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</b> And Ontarians.  The member for 
Carleton—Gloucester, who is involved in this movement, also 
recognizes the importance of co-operatives for the survival of 
the French language.  It played a large role in the survival, and 
I do mean survival, of the French language throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lévis is the site of the Conseil de coopération du Québec.  It 
is also the site of the headquarters of the Federation des 
coopératives en alimentation du Québec.  There are several other 
federations, service co-operatives, including the federation 
interested in social economy, with headquarters in Lévis.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that, with the presence of the Mouvement 
Desjardins and the 2,000 employees working at the headquarters of 
the various Mouvement Desjardins institutions, Lévis can lay claim 
to being the co-operative capital of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for this riding, I therefore have no choice but 
to speak to this bill.  One aspect that struck me in committee, 
because we are at report stage, was that, as the member for 
Carleton—Gloucester mentioned, there is what I would describe as 
a remarkable climate of co-operation among committee members, 
thanks to those influenced by representatives of the co-operative 
movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two large groups of co-operatives in Canada. 
There is the Conseil canadien de la coopération, which covers the 
francophone community and which has representatives in all the provinces 
of Canada except Newfoundland. There is also an equivalent organization 
for the anglophone community across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we noted, and I also want the House to know this, is that the 
representatives of these two councils appeared together, side by side, 
before the committee. They came to testify and to submit their briefs 
while pursuing the same objectives. They showed solidarity, and I 
concluded that it would be possible, with people who have an open mind, 
to work co-operatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Carleton—Gloucester might not like what I am 
saying, but this is proof of the value of the idea that the Bloc 
Quebecois and the sovereignists of Quebec are proposing to all of 
Canada, that is an open hand. 
It would be possible to have a partnership that would be useful for 
everyone if each of the parties made the effort and if they were 
confident in the efficacy of such a process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that when people co-operate, francophones 
and anglophones, they discuss on an equal footing. We have always 
insisted on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I wanted to take this opportunity to point out this example of 
co-operation that these people are providing us. I consider it 
unfortunate, at this stage, that there were two amendments introduced 
this morning, especially Motion No. 1, which limits the role of board 
members in relation to what can be decided at a meeting, as the member 
for Mercier clearly explained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for that, the Bloc Quebecois reiterates that it supports the 
bill. We supported all the amendments that were proposed and the points 
of view provided by the witnesses who appeared before us. 
So we will continue to show co-operation by voting in favour of the bill 
at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the GST was introduced in 1990 under the Conservative 
government of Brian Mulroney and implemented in 1991 the people 
of Canada have been subjected to a 7% tax on all reading 
material.  That includes books, children's books, magazines 
whether at the news stand or by subscription, and newspapers.  In 
fact all reading material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is the first federal tax on reading in Canada's history. 
Provinces have never taxed books.  Every time someone opens their 
wallet to buy a magazine or a novel they pay an extra 7¢ on the 
dollar to the federal government.  Post-secondary students who 
buy their own books must pay tax.  Literacy learners who mostly 
buy their own materials must pay tax.  Tutors in literacy are 
also affected.  Canadians purchasing books for self-health 
purposes and to further their knowledge must pay tax. Parents who 
buy their children books must pay tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize there are GST credits and other educational credits 
for students, but these do not make up for the fact that we tax 
textbooks.  We are talking about a tax burden on a fundamental 
activity which people the world over take part in and benefit 
profoundly from, reading, something very simple, something very 
intimate when shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour of attending the public readings of the 
governor general literary award winners last week.  It was a very 
special event to be involved in a public reading.  We all know 
reading is something quiet and restorative.  It helps us to 
connect with ourselves and link up the outside with our inner 
selves.  It is a healthy, nurturing and calming pastime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike our national sport, fights never break out in groups of 
readers.  Reading is educational, sustainable, non-polluting and 
non-violent, an A1 activity.  Yet we are being taxed by the 
federal government for the privilege of engaging in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even go so far as to put forward the radical idea that 
reading is an important cornerstone of the country's culture.  If 
writing is so then reading must also be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1960 the O'Leary royal commission asserted that magazines and 
newspapers were the most important publications in creating a 
Canadian culture and sense of identity: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far as the written word is concerned it is left largely to our 
periodical press, to our magazines, big and little, to make a 
conscious appeal to the nation to try to interpret Canada to all 
Canadians, to bring a sense of oneness to our scattered 
communities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not have to be reading a 400-page novel by Jane 
Urquhart or David Adams Richards.  One can be enjoying a 
favourite column in the newspaper or the weekend funnies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My children still love to pour over magazines which advertise 
toys at Christmastime, reading every word about the toys they are 
interested in over and over and over so that they can conjure up 
a perfect picture in their minds of how wonderful that toy will 
be when they finally see it under the Christmas tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Magazines and newspapers are the reading material of choice for 
young Canadians and new learners.  For someone young or old 
trying to crack the barrier between the non-reading and the 
reading world, magazines provide a colourful, picture filled 
non-threatening and potentially successful journey into the world 
of print. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading is thankfully something which Canadians continue to 
engage in despite the barrage of audio visual images coming at us 
at all hours of the day and night.  Reading, however, like many 
other good things in our cultural and physical environment is 
somewhat on the endangered list and not helped along in the least 
by the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a very high illiteracy rate.  One if five Canadians 
tested in a recent international literacy survey could not 
understand the label on a bottle of aspirin well enough to know 
the safe dosage.  When provided with a nutritional analysis, only 
one out of four Canadians could calculate the percentage of 
calories that came from fat in a Big Mac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 12, 1997 the <I>Globe and Mail</I> quoted the 
Minister of Finance as saying:  “I can't see how taking the tax 
off books is going to stimulate literacy”.  The Minister of 
Finance continues to contend that literacy is not a financial 
issue and therefore, I guess, somehow not his responsibility.

Coalition's ongoing campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to take him through it step by step.  The GST makes 
reading material more expensive.  Reading is the foundation of 
literacy so literacy in this case is entirely the responsibility 
of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the best way to promote literacy is to ensure no 
obstacles are in the way of those who are trying to achieve it. 
Anything that makes books more expensive, for example a 7% 
federal tax, is certainly a large obstacle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An international survey done in 1996 found that 97% of Canadians 
who achieved the highest literacy levels had more than 25 books 
in their homes.  Only 50% of those in the lowest literacy levels 
had more than 25 books in their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST prices reading materials out of reach of low income 
Canadians.  It is truly regressive for that reason.  Relatively 
speaking, lower income Canadians spend a larger amount of their 
income on reading materials than those of higher income 
Canadians.  The government's own data say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the Minister of Finance care if we are a nation of 
bookworms?  After all, it is the age of the Internet and 
computers.  Why not toss out the idea of reading along with the 
time honoured belief in universal health care and pension plans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we want to be literate?  Because it is good for business. 
Britain, Japan, Australia, Ireland and the United States do not 
tax books.  They know that strong literacy skills are essential 
in the modern workforce.  Strong literacy skills are even more 
essential in this technologically driven era.  Bear in mind, one 
has to be able to read to use the Internet.  Canada's ability to 
train and redeploy its workforce to compete internationally is 
hindered by inadequate literacy skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Joyce Fairbairn opened an international policy 
conference on adult literacy in November, saying on behalf of the 
Minister for Human Resources and Development: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A highly skilled literate workforce is crucial to a strong and 
internationally competitive economy as industrialized countries 
around the world fight to maintain and expand their share of high

</I></B></P><P align=left>Decision and policy makers have to take literacy seriously 
because the information society and the global economy require

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's new jobs require highly literate workers.  Literate 
adults and senior citizens will be far better equipped to 
maintain their independence and quality of life in the future, 
thus lessening the need for social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The percentage of unemployment decreases as the literacy level 
decreases.  The Minister of Finance and his government should 
surely be interested in these facts.  He should also be 
interested in the stunning impact the GST has had on the Canadian 
publishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the first three months the GST was introduced, book sales 
dropped by 14% and the market has never really recovered. The 
used book trade has dropped even more sharply from 15% to 20%. 
Magazine sales are down 15%.  Newspaper circulation is down 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the most recent recession of the early 1980s and every 
previous recession in Canadian history sales of reading materials 
have increased but not this time.  It is astounding to think of 
the revenues that have been lost because of this regressive tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Writers' royalty earnings dropped significantly due to the 
imposition of the GST.  We should think of the legions of 
artists, printers, book sellers and publishers who are no longer 
working because of the plummeting fate of the publishing 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Ireland, incidentally, tried a tax on books 10 
years ago and withdrew it after six months because it was having 
such a negative impact on sales, but not our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the astounding economics of book publishing. The 
authors of children's books currently gets 5% royalties on the 
sales of their creations.  The government gets 7% in tax.  Yes, 
the government is earning more than the writer while the 
publishing houses continue to tread water with the odd infusion 
of funds from a beneficent government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on the magazine industry with the imposition of the 
tax has been profound as well. 
Many consumers simply would not remit the GST on their 
subscription renewals.  Magazine publishers have had to remit the 
7% even if they have not collected it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this reminds me of a story in Jewish folklore found in a 
letter to the editor of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> from a 
Charlottetown reader.  It is about a mythical town of fools.  In 
one story the citizens of the town discover that a storm has left 
a wide crater in the middle of their main street and they fear 
that passers-by will fall in and break their legs. After much 
discussion they decide not to fill the hole but to build a 
hospital beside it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than removing the GST from the sale of books Ottawa is 
throwing life rafts to the publishing industry and the Canadian 
literacy program.  What we need to do is empower the consumer. 
Take the 7% stranglehold off the book marketplace and then the 
demands for and sales of books will rise.  That is what is really 
needed to benefit the publishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finance claims that the general public has become accustomed to 
GST on magazines and books.  But the Don't Tax Reading Coalition 
to this day gets hundreds of phone calls, letters and petitions 
complaining about the GST.  People hate the principle of paying 
tax on reading. Books are for learning and improving.  They are 
not cash cows. Eighty-three per cent of Canadians are on record 
as opposing a tax on reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Minister of Finance that it is time he filled that 
hole caused by the devastating tax on books.  It is time to do 
the right thing, do what the Liberals promised before the 1993 
election at a policy conference chaired by the Minister of 
Finance.  As well during the election and after the 1993 election 
the Liberals promised to reaffirm the historic principles 
embodied in the tax free status of the printed word and remove 
the GST from reading materials.  The prime minister said so 
himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the government has tried to reduce the impact 
of GST on books by offering tax rebates to municipalities, 
schools and qualifying literary organizations, but these rebates 
are only for institutions.  What about the individual consumer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxing books deals a crippling blow to our fight against 
illiteracy.  If want to be a country that reads, then we must 
eliminate the tax on books.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I believe it is time we tackled the problem of 
literacy in our country by taking the tax off the printed word. 
It is time we took the tax off our country's imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to put forward a request for unanimous 
of the House to make this motion votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b>   No.

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, the government is firmly 
committed to supporting literacy. The question has always been 
how can we do this without jeopardizing the hard won progress 
that we have made in getting the nation's finances in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that any measures taken must be effective and 
in fact fiscally responsible.  That is why the government has 
introduced an initiative that rebates 100% of the GST paid on 
books to public libraries, schools, universities, colleges and 
other bodies which promote literacy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that there is no GST on any books distributed freely 
for use in primary or secondary schools or other educational 
settings.  This also results in tax relief on books, not only for 
structured learning in our schools and colleges but also for life 
long learning through public libraries and front line literacy 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST rebate on books recognizes the important role played by 
educational institutions and community groups in helping 
individuals get the tools they need to learn how to read.  In 
addition, it is an efficient and responsible investment. 
Targeting assistance for front line literacy groups will 
certainly ensure a greater impact for every dollar of 
expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special rebate complements government initiatives announced 
in the 1997 budget to support learning and education in Canada. 
And this year funding to the National Literacy Secretariat will 
rise by 30% to $30.3 million, creating more opportunities for 
individuals to improve their literacy and communication skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For students the education credit has been increased to 
recognize the non-tuition costs of schooling and the tuition 
credit has been expanded to cover not only tuition fees but also 
mandatory fees imposed by post-secondary institutions for 
educational purposes. In addition, students are now able to carry 
forward any unused tuition and education credits to be applied to 
future income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the annual contribution limit for registered education 
savings plans has been doubled and parents are now able to 
transfer that unused RESP into their registered retirement 
savings plan. Furthermore, the Canada Council provides support to 
Canadian authors and assistance is available to Canadian 
publishers through the Department of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of ways that the government has taken on the 
initiative of literacy and is ensuring that the expenditures 
being made are targeted to front line literacy groups so that we 
can ensure that individuals who are most in need of literacy 
assistance will get it through the tax and rebate that we have 
provided through the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite clearly the government does not claim that targeted tax 
relief will answer all the challenges that we face with respect 
to literacy and education.  However, we are certainly convinced 
that these measures will go a long toward supporting efforts to 
improve literacy levels in communities across Canada. The Prime 
Minister, the Minister of Finance and all members of the House 
are committed to ensuring that literacy is a priority for the 
government.  It is a priority which is reflected when we speak 
with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the agreement in the House is perhaps how we will 
achieve the goal of increasing literacy in this country. We feel 
we have balanced that approach through our tax expenditure and 
will continue on that track to ensure that Canadians are well 
served by the expenditures the government makes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in the House to speak on Motion No. 93, which 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of increasing literacy in Canada by 
removing the goods and services tax on all reading materials. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the member for Dartmouth for presenting this motion. 
My constituency of Edmonton—Strathcona is home to the University 
of Alberta, an institution that is poised to become one of the 
finest in Canada.  So I can appreciate how important it is to 
address the question of taxes on reading materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I even support the argument presented by the hon. 
member that the GST on books and other reading material works to 
discourage reading. As the cost of books and reading materials 
goes up, the demand goes down. That is the irrefutable law of 
supply and demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised to learn, however, that the member from the New 
Democratic Party has embraced such an important free market 
concept.  I wait eagerly for the day when the NDP caucus stands 
in solidarity in the House and declares that taxes kill jobs. It 
will be a great day for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the heart of the motion is the claim that taxes can create 
perverse incentives.  In this case it is argued that taxes on 
books discourage people from purchasing books. This was not the 
intended purpose of the tax but the unintended and unseen 
consequences of the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This argument is completely valid and it is an argument that has 
been made throughout history by many great scholars. It was an 
argument made by 17th century satirist Frederick Bastiat in 
his classic essay <I>What is Seen, What is Not Seen</I>, and it 
is an argument that is being made today by Nobel prize winning 
economists like James Buchannan and others.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find curious, however, is that while the members of the 
New Democratic Party understand the principle of supply and 
demand when it applies to books, they do not understand this 
principle in other applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, when Reform argues that increases to the CPP 
contributions are a tax on jobs, the members of the NDP seem 
confused.  However, when the cost of labour goes up, demand for 
that labour goes down.  Taxes kill jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the cost of books goes up, the demand goes down.  It is a 
very simple law of economics that has been proven over the course 
of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me provide the House with another example.  The Liberal 
government taxes consumption at 15%.  That means that when we 
spend our money we are now paying about 15% in taxes on average. 
When we save our money we are taxed at 54%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of the perverse incentives which taxes 
can create.  The incentive in this case is not to save.  With the 
state of our CPP, encouraging Canadians not to save is a very bad 
idea, and yet I have heard so many individuals on the ideological 
left claiming that RRSP tax exemptions should be eliminated 
because they are a tax avoidance measure employed by the wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the question of capital gains tax.  This is a tax 
on productivity.  When people are taxed for creating wealth, 
disincentives are created for productivity.  Yet those on the 
ideological left are often heard calling for a higher capital 
gains tax.  That is a recipe for economic stagnation and 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on.  For every tax and government regulation 
created there is an unseen and unintended consequence. Overtaxed 
cigarettes and liquor create underground, illegal black market 
industries.  Increased payroll taxes create unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simple.  Big government is the very source of our economic 
problems and not the source of the solutions.  Big government is 
a disease masquerading as its own cure.  I wish the NDP could 
come to appreciate this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all that, I regret that neither I nor the members of 
my caucus can support the motion.  Reformers believe in tax cuts 
and we hate the dreaded GST, but it is our position that tax cuts 
should be broad based so that one product or one industry is not 
given preferential treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sceptical of the merit of eliminating taxes on certain 
products or even on certain industries while neglecting other 
products or industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We subsidize Canadian book publishers to the tune of almost $20 
million.  Now the Liberals are adding another $15 million to this 
subsidy in the interests of promoting Canadian culture.  A GST 
tax exemption would add to this preferential treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get me wrong.  Canadian businesses are overtaxed. 
Canadian consumers are overtaxed.  However, a fair tax system is 
one which provides for broad based tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian business makes the claim that its product or 
industry makes a vital contribution to Canadian society and 
should be granted certain tax concessions.  I am very sympathetic 
to this claim.  Canadian businesses are overtaxed and they are 
looking for any way to get out from under the thumb of the 
federal government, but we must be extremely careful when we 
create tax concessions which give certain industries preferential 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from the NDP will very likely point out the 
many preferential tax concessions which are currently in place, 
but I would counter that by promising that a Reform government 
will implement a more simplified tax system which will be built 
on the principles of equality and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all this, I am not convinced that GST on books is 
affecting literacy in Canada.  Access to literature through 
public libraries and public schools ensures that those who wish 
to have access to books can do so.  However, I would agree that 
access to the latest information may be hampered as universities 
and public schools try to find money in their budgets.  But this 
is not a threat to literacy in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the frustration which the hon. member feels for 
this issue.  The Liberals broke their promise to scrap the GST as 
it applies to books.  The Reform Party has criticized the 
government's lack of accountability in this House. Campaigning 
promises should be kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the member of the NDP in so far as she is bringing 
the question of accountability to the attention of this House. We 
cannot, however, support the motion for the reasons I have 
already stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I applaud the hon. member for the NDP for her clear 
economic thinking and for bringing the issue of accountability to 
this House.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of increasing literacy in Canada by 
removing the goods and services tax on all reading materials.

The Bloc Quebecois is therefore pleased to support this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with a little semantics, to be clear on the scope of 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In French, literacy translates as knowing how to read and write, or 
the ability to understand and decode information to give it meaning. 
Illiterate persons are those who do not know this code. Without this 
code, they do not have the capacity to read or write, let alone the 
knowledge to do so. Functional illiterates know the code but experience 
various degrees of difficulty in understanding, using or interpreting it 
to give it meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, it is inappropriate to translate literacy by 
“alphabétisme”. But semantics is not the topic of my remarks today, so 
I will stick to the text of the motion as it stands. 
Let us move to the topic of the motion asking that the government remove 
the GST on all reading materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has been repeating ad nauseam that Canada is 
the best country in the world. According to the government, illiteracy 
is not a problem in Canada. Just look at the mind-boggling statistic 
quoted in the 1997 edition of <I>L'État du monde</I>: the literacy rate in 
Canada is estimated at 104%. Let us take a closer look at this statistic 
which seems mind-boggling at first glance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will refer to <I>Reading the Future: a Portrait of Literacy in 
Canada</I>, a document published jointly by Statistics Canada, the 
Department of Human Resources Development and the National Literacy 
Secretariat in 1996. This document is based on the International Adult 
Literacy Survey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a chart illustrating the various levels of reading ability among 
adults aged 16 to 65, Canada's rate is 101% for the category 
“comprehension of narrative texts”. Does this means that every Canadian 
knows how to read and write? Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, out of this 101%, 17% of the population only reach the 
first level of reading. At this level, a person can read the directives 
on a bottle of aspirin. Twenty-six per cent are at the second level. At 
this level, a person can read, in an article, a short sequence of 
information on the characteristics of a garden plant. Thirty-five per 
cent are at the third level of reading. At this level, a person can read 
movie reviews and select the least favourable one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, 23% of the population reach levels 4 and 5. 
At these levels, people can read information on leaflets and integrate 
them in an interview, or they can use an advertisement from the 
Department of Human Resources Development to answer questions that use 
different words from the ones in the add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The percentages are similar for the other two categories that were 
part of the test to evaluate reading ability, namely comprehension of 
schematic texts and comprehension of texts with a quantitative content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Adult Literacy Survey defines literacy as the 
ability to use printed matter and written information to function in 
society, reach one's objectives, improve one's knowledge and increase 
one's potential. 
The survey shows that an impressive number of Canadian adults have a 
very low level of reading ability, which prevents them from fully 
participating in Canada's economic and social life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The survey also shows that the availability of reading material is 
the primary factor in maintaining people's ability to read and 
understand. A country whose people read less than those of another 
country will be less productive and less competitive. This brings us to 
the purpose of the motion, which is to remove the GST on all reading 
materials.

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the International Association of Publishers, Canada is 
the G-7 country that imposes the highest taxes on reading material. In 
Canada, the tax is imposed only by the federal government. The United 
States, Japan, England, Australia and Ireland are among the countries 
that realized the importance of not taxing books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax has had a very negative impact. Sales of new books dropped 
by 10%, those of used books by 15% to 20%, and those of magazines by 
15%. Newspapers' sales dropped by 5%, the first drop in 20 years in that 
sector. These combined drops have hurt publishers and writers, as their 
income also dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the GST on reading material would have such an impact 
was anticipated. Anyone in the country who wants to buy reading material 
must pay a tax. Students who want to buy books must pay taxes. 
Functionally illiterate people who want to learn to read must pay a tax. 
Parents who want to buy books for their children must pay a tax. People 
who want to improve their knowledge and learn new things must pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have something to tell members opposite. I am thinking of a word 
which I cannot use in this House, because they would jump up from their 
seats. Still, I have that word in mind to describe their attitude and 
their behaviour regarding the GST on books. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At their 1992 convention, the Liberals adopted a resolution whereby 
they pledged to abolish the GST on books and reading material. 
In 1993, in a letter to the Don't Tax Reading Coalition, the Prime 
Minister promised to implement his party's resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House of what some of our friends 
across the way said when they were in opposition and the 
Conservative government wanted to pass the GST bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1990, the Deputy Prime Minister claimed that 
charging the GST on books was akin to promoting ignorance.  In 
1991, the Minister of Canadian Heritage said that it was harmful to 
Canadian unity and identity.  In 1990, the Minister of Industry 
gave a 20-minute speech explaining in great detail why he was 
opposed to the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1990, the member for Ottawa Centre tabled a pile 
of petitions against the GST.  The parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Transport tabled four petitions against the GST. 
The government leader tabled a petition against taxing books and cared 
about the functionally illiterate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible 
for Francophonie tabled a petition against taxing books and magazines. 
The member for Carleton—Gloucester also tabled a petition, saying it 
was outrageous to tax newspapers and any reading material, whether it is 
intended for educated people or, worse yet, for those learning to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does offer tax reductions on books purchased by some 
libraries, educational institutions and organizations promoting 
literacy. But that is not enough. The government is still pocketing $120 
million in taxes on reading material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development wants to increase 
training and development programs. He should know that, according to 
international studies, a substantial number of applicants can be turned 
down because of the fact that their limited reading skills in turn limit 
their capacity to enrol in adult and continuing education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I urge the government and the members across the way 
to stop behaving like tartuffes and to practice what they have always 
preached, by abolishing the GST. If they were brave, all members, 
including Reformers, would give unanimous consent to make this motion a 
votable item, so that we can put an end to taxing ignorance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether students are headed for post-secondary education or 
directly into the labour force, they need fundamental learning 
skills and basic knowledge.  These are essential if they are to 
keep on learning, advance their careers and achieve their 
personal goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the future of our youth and of our economy depends on 
whether today's students are being given a sound background in 
primary and secondary schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have a role to play in promoting literacy in our homes 
and communities.  As to exempting books from the GST/HST, I would 
be open to hearing more information on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST was designed to raise no more money than the hidden tax 
it replaced.  Special credits offset the impact of GST on low 
income earners, schools, hospitals, municipalities and new homes, 
Basic groceries, financial services and prescription drugs are 
not taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By law, GST revenues can only be used to service or reduce the 
debt.  In April 1996, Ottawa and Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland agreed to harmonize their sales taxes and to bury 
the tax in the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time Progressive Conservative members and senators from 
those three Atlantic provinces tried to expand the list of goods 
and services that are exempt from GST or HST.  Examples of the 
proposed exemptions were books and funerals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being my first term, I was not part of the government that 
implemented the GST but I was a member of the party that saw the 
need to replace the hidden federal sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Liberals who vowed to abolish the GST, the PC party 
recognized from the beginning that the GST would have to be 
fine-tuned after introduction.  We see this as a continuing 
process.  As all members know, the Liberals did not scrap the 
GST, much to the chagrin of certain members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Hamilton East by-election, the NDP leader for her 
part promised to cut the GST to 5% from 7%.  She said she would 
eliminate the GST on new homes, children's shoes and clothing, 
books, school supplies, furniture and other essential family 
purchases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She did not mention that the British Columbia NDP government 
raised the sales tax to 7% from 6%.  Nor did she mention that one 
of the very first things that Saskatchewan's NDP government did 
was to raise its rate to 9% from 7%.  Having improved its 
financial position, it has since lowered it back to 7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to reiterate my party's commitment to 
improving literacy levels in this country.  However, the 
government must act with prudence.  Before endorsing this motion, 
we must weigh the benefits of any changes against the potential 
cost.  I would like to see hard data on the impact that taxing 
books has on literacy in comparison with lost revenues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak in support of literacy in our society.  I thank my 
colleague for putting her motion before the House of Commons.  I 
will be focusing on the problem of literacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member from Rimouski indicated, presently in Canada over 
25% of the total population is considered to be illiterate. 
Certainly if we were to look at the cost to society as a whole as 
a result of that, it would be in the range of $15 billion to $20 
billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To look at the source of it, we really have to go back to the 
early days of schooling, to the primary level, to the secondary 
level and to the graduate level.  According to Statistics Canada, 
many graduating university students are considered to be 
functionally literate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem here that is of a big magnitude.  There is a 
problem here that is not only a federal responsibility but a 
responsibility of the provinces, school boards, the family and 
society as a whole.  What we need is a holistic approach to the 
whole problem of illiteracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I congratulate the government and, in particular, 
the Minister of Finance as well as the Prime Minister for 
ensuring the continuation of funding to the secretariat in charge 
of literacy in Canada. 
The funding for that agency was due to end in 1993-94.  Thanks to 
the efforts of many of my colleagues on the government side that 
funding has continued despite the fact that education is a 
provincial responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many positive things are taking place in society.  A council of 
ministers is looking at the issue of education across the 
country.  Provincial ministers of education across the country 
are looking at the whole notion of standards in the area of 
education.  I believe this is the essential element to finding a 
solution to the problem of illiteracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unpleasant that in the second richest country on 
earth one out of every three students drop out before they reach 
university.  As one of the richest countries on earth, over 25% 
of the population has difficulties reading or writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend per capita more than almost any other country in the 
world.  Next to Sweden we spend over $50 billion a year on 
education. If someone turns around and says we need more funding 
for education, my answer would be no, we need to look at the way 
we are spending our resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not one of those people who says we need more school boards 
across Canada.  I am one of those people who says we should 
eliminate every school board across the country from coast to 
coast to coast.  In every municipality we should have one 
director of education that reports to a municipal or regional 
government.  These elected officials would have to go to the 
public every three years in any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have democracy through the regional government.  We 
would be able to eliminate the different administrations from 
coast to coast that cost millions and millions, if not billions 
of dollars.  Then we would be able to put that money back into 
schools, into classrooms to provide necessary resources for 
students.  That would be the first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second step would a revamp of the way we do things.  We need 
a national strategy for education and literacy.  We need national 
literacy and education standards.  If I were to graduate from a 
university or any educational institution in Newfoundland, I 
should be able to obtain the equivalent education in British 
Columbia or in Alberta.  If I finished my education as an 
engineer or as a technologist in New Brunswick, I should be able 
to practise elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need transportability of education similar to what we have in 
the national health act.  We need an understanding across the 
country that we live in the same nation.  If I finish my first 
year of university in western Canada I should be able to transfer 
my credits to eastern Canada.  Unfortunately we do not have that 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many complications in the system.  Instead of creating 
ways to help students at the provincial level progress in their 
education, we are creating complications and walls in front of 
them.  Although education and literacy are provincial 
responsibilities the government has made literacy a national 
priority.  I am delighted by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a co-operative approach among the municipal, provincial 
and federal governments and the business community which has a 
very important role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We complain consistently that over 20% of students graduating 
from university cannot find jobs.  Part of the reason they cannot 
find jobs is that some students are graduating in fields where 
there are no jobs.  Who is setting the priority?  Who is telling 
students in every university and community college in Canada 
where the jobs are?  Someone should tell them which fields to 
consider if they want to find jobs in institutions, businesses or 
government agencies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly does not help anyone if every student across the 
country wants to become a lawyer.  It will not help everyone if 
every student wants to be enrolled in history.  There is no 
national strategy by the provinces to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the federal government, one by one our ministers have 
consistently spoken about the need for a co-operative approach 
among different levels of government. I hope one day soon, as 
usual, the federal government will be open to the provinces 
asking it to act, whether as a chair, a facilitator or whatever, 
to develop those standards in education, standards in training 
and standards in literacy.  I also hope we will look at standards 
in the environment, standards in every single sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a nation of different provinces.  We all live under one 
Confederation.  We are diverse.  We need at least a common 
understanding that we require a minimum standard everyone across 
the country agrees on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent education is a provincial responsibility.  That 
is fine, fair and square.   The bottom line is an understanding 
among the provinces that on an annual basis we need a national 
testing standard in the core subjects.  I am not talking about 
geography or history but about core subjects such as math, 
science, physics and chemistry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need a strategy to provide the necessary tools to 
teachers across the country.  How often have we seen provincial 
governments going to teachers at the university level, the 
community college level or the high school level to ask what they 
can do to help them do their jobs better and have a more educated 
or far more prepared student population?  It rarely happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what happened in the province of Ontario, for example, 
with Bill 160.  The educational community was on one side and the 
government was on the other.  In between them we had the 
population of Ontario shaking their heads. Rather than have an 
abrasive approach among governments, educational institutions and 
teachers we need a co-operative approach.  That is what is 
necessary.  We need a co-operative approach in education and 
literacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the wealth we have in the country and at the quality 
of our institutions we can do it.  There is no doubt in my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Speaker:</b>  I would inform the House that we have 
approximately nine minutes left in debate and it is the custom to 
give the last five minutes to the mover of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will try to be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion asks for the government to consider removing GST on 
books and reading material.  This inhibits and puts up blockades 
and barriers in people's journey down the road to literacy.  The 
worse effect is for the people who cannot afford it.  That is 
what my colleague pointed out.  People who can barely afford to 
buy a book have to also pay the 7% GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party says that it supports tax incentives but not 
GST on books.  Liberal members on this side are telling us that 
they appreciate the literacy issue but removing the GST from 
books is not necessarily on their agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last Liberal member who spoke created an interesting debate, 
and I have to take him on.  He indicated that we do not need 
school boards. That is a major debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1425"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>School boards, university senates and boards of directors of 
community colleges are trying to create an ownership of their 
communities and regions by representing parents and children to 
try to envision the future of their education.  At the moment, 
there is no national vision on education as it has been 
decentralized to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national vision creates a vision for the journey from 
kindergarten to grade 12.  After grade 12, when they graduate, we 
drop them off.  If the student survives, great.  We congratulate 
them if they find a career.  If they do they will probably be 
wealthy enough to buy a house or a vehicle and maybe some books 
for their children, but there is no journey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our acts of education say that the provinces are responsible for 
our children until they are 21 years old.  In reality, the 
majority of these graduates are 17 and 18.  We are 
short-circuiting our investment on our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not invest in our children regardless of what journey or 
where they are at in high school, university, trade school, 
community college, business school or any other school they are 
in until they are 21 or 25 years old?  Why not take this huge tax 
grab that we call GST and invest it correctly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, the biggest tax incentives came after the second 
world war.  The country was ready to fight in a war against some 
aggression in the world and suppress it.  We won that war. Now 
this tax incentive in money and resources is to make our lives 
safe and peaceful in an international community.  However, we 
cannot do this without the betterment of our children and a 
vision for our youth in this great country we call Canada from 
coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is a major test for the parties.  The hon. member is 
raising a major issue. The GST on the print media is a 
disincentive for these children and does not give them the 
opportunity to get their hands on books, magazines and a learning 
stage.  This is a simple test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other bigger debates will come into this House and I look 
forward to being a big part of those debates if they enter the 
House.  In the meantime, let us take the GST off.  That is all 
the member is asking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is only a little over a minute left in this 
debate. I just want to make one point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my colleagues who have spoken before have outlined a 
number of initiatives that are being taken in the area of 
literacy both to help very young children and right through to 
university and so on, to help the libraries and schools that are 
instrumental in helping young people to read and adults to learn 
to read, often for the first time very late in life.  They are 
instrumental along with a number of community organizations that 
are also supported by the funds that are raised in part through 
the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask a question of my colleagues on the opposite side 
of the fence.  One of the results of taking the GST off reading 
materials would be to reduce the amount of revenue coming from 
the GST.  We have to ask ourselves who it benefits.  Among 
others, the people who benefit are the people who are buying 
things like <I>Hustler</I>, <I>Penthouse</I>, <I>Playboy</I> and the 
swimsuit edition of <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it really important to help literacy by helping publications 
that are doing quite well, thank you very much, and do not need 
any help whatsoever from the taxpayer?  Or, should we look in 
fact at investing directly into literature and reading material 
that is available to the general public as we do through schools, 
libraries, universities and so on and through very directed 
literacy programs delivered on the ground by community 
organizations across this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, frankly, prefer the latter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
just add my two bits worth to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being an educator all my life, I of course know the value of 
books.  I think it is unconscionable that students who, for the 
most part these days, are having a great deal of trouble making 
ends meet, are taxed to death by a government that has this 
insatiable hunger for tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to what the hon. member from the Liberal Party 
opposite said just a few moments ago, I have a tendency to agree 
that there would be a loss of tax revenue obviously from some 
printed materials that many would value not worthy of that 
exemption from the GST. 
On the other hand we find that taxpayers' money is being used via 
Heritage Canada to subsidize equally offensive publications and 
equally offensive productions.  I have seen and heard them 
myself.  That is using taxpayers' money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should strike a deal.  Let us say that we will not 
take the tax away from books if at the same time we will stop 
using that tax revenue for things which come into exactly the 
same category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be very honest I feel that we need to reduce government 
expenditures so that we can reduce the amount of debt and reduce 
the amount of interest payable.  Then we could reduce in total 
the amount that Canadians have to pay in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we get on to that and reduce the GST, say in stages to zero 
on everything, in the end all Canadians will benefit, especially 
those who are interested in promoting literacy in the country 
which is the motive of this bill, but in other areas as well.  It 
would be a great boon to our economy if the government got its 
cotton pickin' GST fingers out of our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  The time for Private 
Members' Business has expired.  However as colleagues know, it is 
a convention in the House on non-votable private members' motions 
that the last few minutes are very often given to the mover of 
the motion to sum up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have the unanimous consent of the House to give the mover 
of the motion, the hon. member for Dartmouth, three minutes to 
sum up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b> Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
about as much time as I am going to need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot tell you, Mr. Speaker, how disappointed I am that I was 
not able to get unanimous consent on this motion. I thought this 
was something we might be able to come together on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking on behalf of all the readers and the potential 
readers in Canada who were negatively impacted by this decision 
to not open this issue one more time for discussion. Given the 
fact that 83% of Canadians would like to see the GST removed from 
reading materials, I would say that it is a sad day for 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also say that it seemed to me that it should have been 
possible for a dozen or so people left in this House on a Friday 
afternoon to actually address the issue at hand, which was the 
very direct relationship between the cost of books and literacy. 
That was really the only issue we had to be discussing today. We 
did not have to take each other down ideological paths around 
labour, around school boards and around <I>Hustler</I> magazine. A 
lot of red herrings were hauled out on to the floor this 
afternoon. I am very disappointed at that. The people who were 
hoping that this might be chance to discuss the GST again are 
really going to be saddened by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close with a request to the Liberals.  Why will you 
not keep the promise that you made many times over your reign and 
before you were elected?  Please, do what you said you were going 
to do.  In the words of your Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
“Food is not subject to GST because it is a necessity.  So are 
books.  They are needed for young minds to grow”. This is from 
the heritage minister.  I hope that at some point your party will 
somehow get together on your ideas on this and you may in fact do 
what people in Canada have been asking be done for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.34 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
