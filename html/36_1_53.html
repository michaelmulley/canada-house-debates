<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, the day before yesterday the 
member for Prince George—Peace River raised a question of 
privilege.  In that question of privilege the Minister of Natural 
Resources was named.  I asked the House to give me time to gather 
more information and to hear—I hate to use the word 
rebuttal—but at least a response from the Minister of Natural 
Resources.  He is here with us now and I would like to hear what 
he has to say.

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in relation to an alleged question of privilege 
raised last Tuesday by the member for Prince George—Peace River 
pertaining to Bill C-4, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to you, Mr. Speaker, 
for ensuring that on this alleged point the government side is 
heard in this House in response to the five interventions that 
were heard from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure you, Mr. Speaker, that in relation to Bill C-4, 
there has been no contempt of this House nor any contempt for the 
office or the authority of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ongoing discussion about how to change the Canadian Wheat 
Board has been under way both in this House and across the 
prairies for at least 25 years.  It has been especially intense 
since the early 1990s when the former Mulroney government tried 
at that time to diminish the wheat board without reference to 
Parliament and without substantive consultations with farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I inherited those problems after the 1993 election, I was 
determined to follow proper procedures inside Parliament, 
especially in relation to that broad and often fractious western 
farm community within which there are deeply divided points of 
view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of course has the opposition luxury of siding 
with only one side in the debate.  As minister I have to try to 
build some consensus.  One of my common practices in trying to do 
so is to consult extensively with interested stakeholders and to 
try very hard to keep them in the loop with ample information as 
events move along.  Through Parliament and through countless 
public and private meetings, hearings, panels, letters, 
pamphlets, surveys, e-mails, faxes and the Internet, we have made 
an exhaustive effort to keep farmers up to date with what is 
going on with respect to wheat board changes, to answer their 
questions and most importantly to solicit their advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The straight forward meeting with farm leaders which I held on 
January 21 and which is the Reform Party's sole source of 
complaint in this alleged question of privilege was part of that 
open, inclusive and transparent effort to gain the benefit of 
producer input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it is ludicrous to suggest that a minister may not even 
meet with a broad cross-section of interested stakeholders to 
consult them on matters of vital importance to their livelihoods 
if a piece of legislation on the same subject happens at that 
moment to be before Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules do not say that ministers may only consult with the 
opposition or only with the groups of which the opposition 
approves. Similarly the rules do not constrain the opposition 
from meeting outside Parliament with any groups it may want to 
consult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his intervention last Tuesday, the member for 
Yorkton—Melville admitted that he had done just that the very 
next day after my meeting. The member for Portage—Lisgar has had 
meetings about the details of Bill C-4 and many other Reformers 
have done the same. Their extra-parliamentary meetings to discuss 
Bill C-4 while that bill is pending before this House are not a 
breach of privilege. They are not in contempt and neither am I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely adequate consultation with stakeholders is completely 
consistent with and fundamental to the democratic process.  It 
cannot be a legitimate source of complaint on either side of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In what I have written or said about Bill C-4 in relation to my 
January 21 meeting or otherwise, I have tried to be crystal clear 
that the debate in this House is obviously ongoing and that the 
bill is not yet passed.  I suspect that came as no surprise to 
farmers.  If the details change, then there will have to be 
further consultations again. But in the meantime there is no gag 
order on any member of this House to prevent them or me from 
talking with farmers about what is being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has urged on a number of occasions that we 
implement the essence of the 1996 report of the Western Grain 
Marketing Panel.  The essence of that report is a change in 
corporate governance to create a board of directors for the 
Canadian Wheat Board with the majority of those directors to be 
elected by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I met with farm leaders on January 21, that is what we were 
talking about, how to do it right, how to respond to the essence 
of the panel report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September I asked all the major western farm groups to give 
me their practical advice on this issue. 
Many responded with detailed written suggestions including the 
very right wing organization whose cause the Reform Party is now 
espousing in this alleged question of privilege.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  This sounds like debate now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:</B>  I went further when I appeared 
before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food to discuss Bill C-4 last October.  I told the committee 
that I had consulted with farm groups about election methodology 
and I asked that committee the exact same questions that I asked 
the farm groups.  So Parliament was fully informed and engaged 
and there was no complaint from the opposition for over three 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm groups responded seriously and substantively both in 
writing and on January 21.  I cannot help it if the Reform Party 
did not respond, even though it was specifically invited to do so 
through a parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer briefly to two remarks made on Tuesday by Reform 
members.  The member for Peace River said:  “The minister 
publicly stated that he wants the board of directors in place 
before this legislation has been debated properly on the floor of 
the House of Commons and passed”.  In fact I have repeatedly 
stated the exact opposite.  The board of directors cannot be in 
place.  Democracy and accountability cannot be achieved for the 
Canadian Wheat Board unless and until Bill C-4 is finally debated 
and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince George—Peace River said:  “I think it is 
high time that this House demonstrate to the ministers and their 
departments a little democracy over bureaucracy”.  I agree. That 
is what Bill C-4 is all about, empowerment and democracy for 
prairie farmers.  Surely a minister consulting with those farmers 
about how to get there is no question of privilege. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, while the minister was 
making his statement today, I heard cries from the other side 
that this was debate.  I myself did not think this was any more 
debate than the interventions of the other members in this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points have now been put before me.  Allegations have been 
made by one side.  Now we have heard the other point of view from 
the other side.  As to the specific allegation itself, I want to 
review specifically what the member for Prince George—Peace 
River said in his question of privilege concerning the specific 
allegation.  Other opinions were presented to back it up and 
there may be some other facts that I want to take into 
consideration. I now have the minister's statement. I have heard 
both sides.  I will have a look at all the material that is in 
front of me and I will come back to this House with a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the minister's long and 
exhausting preamble he referred to hardworking farmers who are 
concerned about their livelihood as radical right wing factions. 
I would ask that the minister with— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I see we are getting a little into the 
debate and I am sure that all hon. members will want to give me 
time to review just exactly what has been said.  For the time 
being we will let this sit.  I will come back to the House with a 
decision.

the continued intrusion by the government into the way parents

concerned that the unborn have no legal rights in this country. 
The rights of the preborn child are not guaranteed in the charter 
of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore these petitioners call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to protect the preborn by amending clause 28 of the 
charter of rights and freedoms to read “notwithstanding anything 
in this charter, the rights and freedoms set out in it are 
guaranteed equally to male and female persons from conception to 
natural death”. I personally support this as well.

according to section 36, I would like to present a petition from 
many people in northern Alberta. They believe that the 
provocation defence, as it is currently used in femicide and wife 
slaughter cases, inappropriately and unjustly changes the focus 
of the criminal trial from the behaviour of the accused and his 
intention to murder, to the behaviour of the victim, who from 
then on is identified as the one responsible for the accused's 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are obviously asking and praying that Parliament review and

firefighters often do not provide sufficient compensation to 
their families for those whose spouses are killed in the line of

officer or firefighter killed in the line of duty and wishes to 
support in a tangible way the surviving family members in their 
time of need.

I am very happy to introduce a petition in this House from over 
2,000 people across the country. Persons convicted of indictable 
offences and serving prison terms have been able to change their 
names while in prison. Being able to change their names enables 
these persons upon their release to remain unknown to local 
police and to give the impression of not having a criminal 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to enact 
legislation which would prohibit convicts serving terms of

their names.

point of order, Mr. Speaker.  I appreciate that you have risen 
with regard to the issue on petitions.  I believe there are very 
good reasons for the House rules with regard to whether a member 
concurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly all members of Parliament represent all constituents 
and there may be cases where members of Parliament do not for 
good reason support but do not get an opportunity to make that 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask the House if it would not only remind 
members of that rule but possibly provide members with the 
substantive reasons for the rule within this place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member raises a point about presenting 
petitions on behalf of our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that we do represent our constituents by the 
presenting of petitions, whether or not we concur with them. 
There are many that I presented in this House that I do not 
concur with and I have managed to slip that in after I have 
presented the petition.  In the same way there are many that I 
personally support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with the member's theory that we should not be 
permitted to give our opinion on a petition.  The fact is we 
present them on behalf of our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The point is that the rule is there. 
I am as the officer of the House charged with the responsibility 
of enforcing those rules and asking members to observe the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They are not rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  An hon. member says they are not 
rules.  They are certainly an established practice and have the 
force of a rule in the House.  Not every rule is written as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge hon. members to comply with that position.  If there is 
to be a change in it, there is a procedure for doing that.  Hon. 
members know they can raise the matter at the procedure and House 
affairs committee.  I am sure that if the committee presents a 
report the House will consider it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK49">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for imperilling the 
economic and social security of Canadians with their reckless 
commitment to dramatically increase spending, at a time when the 
average family's share of the federal debt is approaching $80,000 
and Canada has the highest personal income taxes in the G-7. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, as we move toward the 21st century one of 
the things that Canadians have a right to expect from their 
federal government is leadership, far-sighted, decisive and 
strong leadership, but that is not what the Canadian public has 
been receiving from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to a pollster several weeks ago who conducts a lot of 
polls and focus groups and is particularly observant of the 
adjectives that people use to describe the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He noted that in the last days of the Mulroney administration 
the word arrogant occurred more and more frequently as the 
adjective used to describe that government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked what adjective is being applied to this government as it 
enters into its last term.  He said the adjective that is being 
applied to this government by Canadians more and more is the word 
weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case some hon. members are not sure what that word means or 
think that it refers to seven days in a row, according to the 
dictionary these are some of the synonyms for the word weak: 
feeble, frail, fragile, infirm, decrepit, impotent, strengthless, 
powerless, flaccid, anemic, exhausted, flimsy, broken down, run 
down, rickety, tottering, doddering, broken, lame, halt, 
withered, maimed, shattered, shaken, palsied, decrepit, languid, 
poor, infirm, faint, sickly, vapid, flat, insipid, watery, loose, 
lax, nerveless, slack, spent, weatherbeaten, decayed, rotten, 
worn, seedy, languishing, wasted, unsupported, helpless and 
defenceless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we want to focus on a particular area where the weakness 
of the government is self-evident.  The subject of the supply 
motion before us condemns, and rightly so, the government's 
management and mismanagement of Canada's high debt and taxation 
levels.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is fundamentally weak on debt reduction and tax 
relief and it is the duty of the House to hold it accountable for 
that weakness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a critique of the Liberal position and Reform's 
alternatives for debt reduction and tax relief which we have 
produced in a little booklet entitled “Securing Your Future”. 
This is a summary of a longer 50 page paper containing the 
results of the prebudget consultations conducted by the official 
opposition entitled “Securing the Dividend”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this material has far more to say on debt reduction and tax 
relief than anything produced by the finance committee of the 
House.  It is the work of the official opposition research and 
communications people, with the supervision and involvement of 
the hon. member for Medicine Hat, the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast, the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley and 
the hon. member for Battlefords—Lloydminster.  I thank them for 
the enormous amount of work they have done on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention to the public that this booklet can be 
obtained from any Reform MP or by contacting us at 
1-888-733-6761, or at our web site, www.reform.ca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This booklet also contains a score card for rating the finance 
minister's forthcoming budget with respect to its treatment of 
debt reduction and tax relief.  This score card for rating 
Liberal financial performance was inspired by the score cards 
used to monitor rowing contests, rowing being the only activity 
we can think of where one can sit on one's rear end and go 
backward and still have some chance of crossing the finish line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the debt problem, this is the essence of it.  Under 
Liberal-Tory mismanagement the federal debt rose to $583 billion, 
which is 70% of the GDP.  Over the past 25 years Liberal 
administrations added $195 billion; the Tories, $300 billion; the 
current administration, $75 billion.  Canadians spend $45 billion 
per year on interest, more than on health, education, 
equalization and pensions combined.  The interest on this debt is 
the greatest threat to social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in understandable terms, most Canadian families have 
a mortgage but what this debt does is establish a second mortgage 
on the future of every family of four to the tune of $77,000. The 
average family, therefore, pays $6,000 to $7,000 a year in taxes 
on that mortgage, so this debt erodes the disposable income of 
every family in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the Liberal-Tory record of debt accumulation is the 
worst of any post-war government in the western world.  It is a 
national disgrace and strong leadership is required to correct 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition therefore proposes that Canada make 
federal debt retirement a top financial priority by committing 
50% of any future federal surpluses to debt reduction.  We 
believe that we are supported in this by a majority of the 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to say to average families saddled with a $77,000 
second mortgage because of the federal government that they will 
receive some extra cash this year, we are convinced that most 
families would make it their number one priority to pay down that 
mortgage, and that is what we are saying the federal government 
should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this booklet and in the background paper that supports it we 
have set down a plan to pay down the debt.  It includes setting 
debt reduction targets and sticking to them, aiming to reduce the 
debt from 70% of GDP to 50% by the year 2003 and to 20% by the 
year 2016.  In other words, the debt would almost be cut in half 
by the year 2016, in 20 years.  That could cut the second 
mortgage on the family from $77,000 to $39,000.  If the 
Government of Canada did that it would save about $20 billion in 
interest payments per year by the 20th year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To back up this debt reduction plan we also propose balanced 
budget legislation, a legal requirement to keep the budget 
balanced over a four year cycle, a legal requirement to put 50% 
of any defined surpluses into a national debt retirement fund, 
and penalties on ministers and on MPs for violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six provinces of Canada have balanced budget laws.  There ought 
to be a federal law to make a repeat of the Liberal-Tory debt 
accumulation illegal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the Liberal-Tory tax record, under Liberal-Tory 
administrations Canadians have been subjected to over 108 federal 
tax increases since 1984, 71 by the Tories and 37 by the 
Liberals.  We now have the highest personal income tax levels 
among G-7 industrialized countries, some 56% higher than the 
average of those countries.  We do not just tax the rich. 
Canada's top tax rate kicks in at incomes of $60,000 a year.  In 
the U.S. it kicks in when one makes $270,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often go to universities to speak to the students. Invariably, 
when we have an open question period, some student will stand and 
say “I am graduating next year with a computer science degree” 
or a degree in this or that.  “Here is my tax position in 
Chicago and here is my tax position in Canada.  Why is the tax 
incentive to leave the country rather than to stay?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not just overtax the middle class.  We overtax the lower 
middle and the poor.  Canada starts taxing people when they make 
$6,500 a year.  Even the heartless U.S. does not start until one 
makes $9,500.  The average among the OECD countries is that one 
does not start paying income tax until one makes about $15,000 a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government currently takes $1.8 billion a year from 
people who make $15,000 or less and takes $12 billion from 
families who make $30,000 a year or less.  In other words, it 
collects almost $14 billion a year in taxes from people who, by 
its own definitions, are near or below the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, to add insult to injury, the government announced the 
biggest tax hike in history, bigger than the Mulroney GST, the 
finance minister's 73% hike in CPP premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting this again in understandable terms, the disposable 
income of the average Canadian family has dropped by $3,000 as a 
result of the taxing policies of the Liberal administration. 
There has been economic growth in the country since 1993 but 
governments have consumed the lion's share of it.  The average 
Canadian family now spends more on taxes than on food, shelter 
and clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have time but other members will get into this point. 
Reform has a concrete plan for tax relief.  We want to make tax 
relief a real priority by committing 50% of future surpluses to 
genuine broad based relief.  We urge the government to adopt 
these tax relief measures.  We list nine particular measures in 
“Securing our Future”.  These measures plus the indexing of 
personal income tax add up to about $20 billion a year in tax 
relief by the time all are delivered over a period of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform target would be to provide $2,000 of tax relief to 
the average family of four by the year 2000 and to lift 1.2 
million taxpayers off federal tax rolls altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will urge the government to proceed immediately with tax 
relief measures that stimulate job creation.  One of those of 
course is to make a 30% reduction in EI premiums paid by 
employers, to stop using the EI surplus funds to offset general 
deficits, and to convert the EI into a genuine job loss insurance 
program.  This proposal is based on the simple proposition, which 
seems self-evident to everyone but the government, that high 
taxes kill jobs and that lower taxes create jobs.  It is time for 
a national job strategy built on that principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to financial reforms, timing is everything.  We 
say now is the time for debt reduction.  Now is the time for tax 
relief.  Now is not the time for increased federal spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition, therefore, does not support the 
government's plan to make increased spending the top priority by 
committing 50% of any surplus to increased spending.  We do not 
support the finance minister's plan to increase program spending 
from $103 billion to $113 billion over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We advocate holding the line on program spending for three years 
at $103 billion, saving and spending more wisely during that 
period until we get our financial house in order, not wasting on 
mismanagement such as the helicopter decision, such as numerous 
decisions the government has made, and reducing spending in some 
areas in order to hold the line.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean you cannot increase spending in some areas 
like health care or research but if you do, you have have to 
reduce something else just like the way most of the families in 
this country have to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the year 2000, we say to hold spending at 10.5% of GDP. 
After 2000 spending can be allowed to increase but not faster 
than the economy is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reiterate, now 1998 to the year 2000 is not the time for 
increased federal spending.  Now is the time for spending what we 
have more wisely, for saving, for paying down debts and reducing 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I want to say two further things.  The first one 
is to the public.  This is a watershed budget year.  Very often 
budgets are simply a one year extension of whatever was done the 
previous year with a whole lot of PR hype around it to make it 
look like something more is being done. That is not the case this 
year.  We are actually at the point where the federal budget 
should be balanced and therefore some crucial decisions with 
respect to future direction have to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the public to inform themselves on this issue, to 
look at the finance minister's budget in detail, to look at 
Reform's plan “Securing Your Future” and to communicate their 
advice and their position to elected representatives. If they 
share our conviction that debt reduction and tax relief should be 
the highest priorities, please let this Liberal government know 
in no uncertain terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also say to the House that I feel we should all be conscious 
of a sense of urgency on this matter.  It has taken 15 years to 
balance this federal budget. 1983 was the first year the polls 
showed sufficient public support to implement a vigorous budget 
balancing policy in this country. The election of the Tory 
government in 1984 was largely based on that appeal.  People 
balked, they were tired of Liberal overspending and they thought 
the thing to do was to elect a Conservative administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what happened.  Conservatives were elected in 1984 and 
re-elected in 1988 but the debt continued to grow, the taxes 
continued to go up and the deficits got worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in 1993 that a block of members were elected to this 
House who made deficit reduction their number one priority. Under 
constant prodding from Reform and from others throughout the 
country, the Liberal government finally has got the deficit under 
control and will have the budget balanced by 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that it took 15 years to implement a self-evident 
policy for which there was public support.  It still took 15 
years to do it. My point is that we cannot afford now to take 
another 15 years to get debt and taxes under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership of this government on debt reduction and tax 
relief is weak and indecisive.  It needs to be prodded like it 
has never been prodded before. This is why the official 
opposition urges support of this supply motion that this House 
condemns the government for imperilling the economic and social 
security of Canadians with their reckless commitment to 
dramatically increase spending at a time when the average 
family's share of the federal debt is approaching $80,000 and 
Canada has the highest personal income taxes in the G-7.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was indeed amazed when the Leader of the Official 
Opposition mentioned rowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it from me to indicate to hon. members present that I am 
on the Henley rowing team but I do remember something that F. 
Scott Fitzgerald wrote in the last lines of <I>The Great 
Gatsby</I>, not to be mistaken for the great Myron or anything. 
In <I>The Great Gatsby</I> he wrote “rowing against the tide but 
borne back ceaselessly into the past”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty I have with the rowing analogy is that on 
occasion hon. members opposite want to return to the past.  It is 
a rather draconian way of looking at how our country is currently 
being operated.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noted that he used the word weak in varying forms. His 
etymological skills impress me.  I wonder if the hon. member's 
researchers spent a week researching the meaning of the word 
weak.  I remember him talking about computers and note that the 
hon. party opposite can be contacted at www.something or other. I 
wonder if that stands for weak, weaker and weakest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of something Shakespeare's MacBeth said:  “Out, 
out brief candle; life is but a walking weak shadow, a poor 
player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and it is 
heard by nothing.  It is a tale told by an idiot signifying 
nothing”. That is not my terminology.  The hon. member opposite 
does strut.  He certainly does fret.  I do not agree with 
MacBeth.  The hon. member is no idiot. He is a very clever man. 
That is why it really surprises me when he speaks about the taxes 
of the current Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that a single mother who earns $15,000 and 
has one child would pay $1,364 in income tax.  The real facts are 
that over four million—four; one, two, three, four—four million 
people in this country pay no taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about leadership.  A leader is a custodian of 
the nation's ideals, of its cherished beliefs and permanent hopes 
which make a nation out of a mere aggregate of individuals.  I 
ask the hon. member and his party how in heaven's name we will be 
able to coalesce in this country when he perhaps unknowingly 
wants to indulge in proposing such divisive tax measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on but I know— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You have, you have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  More, more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  It is so great to get the accolades 
from the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. Leader of the Opposition to indicate how 
he believes the Liberal Party is being injurious to this country 
when he knows full well that there was a $42 billion annual 
deficit when we inherited the leadership of this country.  Now 
the deficit has not only been eradicated but it is quite possible 
that we will have a surplus.  At one time or another the members 
opposite quite obviously voted for another political party other 
than their current party which must have run up that bill in an 
extraneous fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member opposite care to indulge the estimable 
group on this side of the House with what he believes could lead 
us to a brighter future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we were impressed by 
this member's commentary during his intervention, in particular 
the demonstration of his capacity to count to four and also his 
recitation of the one and only Shakespeare quotation he knows. We 
appreciated that contribution. Please, not more, not more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were really two questions in his intervention.  He wants 
us to give the federal government credit for this balancing of 
the budget.  We have already argued that we have pressed harder 
than any others in the House for the achievement of that 
objective so of course we are pleased when we get to that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is something the government must recognize and 
apparently the member missed my entire point.  There are four 
things wrong.  That is a number he should be able to grasp. There 
are four things wrong with the federal fiscal house.  One is the 
deficit, another is chronic overspending, another is the high 
level of debt and another is the high level of taxation.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member in this House who is under the illusion that the 
fiscal house of the federal government can be fixed by fixing 
only one of those flat tires has an awful lot to learn.  What we 
are endeavouring to do is get the member beyond this point to the 
point where he recognizes that increased spending by the federal 
government is the wrong course.  A new attention to debt and tax 
relief has to be given.  That was the whole thrust of my talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's allegation is that somehow what Reform is proposing 
is divisive to the country, or in other words tax relief is 
divisive but spending brings us together.  If high spending 
brought us together this ought to be the most united country in 
the world. What Reform's tax relief measures do is something that 
is beneficial to every part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time did not permit me to translate our $20 billion of tax 
relief into its regional impacts, but let me give the member 
those regional impacts. If the government implemented that 
package of $20 billion in tax relief measures per year, the nine 
measures listed in our program, this is what that would deliver 
per year to the regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada would get $1.4 billion per year, more than what 
the government has ever paid in regional development grants. This 
is given to the many rather than to the few and you do not have 
to be a friend of the government to get it.  Quebec would get 
$4.5 billion a year in tax relief.  To Ontario, $7.5 billion a 
year. To Manitoba and Saskatchewan, $1.4 billion in tax relief. 
To Alberta, $1.9 billion.  To British Columbia, $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that if we gave that kind of tax relief to every part 
of the country, it would do more to stimulate our economy and 
bind us together than the divisive and patronage-riddled spending 
of the federal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker,  I also 
have a question for the Leader of the Official Opposition.  My 
preamble will be somewhat shorter than the previous one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the leader of the Reform Party that the 
quote was not from Shakespeare, it was in fact from F. Scott 
Fitzgerald. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments that the hon. member makes are interesting.  I 
would like to ask him a question about the GST.  One of the 
proposals people have been suggesting is that one way to 
stimulate local economies, neighbourhood economies right down to 
the suburbs, would be to phase out the GST.  With the elimination 
of the deficit, which was one of the arguments for the 
introduction of the GST, what does the Leader of the Official 
Opposition think about the proposal that now is the time to begin 
phasing down the GST? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer to the 
member's question is that we favour reducing the GST rate by 1% 
which saves taxpayers about $3 billion.  That is one of the tax 
relief measures contained in this menu of tax relief measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our longer term proposal for the GST is to flatten and simplify 
the income tax system and integrate the GST into it thereby 
eliminating it all together.  We favour this as an intermediate 
measure because the other reform is a huge and complicated one, 
the 1% reduction in the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I would make to the members of the NDP, 
and I make this sincerely.  There is an awful lot of disagreement 
between Reformers and the NDP on a lot of things but I plead with 
the NDP to look at this issue of debt reduction and tax relief 
from a social standpoint.  This is an area in which the NDP 
professes to have deep concerns and values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that high debt is socially irresponsible.  It is the 
interest on that debt that is eroding all the programs the NDP 
hold most dear.  We argue that these are punitive tax measures, 
particularly the ones that hit the lower income people.  We can 
argue what is the best way to help those people, but surely 
leaving more money in their pockets has to be the socially 
responsible, not just the fiscally responsible, thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the member's question.  I would appeal to the 
members of the NDP to support these measures, perhaps for 
somewhat different reasons than ourselves, but to take into 
account the social as well as the fiscal implications of what we 
are proposing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, judging from 
today's Reform motion the official opposition has clearly not 
seen the movie <I>Titanic</I>.  It should.  Then it would realize 
what perilous policy can ensue; the disaster that can occur when 
speed is put ahead of cautious progress; the tragedy that can 
follow when it is decided that lifeboats are not a necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very much what the motion endorses, a titanic rejection 
of responsible and balanced decision making at the national 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion condemns the government for its pledge to divide any 
surplus which we may have in a coming budget, half to investment 
in economic and social measures and half to tax reduction and 
reducing the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers do not want us to make these investments in Canadians 
and in their social and economic future.  Full speed ahead, they 
demand, on tax cuts and debt reduction.  Scrap the lifeboats. 
They reject the investments we have made in education, in health 
care, in innovation and in combating child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the party which wants us to cut $1 billion from 
government programs to help Canada's aboriginal peoples.  It 
would do away with equalization payments to help those most in 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at our record.  If it has worked, what is the major 
impetus to take us away from policies that have succeeded?  When 
we took office just four short years ago the deficit was $42 
billion.  We are one year ahead of all the programs put forward 
by the Reform Party.  We will be in balance next year.  We have 
experienced going from a moribund economy that was on the verge 
of international intervention to an economy with the highest 
growth rate, with the highest growth rate in jobs of all G-7 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jobs are of critical importance to Canadians today and for the 
future.  Since we took office the unemployment rate has fallen 
from 11.4% to 8.6%.  That is not good enough, but we have created 
937,000 private sector, full time jobs during this period.  It is 
a very important trend which we must encourage and set for the 
future, and I will speak about it a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this period of time the finance minister, the government 
and the prime minister have adopted a policy of sound fiscal 
management.  Part of that management for the future is our 50:50 
balance, as we have stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to adhere to the paths which have gained us 
fiscal success in the past and our two year fiscal plans.  We 
will continue to adopt very prudent economic assumptions in 
budget making.  We will have a contingency reserve to look after 
unforeseen circumstances.  We will continue with our economic 
forecasting.  To the extent that we do not have to use the 
contingency reserve, it will naturally be used to reduce the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also must have the flexibility to respond to unforeseen 
circumstances which come about.  I mention in this regard the 
Asian crisis.  As the state of the union address indicated, an 
economy affected anywhere can affect economies everywhere.  We 
have seen how the Asian influence has affected not just the 
economies of the far east but those of the west.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we not taken the measures that we did to put our fiscal and 
monetary house in order, our dollar would have been far more 
affected than it was.  Of this I am sure.  As it is, the Canadian 
dollar has suffered less because of the Asian crisis than any 
other currency in the world except for the American dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also proud that Canada has assumed its role with the 
International Monetary Fund in helping to provide funds to 
stabilize those economies and restore them to a path of stability 
in the far east.  Canada is a very open economy which depends on 
the international flow of goods, capital, trade and personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I am very proud the government announced its 
support for the Toronto Centre at York University school of 
business.  It will be bringing in financial institution 
regulators from around the world to provide courses and case 
studies so that we can combat one of the major reasons the Asian 
crisis took place:  insufficient regulatory authority and control 
over financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that the Toronto Centre is chaired by Mr. Ced 
Ritchie, an individual who has had a very distinguished career in 
banking in Canada and internationally and brings a great deal of 
leadership to it.  Its executive director is another person of 
great experience in the financial sector, Paul Cantor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very tangible contributions.  They may be small in 
terms of dollars, but the impact they can have on the world 
economic situation and that of Canada is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at our program.  It is important to invest 50% of 
future surpluses in economic and social programs, and 50% in debt 
reduction and in tax reductions.  Even though we will see a 
balanced budget in the next fiscal year, Canada's debt right now 
is about $583 billion.  As of October it was about 73.1% of GDP 
and going down.  This is a very high debt burden for all 
Canadians to bear.  This is why we are committed to reducing that 
debt on a steady and ongoing basis into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened because of our economic performance?  Due in 
no small measure to the leadership by government, to the end of 
October we were able to pay down $11 billion of Canada's national 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of tax cuts, which I know interest hon. members 
opposite very much, in spite of the difficult economic 
circumstances we have faced we have made tax cuts and it has been 
part of our recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where have we cut those taxes?  To show our priorities we cut 
them for students and their families to make education more 
affordable.  We cut taxes for Canadians with disabilities.  We 
cut taxes for children in poverty, particularly poor families 
with a child tax benefit of $850 million, with more, a second 
tranche, to come in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud that we have done this in concert with the provinces, 
both of us targeting our unique resources to help working 
families at the bottom end of the rung.  This is the way it 
should be in Canada.  This is the path I encourage all members to 
support, governments at all levels working through common goals 
to help Canadians who need it the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we cut the taxes borne by small businesses 
which are creating new jobs under our new hires program.  We 
eliminated all payroll taxes for small businesses that took on 
new employees. 
That was targeted tax relief for a specific purpose.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cut by $1.4 billion the payroll taxes paid by all 
corporations, reducing the EI contributions from $2.90 to $2.70. 
When we took office it was at $3.07 going to $3.30.  In spite of 
difficult economic times we cut taxes in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one area in which I think I am proudest as a Liberal to 
say we have cut taxes.  We recognize that governments are being 
forced to cut back their spending.  We have cut back spending. 
Program spending has been cut by us by $15 billion.  We realized 
that we had to give the private sector more of a means to fill 
some of the voids.  This is why we enhanced substantially in two 
budgets the tax benefits available to those who contribute to 
charitable and voluntary organizations.  I am pleased to say they 
have responded by increased efforts at fund raising and renewed 
efforts to help Canadians.  This is the way it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of our spending let me indicate our priorities during 
difficult fiscal times.  What have we done?  We have increased 
spending on health care in terms of the Red Cross and in terms of 
aid to those who suffered AIDS through the blood program.  A 
program is forthcoming for hepatitis C victims.  We also raised 
the cash floor of the CHST by $1.5 billion in transfers to the 
provinces for the medical attention of Canadians throughout the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where we have shown a sense of priority on behalf 
of Canadians is aboriginals.  The condition of Canada's first 
peoples has a claim on the conscience of every Canadian.  This is 
why the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
recently announced a $350 million increase to deal with some of 
the problems of the past that have been incurred and suffered by 
our first peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third area where we have shown our sense of priorities for the 
future of the country is education.  In 1874 in the British House 
of Commons Benjamin Disraeli said “Upon the education of the 
people of this country the fate of this country depends”.  Those 
words cannot be more apposite today in our country.  We realize 
that to have the type of future economically we need Canadians 
who are among the best trained and best educated in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the need to get rid of our deficit we have taken 
concrete measures.  We have doubled the amount that one may 
contribute to a registered educational savings plan to help make 
education more accessible.  We have extended the relief period 
for interest on Canada student loans.  We have introduced tax 
deductions for the ancillary fees that students must pay to go to 
an institution of higher learning.  We have expanded the 
educational tax credit to make it easier for people to go back to 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1997 we established the Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation.  The federal government's contribution was $800 
million.  Together with support from the private sector we will 
lever it up to at least $2 billion.  These funds will be used to 
invest in new research and development in our universities, in 
our colleges and in our hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken another measure in the last two budgets.  I cite 
what we have done with charitable giving to our educational 
institutions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I was very proud that in the fall the prime minister 
announced that the government will establish and endow the 
millennium scholarship fund.  This fund will assist thousands 
upon thousands of deserving students who might otherwise have 
been deterred or prevented from obtaining post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our finance minister recently indicated, this is why the 
coming budget, and I venture to say succeeding budgets, will 
further address the issues of access to and excellence in 
education, recognizing the need to ensure that Canadians are 
among the best educated of all people in the world, where we 
truly recognize, as did Disraeli, that our future depends on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken a balanced approach, making investments today 
through social and economic programs that will strengthen our 
economy, strengthen our social fabric and strengthen in the days 
and years to come the ability of Canadians to compete in our 
global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our balanced program of investment in the future, of reducing 
taxes and of reducing our debt on a continuous and ongoing basis 
was something put to the Canadian people before the election last 
spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada chose a Liberal government that refuses to 
relegate Canadians who are in need or at risk to third class 
steerage on the <I>Titanic</I>.  Canadians want to continue a 
course that offers safe travelling and secure arrival and a 
prosperous future for all Canadians, not just the affluent or the 
advantaged.  This is the Liberal approach.  This is our balanced 
approach for the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment the minister on his speech.  I want to make 
a couple of comments and then ask him a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I think he misuses the <I>Titanic</I> analogy.  It is the 
government that is on the <I>Titanic</I> and the iceberg out there 
is the national debt.  If you hit that, you are going to tear a 
hole in the government, you are going to tear a hole in every 
social program funded by this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I was amused by his quoting Disraeli.  He of course is 
free to quote whoever he likes.  The minister realizes, of 
course, that Disraeli spent his entire life attacking and trying 
to destroy the British Liberal party under William Gladstone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also implied that Reform does not support federal 
spending.  I encourage him to read and study what was actually 
said.  We are prepared to support a spending program of $103 
billion in 1998.  That is exactly the same spending program in 
aggregate terms that the government is proposing.  What we are 
saying is we should freeze that for three years and give greater 
attention to this debt and tax problem which we say is looming 
larger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third comment before I get to my question is the minister 
talked about flexibility and the desire to protect the Canadian 
dollar against instability such as is registered in the Asian 
financial flu.  Surely the minister knows from his own background 
that the speculators that take a run at the Canadian dollar, or 
anybody else, look at your fundamentals.  They take a run at you 
when your fundamentals are not right.  It is true one of the 
fundamentals they look at is whether your budget is balanced, but 
the other fundamental they look at is your high debt levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the minister recognizes that we are carrying a lot of our 
debt on short term money.  A one and a half per cent increase in 
interest rates would add about $8 billion to interest charges in 
two years and blow the minister's projections for a balanced 
budget out the window.  Getting the debt down is one of the best 
protections you have against Asian financial flu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to my question.  I know the minister will like 
this because he has sometimes indicated in question period where 
his heart is.  He has admitted to the House that our tax levels 
are excessively high.  He must know that high taxes kill jobs and 
low taxes help create jobs.

unemployment rate is four points higher than the US. He knows 
that tinkering with taxes is not going to provide the tax relief 
required to stimulate real job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the name of jobs, why in the name of common sense, does 
the minister not become a champion of bold, vigorous, major, 
substantive tax relief within the Liberal cabinet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, our government, in its 
very first budget in 1994, saw the iceberg. We steered the ship 
of state around it, and this is why— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  The debt is underneath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  I think the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition would be pleased to hear more. We saw it. We avoided 
it. We were able, ahead of the schedule set for us by the Reform 
Party, to get our deficit under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take some credit on behalf of all government members in 
this House, but the Canadians who sacrificed to make this 
possible are the ones who deserve the credit as well. We avoided 
that iceberg and we have done it in such a way that we were able 
to almost inoculate ourselves perfectly against the Asian flu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about how the international markets have 
reacted to Canada. They have reacted better to the Canadian 
dollar than to any other currency except the U.S. dollar, which 
has always been a safe haven in difficult times. Ours has fallen 
less than any other currency against the American dollar. This is 
a sign of international confidence in Canada, but he talks about 
the debt we are committed to continuing to get it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about tax levels. Yes, we are committed to 
reducing taxes and we have already shown tangible examples of 
where we have reduced taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada today lies in the middle of the G-7 countries in terms of 
the total tax burden borne by Canadians. Higher than Canada are 
France, Germany and Italy, and lower than Canada are Japan, the 
U.S. and the United Kingdom. We have made one of the three prongs 
of our economic future that we will continue to reduce taxes. But 
we are not going to reduce taxes at the expense of people who are 
disadvantaged in our society, people who need health care, people 
who need learning, people who need education, families living in 
poverty, the disabled, people from the regions who deserve help. 
We are not going to do it at the expense of being able to reduce, 
on a reasonable basis, our debt burden. We are committed to that. 
We are doing it in a balanced fashion. That is the difference 
between us and the Reform Party. We are going to continue the 
paths which have proved so beneficial to Canadians over the past 
four years.

with interest to the minister's speech earlier and I want to come 
back to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about cutting taxes to persons with 
disabilities, but he gave us no data on that. What would the tax 
reduction be for an average individual who is disabled?  We know, 
for example, in the recent CPP changes, the pensions were slashed 
for folks with disabilities. 
What I would like to ascertain from the minister is what was the 
average reduction in taxes for persons with disabilities.

election the Liberal Party established a task force of Liberal 
members of Parliament, headed by our current solicitor general. 
The task force toured the country and came up with a very 
thoughtful and caring report which talked about the real costs of 
disabilities to many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general implication of the recommendation was that we should 
try to recognize the added costs that persons with disabilities 
must bear in order to be full and functioning members of our 
society and economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We undertook to start that process through enhanced credits for 
home care, for medicine, for new apparatus which they might need 
and those kinds of things, which would recognize the added 
burdens they have which do not give them a level playing field 
when it comes to being members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members opposite have suggestions as to how we might 
further enhance our support for the inclusiveness in our society 
of Canadians with disabilities, we would welcome their 
recommendations and suggestions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, I am pleased today to take part in 
this opposition day devoted to a debate proposed by my Reform Party 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I must say that my political party approves the 
principle behind the Reform statement to the effect that the 
government is “imperiling the economic and social security of 
Canadians with their reckless commitment to dramatically increase 
spending” at a time when “Canada has the highest personal income 
taxes in the G-7”.  I would add that the Minister of Finance's 
priorities are not fair to the average taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is clear that the federal government must stop 
spending and focus on running the country better.  However, the 
Bloc Quebecois' ideas for attaining this goal of reducing spending 
are a little different from those proposed by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by reminding members that last October's cross-country 
tour of major Canadian cities, and the comments made by 
organizations and individuals in the course of approximately 50 
meetings of the Standing Committee on Finance show that the country 
as a whole wants the Minister of Finance to change his political 
tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is clear about this: the Liberal government 
must call a halt to the cuts it has been making to provincial 
transfer payments since 1993 and, in particular, forget about the 
$30 billion it was planning to cut over the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance must give back to the provinces the 
amounts he has cut and must certainly not launch costly new 
programs with national standards that would interfere in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.  In Quebec and throughout the rest of 
Canada, the public continues to condemn the Liberal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is largely responsible for the 
deterioration in Quebec's health services and for student debt, for 
our young people being crushed under the weight of the tax burden 
imposed by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December, Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard, made an 
interesting proposal to the Minister of Finance.  This proposal 
reflected the wishes of all Quebeckers. 
The wonderful surpluses soon to be announced by the Minister of 
Finance should be used as follows:  25% to make up for cuts to 
transfer payments and 75% to ease some of the load on taxpayers. 
That is a realistic suggestion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, the Minister of Finance ought to abolish 
the employment tax, or in other words reduce employment insurance 
contributions by employers and workers, and labour and management 
are unanimous on this. Even the chambers of commerce throughout the 
country are insisting that the Minister of Finance decrease 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what is the Minister of Finance waiting for before taking 
concrete action in response to these demands?  He cannot take 
action, understandably, because he continues to dip into the 
employment insurance fund in order to reduce his deficit. 
What the Minister of Finance will be announcing to us shortly is, 
in actual fact, nothing more than a simple mathematical operation 
and the pseudo-surpluses will in actual fact be nothing more than 
the amounts he has taken out of the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules as they stand still allow the Minister of Finance to 
dip into these funds, which were contributed solely by businesses 
and workers, and which, let us remember, now add up to about $12 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind too that the auditor general also 
strongly recommends an annual report on all employment insurance 
activities, so that the Canadian people may know how this program 
is really being administered.  To this too the Minister of Finance 
turns a deaf ear.  He continues to obstinately pursue the policies 
he has always favoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now tell you about another solution which could help 
alleviate the taxpayers' fiscal burden, namely having better control 
over the numerous service charges created in recent years by various 
federal departments and agencies. The figures are alarming. These 
federal agencies implemented service charges when the Minister of 
Finance authorized them to do so in 1995. The minister stated at that 
time that it was appropriate to charge such new fees in order to finance 
part of the programs and services provided by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is paying for this new approach? The taxpayer. Let me give you 
some examples of increased service charges by federal agencies: a head 
tax of $975 for each new immigrant coming to Canada; administration fees 
for a passport raised from $35 to $60. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure directly affects families and outdoor enthusiasts: 
in 1995-96, $35 million in entrance fees was collected from users of our 
lovely national campgrounds, and these fees almost doubled in 1996-97, 
totalling over $61 million. Today, access to national camping facilities 
costs more than to private ones. How can these hidden taxes imposed with 
the finance minister's blessing be justified when the people of Quebec 
and Canada are already taxed to death? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pre-budget consultations clearly showed, once again, that there 
are two economic visions in the country. The federal government wants to 
centralize everything, establish national standards and continue to 
infringe on the exclusive rights of the provinces. As for Quebec, it 
leads a daily fight to protect its autonomy against this centralizing 
government. 
It takes all kinds of actions to ensure that the federal government 
respects provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is simply asking the Minister of Finance to give 
the provinces their money back. The minister must correct the social 
injustice he created for those directly affected by his financial 
decisions, namely the unemployed, students and low income people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do the finance minister's real interests lie? In the coming 
months, the Bloc Quebecois will speak as often as necessary, here in 
this House and everywhere in Quebec, to get the point across to the 
Liberal government. Between now and budget day, we will insist that the 
Minister of Finance finally see the light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand up for Quebec, whose federal transfer payments were 
drastically cut these past few years. 
Also, the Minister of Finance has to stop dipping into employment 
insurance surpluses and ask his colleague, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, to amend the Employment Insurance Act to make it 
more accessible and compassionate for the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, we ask that future surpluses be used by the federal 
government to do justice to the province. Moreover, the government must 
implement job creation initiatives. Finally, it must be truly responsive 
to the needs of our people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with some interest and bewilderment to some of the 
comments actually coming from the hon. member opposite 
representing the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard was a speech on what we should do better in 
running the finances of Canada.  I made some notes.  I heard him 
suggest that we should reduce the employment insurance premiums, 
increase transfer payments to the provinces, cut the fees 
currently charged to new immigrants, cut the increased cost of 
passports, reduce user fees in our parks and we should 
redistribute money to students, seniors and people along those 
lines.  This is interesting advice coming from a member of party 
that is dedicated to destroying the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why we would be given such advice when in fact his 
party's stated goal is open.  There is no question that it is 
honest about its goal in this country.  I find it rather curious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member talk in terms of two visions.  He said one 
was of a central government in this country based here in Ottawa 
with more power and more responsibility in the hands of the 
national government.  The other vision that he talked about was 
one of decentralization, one that gave more power to the 
provinces.  However, the member must admit that there clearly is 
in this place a third vision that is propagated by his party 
which is to secede from the federation known as Canada. I find it 
somewhat at opposite ends of the particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the member.  If indeed he believes that 
we should increase transfer payments to the provincial 
government, and most notably to the province that he represents, 
the province of Quebec, why would he vote against Bill C-28 
yesterday in this place which clearly did exactly that and 
replaced the transfer payment level back to $12.5 billion?  Is 
this really just a game or is the party opposite giving us 
legitimate advice that all Canadians would benefit from?  Or is 
it strictly looking at it in a myopic and self-centred fashion 
for the province of Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I need not remind my hon. 
colleague opposite that the top priority for the Bloc Quebecois and its 
44 members sitting in this House is to get Quebec out of the federal 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> But in the meantime, we want justice. I did 
not ask that transfer payments be increased, just that the government 
give us what is owed to us, the amount of the cuts made since 1993. That 
is all we are asking from the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois advocate sovereignty for Quebec. 
But in the meantime, until the Quebec people chooses sovereignty, count 
on us to defend in this federal Parliament the interests of Quebec, 
which are tied to its exclusive jurisdictions: health and education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are also going to intervene in coming months in 
this House is to put the brakes on the numerous standards the 
government across the way wants to set in its attempts to interfere 
in exclusively provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat: the Bloc Quebecois is here to defend the interests 
of Quebec.  The Bloc Quebecois is here in this House to promote the 
sovereignty of Quebec, so be prepared in coming months to see us 
keeping a vigilant eye over the way you are going to administer our 
money.  What we in Quebec want above all is to get what is due to 
us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to comment on the 
member's remark that he would like justice.  I must ask if there 
is justice if his party continues to wish to separate from Canada 
when the aboriginal people in his province would like to stay 
within Canada.  Is there justice when the majority of Quebeckers 
would like to stay within Canada while his party continues to 
insist that it would like to separate? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, what all 
Quebeckers, whether aboriginal, anglophone or francophone, are 
demanding is to be the ones who determine the future of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see that the hon. member across the way 
has so many concerns, but I would like to find out his opinion on 
his party's offensive relating to the reference to the supreme 
court.  I would like to know if he will be equally objective when 
it becomes obvious that his federal allies in Quebec are now 
denouncing the way the Liberal Party of Canada is handling things, 
denouncing the fact that the future of Quebec has to go through 
federal courts, which do the thinking for the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, before he gives us any lectures about the aboriginal 
people, I would like to ask his opinion of this objectivity, this 
great democratic spirit which his government seems to be trying to 
show with this reference to the supreme court.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate 
this morning.  This debate gives us a chance to talk about 
priorities with respect to the upcoming budget, a subject very 
much on the minds of Canadians across the country.  We are 
debating a resolution introduced by the official opposition to 
reveal what its budget priorities would be in respect to the 
upcoming budget.  The opposition tries to build its case for the 
further erosion of government spending in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have been quite specific about what they see as the 
formula.  It involves a 50% tax reduction. They argue that 50% of 
any dividend from the reductions in our deficit should go toward 
debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the Leader of the Opposition as he spoke 
in this House concerning this resolution.  I heard him speak not 
a single word about real investment in this country, in its 
infrastructure or in the well-being of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing was said to acknowledge the damage and destruction that 
has befallen the health care system over the past three years 
because of the misplaced priorities of the Liberal government. 
Nothing was said to acknowledge that we presently have a severe 
access problem in Canada with respect to young people getting the 
education they need.  Nothing was said about the crumbling 
infrastructure. Nothing was said to acknowledge that we as a 
modern nation are doing very little and less than every other 
OECD country with respect to research and development in Canada. 
This is very serious in the area of medical research, for 
example.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing to acknowledge that their propositions and 
proposals would further erode any commitment to community based 
economic development and any commitment to address regional 
inequalities in this country.  Much less there is no indication 
whatsoever that they recognize the urgency of doing something to 
introduce a national child care program, a national pharmacare 
program and some significant infrastructure to provide home care 
for the people who are suffering as a result of health care cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are suffering because the population is aging and less 
adequate health care is available to them.  There is a big burden 
being heaped on to families and on to communities that do not 
have the resources to provide that home care which is desperately 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform advocates a cut in direct spending by another $8.9 
billion.  Let us be clear that the bulk of these cuts would hit 
unemployed workers, would hit regional development, would hit 
equalization payments to the poorer provinces in this country and 
would further erode any national commitment to Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party does not seem content with the federal Liberal 
cuts in government spending.  Let us be clear that those federal 
Liberal cuts have brought spending in Canada to a level not seen 
since 1949-50. I remember when the federal finance minister 
introduced the budget.  He congratulated himself on reducing 
spending to 12% of the GDP, a level not seen in this country for 
45 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Reform leader recognize that there has been some damage 
done in the process?  Does the Reform Party leader recognize that 
yes, Canadians want to see responsible fiscal management but in 
the main, Canadians feel that the Liberal government has already 
gone too far and we have to do something about the damage and the 
devastation that has been wreaked by this recklessness. What do 
we see instead?  We see the Reform Party arguing that we should 
go even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurred to me as I listened this morning first to the Reform 
Party leader and then the spokesman for the Liberal government 
that what we are hearing once again are Liberals and Reformers 
talking about running Canada the way a business is run. It may 
seem like not a bad analogy to talk about being responsible and 
to talk about being able to balance budgets and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they do not seem to want to run Canada's business in 
the way someone would run a business if they actually expected 
that business to succeed, if they actually intended that business 
to grow and prosper. They want to run Canada like it is the 
target of a hostile takeover, not a flourishing business; sell 
off the assets, lay off the employees, take the money and run, 
move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform and the Liberals treat Canada like a bad investment. 
“Pull your money out,” they say, “the stock is worthless”. 
Where will Canada be in 20 years if the finance minister and the 
federal government keep following that Reform vision for Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where will we be if Korea has invested in the education of its 
children and the skills of its workers while young Canadians are 
marching on the streets?  Where will Canada be if the U.S. and 
Chile invest in a modern transportation network while we allow 
ours to crumble further? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen to the competitive advantage medicare gives us 
in labour costs for example, not to mention our national pride 
and attending to the health of the people of our nation, if we 
allow it to shrivel further and die on the vine?

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past five years this country has been caught in the 
confines of the narrow vision and the shrivelled horizon of the 
right wing debate.  Not content with the growing inequalities its 
prescriptions having engendered, Reform wants to further 
dismantle the ability of government to act in the public interest 
and turn over still more of our economic life to the whims of the 
free market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was listening to the Reform leader's advocacies in this 
House this morning, I was in my office meeting with a group of 
Canadians who are desperately concerned about what we are doing 
to the lives of children and families in this country.  They are 
very concerned about what it does both to the lives of individual 
children and the soul of a nation for the government to be 
contributing through its calculated deliberate adopted policies 
to the growth of poverty among our children.  They are concerned 
about what it does to the lives of people and to the future of 
this nation to be fueling those policies advocated by Reform and 
adopted by the Liberals, to be increasing day in and day out the 
inequality, the gap between the super rich and everyone else in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How about giving them a real job? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B> Nothing in any of the proposals put 
forward this morning deal with that fundamental challenge.  We 
hear one of the Reform members say, “How about giving people a 
real job?”  That is a good start.  That might be one of the few 
things that has ever come from the Reform benches with which I 
agree.  Let us look at the question of what it means to be 
concerned about making sure that people have jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not hear the Reform Party saying this, but it is absolutely 
true that until last month individual Canadians, children and 
families, were living with an unemployment level above 9% for 86 
consecutive months. Finally that unemployment level for the first 
time has come down a little bit and we have the government saying 
its policies are working, that it has the economic fundamentals 
right.  We have Reform egging the Liberals on saying, “Therefore 
let us cut government funding even further, let us cause even 
more devastation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party were serious and if the government were 
serious about making jobs the centrepiece of its economic and 
social platform, for starters it would look at what it has done 
to erode the potential for jobs in this country because of the 
massive cuts to research that have taken place. Let me just zero 
in for a minute on the issue of medical research.  This is a real 
challenge that we face in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last decade we have seen an erosion in the commitment 
to medical research in this country that puts Canada in the very 
worst position among the G-7 nations.  I want to refer to an 
excellent paper that was presented by the associate dean of 
medicine at Dalhousie University in my home riding of Halifax. 
Dr. Dickson, the author of that paper, has put forward a very 
compelling set of facts and arguments why this government has to 
face up to the fact that it has caused a steady erosion of 
commitment to medical research over the last decade and what the 
implications of having done that are for the future prospects in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be an argument made that there is no better way. 
This is an argument which in fact has been advanced by the OECD. 
There is no better way to advance the development of jobs in this 
country than to recognize the need to invest in research.  In so 
doing we not only end up with a better educated nation, we end up 
with a better infrastructure and an increased capability to 
generate jobs, the kind of high wage jobs, the high end jobs, the 
value added jobs that are part of the new economy if we take it 
seriously and we seize that challenge.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But what do we hear from Reform?  We hear advocacies that would 
take us in the direction of the worst kind of low paid jobs, 
unprotected because the marketplace is going to do it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity recently to spend five days meeting with a 
group of political economists, academic researchers in the Boston 
area from Harvard, Brandeis, Boston University and MIT.  They had 
some warnings for Canadians with respect to where the Reform 
Party is trying to drive this country and the fact that the 
Liberal Party seems all too willing to accommodate the advocacies 
of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did those American political economists say to us?  They 
said not to be too impressed by the unemployment level in the 
U.S. which is at 4.7% today.  Frankly that surprised us because 
on the face of it, it looks like exactly what we would want.  But 
that is what they said and we must heed their advice because not 
to heed their advice is a very short-sighted thing for us to do. 
They said, “If you keep pursuing the kinds of policies that the 
Government of Canada has been pursuing in recent years, very much 
advocated by the Reform Party, you will end up with jobs that are 
unprotected, jobs that are inadequate in their pay, jobs that 
have no security and no future attached to them.  You want to 
look very carefully at what kind of country you are going to end 
up with”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of country we are going to end up with is exactly what 
those folks who were in my office wanted to talk to me today 
about with respect to policies affecting children and families. 
The kind of country we end up with when those are the kinds of 
new jobs we create when at the same time there is a greater 
amassing and concentration of wealth among the most privileged in 
society is a Canada that is badly divided, where the social 
fabric is being torn apart, where there is greater insecurity, 
where there are increased levels of violence and in the end where 
social solidarity is shattered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us resist those continuing advocacies from the Reform Party. 
Let us persuade the Liberal government that there is a better 
way, that there is a fairer way for us to move forward.  That 
means we have to recognize that investing is what a budget is 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party wants to only talk about spending and not recognize 
that what we are talking about is investing in our children, 
investing in our families, investing in our communities, 
investing in our futures.  They want to always talk about taxes 
as if it is something that people throw out their window.  Taxes 
are an investment and taxes are our way of sharing as a society 
in the burdens and the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to put forward some of these 
concerns.  Let us heed the voices of those on behalf of children 
and families in this country.  Understand the difference between 
spending and investing.  Understand the difference between the 
notion of taxation as some form of punishment and the notion of 
taxation as a fair way, as a cost effective way for us to ensure 
that we have our social and economic infrastructure on a sound 
footing and that we are going to be in a position to move 
forward, to harness the benefits of the new prosperity if we have 
invested wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can make sure that we can offer our young people a sound 
future, a promising future if we recognize the need to invest in 
their education and in their well-being.  Fundamentally that is a 
question of priorities.

pursue the kind of divisive policies they keep advocating, as we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
nothing focuses the mind like bankruptcy, particularly the 
bankruptcy of a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member were staring the budget deficit of $42 
billion or $28 billion or $8.9 billion in the face, what would 
she have not done that we have done the past year?  Would she 
have not paid down $16 billion on the debt? Would she have not 
cut EI premiums by $1.4 billion, 1% of the government's revenues? 
Would she have not given an $850 million tax credit, with a 
further tax credit to come, for children? Would she not have 
restored $12.5 billion to the cash component of the CHST? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which parts of these programs would she not have done, because 
these parts of our program do show our values that one has to be 
fiscally responsible.  One has to be focused.  It is fine to talk 
rhetoric, but I would like to hear the hon. member tell us which 
one of those programs would she not have engaged in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say first of all 
that the member opposite is absolutely right to talk in terms of 
fiscal responsibility.  Let me repeat what I know the member is 
well aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party brought forward a very clear set of 
priorities that would have resulted in the balancing of the 
budget.  It would have resulted in the elimination of the deficit 
ahead of the deficit reduction targets of the Liberal government 
and the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference is that it would have done so at a lower level of 
unemployment.  In other words we would have accepted the 
challenge, we absolutely accept the challenge of eliminating the 
deficit.  There is more than one way to achieve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the Liberal government chose to achieve it was to wipe 
out over $7 billion in social spending for health, education and 
for basic social support services for children and families in 
this society, and then congratulated itself for eliminating the 
deficit.  But the government completely failed to recognize that 
there is not just a fiscal deficit to be concerned about, there 
is a social deficit.  What that means is that we have added to 
the health deficit in this country.  We have added to the 
education deficit in this country.  We have added the burdens 
that make it all the more difficult for us to move forward in 
this country from a position of strength.  Now those deficits 
have to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite asks a perfectly fair and reasonable 
question.  What would the New Democratic Party have done instead? 
Would we have said to heck with the deficit?  Not at all.  We put 
forward a program that would have eliminated the deficit ahead of 
the finance minister's targets, but we would have done it through 
growth in the economy.  We would have done it by making jobs the 
number one priority, which is what Canadians want and what they 
still want, instead of saying we will continue to live with over 
a million and a half Canadians remaining unemployed.  At least 
that many or more are continuing to be severely underemployed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether the member could think of a defence when 
given those two choices, either choosing in favour of reducing 
the deficit while unemployment remains at highly inflated levels 
or whether he would agree that it is a question of having 
different choices available and choosing the one which has done 
the most damage to people instead of the one which would have 
strengthened the economy and allowed us to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about us being bankrupt in this country.  It is 
very hard to make a case for bankruptcy as being the lot of many 
Canadians when we look at the record profits which corporations 
have amassed over the last couple of years.  The bank sector 
alone has made profits of over $7 billion.  That is where the 
money is. It is not a question of there not being any money. 
Canada is wealthier than it has ever been in its history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions are what are we doing with that wealth?  How are 
we reinvesting that wealth for the benefit of all Canadians, not 
just for the benefit of a privileged few?  What are we doing to 
make sure we strengthen the base, the foundation, on which all 
Canadians can move forward to share in the benefits of the new 
economy and to know that our country is headed in a direction 
which really deals with the basic needs and priorities of 
Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party for 
participating in the debate today.  However, I want to challenge 
her thesis that if we spend more somehow the debt will decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the hon. member that in 
Saskatchewan the New Democratic Party took quite a different 
view.  In fact, it dramatically cut spending for such things as 
hospitals and it actually ended up balancing the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practice the NDP actually does something quite different from 
what it says.  I wanted to point that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that for 30 years we have been spending 
more than we have been bringing in.  The result has not been that 
we have eliminated the deficit.  In fact, it is quite the 
contrary.  We have built up a debt of $600 billion.  The only way 
the government could finally wrestle it down was to cut spending. 
Granted it did it in the wrong areas, but that is how it 
eventually did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could create jobs by spending more we would all have three 
jobs.  I do not think that a $600 billion debt and 8.6% 
unemployment point to a formula for creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that when the debt rises to $600 billion it is low 
income Canadians who pay the most.  We have a situation now where 
the average family in this country pays $6,000 a year in taxes as 
its share of the interest on the debt.  The interest on the debt 
has eaten the heart out of social programs.  There have been 
dramatic cuts made to health care and higher education to the 
tune of 35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see how the hon. member can say that somehow if we 
spend more it will be good for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to point out that because we have spent so much 
we cannot afford the tax relief which low income Canadians need. 
A single mother making $15,000 a year still pays $1,300 in taxes. 
I do not think the hon. member thinks that is socially just.  I 
ask the hon. member, if that is not socially just, why does she 
not support a plan which would reduce taxes for people like that 
single mother and leave that money in her pocket so she can look 
after her child and guide her life the way she chooses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for the second time 
this morning I actually agree with one of the positions put 
forward, which was the very last point the Reform member made. 
Let me say that whenever I think those policies are fair and just 
I have no hesitation in embracing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there should be a tax cut.  There absolutely should be a 
tax cut for those at the lowest income levels who are paying an 
unfair portion of tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is nice to know that the Reform Party has finally come 
on board in supporting the NDP position to cut the GST.  It is 
certainly an improvement over where it was when it was advocating 
that we should actually increase the GST and start taxing food as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that policy is paltry and token compared to the other 
so-called tax reform policies that the Reform Party advocates. 
Let us look at the proposal to cut the capital gains tax in half. 
This is nothing but a tax break for the wealthy.  By making only 
37.5% of capital gains subject to income tax rather than 75%, 
this would give those earning $250,000 a year a tax cut of 
$40,000 each and every year.  Is that the Reform Party's notion 
of tax fairness? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, sound 
economic policy requires courage, diligence and, very 
important, consistency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Reform Party wanted to cut spending by $12 
billion.  Now it wants to put a cap on current spending.  Its 
policy has changed somewhat on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Reform Party was focused on tax reduction and now 
its current strategy is to focus on attacking the debt largely 
due to recent polls of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all waiting with bated breath for the next position de 
jour of the Reform Party on these important fiscal issues.  It is 
an interesting spectacle to watch the party of prairie populism 
evolve into the party of prairie poll mongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party stands firm on our campaign 
commitment to reduce taxes and increase economic activity to 
benefit all Canadians.  The leader of the Reform Party 
acknowledged earlier today, in speaking about the fiscal 
dividend, that it has taken 15 years to eliminate this deficit 
monster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appreciate that the leader of the Reform Party recognizes 
that the steps necessary to reduce and eliminate the deficit 
began 15 years ago under the PC government of Brian Mulroney who 
was responsible for introducing the structural changes in the 
Canadian economy which were largely responsible for putting in 
place fundamental changes such as the free trade policy, which 
the Liberals fought vociferously, the GST, which the Liberals 
fought vociferously and now claim to have invented, the 
deregulation of the financial services industry, transportation 
and energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took nine years of Conservative government to undo many of 
the counterproductive, interventionist policies of Liberal 
governments which had effectively rendered the Canadian economy 
incapable of moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the role that the PC government made, 
especially in the early 1990s, in courageously moving forward 
with these policies which laid the groundwork for the elimination 
of this country's deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary Canadians have yet to benefit from this current jobless 
recovery and ordinary Canadians deserve a piece of the pie.  The 
PC party's growth agenda will provide each Canadian with a bigger 
slice of what will be a significantly bigger pie.  The PC party 
has been extraordinarily clear on this policy and we have not 
shifted to acknowledge any change in poll numbers like others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the leader of the Reform Party said earlier, after 
a meeting with pollsters, he was told that Canadians feel this 
government is weak.  We did not have to consult with pollsters to 
realize that this Liberal government is extraordinarily weak.  We 
were able to probably save a significant amount of money in 
drawing that conclusion on our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's policy strategy changes are somewhat like the 
weather and one can only assume that El Nino has influenced its 
current position.  There seems to be an ongoing competition 
between them Reform Party and El Nino in terms of which one can 
blow the most hot air from the west.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to believe—and we are resolute in this—that broad 
based tax reductions to help put money back into the pockets of 
ordinary Canadians cannot wait until later.  They are needed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High taxes kill jobs.  It is critical to recognize that between 
1989 and 1993 the Progressive Conservative government reduced 
taxes as a per cent of GDP from 14% to 13% from 1989 to 1993. The 
Liberals have since increased personal income taxes as a 
percentage of GDP from 13% to 14%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High taxes reduce disposable income in two ways: reduction in 
the paycheques of Canadians and reduction in the amount of money 
they have to pursue their dreams and to attain the goals they set 
for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term reduction in economic growth that results from a 
reduction in lower incentive to work and invest is another toll 
that high taxes put on the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Industry Canada report “Keeping up with the Joneses” cites 
an increasing gap in the standard of living between Americans and 
Canadians.  The take home pay of Canadians has been reduced 
remarkably compared with that of our U.S. counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question could be what are the Americans doing that we are 
not doing in Canada.  The question really should be what they are 
not doing.  They are not taxing the population to death in the 
U.S.  That is what we are doing in Canada and we have to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High payroll taxes are one of the most detrimental impediments 
to job creation in Canada.  We must move to reduce EI premiums. 
High income taxes and high payroll taxes continue to damage the 
Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at the impact that has occurred with the brain 
drain.  Young Canadians graduating from university and in order 
to pay the egregiously high level of student debt they are 
carrying are having to go to the U.S. to receive higher pay and 
to pay less taxes.  They do not want to go to the U.S., but they 
are forced to by a Canadian Liberal government that is not 
acknowledging the need for change in form of tax reform now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the industry minister in a November 8 article in the 
Toronto <I>Sun</I>.  He said “Taxpayers who have more money in 
their pockets would have more money to spend.  Tax cuts increase 
domestic consumption”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister should talk more often with the finance 
minister.  Tax cuts would put more money in the hands of ordinary 
Canadians and empower Canadians to determine their own financial 
futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals boast of creating a surplus but the Minister of 
Finance will not even give the finance committee the updated 
projection figures from last October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next federal budget must send a clear signal that at least 
one-third of the fiscal dividend will be used to reduce the tax 
burden on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should commit to further reducing excessive EI 
premiums to offset the proposed CPP premium increases.  We also 
have to consider an appropriate framework for the setting of 
public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a question merely of the size of government, albeit 
government is far too large in Canada by about 16% of our GDP. 
Nine per cent of our GDP is going toward paying interest. It is a 
question of definition of government and the role of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What things should government be doing that it is currently not 
doing?  What things is government doing now that it could do 
differently or could cease doing?  What things could government 
pursue?  What new initiatives could government pursue which would 
result in investment in the future of young Canadians in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1993 and today the Liberal government cut 
indiscriminately.  It cut not just fat but bones, tissue and 
marrow.  It cut the hearts out of many Canadians, especially in 
Atlantic Canada where the impact of those cuts has been extremely 
devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having cut indiscriminately it is preparing to spend 
indiscriminately.  Nothing incites a feeding frenzy in the 
Liberal caucus faster than the smell of hard currency around the 
snouts of hungry Liberal backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be interesting to see, as the weeks unfold, how the 
Liberal government and the finance minister slash leadership 
candidate response to the demands of his own caucus on new 
spending initiatives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any new spending initiatives on the part of the government must 
be based on strategic investment criteria that will improve 
Canada's comparative advantage internationally, especially in a 
global society.  We need to ensure a set of criteria is applied 
to every new spending initiative.  This would provide for 
Canadians an improved comparative advantage in the future and 
would not simply be another pork barrel policy of government 
waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the example of medical research.  Canada is the 
only G-7 country that has decreased its investment in medical 
research and development funding over the past several years. 
Canada spends $8 per capita on medical research compared with the 
U.S. which spends $60 per capita.  Under the Liberal government 
MRC funding has been cut to 1987 levels in constant dollars. 
During the past five years the U.S. has increased funding to its 
sister councils by 80%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a global context, our largest trading partner is investing 
heavily in research and development.  It is making a commitment 
to strategic investment and creating a centre of excellence for 
medical technology in the U.S.  It frightens me to recognize the 
impact of our failure to respond to this investment and our 
failure to invest similarly in Canada in the long term 
competitiveness of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Post-secondary education is another area that has a direct 
affect on Canadian competitiveness as we enter the 21st century. 
Student debt has risen by 280% in recent years.  Tuition costs 
have increased by 110%.  It is interesting to note that a four 
year university program in Canada will saddle the average student 
with about $25,000 worth of debt.  Similarly a four year program 
in the U.S. will leave an American with about $18,000 worth of 
student debt in Canadian currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are making higher education in Canada not less but more 
expensive.  The burden on our young people as they carry this 
into the workplace is significant.  It will impact considerably 
on their ability to produce as citizens of Canada and to produce 
within a global arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by the Maritime Provinces Higher Education 
Commission found that 82% of grade 12 students in Atlantic Canada 
were interested in higher education.  However, 55% of these 
students say that they will not be able to achieve higher 
education for financial reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, when the Liberals gained power, only eight students in 
Atlantic Canada carried a student debt greater than $30,000. That 
number has grown over the past five years to the point that today 
there are over 900 students in Atlantic Canada with a student 
debt greater than $30,000 upon graduation.  The figure has gone 
from eight students to nine hundred in five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada has been particularly hard hit, as have all 
Canadians, by the Liberal government's attack on higher 
education.  I am proud of Nova Scotia's strong heritage as a 
cradle of higher education in Canada.  The decimation of 
opportunities in higher education by the Liberal government and 
its slash and burn policies have inflicted irrevocable damage on 
the future competitiveness of young Canadians.  It is a sad 
legacy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party said this week that debt should be Canada's 
number one priority in order to reduce the debt to GDP ratio. 
There is another way to reduce debt to GDP ratio.  We certainly 
acknowledge that the debt must be reduced.  The other way is to 
actually grow the GDP.  Spending initiatives based on the right 
criteria, including the criterion of competitiveness, will 
actually bolster the competitiveness of young Canadians.  It is 
possible that certain strategic spending initiatives can improve 
the GDP ratio and grow the economy faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we focus on cutting the debt and refuse to acknowledge the 
issues of student debt, consumer debt or personal bankruptcy, all 
of which have been growing remarkably over the past several years 
in Canada, we fail Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The national debt is one debt, but the social debt that is being 
paid by ordinary Canadians in the balancing of the budget over 
the past few years has been similarly damaging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in our young people is a worthy objective.  Our party 
believes that we need to couple strategic investment with debt 
reduction and tax relief.  The Reform Party may over the next 
several weeks change its policy or emphasis again, but ours will 
remain constant.  Our belief is that Canadians will succeed with 
a lower debt.  Canadians will succeed when provided with lower 
taxation.  Canadians will succeed with a government which is able 
to redefine its role relative to the Canadian people and to make 
strategic investments in the areas which will truly impact 
positively on the future of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By cutting transfers the Liberals have effectively shifted debt 
and financial responsibility to the provinces.  Similarly the 
provinces have shifted responsibility to municipalities. 
Municipalities have shifted responsibility to ordinary Canadians. 
The growth in personal debt and the growth in bankruptcies, all 
such issues, have come from initial decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals really did not cut the expensive, wasteful, 
bureaucratic and redundant spending that they could have cut. 
Instead they tackled the debt by dealing with cuts to the 
provinces.  We can offload a lot of things to the provinces.  One 
thing we should not offload as a government and one thing this 
government has done is effectively to offload leadership.

need to ensure that all Canadians have an opportunity to invest

Canadian economy is healthy and individuals can function 
competitively in a knowledge based society, without the 
impediments of fat, ineffective or interventionist governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member, the new finance critic, for participating 
in the debate today.  I congratulate him on his post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to set the record straight with respect to what my friend 
said vis-à-vis Reform Party policy on debt.  As my friend knows, 
last fall the party engaged in a round of consultations with 
Canadians across the country.  We specifically went out to hear 
what Canadians had to say.  Canadians said very clearly that they 
saw the debt as the number one issue across the country.  My 
friend may mock this but the polls in fact confirm that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one will ever accuse the Conservative Party of listening too 
closely to Canadians.  We know that.  I think people who remember 
Brian Mulroney will attest to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my friend a question.  We heard a salute to Brian 
Mulroney from my hon. friend.  He lauded the Conservative record, 
the record where they increased taxes 71 times, the record where 
they added $300 billion to the debt, the record where they led 
Canada into the worst recession outside the great depression that 
the country has ever seen, and the record where we saw the trust 
in politicians eroded to new lows because of that prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because he seems to think that the previous record was so good, 
is hon. friend suggesting that a new Conservative government 
would continue with the self same policies that gave us those 
record debts, record taxes and record deficits that we had under 
Mulroney? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
of the member for Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On government by polls, I do not pay a lot of attention to 
polls.  My party and I determine economic policy which will best 
lead Canadians into the 21st century.  His party had polled that 
my riding would go Reform last election.  I would not be here if 
those polls had been correct.  Therefore I tend to focus on sound 
economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I refer to the Conservative government as having been 
extraordinarily important in laying the structural changes 
necessary to eliminate the deficit, those were not completely my 
own words. 
Those came from the <I>Economist</I> in its preview of the world 
1998, which said specifically that much of the credit for deficit 
reduction in Canada belongs to the Conservative government of the 
early 1990s which introduced free trade, GST and deregulation of 
the financial services industry, transportation and the petroleum 
industry. I suggest that perhaps there are more people than 
simply I who credit the Conservative Party for what it achieved 
in the early 1990s.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about trusting politicians and doing one thing and 
saying another, I think Brian Mulroney was, for instance, 
portrayed by the leader of the Reform Party as being a fake. 
Brian Mulroney did not dye his hair. Brian Mulroney did not have 
his teeth done. Brian Mulroney did not have his eyes operated on, 
and yet they refer to Brian Mulroney as a fake. Let us give 
credit where credit is due.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was going to say something, but I thought the jousting 
between the two parties on the right was more appropriately 
described as the reason why they are both on that side of the 
House and the reason they are going to remain on that side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member on his new elevation in 
terms of this very significant, very important work he is going 
to be undertaking on the committee. But it seems to me that like 
his brethren and friends and, I guess, former political alliances 
in the Reform Party, they too have not only a case of amnesia but 
do not understand their own policies that they have articulated 
in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that the motion today is being 
presented by a member whose party, in a very short period of 
time, has gone from zero in three to the taxpayers budget, a 
fresh start, securing your future, yadda, yadda, yadda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that party has really not got it right yet. It is 
one of the reasons it is not on this side of the House and the 
Canadian public understands that very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with the question and the comments that were 
raised by the hon. member in his defence of Brian Mulroney, and 
perhaps a bit of advice. If he drops that, he might find himself 
a bit more successful in the long run because the Canadian 
people, as we know, are always right. They full well know that in 
terms of the budget and in terms of the situation this government 
inherited in 1993, the $42 billion deficit was something that was 
accelerated by his government and the person he is now praising. 
That is a problem we inherited, it is a problem we are dealing 
with, and I think we are dealing with it very successfully as 
adjudged by the Canadian people last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election the Conservative Party seemed to have a bit 
of trouble with its platform. It suggested that one-third, once 
we achieved the point of reducing or removing or eliminating the 
deficit, would ultimately be spent on tax reduction. The rest was 
sort of put toward the balanced budget approach, the balancing of 
the ultimate deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member could clarify, since it seems that 
there is a huge contradiction in his statement. The hon. 
member is so concerned about the outcome of young people and 
students in this country who are engaged in education, 
particularly in his region. I can assure him that there are 
universities right across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member perhaps illustrate to us the conflict, the 
problem he sees in saying that we are going to reduce the 
deficit, reduce the debt, give people all this tax money back and 
achieve the objective of higher education?  How does he do it 
when he has increased the burden on ordinary Canadians, as 
evidenced by his friend, Brian Mulroney? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's comments, and perhaps we should ask him to translate 
yadda, yadda, yadda. Sometimes these are very complex, 
mathematical and economic equations and perhaps I could lend him 
a calculator. One-third plus one-third plus one-third equals one, 
and what we are suggesting is one-third for debt reduction, one 
third for tax reduction and one third for sound, strategic 
investments in the future competitiveness of Canadians. 
I do not think this is particularly difficult but I would gladly 
sit down with the hon. member after we are finished and we can do 
the math ourselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we resume 
debate, in the questions and comments period in the future we are 
going to try to give a few more people an opportunity to ask 
questions.  By doing that if there is an indication, during the 
debate or during the initial presentation, of a great interest in 
speaking, if members would indicate to the Chair your interest in 
asking a question, the Chair will then have some idea how many 
people are interested in intervening.  Or if hon. members stand 
initially we can figure out in our minds how much time should be 
reserved for each intervention and each response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, if five people stand, then there might be five one 
minute interventions and one minute responses.  This would give 
all hon. members a better chance to speak on issues.  This is 
something we are going to try to work out much as we have done in 
question period since the beginning of this Parliament to see if 
we can work this into debate as well.  There is no intention to 
make this a hard and fast rule. We have to try to live with the 
feeling and the mood of the House at the time. Just so people 
know, it might make things more interesting in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a point of order, the hon. member for St. Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was listening to your 
announcement from the Chair because I am not aware that this has 
been agreed to by the parties.  Of course, as you are aware, the 
Speaker is a servant of the House and not the master of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in finding out how you are going to police this 
new policy that you seem to be introducing and springing on the 
members right here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Certainly there 
would not be any intention to police.  It is not a new policy. 
It is something that has worked very well in question period.  It 
is deemed to have worked very well in question period and it has 
in the last session.  We have tried it from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I think I clearly said, it is purely at the pleasure 
of the House.  It is not an intention of the Chair to impose 
anything.  It is merely a suggestion that perhaps we could 
accommodate more members if we were to be more liberal or less 
liberal in our approach; more reform or perhaps more conservative 
and less liberal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say to my hon. friend from  St. Albert that I think 
the Sergeant-at-Arms does carry a sword and I think that is the 
way we could probably keep some order in this place if we really 
had to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise and address this motion. 
I will read the motion again just for people who are watching 
this debate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for imperilling the 
economic and social security of Canadians with their reckless 
commitment to dramatically increase spending, at a time when the 
average family's share of the federal debt is approaching $80,000 
and Canada has the highest personal income taxes in the G-7. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are talking about an extraordinarily important issue 
here today.  Unfortunately I do not have time to explore that 
issue as deeply as I would like, but I do want to focus on one 
aspect of that, what we in the Reform Party refer to as social 
benefits of tax relief. In order to do that I must talk a little 
about how government overspending has really come to hurt 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk first about the effect of overspending on social 
programs. Earlier the leader of the New Democratic Party spoke 
and I know the NDP is extraordinarily concerned about social 
programs.  I can tell the leader of the NDP that the Reform Party 
is as well.  We point out to our friends in the NDP and to the 
Liberals that since we have run up a debt of $600 billion and now 
have interest payments in this country of around $47 billion a 
year, we have had to find cuts elsewhere. 
The government in its wisdom cut social programs.  Who does that 
hurt the most?  It hurts low income Canadians.  It hurts the most 
vulnerable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember sitting on the finance committee and having Dr. 
Judith Kazimirski appear before the committee.  Dr. Kazimirski 
was the head of the Canadian Medical Association.  She spoke with 
a tremendous amount of passion about how long people with breast 
cancer or prostate cancer had to wait, on waiting lists, in this 
country because we cannot properly fund health care today.  That 
is a disgrace.  That is what has happened because we have 
interest payments of $47 billion a year, because successive 
Liberal, Tory, Liberal, Tory governments kept spending more than 
they brought in.  The result was a debt of $600 billion.  It has 
been the most vulnerable people in society who have paid the 
biggest price for this.  We see that in the erosion of our social 
programs, but it does not end there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the taxation system in this country, we see 
another perfect example of how overspending and mounting debt 
have hurt the most vulnerable people in society.  If we look at 
working class Canadians and middle class Canadians, they have 
paid a tremendous price for overspending.  I point to the tax 
load people have to carry in this country.  We have the highest 
personal income taxes in the G-7, 56% higher than the G-7 
average, than all the other people we trade with, the U.K., the 
United States, Japan.  That is staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from the Conservatives was talking a minute ago about 
people going to the United States.  According to the government's 
industry department study, people in the United States are 25% 
wealthier than Canadians.  Just a decade ago we had Canadians who 
were on par with the Americans in per capita income.  We tied 
second and third in the world.  Now we are twelfth.  The economic 
powerhouse Iceland is ahead of us because the Liberal and Tory 
governments did not keep their eye on the ball. When the Liberals 
were reducing the deficit they did it on the backs of taxpayers, 
so their per capita income went down and down.  That meant a 
tremendous strain on families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly, in 1991 Decima poll came out and said that 74% 
of working Canadians said that if they had their druthers, if 
they could afford it, they would have one parent at home.  But 
they cannot afford it.  Since 1990 personal incomes, real 
disposal incomes, dropped by $3,000 for the average family.  That 
is unbelievable.  Now Canadians are under tremendous strain 
because governments have overspent and the debt has mounted and 
mounted.  Now we have interest payments of $47 billion a year. 
That would be bad enough, but we have Liberals and now the 
Conservatives talking about spending even more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess a debt of $600 billion is not enough.  I guess taxes 
which are among the highest in the world are not enough for these 
people. Liberals want to spend 50% of the surpluses on new 
programs. Some people say the surpluses might hit $30 billion. 
That is $15 billion a year in new spending?  We have a debt of 
$600 billion which leaves us extraordinarily vulnerable to shocks 
from around the world.  But these people are so reckless that 
they want to spend more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives say they will spend a third of the surplus, 
$10 billion a year, in new spending advocated by a Conservative 
government.  That is scary to me.  This is the time to be prudent 
on the one hand and secure our present situation by starting to 
pay down debt.  We heard that from Canadians when we went around 
the country this fall.  They said pay down debt, it is our first 
priority, please pay it down, we have had enough of this 
profligacy of $600 billion debts, we need to pay it down.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand and close behind Canadians were saying “Let 
us start to give people some hope for the future.  Let us give 
them some tax relief.  Let us leave them with more money in their 
pockets so they can drive their own futures, so they can live 
their lives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all received letters from people who say “I have had 
it”.  I received a letter from a lady who lives in Quesnel, B.C. 
Her name is Margaret Snell.  It is one of the most 
heart-wrenching letters I have ever read. Her son came to her and 
said “Mom, I cannot be in baseball, soccer or hockey this year 
because we cannot afford it, right?” She was ready to complain 
about the CPP increases.  They simply do not have the money.  For 
them it was not an option of taking it out of disposable income. 
Like many Canadians, they do not have any disposable income.  It 
was either going to come out of the mortgage or out of the 
groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is simply that Canadians cannot afford a government 
which continues to spend.  We have to have debt reduction.  We 
have to have tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party has laid down some solutions.  We have set some targets 
for reducing the debt.  Right now the debt is $600 billion.  We 
would reduce it over 20 years to about $343 billion.  It would go 
from 70% of the economy down to about 20%.  It would save $20 
billion a year in interest charges on the debt.  That $20 billion 
could be returned to social programs.  It could be used for tax 
relief.  It is an extraordinarily prudent measure.  It is 
something which would secure the future of young people who are 
having to bear an inordinate burden because of the profligacy of 
previous governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other half of that surplus would be devoted to tax relief. 
We list nine measures in our document.  The one which comes to 
mind right away is that which concerns the 3% and 5% Tory 
surtaxes.  The Conservatives introduced them specifically as a 
measure to reduce the deficit.  The deficit is now gone.  The 
Liberals have a moral obligation to get rid of the 3% and 5% 
surtaxes.  They were implemented specifically to pay down the 
deficit.  It is gone.  Let us remove those surtaxes and help all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way talk so often about the need to be 
more compassionate.  I agree with that.  Let us be more 
compassionate.  If we implemented the tax relief measures which 
the Reform Party is talking about, we would lift 1.3 million low 
income Canadians off the tax rolls.  The single mother who makes 
$15,000 and pays $1,300 in income tax today would pay nothing. 
The family of four making $32,000 which is paying $3,000 in 
income taxes would pay nothing. It is time to help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have laid down the challenge to my friends across the way. 
This is an hour of decision for them.  There is a budget coming 
up.  It will be the first balanced budget in 27 years.  It is 
time for them to set a new course for the country.  We do not 
want to see them go back into that spending mode which got us 
into this problem in the first place.  Canadians do not want it. 
They have made that extraordinarily clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lay down the challenge to my friends.  Please consider 
seriously what we are suggesting to you today.  If you do, I can 
guarantee that you will have the support of not only the Reform 
Party but of Canadians from coast to coast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as brief as 
possible because I know there are other individuals who would 
like to pose questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate that when the fiscal dividend emerges 
Canadians want action on three fronts.  That is essentially what 
we heard from Canadians.  They want action on debt reduction, 
action on investment in a stronger economy and a stronger 
society, and they want some tax relief.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me focus on the tax relief.  When we look at securing the 
dividend submission by the Reform Party, it proposes a wide mix 
of tax measures that when mature will cost around $30 billion and 
foregone revenues will in fact increase by $4 billion each and 
every year.  It actually underestimates the total cost of its 
package by $10 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a responsible government we do not have the luxury to be 
irresponsible much like the Reform Party.  We have to ask 
ourselves a very basic question:  Where is the $30 billion-plus 
coming from for tax cuts?  The Reform Party does not fully answer 
this question in its prebudget document.  Is it going to come 
from a reduction in health and education spending, in a reduction 
in benefits for families, or should we just walk away from the 
success that we have had and increase the deficit?  Should we not 
go for a balanced budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford as a responsible government to deal with issues 
much like the Reform Party because it has not done its numbers. I 
will give the Reform Party a calculator with batteries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would simply point out 
to my friend that not only are these things costed out and not 
only do we use the government's numbers, but he is in fact 
completely wrong when he says that the tax relief for Canadians 
coming from the Reform Party would be $30 billion.  It would be 
$20 billion. I note that my friend finds that quite shocking.  It 
would work out to over $2,000 for the average family of four by 
the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to emphasize for my friend that Canadians are not 
going to be fooled this time.  They have made it extraordinarily 
clear that they do not want to radically increase spending.  I 
think this is where the Liberals have gone off track.  They made 
a commitment and now they cannot back out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we know that Canadians from coast to coast, by a 
majority of about 90%, say they want an emphasis on paying down 
the debt and reducing taxes, not on increasing spending on 
fuzzy-headed programs that have no end that Canadians can somehow 
divine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
when I spoke on the unemployment rate in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, Reform immediately told me that the smallest violin 
plays for Atlantic Canada.  In other words Atlantic Canada should 
be cut loose financially from the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My home province of Newfoundland staggers under an unemployment 
rate of more than twice the national average.  Our net out 
migration rate is about 9,000 people in Newfoundland and Labrador 
and we have a population of approximately half a million. Whole 
communities along the coast of Newfoundland have been decimated 
with nobody left in some of these communities but pensioners and 
families on social assistance.  There are areas where I would 
support an increase in spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The have not provinces are in the position of where every dollar 
that is raised in resource revenues is clawed back practically 
dollar for dollar from our equalization payments.  Therefore, I 
could support a renegotiation of the equalization entitlements 
for the have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to the Reform Party that in balancing the 
national budget Canada eliminated about 15% of its federal public 
service.  In Newfoundland before that process is finished we will 
have eliminated roughly about 30%.  I agree that we should have 
balance in spending but— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  My apologies.  The 
hon. member for Medicine Hat has about 50 seconds to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  First, Mr. Speaker, it is sad that the 
Liberals and Tories allowed the fisheries to be destroyed in 
Newfoundland; we probably would not have the problem we have 
today but that is a fact.  I would simply point out that the 
Reform Party would put $1.4 billion back into Atlantic Canada 
through tax relief, something which would stimulate those 
economies far more than some government initiative that 
inevitably ends up being some kind of a patronage program that 
rewards Conservatives and Liberals.

care measures that will preserve our lives, our well-being and 
our health.  We need to know that when we become old we will be 
able to retire on secure, comfortable incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those measures and those aspects of our lives as Canadians are 
extremely important.  If the case is that what the government is 
moving toward and what this Liberal government intends to do is 
going to further imperil the already shaky security or lack of 
security in many of these areas, then we in this House need to be 
very concerned about that. We need to do our job to urge and to 
push the government in a direction that will alleviate this 
danger to our personal security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have brought forward and our speakers have brought forward 
even today evidence after evidence that Canadians are moving 
toward a lower standard of living.  And this plan by the Liberal 
government to continue the mother government's federal spending 
programs, many of which intrude on the jurisdiction of the 
provinces, will continue to lead to a lower standard of living 
and in some cases more so in some regions of the country, as one 
of the questioners pointed out a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some income groups the standard of living is so low that 
there is essentially not enough left for necessities. The 
government in noticing this says “We are going to do something 
about poverty among children and poverty in some rural and remote 
communities”. What it could have done was to not enact the 
policies which led to this tragic set of circumstances to begin 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer briefly to two studies, one which was just 
released by Industry Canada and one by the Ottawa based Centre 
for the Study of Living Standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some interesting highlights in the just released 
Industry Canada report.  I wish I had time to refer to it in 
detail but I do not.  I will specifically point to the areas that 
talk about the resources and the standard of living Canadians 
have and how they are being impacted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study specifically compared the Canadian standard of living, 
the kind of standard of living that Canadians have as compared to 
their neighbours in the United States. We have to remember that 
Canada does 80% of its trading in economic activity with the 
Americans.  It is a very appropriate and very needful comparison 
that has been done by Industry Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are only a couple of things from this study.  People who 
are listening to this debate may want to refer to it in more 
detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all and most tellingly, the employment rate in the 
United States, the participation rate in the labour market is 
much higher than in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who are looking for work and there are people 
who have simply given up looking for work and are doing other 
things.  For example they are working abroad, going back to 
school or simply just are not working at all and are relying on 
other family members for support.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The participation rate in Canada's labour force is far lower 
than the U.S. rate.  The unemployment rate is much higher in 
Canada for those who want to work and are ready, willing and able 
to work.  According to Industry Canada, if Canada had the same 
employment rate as the United States there would be one million 
more people working, which would put to work two-thirds of those 
who are currently unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Medicine Hat was asked a question concerning 
regional disparities by a member of the Conservative Party.  He 
mentioned the terrible problem of regional disparity.  In the 
United States problems arising from regional disparity occur at 
about half the rate of those found in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bankruptcy rate in the U.S. has fallen by 30% since 1995, 
while in Canada it has increased by 80% to record setting levels, 
which affects small and medium size businesses.  Canadian 
businesses are unable to even make a go of it, never mind earn 
the decent return business people need to feed their families and 
provide for the necessities of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Real personal income per capita is 24% higher in the United 
States.  Families earn nearly 25% more in that country just a few 
miles south of us than our families do.  The household debt is a 
lot higher in Canada.  The savings rate has fallen as Canadians 
have been forced to collapse their RRSPs and personal savings to 
cope with the increasingly harsh economic climate in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been rightly mentioned that Canadian expenditures on 
research and development are half of U.S. expenditures.  Our most 
highly skilled professionals including engineers, architects, 
surveyors, mathematicians, computer scientists and natural 
scientists earn far lower salaries than their U.S. counterparts 
and their tax burden is much higher.  It is no wonder we are 
having a massive brain drain to the south because of these 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On average Canadian wage earners pay approximately 33% more in 
income tax than their U.S. counterparts.  They also have our 
favourite tax, the GST that the Tories brought in and the 
Liberals failed to get rid of as they said they would.  U.S. 
taxpayers can deduct mortgage interest payments and student loan 
payments from their taxable income.  This all means that 
Canadians have far fewer resources left in their hands to care 
for their personal needs, for their children's needs and for 
their families' needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more telling is a study conducted by Ottawa based Centre 
for the Study of Living Standards.  It compared the wealth 
created per person in Canada with the same figure for the other 
member countries of the OECD.  Thirteen leading industrialized 
countries were compared.  The results were absolutely shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We created per person an amount of wealth that put us dead last 
among all industrialized countries.  Every other country in the 
industrialized world increased their wealth, but Canada actually 
lost ground up to 1996.  We scored a decrease of 0.4% per person. 
Norway increased its per capita wealth by over 22%.  All other 
countries experienced an increase except for Canada 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that Canadians do not have enough resources left in 
their hands to meet their needs and the needs of their families. 
Yet government takes more and more to fund the spending programs 
that have proven so ineffective when it comes to security and a 
good standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government, as we set out in our motion, to reverse 
this commitment to reckless spending and instead to pay down the 
mortgage on our future.  Let us keep more of our own money to 
give us real social security.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is truly amazing to hear all the comments cited by my 
hon. colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill.  I would swear that some 
of them were probably taken from magazines like the <I>New 
Republic</I> or perhaps the Fraser Institute or other think tanks 
whose primary responsibility is to put most ordinary Canadians 
into the financial dunk tank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear to me that all the things cited by the hon. 
member do not square with the reality that Canada currently 
enjoys the highest standard of living rated by the United 
Nations.  That is an inescapable fact.  No matter what the hon. 
member wants to posit or what wonderful little fantasies he wants 
to put forward, the reality is that we are doing pretty well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is about the fruits, efforts and undertaking by 
the government and the Canadian people to reduce the deficit. 
This debate would not take place if we had not reached the point 
where we could begin to discuss one day the opportunity of 
dealing with the fiscal dividend.  Clearly hon. colleagues in the 
Reform Party who have provided the motion today ignored the fact 
that what we are proposing as government was vindicated and 
authorized by the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party has a problem with democracy it ought to say 
so here and now.  Given that what we are proposing squares firmly 
with the election platform we have put forward, what problem do 
Reformers have with that?  If they have a problem with that, 
perhaps they ought to redefine their definition of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians only wish 
that the performance of the Liberals squared with their election 
platform.  We all know about the scrap the GST promise.  Where 
are we today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many inaccuracies in the comments of the member 
opposite that I can hardly even address them all.  However he 
said something that was true.  The facts I cited were amazing and 
should be paid attention to on the other side.  They were taken 
from the government's own industry department study, from a think 
tank in Ottawa that is well respected.  These are not made up 
figures.  These are the government's own figures and we need to 
start paying attention to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that Canada has the highest standard of living in 
the world.   Other countries are ahead of us, in particular the 
United States, as the Industry Canada study indicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the member was not listening to what I said.  Once again 
he is living in some kind of fool's paradise that we do not have 
to do anything; don't worry, be happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a fiscal dividend that is being spent.  This is our 
money.  This is Canadians' money.  It is not money for the 
Liberal government to play Santa Claus with.  It is time the 
Liberals understood that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member talks about democracy he might want to look at a 
Roper Canada poll taken in December which showed that 39% of 
Canadians want a cut in taxes above everything else.  Some 37% 
want to pay down the national debt.  Guess how many want an 
increase in social spending.  Only 19%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to follow democracy, to listen to 
Canadians and to do what Canadians want with their money, he 
might pay attention to what they are really saying. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me pursue for a moment the issue of reduced spending.  We all 
support debt reduction as long as there is a balance in the 
sharing of responsibility with the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said a few moments ago, we badly need a better recognition 
of the disparity that exists between Atlantic Canadians and the 
rest of Canada.  I feel strongly that have not provinces need a 
better deal on equalization.  I can support as can a lot of 
Atlantic Canadians an increase in spending as long as it is 
directed to the right areas.  One area would be a better deal on 
the equalization formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had more time to pursue the issue.  What is the 
member's position on correcting that disparity by renegotiating 
the equalization formula for have not provinces?

for our caucus in the last parliament and spent many days and 
hours in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share his tremendous concern about the terrible conditions of 
many Atlantic Canadians, particularly in the more remote areas 
and communities due to mismanagement of the fishery, misuse of 
development moneys, patronage and all the things that have caused 
a lot more harm than good to a beautiful and vibrant area of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed that equalization payments should be 
re-examined.  Middle income provinces are getting a share of 
equalization payments that would be more appropriately directed 
to the very poorest provinces, which would mostly be the Atlantic 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with the member to support a program 
that would direct more equalization resources to meet the need 
for better delivery of social services and social security in the 
Atlantic provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today's motion accuses our 
government of imperilling the economic and social security of 
Canadians.  The only thing truly at peril is the credibility of 
the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the government share the view of most Canadians 
that our national tax burden is too high.  That is why we have 
committed clearly and concretely to take significant steps to 
reduce the broad tax burden shouldered by Canadians as we move 
from a deficit to a fiscal dividend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister also made clear that a balanced budget was 
not the end of a fiscal turnaround.  We must move on to bring 
down our hobbling public debt as well.  These facts, high debt, 
too heavy taxes, are not signs of a national failure or futile 
policy.  They are the carryover of the economic malaise we 
inherited five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a wasting sickness in which 25 years of deficit spending 
played a tragic part.  It is a disease that still leaves symptoms 
when the patient is well into recovery.  That recovery is a fact 
that disturbs and dismays members of the official opposition. 
Since they can no longer deny the success of our approach to 
deficit reduction, they must find a new threat to browbeat and 
bully Canadians.  That is the threat of reckless spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at how reckless we have been since coming to office 
and the direction we have set for the future.  Let me emphasize 
that this is a direction which was endorsed by Canadian voters in 
the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October the finance minister presented the government's 
fall economic and fiscal update.  It demonstrated convincingly 
that our government's plan to restore Canada's fiscal and 
economic health was working.  We started with an absolute and 
unequivocal pledge to eliminate the deficit.  We did this because 
we understood that the price a nation pays for years of excessive 
deficit spending is clear, concrete and corrosive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of all deficit financing means higher taxes.  Last year the 
federal government had to pay over $45 billion in debt charges. 
That is equal to about 32 cents of every dollar of tax revenue 
Canadians pay to Ottawa.  Looked at another way, that $45 billion 
is equivalent to 70% of federal income taxes that Canadians pay. 
It is more than EI premiums and GST combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why when we first came to office we set about putting 
our fiscal house in order, something the opposition party clearly 
did not understand then and does not understand today.  We knew 
it was the essential foundation for lower interest rates and 
higher economic growth which means jobs.  I am sure the NDP will 
appreciate this point.  That is what Canadians want.  We knew 
that without a fiscal turnaround we would never be in a position 
to pursue broader tax reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most Canadians know, our deficit control plan centred on 
cutting government spending has met its targets and in fact 
exceeded them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our deficit progress has delivered real and rewarding results 
for Canada.  We have transformed the vicious circle of higher 
deficits, higher interest rates and slow economic growth into a 
virtuous circle where lower deficits have helped produce lower 
interest rates, leading to higher economic growth and lower 
unemployment, ultimately leading to even lower deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today as we have been buffeted by the impact of the Asian 
currency crisis, Canadian rates are still below U.S. rates, both 
for 30 day bills and long term bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fiscal turnaround is not a transitory phenomenon.  We have 
confirmed that the federal deficit will be eliminated no later 
than this coming fiscal year and it will be the first time that 
the federal government books have been balanced since 1970.  This 
means that we are now looking to the day when Canadians will see 
a fiscal dividend.  To sustain our economic progress, we will 
make sure that our commitment to fiscal prudence does not change. 
As the prime minister said, we will never again allow the 
financial health of our country to get out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about that fiscal dividend once the federal books are 
balanced?  In fact, what about the Reform motion today that warns 
of that reckless spending by this government?  Again, listen to 
the real facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has committed to a 50:50 allocation of the 
dividend among, one, expenditures to address economic and social 
needs and two, tax cuts and debt reduction on the other.  Let me 
touch on some of the issues and concerns that we feel must in 
fact define this dividend debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the tax issue, our government is absolutely committed to 
bringing down the tax burden of Canadians.  Because the dividend 
can start off small, it leaves little room to implement a 
substantial across the board reduction right away.  We feel that 
the most responsible course will be to continue to provide 
targeted tax relief where it does the most good, as we have done 
in our recent federal budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our priority here will be to provide tax relief to low and 
middle income people and families first.  When we can afford it, 
we will and we must go further and reduce the broader tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the challenge of investing in Canada's future.  We 
believe the responsibility of the government today goes 
beyond debt and tax reduction only.  To rule out the need to 
invest strategically in areas such as health care, education and 
public pensions is not just bad social policy, it is bad 
economics.  Such programs provide Canadians with the security to 
participate in our fast changing economy with confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is to find the right balance, a balance that 
ensures that the quantity of growth we all seek contributes to 
the quality of life Canadians deserve.  For example, growth may 
be central to a strong economy, but in today's world of 
accelerating technological change, knowledge and skills are 
central to growth.  They are central to a society that is more 
fair, where people have the skills that mean good jobs and good 
incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the federal government has taken measures to make 
registered education savings plans more attractive and flexible, 
measures that we just this week debated at second reading of Bill 
C-28.  Just this week we debated and voted on this bill.  Of 
course the members of the official opposition rejected that 
measure and voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is also why the prime minister has announced that we will 
create a Canada millennium scholarship fund, to reward academic 
excellence and assist thousands and thousands of low and moderate 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess this is that reckless spending that the Reform Party 
says puts Canada at peril.  I am convinced that the vast majority 
of Canadians certainly see it differently.  They see it as a wise 
use of part of the coming dividend. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not good enough to have the right skills if our 
country does not also offer the opportunities to develop and 
apply those skills in the laboratory and the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, that is why the government, to help strengthen this 
synergy, called for and created the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation.  It provides $800 million to help maintain or enhance 
facilities at our hospitals and universities, facilities to 
deliver world class research and keep top flight researchers here 
at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not put words into the mouths of members opposite, but 
perhaps this is another example of the reckless spending the 
opposition wants to attack.  However, I do not think I have heard 
them say openly that this is a measure which should be killed.  I 
will not say they have said that, but I will say that most 
Canadians see it as a rewarding investment, not a reckless one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to equip Canadians for success in a new millennium we 
must first focus on early childhood where the capacity to learn 
is developed.  That is why we are building a new partnership with 
the provinces on behalf of children and providing $850 million in 
additional resources under the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is clear and concrete, to begin to put an end to the 
welfare trap where low income parents who return to the workforce 
see their children's economic conditions actually worsen because 
they lose services provided under social assistance. Going to 
work should make people's lives better, not worse.  We are 
addressing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this, once again, the reckless spending which Reform feels 
will imperil Canada's economy and society?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another measure which was included in the debate on 
Bill C-28, which is the action of the government to enrich the 
Canada health and social transfer which goes to the provinces to 
support health care, post-secondary education and social 
assistance and services.  Because of our faster than expected 
fiscal progress we are in a position to guarantee that the CHST 
transfers to the provincial governments will be $12.5 billion for 
each of the next five years.  That is $1.5 billion more over the 
previous floor and it represents overall $7 billion to the 
provinces.  It is an increase which does not threaten our 
balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps opposition members will think that is reckless, but 
millions of Canadians would surely disagree.  They want a strong 
health care system.  They value support for education.  They 
believe our country should help the disadvantaged.  They know 
these are valid and vital uses of federal resources, especially 
when they do not jeopardize our progress to a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested at the start that the only thing in peril, going by 
today's motion, is the Reform's credibility.  I think I have made 
my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay specific attention to the prebudget document 
which the official opposition has put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party talks about balancing the budget and applying 
unused contingency reserves to debt over the next three years.  I 
want to thank the Reform Party.  I am very pleased that the 
Reform Party now endorses the government's budgetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October the government committed to balancing the budget no 
later than 1998-99.  The government also made the commitment that 
if the contingency reserve was not needed it would be applied to 
the debt.  That was in October.  Some members opposite were 
there, some were not.  I only hope that those who were there 
would have communicated that to the rest of their caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about freezing program spending through to 2001. 
Reform suggests freezing total program spending but allowing the 
natural increase in the major statutory programs to take place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially what they are advocating is a cut of $3 billion or 
6% of the non-transfer portion of spending over the next three 
years.  Where does it come from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of one-time savings are offered up as advocated by the 
auditor general but where it will find $3 billion of ongoing 
savings is yet to be identified.  That is what the platform says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members keep changing their minds on this.  They are all over 
the map.  In the 1997 election they talked about calling for 
large cuts to EI and equalization.   Now they think spending on 
these programs should be allowed to increase.  They have no 
credibility on the issue of expenditure reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go on and on but the one area I need to spend 
some time on because it is a major plank in the platform that this 
official opposition has is the wide mix of tax measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would call on this party to go back, redo its analysis, redo 
the costing of this measure because when the analysis is 
complete, when the tax measures that are put forward by this 
party are looked at, when they are mature they would cost around 
$30 billion in foregone federal revenues and would grow by $4 
billion each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They underestimate the total cost of their package by over $10 
billion.  As a responsible government, we do not have the luxury 
of basing our policies on sloppy and incomplete analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get our numbers right and we must look at the 
consequences of any measures that we undertake, obviously not a 
criteria of that party.  In that regard I think we would have to 
ask ourselves one very basic question with respect to the Reform 
Party package. Where is the $30 billion plus for tax cuts to come 
from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have not answered that in their platform.  They have 
not answered that in their prebudget document.  I suppose we will 
have to guess what they might propose to do to make up the 
foregone revenue, perhaps reduce transfers for health and 
education, reduce benefits for families with children or the 
elderly or perhaps the suggestion that we walk away from all the 
sacrifice and hard work of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have partnered and ensured that we were able to 
balance this budget.  Should we just add it to the deficit and 
the debt?  I am not sure at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think when we look at the spending plan that this government 
has proposed and how it is balanced with the real commitment to 
action on taxes and debt reduction, the reckless risk taking and 
a government out of control is not seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is seen instead is a realistic strategy that invests in 
Canada's renewal, a strategy developed in consultation with 
Canadians by a government committed to helping them regain 
control of their lives and their children's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this motion deserves to be dismissed is so that we 
can get on with the job of building that future in a way that is 
responsible and responsive to Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I listen 
to this nonsense.  I listened to it for years before I was 
elected.  I used to watch this kind of nonsense from both sides 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I have raised four children and they are now young 
adults.  We have twin sons.  When our two boys were in grade 10, 
they got part time jobs making a minimum salary.  When they came 
home with their paycheques they were aghast at the difference 
between their gross pay and what they were going to be able to 
cash that cheque for because of people like this taking and 
gouging young Canadians like our children and millions like them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are being gouged with high payroll taxes and now we are 
hearing this kind of verbiage that drips with the attributes of 
hypocrisy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are hearing.  They are saying that they are 
responsible, that they have got to give control back to 
Canadians.  Who took the control from them in the first place? 
Who increased the taxes year after year after year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born, my mother tells me, in that old log house that I 
remember with a sod roof.  We eventually moved out of that house. 
We were not unlike many of our neighbours.  We moved out of that 
home to a better home, but we could never have done it if 50 
cents of every dollar we had earned had been taken away by taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We built this country on low taxes.  What is destroying this 
country is high taxation.  When there are millions of families 
like Kim Hicks' who are struggling to make ends meet on $30,000 a 
year and the government is taking anywhere from $2,500 to $3,000 
away in taxes, that is criminal.  That is what is wrong with this 
country.  That is what is wrong with this government. A single 
mom with one child makes $15,000 and has to pay $1,300 in taxes. 
What does the member have to say to those people?  Certainly the 
nonsense he has given us today and placed upon the record is no 
comfort to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the mess we are in, we look at the pilot of the 
<I>Titanic</I>.  Who piloted the <I>Titanic</I> into the iceberg? 
Someone who was absolutely asleep at the wheel.  That is what we 
have seen for the last 25 years.  The pilots, whether they were 
Liberal pilots or Tory pilots, for the last 25 years have steered 
us asleep straight toward an iceberg and that iceberg is now $600 
billion in size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-seven billion dollars of the taxpayers' money has to be 
used not on social spending, not on health care, not on 
education, not on seniors, not on those people who need it. No. 
It has to be used on the iceberg that the <I>Titanic</I> is headed 
toward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member stands and ridicules, mocks and scorns every attempt 
that the opposition members bring forward to return control back 
to the people.  What does he do?  He pretends by saying “We have 
screwed up this country but we are the only ones that can solve 
the problem.  We are the ones that brought us into debt but we 
are the only ones who can get us out of it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone understands the principles of economics.  At the end of 
every month millions and millions of families have to sit down 
and pay their bills.  They know that you cannot continue to go on 
and on if you are spending more than what you are bringing in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 25 years and beyond, that is what the Liberal and Tory 
governments have done to the people of this country, to my 
children and millions of other children.  They intend to do it to 
our grandchildren as well, particularly with the 73% increase in 
the Canada pension contributions our children and grandchildren 
are going to have to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should hang his head in shame and say “Yes, we made 
a mistake.  Let us correct it.  Let us work together to do 
something for our children and our grandchildren” and for the 
Kim Hicks of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the member has anything to respond that is 
worthwhile to these facts but I certainly give him the 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I truly welcome the 
opportunity to respond.  I appreciate the member's passion for 
this particular topic, although I would question some of the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate once again that when we talk about taxes, 
this government has not once increased personal income taxes 
since coming into office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to perhaps listen to the answer since he 
had the opportunity to take the floor a little earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the member to join us as we move to the next 
millennium and to stop talking about the 50 years that have gone 
by.  It is only because of the support of Canadians for the 
actions of this government that we are talking about a fiscal 
dividend today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is not taking the credit.  It is Canadians who 
should take the credit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not come to this House and continue with this verbiage about 
how I am standing up and belittling the member.  Let us get it 
clear.  Canadians ensured that this government was able to 
complete a program that was laid out beginning in 1993 continuing 
through to 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member talks about spending, there is spending in this 
government in this country today that is the lowest in 50 years. 
It is not this particular government that is overspending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about what is so crucially important to sustain 
this country, it is that we must not and will never overspend or 
spend more than what we take in.  It is quite clear and it has 
been said over and over again.  I only wish that for once a 
member from the opposition would get up and recognize that fact. 
They should check <I>Hansard</I> because over and over again it is 
there, but they agree to ignore it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me move to some of the other members of that caucus. The 
member for Selkirk—Interlake said that any shortfalls Manitoba 
suffered from equalization cuts could be made up by provincial 
tax hikes or spending cuts.  Is that coming from that opposition 
party?  Is that coming from that opposition party that just had a 
member stand up and say “Give back to Canadians no tax 
increases”.  A member of his own party says “Do not worry about 
cutting, they will jack it up at the other level”.  That is 
something we will not do.  That is not the role of this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about cutting spending.  I will use another example of 
a member of that particular party and perhaps some will recognize 
the quote, “I support the idea of regional economic development. 
As a former mayor of Dauphin I know the importance of it.  We 
need the money to leverage other money”.  That was the member 
for Dauphin—Swan River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  But you do not go into debt to do those 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  And you are exactly right.  Every 
measure that this government has taken and every measure this 
government is considering does not in any way jeopardize the 
balanced budget we are going to achieve.  It does not increase 
the debt that we have in this country.  I only wish the hon. 
member would go back and check <I>Hansard</I> because over and 
over again those arguments have been answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any new initiative that this government will undertake will not 
increase our deficit or increase our debt.  Not one.  This 
government will take the balanced approach.  It will reduce the 
debt in real terms and on a ratio basis.  It will invest 
strategically in priorities of Canadians and it will reduce taxes 
for Canadians. That is what this government will do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the member for Lethbridge.  I believe 
that all members of the official opposition will be splitting the 
time from here on in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard the opening remarks of the parliamentary secretary 
I thought for an instant that perhaps the Liberal majority was 
going to be in jeopardy.  The way he was speaking I thought he 
was going to come over and join us.  Then I thought he would not 
do that but that the light was finally going on in the Liberal 
government's mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was talking about such things as “lower interest 
means more growth” a quote by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance. Finally we have an admission by this 
government after 25 years, that it finally has realized that debt 
does not buy your way to happiness and it does not buy your way 
to riches.  Finally and hopefully and completely forever we will 
not see higher interest. That by his definition will mean more 
growth.  It also means more jobs for Canadians, more jobs for our 
kids, more future for our young people as they try to find a job 
after finishing university under a mountain of debt because of 
the high cost of education, courtesy of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said “Lower deficits mean lower taxes”. 
After 27 years of the Liberals and the Tories managing this 
country, they have finally come to the realization that a lower 
deficit means lower taxes, and they have saddled us with $600 
billion in debt, $45 billion a year in interest. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are finally saying “If we could only get rid of that 
deficit”, and it was their creation.  They are finally saying 
that we can lower taxes.  The Reform Party has been saying let us 
lower taxes, let us create growth, let us create jobs.  Obviously 
the message is finally getting through and I am glad to see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also went on to say that less taxes create more jobs, 
which I just covered.  He said that high deficits mean lower 
growth and we are now looking at the first surplus since 1970. 
What an admission by a government that would allow us to go 27 or 
28 years without a single surplus.  Every year the debt has been 
going up and up and up, taxes have been going up and up and up, 
the interest cost has been going up and up and up.  After all 
that head in the sand style of government the Liberals finally 
come around and say that the Reform Party has it right and they 
are endorsing our principles and policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that they will never spend more 
than they take in.  How Canadians wish they had listened to their 
own advice years ago, many years ago.  We would have no debt.  We 
would have $45 billion, $1,500 for every man, woman and child. 
That money would be in the pockets of Canadians for them to spend 
every year. Six thousand dollars per family would be in the 
people's pockets every year.  They would be able to buy goods, 
increase their standard of living and provide better education 
for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no, this government because of its folly and insanity, which 
it now realizes to be folly and insanity, is now saying that it 
would have been better if it had left the money with Canadians. 
Think of the prosperity we would have.  Think about how much 
higher the economic growth would have been. We would be one of 
the most prosperous nations on earth. Our dollar would be on par 
and our interest rates would be the same as those of Japan.  It 
would be heaven on earth.  It would be Shangri-La right here had 
it not been for this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk in generalities but we have to translate these 
policies and ideas into workable things that will ensure that 
government is more efficient.  Government should deliver what it 
says it will with the same degree of productivity and efficiency 
we expect from the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chairman of the public accounts committee, I am quite 
often appalled at the way this government allows its senior 
bureaucrats to mismanage their departments at great cost to the 
Canadian taxpayer. I have some examples from the auditor 
general's report, chapter 13 concerning Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 13-31, paragraph 13.145 states that a limited review of 
ambulance costs identified cases of potential abuse that had gone 
undetected.  In one such case a client had taken 150 ambulance 
trips costing over $21,000 during a five month period. It goes on 
to say that no one had questioned the trips until they were 
identified by an internal review.  Someone was using an ambulance 
as a taxi, we were paying for it, and nobody in the department 
was asking what was going on. What is going on here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exhibit 13.16 on page 13-29 refers to provision of dental 
services.  One dental provider billed $25,000 for 58 root canal 
therapies, about 12 times more than the average practitioner 
performed in the province.  Another provider charged $40,000 for 
92 crowns, which is six times more than the provincial norm.  A 
dentist claimed $27,000 for 356 coloured surface restoration 
procedures, about 40 times the average for such a procedure 
performed by dentists in the province.  And Canadians paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians pay these kinds of bills each and every day because 
the departments, the ministers and the senior management do not 
know how to manage Canadian taxpayers' money. 
They just pay the bills as they come in because they are quite 
comfortable with their jobs, their security and their salaries, 
and yet the Canadian taxpayer has to squeeze out more and more 
money each and every year to pay for this serious mismanagement 
and waste of money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of thing that goes on each and every day.  That 
is the type of stuff the public accounts committee is trying to 
stop.  That is why we are looking for some serious changes to be 
made by the Liberal government.  As it saves it will look after 
Canadian taxpayers money.  As the chairman of the public accounts 
committee I will put the Liberals on notice that we will be 
holding them accountable for the way they spend the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to compliment the auditor general for bringing these 
types of issues to our attention.  Unfortunately every time the 
public accounts committee meets it deals with issues of this 
magnitude and waste of these huge proportions.  It goes on and 
on. It never seems to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are $600 billion in debt.  We have heard people talk about 
all kinds of scenarios.  They talk about what would happen if our 
economic growth were to slow or stop.  It reminds me of the days 
of the depression.  In 1929 the country was going into a deeper 
and deeper recession.  People were losing their jobs.  There was 
25% unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It was a Tory prime minister, wasn't it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  It was a Tory prime minister.  It was 
Mr. Borden.  He said “We are not going to borrow any money 
because we want to make sure our credit rating is strong.  It 
does not matter that people are unemployed and starving in the 
streets”.  He wanted to protect the credit rating.  He refused 
to borrow money.  If we ever get into that situation again we 
will not be able to borrow money because our credit rating is so 
weak.  Therefore, while history may not repeat itself, it is 
bound to rhyme, as someone once said.  Canadians will be left 
high an dry with the Asian flu, if it ever reaches North America. 
Because of the $600 billion debt, because of our vulnerability, 
because of mismanagement by this government and the previous Tory 
government we stand to suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that does not happen.  I hope this government sees the 
light of day.  We need to have serious, proper management of the 
affairs of the nation.  We must ensure that the government does 
not fritter money away with its 50:50 split on surpluses, giving 
some to reduce the debt and spending the rest on goodies. That 
cannot happen.  Let us see some real responsibility for once. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have been sitting here since 10 o'clock this morning listening to 
the debate and there is an issue which has come forward which 
should be of serious concern to the House.  It has to do with the 
integrity of information which has been put on the floor from 
time to time, particularly as it relates to tax matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition, yesterday in question period and 
again today in his opening speech, used the statement that 
Canada's highest tax rate kicks in at approximately $60,000, 
whereas in the U.S. it kicks in at $270,000, making the point 
that somehow we should have parity.  In fact what it means is it 
would provide tax breaks to 10% of the highest income earners in 
Canada, although his description was that it would help low and 
medium income Canadians.  It is not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill tabled in the House her 
views.  She said the effect of the tax burden in Canada was 33% 
more than it is in the United States and that Americans can 
deduct the interest they pay on their mortgages.  She did not 
mention that they also have to pay capital gains tax on principal 
residences, which we do not.  She also did not mention that they 
do not have free health care, that they have to pay for it.  She 
also did not mention that the same analysis went before the 
finance committee which noted that there is parity and equity 
between the effective Canada and U.S. rates.  The information 
provided to this House was incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the hon. member for Crowfoot gave the example that a 
single mother making $15,000 a year would have to pay $1,300 in 
taxes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT47"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT47"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1350

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not correct.  A single mother getting the non-refundable 
tax credit of $6,456 also gets to claim the child as an 
equivalent to spouse exemption which means that the first $13,000 
is in fact sheltered from tax.  That leaves $2,000 on which only 
$500 of tax is paid.  When we add on to that the fact that she is 
eligible for the child tax benefit of $1,800 and the GST credit 
of another $400, not only does she not pay $1,300, she gets back 
$1,300 on the $15,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member just 
pointed out the classic difference.  The Leader of the Opposition 
pointed out that this government is taxing billions of dollars 
out of the pockets of people who are defined as poor and below 
the poverty line.  We just heard the example of how the 
government takes millions of dollars away and turns around and 
gives it back to them, saying it is doing a great job.  That 
cannot be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could improve the efficiency of the government by not 
collecting the taxes from these people.  Why would we collect 
taxes from the poor and the people who are below the poverty line 
just so we can channel it through the government and give it back 
to them in the form of a cheque?  This is absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the member would agree that to leave the taxes in their 
own pockets and not take it away is a far greater incentive than 
to come out with a myriad of programs with all the rules and 
regulations that force people into complexities of following 
government rules and perhaps having to give up a job in order to 
qualify for a benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not leave the money with the people? Why 
does it not let them prosper and stand on their own two feet and 
get on with being a real Canadian with a real job?  That is what 
it is all about.  It is not government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to get into this battle of the accountants that is 
happening here and remind the hon. member for Mississauga South 
that as an accountant he is wont not to see the forest for the 
tree.  He knows very well all the detailed features of the 
comparative tax codes of Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bottom line, the forest, the big picture is that 
the U.S. tax foundation calculates that the total family tax 
index in the United States is no more than 34% of total family 
income, while the Canadian family tax index, calculated by the 
Fraser Institute, an organization which the hon. Minister of 
Finance has recognized as a great economic authority while 
speaking at its conferences, was 47%.  This 34% versus 47% is the 
big picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Let me enlighten you, Mr. Speaker.  I 
am splitting my time with the member for Lethbridge.  He is 
following right after me.  I think the previous speaker, the 
member from Calgary, has pointed out quite clearly that there is 
a massive difference between us and the United States.  There is 
also a massive difference between our unemployment rate and its 
unemployment rate and our economic growth and its economic 
growth.  There is no question that lower taxes create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am going to recognize the hon. member for 
Lethbridge, of course, but I would tell him that it would be my 
intention to intervene when he would be in about the middle of 
his speech.  Therefore, I wonder if he would prefer to wait until 
after question period and then he can get a straight run at it. 
What would you like to do, sir? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  I would like to start now, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will give you about three and a half 
minutes and then you will finish after. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
try to talk fast.  It is atrocious to think about the last 30 
years of foolish spending sprees by the Liberals and Tories, 30 
years of the financial burden of Canadian taxpayers being made 
heavier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the problems lie with the lack of accountability.  When 
Canadians elect a government they vote under the assumption that 
government will act in their best interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, where our pocket books have been concerned, this 
has not been the case.  Foolish spending has left us buried in 
debt.  Today's opposition motion condemns this and any government 
that imperils our economic and social security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of this motion as an insurance policy against reckless 
endangerment of our hard earned tax dollars.  Amidst all this 
government hoopla is the attempt to boast of eliminating a 
deficit it created, Canadians deserve the assurance that 
governments be held accountable for such absurd spending 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the CEO of a major corporation does not act in the best 
interests of a company and its shareholders, the board of 
directors will turf that CEO as a sign of non-confidence in his 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the citizens of Canada not deserve the same degree of 
accountability?  Let us face it.  The stakes are even higher 
here.  We are talking about the finances not of one company but 
of an entire nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous to applaud a government for eliminating a 
deficit not only that it is responsible for, but this government 
did not even reduce the deficit responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did it manage to eliminate its deficit?  By reducing health 
and education transfers to the provinces.  Thanks to the federal 
cuts, provinces felt the pinch.  Hospitals closed, school 
programs were cut, payroll taxes were up and the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have addressed the deficit by raising Canadians' 
taxes 37 times.  Now the Liberals have announced 31 new spending 
programs that would take spending levels higher than they have 
ever been, leaving Canadians with the highest income taxes in the 
industrial world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this led to even fewer dollars in the pockets of Canadians. 
We are supposed to thank this government for getting rid of a 
deficit?  Let me take a moment to use an analogy of the nation's 
financial situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the government as the <I>Titanic</I> of financial 
coffers.  Consider now the deficit as the part of the iceberg 
situated above the water surface.  If members know anything of 
the formation of an iceberg, they know that the portion of the 
iceberg they see above the water is minuscule to the vast amount 
that is hidden beneath the water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the deficit represents a small portion of the iceberg above 
the water, what will we call the massive unseen structure?  That 
is our debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government to lick its chops in anticipation of blowing 
our surplus, I urge it to remember that the average family's 
share of the federal debt in Canada is now approaching $80,000, a 
mortgage every family has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our nation's massive debt has approached the $600 billion mark 
and the government is claiming an economic victory.  This is an 
affront to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The error of foolish Tory and Grit spending must come to an end 
immediately.  There is only one reason why this motion may not 
pass today.  If we could just for one moment put political 
patronage, broken promises and partisan tactics aside and 
consider the responsibility each and every one of us in this room 
has to our constituents, the bottom line remains the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We each have a serious obligation to safeguard the economic and 
social security of Canadians.  The time has come for governments 
to put an end to the last 30 years of Liberal and Tory financial 
mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legacy of massive overspending deficits, debt and tax 
increases must end.  Any government that claims economic victory 
is just like the <I>Titanic</I> heading for disaster.  Full steam 
ahead on spending now is a collision course with economic mayhem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large debt burdens force interest rates higher and increase the

in the north part of my Elk Island riding have been prevented

</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people in Canada are the best educated, most literate and 
most technologically adept generation in history.  Today's 
rapidly changing economy and competitive job market make it more 
difficult for inexperienced, undereducated or undertrained youth 
to find meaningful employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many believe their education is deemed worthless by employers as 
they are caught in the vicious circle of no job without 
experience and no experience without a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth tell us they need improved access to education and 
training and more information about Canada's labour markets.  The 
Canadian economy needs their energy and talents.  They deserve a 
chance to prove themselves and a chance to acquire work 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response, the government has created the youth employment 
strategy aimed at helping young people gain the experience 
necessary to find meaningful employment.  While this initiative 
should be applauded, I challenge the government to increase the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberal

status of fishermen in West Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those owning fishing vessels, whether large corporations or 
individual fishermen, will now be required to make CPP

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1997, despite ongoing negotiations with the fishing 
industry, Revenue Canada unilaterally set the start up date for 
these changes as January 1, 1997, followed by a demand for 
retroactive payments plus interest from the vessel owners to 
cover CPP contributions for this past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This request is very damaging to an industry that has already 
been decimated by quota cuts over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the people of West Nova I urge the government to 
cancel the request for retroactive payments on CPP contributions, 
return to the negotiating table with representatives of the

implementing these changes.

It would give protection to Canadians from unreasonable laws and

<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
answered this question fully yesterday.  We respect the Privacy 
Act.  The matter is being investigated to the utmost.  We will 
get to the bottom of this situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government acts as if this were some isolated 
incident, but Rita Galloway, president of the First Nations 
Coalition for Accountability, says differently.  She alleges that 
when band members write letters to the ministry complaining about 
financial irregularities or human rights abuses on reserve 
invariably those letters end up in the hands of the band and 
council being complained about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not condone this practice, what concrete 
steps will it take to stop it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister said that she is very concerned about this letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was really beyond the department and the RCMP.  It was so 
important that the minister appointed an independent senior 
official security investigator from outside the department to 
pursue the investigation and right now the investigation is 
ongoing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Stephen Constant from the James Smith Reserve wrote to 
the Indian affairs minister in 1996.  Ten days later he got a 
call from the band leadership that told him that they had a copy 
of his letter.  They said that they always get such letters.  As 
a result the band cut off Stephen's financial support.  His child 
was taken away from him until a court intervened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government prepared to call in the RCMP to find out 
precisely who in the department of Indian affairs is violating 
the privacy rights of ordinary aboriginal people?

the Reform critic was forced to admit upon questioning that we do 
not have any evidence of what he said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know 
how much more evidence the government needs.  When Bruce 
Starlight wrote to the minister of Indian affairs to allege 
corruption on his reserve, that letter was immediately handed to 
band chief Roy Whitney.  Chief Whitney is now using band funds, 
money contributed by the federal government for all band members, 
to sue Mr. Starlight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bruce Starlight's wife Deanna has a question.  She wants to know 
how it is that money belonging to her and her children can be

for several months now we have been hearing the intergovernmental

unilaterally declare its sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, four years ago in Saint-Malo, the prime minister 
said, and I quote  “Any advances made in international law have 
come about through unilateral decisions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the prime minister recognized that, in international 
law, the principle of effectivity is what counts, why is the

<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

that what Canada did was consistent with the principles of 
international law that allow it to take emergency action to prevent 
the complete destruction of this essential resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Bloc Quebecois wants, at all costs, to link its attempt 
to secede with the turbot war, then there is no hope.  First Mr.

admit it suits him well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone, including the prime minister, understood yesterday 
that it is established facts that matter in international law.  In 
other words, international law recognizes facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the prime minister or his minister explain to us, with a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council

and I am going to answer it very calmly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very interesting that the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois is admitting that his party now espouses the theory of 
effectivity, when before that it was self-determination.  He has 
probably been coached by his colleague who specializes in 
international law and he knows what the theory of effectivity is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot defend in this House something that is before the

law by other governments, and that generally leads to difficulties. 
Things are obviously much easier when the people concerned are 
separated by an ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if an attempt is made to do something as unforeseen and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister

I met today with the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, 
they had the same thing to say as all other student groups.  The 
tuition fees have never been higher and funding for 
post-secondary education is lower because of the savage cuts by 
this government to the tune of $6 billion.

<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, having 
your presentation interrupted by question period is somewhat like 
having a couple of rounds of WWF during a tennis match, but I 
will try to carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large debt burdens also reduce the levels of job creating and 
investment in plants, machinery and equipment.  The massive 
iceberg of a debt that government seemingly refuses to address 
has exposed Canadians to higher taxes, making investors nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government owes it to Canadians to change the course of 
financial administration in this country and to heed the warning 
calls that have been sounded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young generations of Canadians have recently realized that they 
cannot trust the government to pay back their CPP contributions 
when they retire in the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's financial record is simply atrocious.  For 
years and years government was entrusted with safeguarding and 
wisely investing the Canada pension plan funds.  The track record 
is very embarrassing.  The government now owes almost $4 billion 
to the CPP and a whopping $114 billion to public sector pension 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, think of the government as the CEO of our nation.  In the 
private sector, its track record would never be tolerated. 
Shareholders would be hollering from the rooftops for a change. 
Canadians need to hold their government to the same degree of 
competence.  Shareholders in a company would not be approving 
spending increases if the company still carried a multibillion 
dollar debt load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I come back to my original analogy of the 
<I>Titanic</I> government approaching the ever increasing iceberg 
debt.  Knowing now how the plotted course of action will hurt our 
nation's economy, it would be indignant of this government to 
keep spending full steam ahead, leaving already overburdened 
Canadians to pick up the pieces and carry the worry of such a 
huge debt on their backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsible thing to do is to change our course of action. 
Ignoring the debt will be as irresponsible as ignoring the 
warnings of the looming iceberg was to the <I>Titanic</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to stop playing Russian roulette with our 
nation's finances. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for an excellent speech.  He has a good understanding 
of the necessity of bringing our debt under control and managing 
the finances of the country on a very solid basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he would take a minute to tell the House and the 
members here what in his view is the effect of the large amount 
of debt and the interest payments on it in terms of the effect 
that has on the paying of government programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B> Madam Speaker, servicing the debt, $48 
billion a year, affects every aspect of government. The fact that 
that kind of money has to go to strictly service the debt and 
cannot be used for social programs, cannot be used for education, 
cannot be used for health programs is what is wrong with this 
country. If we can get the debt paid down and free up some of the 
interest payments to it and slowly work away at it, we can free 
up funds to take care of the problems that we discuss in this 
House every day. Some of the debt is held on short term, high 
interest rates, so we have got to get rid of that first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see people in my constituency office on a daily basis who are 
struggling to get by, and they are struggling for one reason, the 
tax load is too high. There are two parents working, one working 
just to pay the taxes, so that they can try to make a living and 
try to take care of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to be changed. We have to reduce the debt. We have to 
free up more funds. We have to reduce taxes so families in this 
country can enjoy the kind of life they deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
earlier today the Leader of the Opposition led off the debate by 
outlining his party's position being that 50% of the surplus 
should be applied against the debt and the other 50% should go to 
tax breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to a question about spending, the Leader of the 
Opposition said they plan to keep spending levels the same. Given 
that is the position of the Reform Party, I wonder if the member 
could advise the House what items of new spending the Reform 
Party is proposing, if any, and if there are some, what exactly 
is it going to cut out if it introduces these new programs to 
make sure that total spending levels do not increase? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for his question. A couple of the areas that we must 
address, and I think I mentioned them earlier, are health care 
and education. We heard today in the House that education tuition 
is too high.  Student debt has increased substantially in this 
country.  We see it daily at home that the students are coming to 
us and saying that they cannot afford to pay higher tuition. 
There has to be some help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We looked at health and we looked at the way education is 
funded, and these are a couple of places where we would like to 
spend some money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
response to the first half of the question, that he will spend in 
these areas. The second part of the question, which he did not 
answer, is to pay for those additional spending items that he 
laid out, what do we spend on today that they plan to cut out so 
that total spending does not increase from today's levels? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Madam Speaker, there are lots of areas 
where we could spend. There are lots of areas where we could save 
money. In one place we could have had $500 billion more if we had 
not had to pay the penalty on cancelling a bunch of helicopters 
that we ended up buying anyway. We could have saved $260 million 
on the bungled Pearson airport deal. We could have saved $3.4 
million on Mulroney's airbus payout. These are but some of the 
places we will look to find this money. There is $1.1 billion in 
regional development savings. We could look at eliminating that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at the Department of Canadian Heritage. We are 
looking at the department of Indian affairs. We hear in this 
House every day of the mismanagement that happens there. There is 
money there that could be realized. We are looking at cutting the 
employment insurance rates by 21%. These are just a few of the 
areas we would look at and a few of the places where we believe 
money could be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every department, every office in this government should be 
looked at and decided if it is still needed and if there is room 
in that office for some cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to stand in the House of 
Commons today to participate in this debate.  For those who are 
watching and may have just tuned in following question period, we 
are debating an opposition motion that condemns the Liberal 
government for imperilling the economic and social security of 
Canadians.  First, nothing could be further from the truth. 
Second, the motion is not supportable for numerous reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to stand in my place today as a member of a 
government that in 1993 inherited a $42 billion deficit and, as 
we heard from the finance minister this afternoon during question 
period, will for the first time in too many years see a balanced 
budget reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything is to secure the future of Canadians, if anything is 
to secure economic and social services for the people of Canada, 
surely getting our fiscal house in order is the first 
prescription for achieving that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is not supportable because it denies the reality of 
the fact that we have turned the corner.  The back of the deficit 
is broken.  We are on the verge of a balanced budget.  The 
Liberal Party has a plan that we went to the people of Canada 
with.  I was proud to take it to the people of my riding of 
Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign last spring I told my constituents 
about the plan of the Liberal Party, that we expected the budget 
to be balanced within the next two years and that as soon as we 
achieved a balanced budget it was our intention to have 
surpluses. That is what happens when the budget is balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty per cent of the fiscal dividend, whatever its amount, will 
be used to offer needed debt and tax relief to Canadians and 
fifty per cent will be used to invest in the important quality of 
life and social priorities of Canadians.  Those priorities are 
health care, education, children, training and child poverty.  I 
hope we can achieve a consensus in the House that the people of 
Canada understood the promise and the importance of that kind of 
balance in public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one will stand in the House to say “I love paying taxes”. 
However I will say I love Canada and I love the services we have 
collectively decided to support.  I love the fact that when I 
travel outside Canada people say to me that with Canada's health 
system it does not matter if you are rich or poor; you get care. 
People around the world know that we have problems, but Canadian 
medicare says to people that it will do what it can to ensure 
they get the care they need when they need it.  They do not have 
to worry about bankruptcy or their children or mortgaging their 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the people of Thornhill have mortgages.  It is a young 
community made up of Vaughan, Markham and Concord.  Many have 
children.  There is an older population in Thornhill.  Many live 
in condominiums.  Some have mortgages.  Many people who cannot 
yet afford homes live in apartments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of them wish for a brighter and better economic future. They 
all want us to preserve the quality of life for which Canada is 
famous around the world.  They want us to protect the social 
programs which have defined Canada and make us proud to be 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Thornhill understand very well that when we start 
to talk about fiscal policy it is important to have a balanced 
budget.  They know that sometimes a crisis will arise.  They saw 
recently and were very sympathetic to the people who were 
suffering because of the devastating ice storm.  I received many 
calls at my constituency office from people offering to help.  We 
directed them to the appropriate disaster relief agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of my riding are sympathetic.  They understand there 
can be crises that must be addressed, but they want fiscal 
prudence.  Because many of them have mortgages or many of them 
have debts, they know that what is important is how they manage 
them.  Is the debt or mortgage affordable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was concerned that the size of the debt was growing in Canada 
and that the debt to gross domestic product ratio was growing. 
For me the first priority has always been the elimination of the 
deficit and the stabilization of the debt.  I was proud that the 
government made a commitment to reduce the debt to GDP ratio.  We 
have already seen that occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trend is in the right direction.  It is important to reduce 
the debt.  That is an important part of fiscal prudence.  I 
believe very strongly that neither the debt reduction strategy 
nor the tax reduction strategy nor the investment in our youth 
and in our social programs will do anything but enhance the 
future for Canadians because the plan is balanced.  It recognizes 
that it is important to Canadians that we manage our house, that 
we balance our books, that we look at our debt and ask whether we 
can afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we see a decline in the debt to GDP ratio and as the debt is 
gradually reduced we will look at the debt and make an 
assessment, just as people do every day in the riding of 
Thornhill and elsewhere across the country.  They come to the 
conclusion that they do not want to wait until their house is 
paid off before they give their children the opportunities they 
need to have a successful future.  No one wants to insist that 
their house is paid off before their children can go to 
university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Thornhill would like to see tax reduction, but 
they know the fairest way of reducing taxes is to make sure those 
people at the low end are the first to get tax relief.  It is in 
their interest to have a strong social safety net.  It is in 
their children's interest.  It is in their grandparents' 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan of the Liberal government, which is a balanced policy, 
will improve the future of all Canadians.  I believe it is 
supported by the people of Thornhill.  They know it is in their 
interest and in their children's interest.  That is the reason 
they honoured me by voting for me and the Liberal Party during 
the last election in such tremendous numbers. 
Some 60% of the people voted for me.  For that I say thanks.  I 
believe they would want me to vote against this motion of the 
Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have to agree totally with the Liberal member who just 
spoke.  It is the people at the low end of the scale who should 
be getting the tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, I would specifically like to know why it is 
that her government would see a single parent mother with two 
children, earning $15,000 a year, pay $1,700 a year in taxes to 
her government.  I would like to know why families earning 
$30,000 a year and under contribute almost $30 billion in taxes 
to her government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then does she think Canadians should believe that her words 
have any basis in fact?  She says, on one side of the coin, it 
should be the people at the low end of the scale who are getting 
the tax relief; but on the other side of the coin her government 
is collecting $30 billion a year from families earning less than 
$30,000 a year income.  It is incomprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear and very precise.  The specific program of 
the Reform Party is that the people at the low end of the scale 
will be the first people who will be advantaged.  We will no 
longer see single parent moms who are barely getting by paying 
taxes to a government.  That is where the Reform Party will make 
the relief.  Why will the Liberal government not do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not support the 
Reform Party policy that would scrap medicare.  I do not support 
the Reform Party policy that would scrap the CPP.  I do not 
support the Reform Party policy when its members stand in their 
places to tell the people that Canada has the highest rates of 
income tax in the G-7.  The reality and the truth is that we are 
in the middle of the pack of the G-7 when it comes to taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people look very closely at Reform Party policies they will 
begin to realize the high price they will pay in the serious 
deterioration of the quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say the Reform Party should support the child tax benefits, 
the millennium scholarship fund and the initiatives of the 
government which are balanced and which offer to people the kind 
of support they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, we have to make progress, but his policies only cut the 
taxes and the deficit.  They forget about medicare, pensions, 
education and social safety nets.  They scrap equalization 
payments.  I say no to my colleague in the Reform Party.  That is 
not good for Canada and not good for the people of Thornhill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I heard the Liberal member's comments and she is 
absolutely dishonest in what she is saying.  The Reform Party is 
the only party that has railed against the Liberals for the 
gutting of health care and education that they have done over the 
last three and a half to four years, to the tune of $7 billion. 
That is the amount by which the Liberals have gutted the health 
care and education programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said that we would put the amount back in to the tune of 
$4 billion and that member knows it.  Her statements are 
dishonest.  I challenge her to stand and say that they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not even going to 
respond to the member opposite.  He is absolutely ridiculous. 
What he says is not true.  I would say to him that anyone who 
scrutinizes Reform Party policies would understand that they 
would fundamentally dismantle all those things which have built 
the country into a great and wonderful country where everyone has 
access to medicare, public education and, for those in need, to 
pensions.

low interest rates, low inflation and high confidence in one of 
the most robust economies in the industrialized world.  The 
fiscal facts speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that this progress was achieved 
without compromising our core values of fairness, generosity and 
compassion.  This government recognized that deficit reduction 
did not come down to a choice between economics or people.  It 
was a question of making the right choices in order to build a 
better and stronger society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we cut defence spending and agreed to develop a 
national children's agenda, making our first down payment by 
establishing a national child benefit that increases support to 
low income families with children.  It is why we reduced 
subsidies to business, but increased spending on youth.  Over 
three years overall government efforts will help nearly 300,000 
young Canadians find their place in the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is why we closed tax loopholes for wealthy Canadians, but 
launched an opportunities fund and employability assistance 
program for people with disabilities to ensure that they have an 
equal opportunity to enjoy the dignity and financial rewards that 
come with employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made wise investments, investing in the future, creating 
incentives for life-long learning, encouraging self-reliance and 
ensuring financial support for those in greatest need.  Each 
social program is more target, more results oriented and more 
responsive to Canadians' needs than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand proudly before this House as a member of the government 
that believes profoundly in social investment.  We know it is the 
right thing to do.  It is the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a mixture of disbelief and dismay that I address this 
illogical opposition motion.  I am at a loss to understand what 
the hon. member considers to be “reckless spending”.  I must 
admit to being curious about which social programs he believes 
imperil the economic and social security of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he suggest we put the brakes on our campaign against child 
poverty, a co-ordinated national strategy to improve the 
well-being of children that sprung from productive partnerships 
with provincial and territorial governments?  Does he realize 
that ensuring children have a strong start in life is critical to 
Canada's future?  Study after study concludes that a failure to 
invest in early childhood development negatively affects our 
economic prosperity.  Children in economic poverty encounter more 
difficulty and experience more emotional and behavioural problems 
throughout their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the opposition believes it is better to pay later, when 
the social burden would be even greater if we attempt to rebuild 
shattered lives and when our country will find itself incapable 
of competing in the global economy because of a lack of healthy, 
productive work-ready young adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member believes we should forego the millennium 
scholarship fund which will ensure that students who want to 
pursue an advanced education, regardless of their financial 
circumstances, have every chance to realize their career dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the opposition is suggesting we should not fund the 
Canada student loans program which supports 370,000 full-time 
students, almost one-third of full-time students enrolled in 
Canadian universities this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of thousands of Canadian young people are able to 
attend post-secondary institutions where they acquire the skills 
essential to become employable in our knowledge economy because 
of the $1.3 billion available in student loans to subsidize the 
costs of their education.  Canada has the highest percentage of 
youth with a post-secondary education of all the OECD countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of current and worsening skill shortages in the 
high-tech sector, does the opposition recommend that we cast off 
the Software Human Resources Council which works to increase the 
supply and quality of workers entering this rapidly growing area 
of labour force?  Can we afford not to fund initiatives such as 
the Canada Foundation for Innovation which supports economic 
development in knowledge-intensive sectors? 
This partnership with the private sector, the provinces and 
universities is essential to rebuild the research infrastructure 
of Canada's universities and teaching hospitals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member this.  Would his party have us 
abandon the senior citizens of this country whose initial 
investments built those institutions and whose hard work has 
provided us with the high standard of living and the quality of 
life Canadians enjoy today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely my colleagues on the other side of this Chamber recognize 
the moral responsibility, necessity and economic value of 
providing a source of financial stability and security for 
retired Canadians under the Canada pension plan.  Demographic 
demands dictate that we secure the future of the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not apologize for a single one of the many 
progressive social programs funded through federal tax dollars. 
Collectively they help define who Canadians are as a people. They 
shape the country we share, a nation that is the envy of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of the worthy initiatives I have named is crucial to both 
Canada's social and economic stability.  These investments in 
Canada's human capital are an invaluable investment in Canada's 
continued economic growth and social well-being.

who lose their jobs get back to work, the transitional jobs fund 
to create jobs in high unemployment areas, aboriginal strategic 
investments which improve aboriginal peoples' employability and 
create meaningful employment opportunities in aboriginal 
communities across Canada, or labour market development 
agreements with the provinces and territories that allow each 
region to tailor its active employment measures to respond to 
local priorities, these programs are making a real difference in 
the lives of individual Canadians and the overall welfare of our 
great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the House long gone are the days of passive income 
support. These are active, concrete measures that are getting 
people into the workforce, enabling them to provide for their 
families, giving them a reason to continue to believe in 
themselves, their country and the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are unequivocal in their insistence that we have a 
responsibility to look out for the most vulnerable.  They tell us 
they want a Canada where parents are able to give their children 
what they need to flourish, a Canada where youth can find and 
keep rewarding work; a Canada where unemployed people can count 
on temporary assistance to tide them over until they get back on 
their feet; a Canada where Canadians feel secure and confident 
that the Canada pension plan will provide the income support they 
require to retire in dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member exactly who is it he would leave behind. 
What Canadian is not worthy of these fundamental human rights? 
Only when he is able to come up with the answer to that question 
should Parliament seriously consider this motion.  Until then I 
urge all members of this House to focus our sights on the real 
priorities, continuing our balanced approach to fiscal 
accountability and social responsibility and ensuring that Canada 
will retain the title of number one nation in the world each and 
every year of the new millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
listening to my colleague's shopping list of groups in society to 
be considered.  I agree.  However, his good wishes do not reach the 
most remote rural areas, which are still suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not necessarily agree that the debt should be paid as 
soon as possible, as the Reform Party often says, because if a 
family is in debt for example, it has to stay in debt for a while, 
unfortunately, so the children can eat and go to school.  It is 
true it costs a lot, but the family will continue to pay off its 
debts for a few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My response to my colleague is “Yes, we are doing something, 
but we cannot do it that way”.  We want the money to be given back 
to the provinces through tax points or transfers.  Who is in a 
better position to distribute the money?  The provinces, of course. 
When I say provinces, sometimes it is the municipalities, but they 
have to go through the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do? It plans to put the Canadian flag on 
every cheque. It looks good. This is tantamount to buying votes. I would 
submit that anyone with compassion should not try to score political 
points on the backs of the less fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that, this year again, banks are posting billions of 
dollars in profits without anyone raising the alarm about this? Would 
they go bankrupt if these profits were taxed at a higher rate? No. In 
practical terms, this means that, in this country, instead of 
distributing wealth equitably, governments are letting the rich get 
richer as the poor get poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Matapédia—Matane, employment insurance is commonly 
referred to as poverty insurance, because many of my constituents will 
not qualify for it this year because they are 20, 30 or 40 hours short. 
People want to work.  But because they have not accumulated enough hours 
to qualify for EI benefits, they are forced onto welfare and this is a 
blow to their dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my hon. colleague. I listened carefully to 
his remarks and some of them made sense. Could he not convince his 
colleagues to transfer this responsibility to the provinces so they can 
do as he suggested, but much more efficiently and cost-effectively, and 
by staying closer to the people? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for the question.  I, too, represent a rural area in 
Ontario and I think it is very important that we work on behalf 
of our rural residents along with small town Canada and, indeed, 
all residents of this great country.  I think it is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, as members know, inherited an enormous debt and 
deficit when we took power in 1993.  What we had to do in a short 
period of time was turn that around and make sure that our fiscal 
House was put in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did that with remarkable speed in the great context of 
things.  I think that speaks volumes about the ability of this 
government to do the right thing on behalf, not only of 
provinces, but all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is worthy of note.  Once that is done, we can start 
to see where we can proceed in a way that is reasonable, measured 
and important.  That is to start whittling away and reducing that 
accumulated debt to ensure that we make program reinvestments in 
a way that make sense not only for those of us here but for all 
Canadians on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to start the process of looking at tax reductions in the 
forms that make sense for Canadians as well.  It is important 
that we, as a federal government, do the right thing on behalf of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that it is very important that the federal 
government, with its presence across this great land, do the 
kinds of things that Canadians not only want and need, but 
deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to start by reading the motion again so that people 
who are commenting on the motion can really understand what 
motion is being debated today.  The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for imperilling the 
economic and social security of Canadians with their reckless 
commitment to dramatically increase spending, at a time when the 
average family's share of federal debt is approaching $80,000 and 
Canada has the highest personal income taxes in the G-7. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the basic information in this motion has been refuted by 
members opposite.  The information sources, in fact, mostly come 
from the government itself.  It is kind of hard to understand why 
it is doing that.  It is a little difficult indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am going to do is talk about the four fiscal areas that 
have to be dealt with before this fiscal mess that we find 
ourselves in in this country can be dealt with. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT70"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT70"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the deficit.  The second is the chronically high 
levels of government spending.  The third is the high level of 
debt that we have in this country.  The fourth is the chronically 
high and increasing tax levels that we have.  We have to deal 
with all four areas before we can solve the fiscal problems that 
we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting with the deficit, the balanced budget, we will have a 
balanced budget this year, no doubt.  I think the Liberals should 
receive some credit for that.  It is important we recognize that 
this government will be the first government in 25 years that has 
had a balanced budget. It deserves some credit for that. I am 
going to look a little bit later at how it arrived at this 
balanced budget.  I think that is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what would have happened had we had the New Democratic 
Party as the opposition over the past four years.  We would have 
had at least as high a deficit as was in place when the Liberals 
took government in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if the Conservatives had been the opposition over these 
past four years?  Then we would have had more of the same.  If we 
look at the last 30 years, whether it was the Liberals governing 
with the Conservatives in opposition or the Conservatives 
governing with the Liberals in opposition, it really did not 
matter.  We had ever growing deficits and we had this debt 
balloon to a level which is completely unmanageable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really important to recognize that the real push for 
government to deal with the deficit came with the Reform Party as 
it was established first in 1987 and as we came to Ottawa in 
1993. I give the government credit for being the government in 
place when the budget was balanced but it is important also to 
give Reform credit as being the force which nudged, prodded, 
pushed and cajoled this government into finally doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a balanced budget only deals with one of the four key 
areas which have to be dealt with to solve this fiscal mess. The 
second is the high level of government spending, in fact 
overspending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, the Liberals have concentrated most of 
their speeches on how they are going to spend on all these very 
worthwhile causes.  They are going to spend for this, spend for 
that.  They have this program, they have that program.  What 
about dealing with Canadians who really need help? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are continuing. In fact they are returning to an increased 
pattern of overspending.  That is pretty clear from what we have 
heard today.  That is what is coming.  Clearly the chronic 
overspending has not been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area is the high level of debt, $600 billion.  That 
probably does not mean much to a lot of people.  My wife and I 
have five children.  Our share of that debt is approximately 
$20,000 for each of us which amounts to $140,000 that we have to 
add to the mortgage on our house, the mortgage on our farm and 
the other payments we have to make.  We have to make payments to 
pay down this $140,000 which is our portion of the debt. Because 
I earn probably higher than average income, our portion will be 
even higher than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it means beyond that is that this government will spend 
more than $45 billion this year just to make the interest 
payments on the debt.  The Liberals talk about caring and 
spending on social programs.  I would like them to respond to how 
spending this $45 billion on interest payments is allowing more 
money for these important social programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a little difficult for me to understand.  That $45 billion 
is not available for any social program.  It only goes to pay the 
interest on the debt.  Clearly that part of the fiscal puzzle, 
the high level of debt, has not been dealt with and as a result 
too much of our hard earned tax money is going toward interest 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth area is the one which I want to concentrate on.  I 
want to put it in personal terms.  I only use my family as an 
example because they are the people I know best.  I care about 
them and I talk with them more than anybody else, quite frankly, 
about these issues.  This area concerns the chronically high tax 
levels in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disposable income under this government since 1994 has decreased 
by $3,000 for the average family.  Yet the finance minister 
stands and with a straight face says “We have reduced taxes”. 
Liberal math is really hard to figure out.  That is a well 
documented fact. This and various other tax increases, which I 
will refer to in a bit of detail in a few minutes, have an impact 
on my family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, I have five children.  My oldest daughter is 20 
years old.  She is taking business management and is in her third 
year of university.  She has worked to earn money for university 
and she has taken on a loan to help pay her way through 
university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two sons who have just turned 18.  They are identical 
twins.  The member for Crowfoot is not the only Reform member who 
can proudly say that he has twins. My sons are in their first 
year of engineering at university. They are very fortunate that 
they earned enough in the summer to pay for their education. 
They work hard.  They have trained for years to gain the ability 
to earn their way through university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They started their own business.  The work they do amazes me. 
They rebuild combine headers.  Farmers will understand what that 
is.  They completely rebuild old headers, paint them to make them 
look nice, make sure they are in good working shape and they sell 
them.  They carry on this business.  More and more they are 
coming to me to talk about the high rate of taxes, how taxes are 
affecting them already and how they will be affected by them far 
more in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent tax issue which they brought to my attention was 
the Canada pension plan premiums. Because they run their own 
business and are self-employed, they pay both the employee and 
employer portions of the Canada pension plan premiums.  That 
means as their business earnings increase, probably by the time 
they get to their fourth year of university they will be paying 
the full premium rates for the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each one of them will be paying close to $3,300 in Canada 
pension plan premiums and for what? I have heard many Liberals 
say that it is for a secure retirement which will be guaranteed. 
The maximum amount they could ever hope to get out of that 
pension is $8,800 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax increase and other tax increases have had an incredibly 
negative impact on my family and on families across this country. 
That part of the fiscal puzzle has to be solved and it cannot be 
solved until we start lowering taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
earlier today the leader of the Reform Party said that it took 15 
years for Canadians to wrestle this deficit monster and to beat 
it and he was absolutely right.  It did take 15 years.  And it 
took more than this Liberal government to beat the deficit; it 
also took a Conservative government.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from <I>The Economist</I>.  It stated that much of 
the credit for deficit reduction in Canada comes from the passage 
of time and successful reforms earlier in the 1990s introduced by 
a Conservative government, including free trade which the members 
opposite fought, the GST which the members opposite fought, and 
the deregulation of the financial services industry, the 
deregulation in transportation, and the deregulation of energy, 
like the national energy program which when we eliminated it 
benefited western Canadians.  The Reform Party should remember 
that and give credit where credit is due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear members of the Reform Party speak, there is always a 
certain amount of warmth because they usually refer to their own 
family situations.  I think that is wonderful because I came from 
that kind of Ozzie and Harriet, Leave it to Beaver family as 
well.  However I am not naive enough, like a lot of members of 
the Reform Party are, to assume that is typical of Canadians and 
that all Canadians are so fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference between the Reform Party and our party is that we 
care about all Canadians.  We will continue to fight not just for 
the wealthy or for those who are privileged and have access to 
the economic levers and to bootstrap themselves out of poverty, 
but for all Canadians.  That is why we propose in our party 
platform to raise personal exemptions to $10,000 and to actually 
help the poorest of Canadians and not just the rich Canadians for 
whom the Reform Party would fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Reform Party member a question relative 
to student debt.  In 1993 eight students in Atlantic Canada had 
$30,000 or more of student debt after a four year program.  Today 
in 1998 there are over 900.  What is the Reform Party's position 
on student debt?  How would it address the student debt issue for 
young Canadians who are now looking to go into the 21st century 
to compete on a global stage with over $30,000 worth of student 
debt upon graduation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, before I get directly 
into answering the question, I will say that when the 
Conservatives were in government they did some good things.  They 
put in place the free trade agreement.  I guess that is about it, 
but there must have been some other good things, such as the GST 
and the Airbus deal.  Those are pretty good things too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbelievably the member began by saying that his party also beat 
up on the deficit.  The Conservatives beat it up to $43 billion a 
year, a record high.  I do not know how that member can stand and 
somehow say that his government had anything to do with the fact 
that we at least have a balanced budget now.  It is really hard 
to figure out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives talk about how they are caring and how they 
are not just concerned with those who have but also with those 
who have not. How have they shown that when they played a big 
role in driving that debt up to $600 billion?  Over $45 billion 
is spent on interest payments on the debt alone.  That is money 
that is not available to deal with those areas of concern to 
Canadians.  We recognize there is a need out there. Therefore 
this is a little hard to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dealing with student debt is important. Having three children 
now in university and two more in about two or three years, it is 
important.  The Liberals dealt with it by reducing transfers to 
the provinces for health and education by $6 billion to $7 
billion a year as of this year and next year.  That is how they 
dealt with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first private member's bill the Leader of the Official 
Opposition tabled before this House was on how to deal with that 
student financing problem.  It talked about things like making 
sure money is available, but making sure that it was going to be 
repaid, having income contingent repayment and so on.  That is 
the importance we place on this issue.  Our leader in his first 
private member's bill dealt with it.  The member should read the 
bill.

Madam Speaker, as we approach a balanced budget in the next year 
we must be careful to let people know that we are not here to 
praise the Liberals today.  In fact we are here to condemn the 
Liberals for their high taxation, for their reckless spending, 
and for the mismanagement of the country's finances.  They helped 
to get us into this debt crisis in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced budget that will be coming down, I have to add, was 
not achieved through prudent spending of the Liberals.  It was 
not achieved through cutting back on their wasteful spending, 
cutting back in the areas of little need in which they doled out 
millions upon millions of dollars to their political friends and 
special interest groups.  That is not how we reached this 
balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We reached this balanced budget through Liberal policies on the 
backs of hard working Canadian taxpayers.  That is how we are 
getting to this balanced budget, not through the cutting of 
wasteful spending like the Reformers have demanded since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals like to crow about their balanced budget, 
telling us that they are the heroes of the country, they should 
thank the real heroes, the Canadian taxpayers who have made it 
possible to achieve a balanced budget, the overtaxed workers of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should give thanks for their balanced budget to the 
students who cannot afford to pay their tuitions, to the students 
who are facing having to pay incredibly high student loans 
because the Liberals have taxed education out of the reach of the 
average Canadian student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should give thanks to the businesses that cannot 
afford to hire because of the incredible payroll taxes the 
Liberals continue to hang on to.  Those are the real heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should give thanks to the sick people, people who 
are on waiting lists for health care and surgery.  That is whom 
the Liberals can thank for their balanced budget.  They have cut 
back billions of dollars from health care.  There are no hospital 
beds.  There is no room in the surgeries to look after the needs 
of Canadians to get them to better health.  That is whom the 
Liberals have to thank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should thank Canadian families who are just 
scraping by, who saw their disposable income reduced by $2,000 to 
$3,000 since the Liberals came into power.  They are the real 
heroes of this balanced budget, not the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Liberals now talk about dedicating half of a 
projected fiscal dividend to new spending programs when we have 
just barely balanced the budget?  How can they in all common 
sense talk about new spending programs as they have been doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have they forgotten something?  Have they forgotten that the 
country is $600 billion in debt?  Have they forgotten that there 
is about a $45 billion a year interest charge on this debt?  That 
$45 billion is more than is spent on health care, education and 
old age security in a year; more than all of that.  Our biggest 
expenditure is the interest charge on the national debt and the 
Liberals want to introduce more spending programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that absolutely astonishing and unbelievable.  They are 
like kids in a candy store, just dying to spend more money.  They 
are like spendaholics with a new credit card, just dying to go 
downtown and rack it up.  That is what they are like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have introduced more than 30 new spending programs in the 
last year. 
We will see more of them in the upcoming budget.

celebrate with a stiff drink.  It would put us back on the ways 
that got us there in the first place.  It is like running us 
over, getting out of the car, picking us up, throwing us down and 
backing over us again.  That is what these new spending programs 
can be compared to.

to loosen up those cheques.  They have already done it.

The Tories helped them with decades and decades of reckless, 
irresponsible spending.  Now it looks like they want to do it 
over and over again.

all these things.  They think we are out of the woods but we are 
not.  They are ready to fire up that spending engine again and go 
full blast down the road.  Oh, yes, for the Liberals happy times 
are here again.  They just cannot wait to be spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget may be balanced this year, but the Liberals are not 
the heroes.  It is tax paying Canadians who have to be thanked. 
They are the real heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could talk about some other little recognized heroes. 
It is the official opposition party, the Reform Party, that has 
been pushing the Liberals since 1993 to get the finances of the 
country under control.  Now that they are just about there they 
want to take credit for it.  No way.  The Reform Party has been 
leading the pack to make the fiscal health of the country 
healthier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been leading the charge and we have the plan.  We have 
the alternative.  It is called “Securing Your Future”.  The 
Liberals have it.  They know it is a sound plan.  It clearly 
spells out how to clean up the Liberal-Tory mess.  We can 
distribute it after the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have our priorities right.  Our plans say that we should not 
start spending again.  We should start paying down our debt.  Our 
plans say we should not start new spending programs, that we 
should give tax relief to Canadians from the surtax and the blood 
sucking, insidious little bracket creep the Tories put in.  I 
love that phrase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poor families today owe about $78,000 each of the national debt. 
They are paying an incredible amount of their income tax to 
service that debt.  The priorities have to be right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan says we need tax relief, not new spending programs. 
These are the right priorities.  We say a dollar left in the 
hands of a taxpayer does far more good than sending that dollar 
in taxes to these Liberals in Ottawa.  That is the right 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan states clear priorities for responsible spending. Those 
are right priorities, not spending on ski resorts, golf courses 
or free flags on which the heritage minister would like to spend 
her money but spending on programs Canadians care about like 
health care and education.  These programs were gutted by the 
Liberal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are not only the right priorities.  It is the compassion 
needed in the country today.  It is the common sense to get 
priorities straight.  The Liberals have none of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition calls for paying down the debt, 
controlling spending, lowering taxes, and reinvesting in health 
care and education.  That is a good plan.  That is common sense. 
We have listened to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the country columnists and journalists in the economic 
field have looked at our plan and said that it is a quick reading 
of the public mood.  It is a compelling plan.  It will point the 
federal government in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will keep the pressure on the Liberals to go in the right 
direction.  Day after day we will remind them of their past sins 
and tell them how they can repent and bring the country back to 
financial health.  We will be here day after day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to keep the country on the road to a strong, secure 
future.  That is why we call our plan “Securing Your Future”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate being recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am listening with great interest to the Reform Party members, 
in particular the member for Lakeland who tries to rewrite 
history in the name of the NDP.  Whenever Reformers write history 
on behalf of the NDP they get it dead wrong, just like many of 
their principles and their philosophies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to set the record straight and ask the member who just 
gave his speech a question or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the NDP had governed in the last four years, let alone being 
the opposition, we probably would have had a similar situation in 
Canada to what we had in Saskatchewan.  For example, from 1971 to 
1982 we had 11 consecutive balanced and surplus budgets and no 
debt, the lowest tax rate in the country, a free dental plan for 
our children 18 years of age and under, and an almost free 
prescription drug program.  It was one of the best places in the 
country to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 the Reform cousins, the Conservatives in Saskatchewan 
who are now back to the Reform Party—they were Conservatives at 
that time—promised three things the Reform Party has promised. 
They promised less taxes, less government and more jobs.  The 
people of Saskatchewan voted for Mr. Devine, the Reform 
Conservative in Saskatchewan, and they got less taxes, less 
government and more jobs not.  They did not get that.  They had 
higher taxes and increased government services.  They gave away 
the assets.  They bankrupted the province in nine years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Reform Party which bankrupted Saskatchewan in nine years 
under the Conservative banner is saying that NDPers are not very 
good governors.  In 1991 the people of Saskatchewan kicked the 
bums out and re-elected an NDP government.  Since 1992 there have 
been consecutive surplus budgets in Saskatchewan under the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What track record does the Reform Party have?  It has a nine 
year track record in Saskatchewan of corruption, inefficiency, 
ineffective government, huge deficits and a 60 year debt to be 
paid off by the people of that province.  It will take 60 years 
to pay off the Reform debt in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just remember, members of the Reform Party promised less 
government, less taxes and more jobs.  Their cousins in the 
Conservative Party are quite amused with the comment about how 
they are each fighting and bragging about “I supported the free 
trade agreement.  I supported the GST”.  They did and they are 
putting our country in very serious jeopardy.  Ask any small 
business person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member one question.  They talk about 
eliminating equalization payments.  The member for Dauphin—Swan 
River, a Reform member, does not agree with the Reform Party.  He 
is a Reform member of Parliament and a former mayor of Dauphin, 
Manitoba.  He says the leader of the opposition and his Reform 
Party have a screw loose when it comes to eliminating 
equalization because that is a leverage for small business and 
small communities in western Canada to create jobs and economic 
diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  Does he support the member 
for Dauphin—Swan River in his on-hands governing as mayor of the 
city of Dauphin before he got elected and used equalization to 
the benefit of the people of Dauphin?  Does he agree with that 
member, or does he support his leader who says let's trash the 
west, let's trash the regions when it comes to economic 
diversification and eliminate equalization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I inform the NDP member 
that in our party democracy is alive and well.  We can disagree 
with each other.  We are not led around like little sheep with a 
noose in our nose.  We can disagree if we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said if the NDP had been running the country or in 
the opposition it would have been like Saskatchewan with the 
biggest out-migration of population of any province leaving the 
country.  No.  If they were the official opposition the country 
would be more like B.C. or Ontario under Bob Rae with out of 
control spending, out of control debt, corruption and dishonesty 
like we currently have in B.C. under Glen Clark, out of control 
ethics, dishonesty and corruption in our provincial government. 
That would be the scene in this Parliament if the NDP were in 
this spot here in official opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time 
with the member for Ottawa—Vanier.  It is a pleasure to respond 
to this motion.  The motion contains a rather confusing reference 
to a reckless commitment by our government to dramatically 
increase spending.  That is not unusual to hear from the opposite 
side which makes statements like that with no basis at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a highly speculative statement but at the risk of 
jumping to conclusions I assume it relates to the fact that our 
government is on the verge of delivering the first balanced 
federal budget in nearly 30 years and Reformers just cannot take 
hearing the facts.  That is what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have our fiscal house in order, interest rates are low and 
our rate of inflation is among the lowest in the industrialized 
world.  From a trade standpoint we have one of the most open 
economies in the world.  We have an opportunity to build on this 
economic foundation to create a knowledge economy for the 21st 
century.  We have the people, we have the institutions and we 
have the research excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, having such assets is not enough.  We have to mobilize 
our resources toward the clear objective of being the best in a 
knowledge based economy.  I will address this point shortly but 
first I will devote some time to a discussion of our achievements 
over the past four years which I am sure the opposition will want 
to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After more than a decade of high deficits a balanced fiscal 
situation is in sight in Canada.  We have achieved this by 
sticking to a rigorous deficit reduction plan that relies on the 
help and support of all Canadians from coast to coast, having 
budgets set and two years of planning to make sure we stay on 
target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that our fiscal progress is more than a federal 
effort.  The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister have 
repeatedly said this.  It is a national effort supported by 
Canadians across this country.  It relies on the efforts of every 
province and territory from coast to coast which has set a goal 
of returning us to full fiscal health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results are striking.  With the provinces' plans in place 
the total government deficit is expected to be eliminated by 
1998-99, right on target.  We have consistently hit all our 
deficit targets.  In 1996-97 our deficit was $8.9 billion, about 
$20 billion lower than in 1995-96.  Canada was the only G-7 
country to be in a surplus on a federal financial requirement 
basis in 1996-97. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fiscal progress is so great that we are on the verge of a 
national debate, a debate that is happening here in the House. We 
often talk about what will be done with the surplus.  We are on 
the brink of a post deficit era which was unimaginable four years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has not relied on across the board tax increases 
to hit its deficit targets.  We have not relied on rosy 
forecasts.  We are maintaining the same prudent approach we 
adopted from the beginning and it is starting to bear fruit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's inflation rate has gone from one of the highest among 
the G-7 economies to one of the lowest in the world with 1.5% 
annual inflation over the last four years.  We outperformed the 
U.S.  during this same period.  Our interest rates are three 
points lower than they were in 1995 and Canada is poised to 
experience sustained economic growth. The OECD predicts that 
Canada will grow by 3.5% in 1998 and 3.3% in 1999, the best two 
year performance of any G-7 country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is not enough to say that we are meeting our financial 
targets.  Canada must also rise to the challenge and become a 
leader in the global knowledge based economy.  Our government is 
investing in innovation and knowledge itself.  We are targeting 
the knowledge based sectors where we are already strong and where 
the opportunity for growth is the highest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will spur job creation and sustain growth in our standard 
of living in the 21st century.  We are helping to build a leading 
edge national system of innovation with programs like the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation.  Our $800 million investment will draw 
up to $1.2 billion in additional public and private sector 
investments to create a total R and D investment of some $2 
billion over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund will renew and expand research infrastructure at 
Canadian hospitals, colleges and universities.  This will create 
better research infrastructure and facilities for researchers and 
students.  It also ensures that our best and brightest stay in 
Canada to pursue their studies and careers.  We are helping to 
bring new innovation to market with the Technology Partnerships 
Canada.  We are making repayable investments at the commercial 
end of the R and D spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are real investments where the government and the private 
sector share both the risks and the rewards.  Investments to date 
have ranged from aerospace to environmental technologies.  We are 
building on the success of the National Research Council's IRAP 
program to help small and medium size businesses develop and 
commercialize new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Business Development Bank has been refocused to better meet 
the financial needs of innovation in small and medium size 
businesses.  In a knowledge economy, the only true competition 
advantage lies in developing the brains and skills of our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian millennium scholarship fund will invest in economic 
excellence and provide thousands of scholarships to give young 
Canadians access to colleges and universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are part of our efforts to prepare our society to meet the 
challenges of a knowledge based economy head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let me repeat that we have invested our money 
wisely.  We have reined in the deficit and we will continue to 
wage our battle against the debt.  We have made a firm commitment 
to ensure that all Canadians can benefit from the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to suggest that we are on the verge of 
reckless commitment to dramatically increase spending is utterly 
ridiculous.  As far as I am concerned, the motion by the 
opposition today is political hogwash.  The same party said just 
a few years ago that Canada was going bankrupt.  The same party 
said that Canada was part of a third world nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party needs to recognize the reality of the last four 
years.  It needs to understand the challenges of tomorrow.  Like 
this Liberal government, it needs to see the limitless potential 
we have before us as we move Canada into the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
when I listen to my colleague opposite, he sounds just like the 
members beside us.  We hear the most interesting things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about the fight to bring down the deficit.  I will 
tell you how to go about ruining the social fabric.  When all is 
said and done, yes, I agree that the deficit must be eliminated. 
Deficits are a drain on future generations. But it is all in how 
you go about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague across the way:  How is it 
that our economy is doing so well right now?  The indicators show 
that we are in a period of full economic growth. 
Businesses have been making record profits for a few years now. 
How is it that, with business doing so well, poverty is on the 
rise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted to reduce the deficit.  The federal government has 
taken the easy way out and cut transfer payments.  The provinces 
are then obliged to make cuts in the social fabric:  health, 
education.  Right now, there is unprecedented poverty.  The worst 
is that it is a trend, and that is what worries me. While the 
economic indicators certainly look very good, it is a bit like 
Canada Dry: it looks like champagne, but it does not taste like it 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What worries me is that, instead of making cuts as the 
government has done or lowering taxes as others have done, we 
should be debating the issue, as the Bloc Quebecois suggested at 
one point. If we are in a period of economic growth, that means there is 
money, there is wealth being created.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If wealth is being generated, why are we not able to get at it? I 
am alluding to tax increases, to ways of getting the money where it is, 
namely in the pockets of the wealthiest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, why is it that major corporations can take advantage of tax 
avoidance schemes, tax havens and all these sorts of things? Governments 
turn a deaf ear, and I feel that, all too often, they are puppets of the 
corporate world and of the wealthy. The government does not care about 
young students getting into debt, or about the poor. What is more 
worrisome are the new types of poverty currently found in our society. 
All this leaves a very bitter taste; the champagne has turned to 
vinegar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the question to the hon. member opposite: How does he explain 
the fact that there is an ever widening gap between the rich and the 
poor? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sure that the 
member opposite realizes that when this government took over from 
the previous government we were $42 billion in debt.  I am sure 
he realizes very clearly the amount of transfer cuts versus total 
spending cuts in the federal government.  The federal government 
cut well over 14% of its own spending.  It more important at that 
time to cut spending at the federal level in order to get our 
house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the member needs to be reminded, but maybe so, 
where interest rates were and where they are today, where 
inflation was and where it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the number of times that investments have been 
put into companies in order to get jobs.  There have been a number 
of jobs created, whether it be Technology Partnerships Canada, in 
research, in the Canada Foundation for Innovation with which I 
understand there has been some difficulty in Quebec with the Bloc 
and the PQ as far as making sure the scientists get the 
money.  That will be resolved shortly I hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is by putting money into these programs which has created the 
jobs to put more people off the poverty line and into earning a 
higher amount of money.  That is how we get the economy going 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are people saying outside of Canada, outside of North 
America, that Canada has been on the right course to develop its 
business plan to make sure that we will be having a better 
future?  That is what is happening today.  The member needs to 
understand that and needs to recognize that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, our 
only reaction to today's opposition motion is a painful feeling of 
déjà vu, if not of reheated leftovers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If memory serves me right, the same hon. member for Medicine 
Hat proposed something similar last fall.  This must not be seen as 
admirable consistency in the opposition's concern for Canadians, 
but rather as an example of how the Reform Party refuses to admit 
that the people of Canada knew very well what they were doing when 
they brought our party back to power in last June's general 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although last year's Reform program, <I>Fork in the Road</I>, met 
with general public indifference throughout the country, these same 
people continue to take up the time of this House by calling for 
measures which Canadians have essentially rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that Canadians are far smarter than the Official 
Opposition would care to admit.  They know that the Reform Party is 
just trying to recycle a platform which repudiates a good number of 
the fundamental values and traditions on which this country was 
built.  They know also that the results our government has obtained 
on the financial level leave them no other choice but to try to 
spread false ideas about how we govern and engage in scaremongering 
about the direction we want to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, however, convinced that Canadians are not as easily 
fooled as the opposition thinks they are.  The June election 
results are proof of this, and our track record on deficit 
reduction and job creation demonstrates that Canadians made the 
right choice, in my opinion.  They know we acted with determination 
over the past four years in order to put our finances in order.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that by doing so we have been true to the sense of 
balance underlying the Conservative ideology of the members of the 
opposition.  They recognize that our plan for the upcoming budget 
surpluses, a balanced plan that will lead to a reduction in taxes 
and in the public debt and to investment in health and education, 
is the best choice for Canada's economic and social future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the motion before us today indicates, the Reform Party is 
trying to make believe that our government has already forgotten 
past lessons. 
This is not so.  We were the first to note the economic effects of 
27 years of deficit financing, the real measure of excess spending, 
and we do not want to expose the country to this scourge again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not preclude, however, establishing priorities for 
our society and investing strategically and wisely for the future. 
We have certainly had to move carefully to achieve our financial 
objectives.  We know that it has meant sacrifices for many.  We are 
beginning to see the fruits of our investments and our efforts, 
efforts that should benefit all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this year we are allocating half of our budget 
surplus to improving social programs in Canada and the other half 
to reducing taxes and gradually repaying the public debt. 
That is what sets us apart from the right wing members across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House believe in the role of government. We 
believe that it can help make our society a better and more equitable 
one. The best example of this is the tax policy pursued by our 
government as compared to the tax policy one might expect under a Reform 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be quite clear. Taxes may be high in Canada, but that is the 
price Canadians have to pay for 25 years of accumulated federal deficit. 
That is why our government will be reducing taxes. The Minister of 
Finance let no room for doubt in this regard. We will see when the 
budget is tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We however could not implement major tax cuts without immediately 
incurring another deficit with devastating effects or being forced to 
slash seniors, health, education and other important social programs. 
None of these options is acceptable to us, as they would nullify the 
social and economic progress we have worked so hard to achieve over the 
past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we are determined to ensure that tax reductions first 
benefit those Canadians who need it most, that is to say low income 
earners. That is why I am looking forward to the next budget. I would 
like to remind the House that one of the distinctive features of our 
previous budgets has been our commitment to ease the tax burden of the 
less fortunate. Our government is the one that has put a stop to rising 
taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about it for a minute.  Individual tax rates have not 
gone up in any of our last four budgets. In fact, the last two 
budgets did not include any tax increases. Instead, they offered 
selective tax cuts of immediate benefit to those whose needs are 
greatest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are $850 million in tax cuts for over one million 
low-income families and their children, cuts for individuals 
making charitable contributions, for disabled Canadians, for 
students, for workers pursuing higher education, and for parents 
saving for their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, some of these tax measures in favour of charitable 
organizations and registered education savings plans were suggested 
to us quite recently when we passed Bill C-28 at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also know that, in each of the last three years, we 
reduced EI premium rates in order to ease the burden of payroll 
taxes.  We also lowered maximum insurable earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took all these measures in order to provide the public with 
real social benefits, while meeting our financial responsibilities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what Reformers would have done, at least I do not think 
so. Given the motion before us, they would prefer immediate and major 
tax decreases, for the benefit of the wealthy. It seems to me that tax 
fairness is a foreign concept to Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the $100,000 capital gains exemption had been eliminated under 
a Reform government, one wonders whether the deduction granted to 
corporations for meal and entertainment expenses would have been reduced 
to 50%. Would the tax rate of major corporations have been raised by 
12.5%? 
Would Reformers have imposed a 12% surtax on the capital assets of banks 
and major deposit institutions? Did Canadians see our government take 
all of these measures? My constituents and those represented by all the 
members of this House have indeed seen our government take such 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we amended the tax system, one of our priorities was to make 
it fairer, in order to spread the fiscal burden more equitably, and to 
ensure that every citizen and every business in Canada does their fair 
share to help reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fairness also guided us in implementing selective tax cuts. Indeed, 
it is only fair that the needy would be the first to benefit from 
government assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to say it again for the benefit of the Reformers in this 
House: we do believe in fiscal responsibility. 
As members of the opposition, it is very easy for Reformers to advocate 
tax decreases across the board. However, we have done too much in the 
fight against the deficit and the debt to jeopardize the progress that 
has been achieved so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight to put our fiscal house back in order is not over yet. 
Victory is within reach, but now is not the time to rest on our laurels. 
We cannot eliminate overnight a tax burden fuelled by 25 years of 
deficits, and we must recognize and accept this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the few comments I wanted to make concerning the 
opposition's motion. I feel it is extremely unrealistic to cut taxes as 
aggressively as suggested by the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
just a short question for my Quebec colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he says there have been deficits for 25 years, and a debt 
has been accumulating for 25 years, it must be stated that for 16 
or 17 of those years the Liberals were in power.  They must admit 
it.  It all started with Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, since my colleague represents a Quebec riding, I trust 
that he has a bit of Quebec in his heart.  I will therefore ask him 
a very simple little question and I would like to get a straight 
answer from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Quebec government and the Bloc Quebecois are 
demanding $2 billion in compensation for the GST. 
Studies have been carried out, although the minister sometimes 
claims otherwise, and there ought to be $2 billion in compensation. 
Is the hon. member prepared, since he comes from Quebec, to claim 
what is merely our due, for the people of his riding, and ours as 
well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to give my 
colleague a lesson in geography.  I am flattered that he thinks I 
am from Quebec.  I must admit that although I was conceived in 
Quebec, I was born in Ontario, I live in Ontario and I represent a 
riding called Ottawa—Vanier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I was born in a village called Mattawa.  It is where 
the Speaker was born as well.  It is in Ontario, and my riding of 
Ottawa—Vanier is definitely in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief anecdote springs to mind.  The day after my election 
in the February 1995 byelection, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported that 
the Liberals had won three byelections in Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the hon. member is not the first one to make the mistake. 
I find it flattering to some extent, but I am very proud of my 
Ontario roots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards accumulated deficits, I did indeed say that over 
the past 25 to 27 years successive governments have accumulated 
deficits such that in 1984, when the government changed, the 
accumulated debt, that is the accumulation of annual deficits, 
amounted to some $180 billion.  The responsibility for that rests 
indeed with the governments of those years, that is, from the early 
1970s to 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1984 and 1993, the debt climbed from approximately 
$180 billion to $480 billion, and we inherited an annual deficit of 
$42 billion.  So, yes, preceding governments, including the one in 
power from 1984 to 1993, which more than doubled the debt in nine 
years, have to bear a share of the blame.  So, as far as that goes, 
we are in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The errors of the past must be put right, and that is what 
this government has done.  In four years, we have reduced the 
deficit from $42 billion to zero perhaps this year, but certainly 
next year.  We are in a surplus situation.  That answers the first 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second, the one about the $2 billion for the GST, 
I will answer that question with another.  Will the member admit 
that the finance minister in the last Quebec government admitted 
officially that there is no claim for $2 billion? 
Quebec's former finance minister, a Liberal, clearly said that 
there was no question of the Government of Canada owing the 
Government of Quebec $2 billion for the GST.  So, I am prepared to 
accept the responsibilities of past governments, and I hope my 
colleague will do likewise. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 
to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at 
the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Churchill River—The Environment; the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington—Literacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I am going to recognize the member for Fraser Valley.  I am 
just wondering if he is going to give us 10 reasons like he does 
in question period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
tempted, but I will divide my time with the member for Wild Rose 
and we will each give 10 minutes on today's motion which was 
supplied by the Reform Party to the House for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who have just now picked up the debate, we are dealing 
with the fact the Reform Party thinks that we should target any 
future surpluses toward paying down the debt and offering tax 
relief, and chastising the government for its plans to spend 50% 
of any new spending or any budgetary surplus on new spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the essence of two different visions on the economic 
side of what we would like to see in Canada.  On the one side is 
the view of the government.  The government says that the way to 
prosperity is to tax Canadians more, to spend more and not to be 
concerned about the debt.  The debt will somehow look after 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition view is that if we are fortunate enough to hit a 
surplus this year that the surplus should be divided equally 
between debt retirement, which of course offers some hope down 
the road, and tax relief which offers hope for today.  Therefore, 
we are offering two different visions and that is what this 
debate is about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we are in the next two, three or four weeks, given a 
budget that shows that we may hit a budget surplus, a good part 
of the credit for that is going to go to the Canadian people who 
unfortunately have seen a record number of some 37 Liberal tax 
increases since this government came in, a huge and growing 
surplus in the EI fund, cuts in transfer payments to provincial 
health care, education and so on.   If it is going to be a 
balanced budget, the credit should go to the Canadian people 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, what do we do with a surplus.  The Liberals 
again mentioned in their throne speech not one concrete proposal 
for debt reduction or tax relief but there are 31 new proposals 
for increased government spending.  The Minister of Finance's 
economic statement has no concrete proposals for debt reduction 
or tax relief, but there are 10 pages of new spending proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the finance committee's pre-budget report, it was weak in 
three different areas. 
Not one word is in there about how to achieve debt retirement 
targets or long term debt management strategy, which are hugely 
important items not only today but for our children and their 
children.  There is a brief mention that certain tax relief 
measures will be examined or studied but there is no commitment 
that should happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a couple of recommendations from the finance committee 
that we would be pleased to support.  They involved increasing 
personal and spousal amounts and removal of the 3% and 5% 
surtaxes on income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day we ask the minister if this is a direction he 
would be pleased to move in, would he please offer that hope for 
the Canadian people, and day after day we are told to just wait, 
that maybe the answer is coming in the budget and maybe it is 
not.  It is a disease called spendicitis.  It affects Liberal 
ministers of finance.  It affects them somewhere deep inside. 
This spendicitis kind of puts a twist in them when they answer 
questions and they just cannot get out those words “I am a 
taxaholic, I suffer from spendicitis and I just cannot say the 
words tax relief”.  Something wells up in their throats.  It is 
a sorry thing to have to watch but I hope one day that our 
current finance minister will get over it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New ideas about spending more money by the Liberals are being 
floated in the newspapers these days.  They seem to think that 
spending more money is the way.  If spending more money, 
borrowing more money, taxing the Canadian taxpayers were the way 
to prosperity we would have so much prosperity in this country, 
so much employment, our dollar would be so high, people would not 
know what to do.  They would be saying there is a chicken in 
every pot.  Instead they say if there is a chicken in every pot, 
why is the taxpayer the one who keeps getting plucked?  They do 
not know why there is not prosperity but the answer sits in the 
policies of the federal government:  No tax relief, no debt 
retirement, no prospects of any of those things happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do governments keep introducing new taxes like the Liberals 
and the Tories before them have done?  Why was the GST 
introduced?  Why have there been so many increases from the other 
side?  Why has bracket creep been allowed to happen?  Bracket 
creep is not a minister of the crown who lives on that side.  The 
bracket creep I am talking about is something that happens in the 
tax system when personal deductions are frozen so that any 
inflation that comes along eats into your disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happens because the government has an insatiable appetite for 
our Canadian tax dollars.  That is why the average family's 
disposable income has dropped $3,000 since the Liberals took 
office.  People probably do not even know that they spend more 
just servicing the interest payments on the debt than they do on 
food and shelter, housing and health care.  It is a sad 
situation.  That is what debt does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than that, taxes and high debt hurt job creation.  I do not 
understand the logic from that side that says do not worry about 
it, what is a little increase in the CPP?  The little increase in 
the CPP means this at home.  There was a little item in my local 
newspaper.  School district 33 just found out that it has to pay 
$170,000 more to service the CPP portion of its tax payroll. It 
says that three full time employees will be laid off in school 
district 33.  By the year 2003 just the CPP portion will be 
$700,000 for that little school district in Chilliwack.  That 
money will either pay for teachers and other staff or it will pay 
for a payroll tax.  It is a job killing payroll tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse than that is what it means for our children.  I travel 
around many high schools, especially those in my riding.  When I 
talk to the kids at the high school level they say “I do not 
know why I should really care about the underground economy, 
about getting something without paying tax.  I do not worry about 
declaring my tips.  Why should I worry if I can get paid under 
the table by a construction company?”  They do not care because 
they do not think the government is handling their money wisely. 
It is a sad thing to see.  What do you say to them? 
When you are standing up there as one of the law makers of the 
land to say “You cannot do what is illegal but you are trying to 
make ends meet”, what do you say to them.  You say “I 
sympathize with you but you have to find another way around it”. 
The way to do it is to change the direction of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to somewhere make that philosophical decision in this 
country on where are we going.  Are we going to go for bigger 
governments, more taxes, rely on government spending to look 
after us or do we make that change soon that says “Government 
cannot do everything.  If you would just leave me the money as a 
taxpayer I will hire people, I will create jobs, I will look 
after some of my own expenses.  But if you are just going to take 
my money and spend it on things I never asked for, then I will 
not be part of that system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our area now there are people who speculate that in the 
housing industry alone—one of the few industries that is still 
doing well in my particular region—up to 25% of the entire 
construction industry is now done under the table.  It is a 
shocking thing but that is what happens when people feel they are 
not getting a bang for their buck on their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would Reform do?  We say attack the debt now.  This is the 
year when we make that division, that fork in the road, and we 
choose the one less travelled.  This is the year.  We take that 
road that says “Let's retire the debt.  Let's pay it down now 
while we are still paying taxes in this House and taxpayers in 
this land that have rung up the debt.  Let us start paying it 
down.  Let us give our children some hope for that”.  We want to 
hold the line on spending, eliminate the waste and then offer 
some tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a document that we have put together called “Securing Your 
Future” we talk about not only where government should refocus 
its energies but also the kind of tax cuts that people can hang 
their hopes on:  for example, tax relief for student loan 
interest, tax relief for capital gains so business people can 
have some hope, tax relief for families so that we can take home 
more of our money, tax relief for people trying to raise 
children.  That is the kind of hope that people need.  Retire the 
debt, offer some tax relief and do not ask the government to do 
everything.  We will look after more of that ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of future we could get with that choice in this 
next budgetary year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I must congratulate the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley.  He has a great turn of phrase with the word 
“spendicitis”.  But I must say that the Liberal Party has 
operated on that malaise called spendicitis since 1993.  We have 
it completely and utterly under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also say that since he has a great turn of phrase there 
is an oxymoron that is like bitter-sweet.  It must be 
bitter-sweet for the party opposite to know that we basically as 
they say have been nudged by them into controlling this wicked 
deficit that we inherited, $42 billion a year.  We have that 
under control.  That is the bitter part for them to swallow 
because we have it under control.  In this current budget we are 
going to propose we have designated 50%— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  A minute is not a long time, is it.  The 
hon. member for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to answer in a 
minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree the Reform Party certainly has been championing the 
balanced budget idea for a long time.  We would love to see 
balanced budget legislation to make sure it stays there, once it 
is there.  We are not convinced it will, depending on who is in 
charge of holding the purse strings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How has the budget been balanced?  We have the highest income 
taxes in the land.  Tax freedom day now is a full six months into 
the year.  In British Columbia we spend 54%, our highest tax 
rate, just on personal income tax.  Fifty-four per cent of income 
goes to income tax, plus the GST, plus the service charges.  We 
have the highest taxes in the G-7.  Canadians pay 56% higher 
income taxes than the average in the industrialized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to thank the Canadian people for balancing—

<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member talks a lot about lowering taxes. I have a short question and a 
comment for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If taxes are lowered by 1%, for example, it does not make a huge 
difference for a low income earner. However, the same 1% makes a 
noticeable difference for someone earning $100,000. The end result of 
this is that the tax decrease will provide greater buying power to the 
rich. It will benefit the rich. This is my first point and I am curious 
to hear what the member has to say about it. I am not playing politics 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, here is my question. The hon. member often says that 
governments spend too much. Does he not think we should try to get money 
from the wealthy? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question.  I take it in the non-partisan way it was offered to 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the advantage to the wealthy?  In a sense, the member is 
right.  If you targeted your tax cuts for the wealthy, if you 
said only people making $100,000 plus are going to get a tax 
break under the Reform plan, I would be quite concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan starts with the people at the bottom.  We say let's 
increase the personal exemption.  We would eliminate 1.2 million 
from the tax rolls altogether.  Let's cut them off.  Let's not 
make them pay any taxes.  Right now a single mom with a child 
making $15,000 a year pays $1,360 in tax.  They deserve to pay no 
tax whatsoever.  Let those people have that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increase that amount.  Increase the spousal amount for those 
that are living together to raise a family.  They are perhaps 
staying at home for a couple of years.  Raise that spousal amount 
to match the personal exemption so that they get to not only take 
home more because of the increased personal exemption, but they 
get to keep more for their spouse to help them during the period 
they are raising the child. That is more for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lowering the GST by 1 per cent helps every single person who is 
buying.  If you are buying clothes for your family and you do not 
have to pay seven but six, it helps.  It starts to lower the tax 
burden.   You have to offer the right kind of tax relief.  I 
think we have the right combination of help for entrepreneurs 
which will increase job opportunities, help for poor people by 
taking them off the tax rolls and leaving that money in their 
hands.  The socially responsible thing to do is leave that money 
with the poorest of the poor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
really pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this motion 
which I thoroughly agree with.  The hon. member for 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke sort of triggered my selection in 
the direction I was going to take on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get right to the spending.  He said the Liberal 
government has done an excellent job of getting it under control. 
My colleague from Fraser Valley pointed out something very 
important that I think we really ought to applaud.  That is the 
taxpayers of this country have bent over backwards to help 
eliminate the deficit.  They are the ones who did it.  They are 
the ones who deserve the credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that they have accomplished this balanced budget, the least 
that we can do for Canadian taxpayers is say job well done, now 
we are going to concentrate on reducing the debt and giving you a 
much deserved tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about spending, that everything is under 
control.  He must not be reading the public accounts.  I just 
want to point out a couple of them.  One of them will really 
interest you, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only been here four years.  If you look through the 
public accounts you see money being spent for a committee to 
discover all kinds of different ways to use blueberries to make 
good jam, good pudding or whatever, a committee that was struck 
by this government.  That is just one example.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The one I am really intrigued with cost $116,000. It is a 
committee the government put together to study seniors and 
sexuality.  Old guys like us must really be appreciative of that 
kind of committee.  Am I pleased that the government is willing 
to spend money like that to look after me and my sexuality.  That 
is the kind of bragging the government ought to stand up and talk 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the public accounts.  Look at all the stupid things the 
government spends money on.  And the Liberals sit over there and 
brag.  I hope there is one area where spending does not take 
place.  I hope the Liberals do not have a bunch of money in each 
one of their budgets to pay chiropractors to help put their arms 
and shoulders back in place from trying to pat themselves on the 
back.  They do not deserve a pat on the back.  The kind of pat 
they deserve would be a lot lower than on the back, for the way 
they have spent this country into the situation it is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members have people coming to them with different 
complaints regarding this and that and one thing or another. Just 
the other day before we came back to this session, a fellow came 
to my office.  He was absolutely displeased. He had received a 
raise.  He was as angry as could be.  We compared his paycheque 
before he got the raise. Guess what?  He was taking home less 
money than he was before he got the raise.  But guess who was 
getting more money?  The Liberal Government of Canada was getting 
quite a bit more, more in income tax because it put him up in a 
higher bracket, and a whole lot more in CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of thing these people are doing to Canadians 
who are trying to make ends meet.  Canadians are getting angry 
and are wondering why the government is doing this to them.  We 
have to stop this and the only way I know of is to kick those 
guys right out of those seats and put people over there who are 
willing to look after those kinds of issues because they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at priorities.  In my riding young married couples 
with one or two children have been evicted from their homes 
because they cannot pay the rent or they cannot make the mortgage 
payment.  Yet if we look at their paycheques, some of them earn 
$20,000, some less and some maybe more, but the amount of taxes 
is pathetic. The taxes would be enough to help them live in their 
homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime their kids, the wife or the husband might have 
dental problems but if they do not belong to a dental care plan 
they cannot think about going to a dentist because they cannot 
afford it.  If one of them needs a pair of glasses, the best hope 
they have is to pick up a cheap pair at a drugstore rather than 
go to an optometrist because they cannot afford it.  Yet the 
government can still take taxes and more taxes and smile at them. 
I do not see how they can be happy about what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the prison guards.  As prison critic I go around talking 
to the prison guards. They have not had a raise in nine years. 
There has not been a raise for our security guards, the people 
who clean our floors or our bus drivers.  I am beginning to think 
that it might not be a good idea to give anybody a raise because 
it is only the government that will benefit. It means more taxes 
for the government.  Maybe we should say to these people “We 
will give you a better deal.  We will leave a lot more in your 
pockets rather than give you a whole bunch more money, because it 
will just be more for us”.  I wonder if they think about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And how is this for priorities in the prisons? If you are a 
prison inmate a dentist comes and takes care of your teeth. It 
does not cost the inmate anything.  If he has an eye problem we 
supply him with glasses.  Well good grief, they might even pay 
for a sex change.  Let us do that for them.  One of the inmates 
said to me “You know, it is not bad in here.  I have not been 
cold, it is nice and warm.  I get three good squares a day”. 
We could go to many ridings and find lots of families who wished 
they could have three square meals a day but they cannot.  They 
have a difficult time, unless they really like Kraft cheese 
dinners.

</I></B></P><P align=left>And the Liberals sit over there and pat themselves on the back 
and brag and boast and go to the press club or wherever else to 
celebrate their great and wonderful victories.  But they have 
nothing to celebrate.  They have a long way to go.  They have 
started. We have a balanced budget.  That is great.  Now let us 
start thinking about the other things that have to be taken care 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians had better soon see some relief.  They have been 
supporting this idiotic way of running government for the last 30 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a happy grandpa.  I really fear for the future of my 
grandchildren.  I wonder if anybody over there is listening and 
hearing what is being said.  Do not pat yourselves on the back 
too hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statements we hear from young people.  They say “We will 
have to work for the rest of our lives never utilizing the CPP”. 
They do not believe for a moment that it will be there.  They do 
not believe the rhetoric they are hearing from the government 
that, boy, it is going to look after them.  At the end of the 
day, after all of the CPP deductions have been made, which they 
cannot afford to pay because they might have to pay a dental bill 
or they might have to buy more food, they do not believe the CPP 
will be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say  “I am going to have to pay more and more taxes to 
help those who are retiring as the years go on”.  They feel like 
they are the ones in Canada who will be burdened with the whole 
load. Under this government's policies they are not wrong.  They 
are not far from wrong at all. Under our plan we want this 
shared.  I am willing to share in the debt load.  I am willing to 
pay my part.  I do not believe any members over there are willing 
and I can illustrate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be one of 51 members of this House, along with 
five members from the Liberal Party and five members from the 
Bloc, who gave up the gold plated pension to save taxpayers $30 
million.  I am proud to be part of that.  At least it is 
something which we on this side of the House could do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is not one of them over there who has the fortitude to 
stand today and say “Count me in.  Do away with the gold plated 
pension”.  I applaud those over there who did and I condemn 
those who have not. Boy, that pension is going to look good to a 
lot of them.  I sure hope they pat themselves hard on the back 
over that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people say “We will never have a life as good as our 
parents'.  Our generation will never be better off than the past 
generation”.  They have no confidence whatsoever that can 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can give them confidence if we start getting our priorities 
straight.  The priorities are all wacky.  The Liberal priorities 
are to make sure they cut lots of transfers to the provinces so 
health care and education will be a real problem.  Boy, the 
provinces have struggled.  I applaud those provinces that managed 
to balance their books a lot sooner than this government did.  I 
applaud them.  They are on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you want to get on the right track, take a look at our 
booklet “Securing Your Future”.  That is the right track.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am on the Standing Committee on Finance.  One of the things we 
heard when we travelled across Canada was that Canadians were 
happy with the balanced budget and that they wanted to see 
sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear an incredible mix from members of the Reform Party.  They 
talk about the kind of tax measures they would like to see 
implemented.  I also hear them talking about concerns for health 
care and education.  My understanding is that it would cost 
around $30 billion to achieve the things they are suggesting and 
that would grow by approximately $4 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could you balance the budget given those kinds of spiralling 
costs?  Are you willing to give up the kind of stability which we 
have offered the Canadian public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  All of the questions and answers should be 
directed through the Speaker, please.  That is so you do not meet 
head on head.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again it goes right 
back to what we said earlier. Government has to get its 
priorities straight.  It has to start considering what is 
actually taking place out there.  Look at reality. Look at what 
we need to do for the people of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding travelling across the country with committees, I have 
seen this happen before.  Travelling committees come to my 
territory in Alberta but guess who they meet with?  Not the 
Canadian people.  Not the average Joe.  They meet with the 
selected crowds, the good old Liberals, the good old party 
supporters, the good old elite. No one in my riding has ever been 
interviewed by any travelling committee because they are just 
plain folks who work hard for their living.  They have to spend a 
few hours a day earning an honest living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem. Priorities. This whole idea of the 
government's wasteful spending being under control.  But don't 
forget, your sexual life is looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member was not referring to 
the Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wanted 
to direct a brief question to the member through you. It deals 
with an item that came up last night on television and I am 
wondering how the Reform Party might respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last several years successive governments in this country 
have eliminated the social portion of Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation.  Last night viewers apparently saw some of the 
results of that in the city of Calgary where there is admittedly 
a very successful economy at the moment. A number of people 
simply cannot afford to rent accommodations there.  The shelters 
are stretched and bursting at the seams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not quite equate the member's answer that this has 
dramatically increased spending. We do not have enough social 
spending in this country on things like that.  I am wondering how 
the paper the member's party has been touting all day deals with 
those kinds of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again, just talk 
about one of the priorities alone.  I believe that we should make 
every effort and take whatever steps are necessary to see that we 
do what we can to help people get into proper homes and shelters. 
If they need it, that is going to happen.  There is no doubt 
about it.  Nobody denies that.  Let us do what we can.  That is a 
priority to me.  Not only that, once we get them into a shelter, 
into a place where they can live, let us help them meet their 
needs the best they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals would stop to analyse it, it might take a little 
time and be a little slow but the best way to do this is to get 
out of their pockets.  Leave money in their pockets.  Do not tax 
more to spend on programs.  Leave it in their pockets.  People 
will look after themselves.  That is the whole point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These socialists do not believe that Canadians are capable of 
looking after themselves.  It is getting very difficult because 
they will not stay out of their pockets and it is time they did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the motion before 
us today.  It is a motion that tries to question this 
government's good judgment and its commitment to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our hon. Reform colleague would have this House believe that the 
government is about to suddenly change course to embark on a 
reckless course of overspending, throwing away in effect all that 
Canadians have worked so hard to achieve.  This is absolutely 
untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A $600 billion debt.  That is what they 
worked so hard to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  I think the member for Medicine Hat is 
speaking through his hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, that is funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  First, when we came to office, we set 
about putting our fiscal house in order.  We did this because we 
knew that it was the essential foundation for lower interest 
rates and higher economic growth.  That means jobs.  That is 
exactly what we have achieved. 
We knew that without a fiscal turnaround we would never be in a 
position to pursue broader tax reduction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his first budget in February 1994, the Minister of Finance 
shared with Canadians this government's vision for the future and 
firmly stated how we would get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance declared that we are pursuing a balanced 
approach to fundamental reform to create jobs, to continue to 
care for those in need and to get the deficit down. We have done 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our sound judgement, our balanced approach and prudent planning 
have secured important gains for Canadians, and it would be the 
furthest thing from the truth to suppose that this government 
would risk all that we have achieved together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look briefly at the achievements. As I said earlier, this 
government realized in 1993 that the key to a prosperous future 
for Canadians was getting Canada's books in order. Our prudent 
and balanced deficit control plan, centred on cutting government 
spending, has met its targets. In fact, we have exceeded them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth repeating the fundamental facts of our stewardship 
because it is our proven ability to keep our promises that should 
reassure Canadians that we will continue to keep them today and 
in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993-94 the federal deficit stood at $42.5 billion, or 
about 6% of our economy. We said that we would bring that down to 
3% of GDP within three years. This is a benchmark that is used in 
Europe and is centred in the Maastricht treaty, and that we would 
not stop until the budget was balanced. We exceeded our own target 
on the timeframe of balancing the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By last year, fiscal 1996-97, the final deficit figure was down 
to $8.9 billion. That is 1.1% of GDP. That is $20 billion lower 
than the previous year for the biggest year over year improvement 
in our history. At $8.9 billion, it is the smallest federal 
deficit in 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we are now internally borrowing the money that we need. 
We are not borrowing internationally.  There no more outside of 
the country credit leak, and it represent a resounding decline 
from some $33 billion since we came to office. I think that is a 
very good record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contributing to this success have been the unprecedented 
spending restraint measures introduced in our budgets. Also 
contributing to our deficit success is the new expenditure 
management system that the government has put in place, a system 
on one hand that affords departments greater flexibility in 
budgeting while on the other hand forces tradeoffs and reins in 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year program spending, that is all government spending 
except interest payments on the debt, fell by more than $7 
billion to just under $105 billion. This means that between 1993 
and 1994 and the last fiscal year, total program spending has 
been reduced by $15.2 billion, and our deficit progress has 
delivered real and rewarding results for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at interest rates. About three years ago 
short term interest rates in Canada were almost 2.5 percentage 
points higher than those in the United States. By last fall, they 
were almost two points lower than what was in the United States. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT89"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT89"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an abstract achievement.  It has meant, for 
instance, that a homeowner taking out or renewing a $100,000 
mortgage for 25 years has saved $3,300 a year.  A consumer, for 
instance, taking out a $10,000 car loan has saved $320 a year. It 
gets better.  Savings on a $25,000 small business loan, the 
engine of our economy in this country, over 10 years would total 
$7,500.  That is a definite advantage for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Figures like that clearly illustrate the real benefits that this 
government's sound judgment and balanced and prudent management 
has secured for Canadians.  That means lower deficits and lower 
interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know interest rates will be affected by many factors such 
as domestic conditions which can change and many global 
influences which are beyond the control of even the largest 
economies. We have seen this very clearly recently as Canada has 
been buffeted by what everybody refers to as the Asian currency 
flu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine what would have happened to this country back in 1991, 
1992 or even 1993 when we were running a $42.5 billion deficit in 
this country with interest rates in double digits.  It would have 
killed us as a country.  However, through prudent management we 
got our country on line and within safe measures before something 
like that happened.  It saved our bacon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because our underlying economic fundamentals are now 
strong, as I have said before, we are in much better shape to 
meet this type of development than we were just a few years ago. 
That is why, despite the fact that our interest rates have 
increased, they are still below U.S. rates.  That clearly shows 
that we have the right economic policies to weather the storm and 
to ensure that continued strong growth and job creation prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job creation is indeed another vital area in which we have made 
significant progress since coming to office.  Between 1989 and 
1993 some members in this House may recall that employment had 
dropped by over 100,000 jobs.  Since this government has come to 
power, employment is up now by 1.1 million jobs.  These are all 
in the private sector. Nearly nine out of ten of these jobs are 
full time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December, for instance, employment increased by 62,000 
jobs, contributing to a total employment growth of 363,000 jobs 
in 1997 as a whole.  At 8.6%, December's unemployment rate, that 
is at the lowest level since September 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very real results of our second sound and balanced judgment 
in these three areas, the deficit, the interest rates and 
employment, are quite clear and, as far as I am concerned, very 
impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more good news.  The real GDP, the measure of economic 
growth, has risen by 4.1% in the third quarter of 1997.  While 
the month to month figures can fluctuate, the growth has 
continued on average in the fourth quarter.  In other words, it 
is an upward march.  As a result, the consensus of the private 
sector forecast is that Canada's economy will continue to expand 
into 1998 and beyond.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the type of evidence that backs up this outlook.  Do not 
take my word here.  Manufacturing shipments remain on an upward 
trend with the average growth for October and November running at 
about 5% and above on the third quarter.  When the hon. member 
for Wild Rose asks about the dollar, that is one of the reasons. 
Because of that dollar our exports are very competitive. 
Merchandise exports increased by 1.5% in November and reached a 
record high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business investments have surged by some 25% over the past year 
and remain at a record high.  Housing starts were up by 16% in 
1997.  Vehicle sales were up by 17.8%.  Since its 6.6% plunge in 
late 1989 and late 1993, real disposable income has stabilized. 
Consumer confidence which declined by 6.9% between 1989 and 1993 
has surged by 18% over the past year alone as the recovery has 
fully taken hold in the domestic economy.  Consumer confidence 
has reached its highest level in eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all very significant achievements but the real issue 
is what lies ahead.  That is what we are talking about here 
today.  According to the member for Medicine Hat what lies ahead 
is a 180 degree  about face.  He wants Canadians to believe that 
what lies ahead is a government prepared to abandon a course of 
balanced and sound prudent management that has brought Canadians 
the rewards that I have just described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants Canadians to believe the government that is about to 
take this nation to a balanced budget in 1998-1999 is also a 
government that will take this nation back into the dark ages of 
overspending and deficit financing.  That is absolutely wrong. 
This will not happen.  We are not the party that changes its 
economic principles and political focus just for the sake of 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 election I was the only one who stood at an all 
candidates debate and said if you want a tax cut vote for those 
guys, do not vote for me, and I am back.  As the prime minister 
has said, we will never again allow the financial health of our 
country to get out of control.   As the finance minister declared 
last October, responsible financial management is not a fad or a 
phase.  It is a permanent feature of a successful society.  These 
statements are the statements of the government that is going to 
take this nation into the next millennium financially healthy and 
strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I see five members rising but we have about 
30 seconds.  I do not think I could even get one of you in in 30 
seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 5.30 p.m., it is my duty to inform the House that

<A NAME="LINK248">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 19, 1997, consideration of the 
motion and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in this House in support of my colleague's motion 
requesting that the government review the level at which the 
child tax benefit is currently indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Shefford for bringing 
such an important issue to this House.  Campaign 2000 recently 
released its 1997 figures on child poverty and the figures are 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 500,000 more children living in poverty today than in 
1989, the same year that Parliament unanimously passed a 
resolution to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty among 
Canadian children by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One poor child is just one too many.  What can we say about the 
1.5 million currently living in poverty in this country?  The 
figures tabulated by Campaign 2000 clearly indicate that the 
problem is increasingly alarming and must be attended to 
immediately.  The situation demands that the government examine 
the child tax benefit and adjust it to better assist the children 
and families with incomes that fall under the low income cut off 
level, better known as the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is more than just a lack of money.  It affects a child's 
health, education, welfare and general well-being.  On this I 
want to tell this House today that when I was mayor of Saint John 
I sat on the board of the Rotary Club for the Rotary boys and 
girls club.  When we were having a breakfast meeting one day we 
heard a noise outside.  I went out.  Here was a little boy going 
through the garbage barrel.  I said “What are you doing?”  He 
said “I'm hungry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I picked him up.  I brought him in.  We found out that there 
were a number of children attending an elementary school nearby 
the Rotary boys and girls club who went to school on a Monday 
morning with nothing to eat.  We started a breakfast for them and 
we had over 50 little children from that elementary school who 
came and we fed them their breakfast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also tell the House this.  The Rotary boys and girls club 
every year would honour one of their very special people, someone 
they thought so much of they would make a little crown for them. 
Do you know who they gave the crown to, Mr. Speaker?   It was a 
senior citizen who came and cooked for those children.   She 
became their nanny and they loved her so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You see, it is so important.  It was affecting, according to the 
teachers, their level of learning because they were hungry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian School Boards Association believes “The 
relationship between child poverty and its adverse affect upon 
children's readiness to learn and their ultimate success in 
school is well established”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the connections between child poverty and youth 
unemployment are tremendous. Our teenagers are our future:  our 
teachers, our doctors, our plumbers, our electricians and 
prospective parents. If we are not able to break the poverty 
cycle in which they live today, it surely will be passed on to 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When poor children become adults they are less likely to find 
well paying jobs.  Why?  Because the children living in poverty 
do not have good health.  They have a difficult time to learn. 
They are likely to miss school and are more likely to fall behind 
in high school as well.  When all hopes and dreams vanish, they 
are more likely to drop out before graduating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For governments this situation translates into higher hospital 
and education costs and more spending on social assistance 
programs.  It also represents less tax revenue to Canada.  At the 
end of the day we all pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that children are poor because their parents 
are poor.  These parents need secure and better paying jobs to 
allow them to meet their financial obligations and to provide 
their families with safe and adequate housing, to provide meals, 
warm clothing and an overall healthy environment conducive to 
their development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a little bit of money at the end of the month may also 
mean that children will no longer miss birthday parties, school 
trips, or get involved with sports.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have just painted for you the sad picture of 
child poverty.  Now let me tell you what we can do to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving the level at which the child tax benefit is indexed 
could go a long way against the devastating effects of child 
poverty.  This assistance program is not a luxury but a necessity 
for many Canadian families.  Sadly, the benefit's value keeps 
decreasing every year due to inflation and, although the 
inflation rate has remained below 3% in recent years, it has 
fluctuated enough to affect poor and low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food, as I have stated, clothes and rent cost more.  Back east 
they cost much more because the HST is applied to little 
children's clothing.  These things cost more, but these families 
do not get more money to pay for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To survive parents must make choices.  They must make difficult 
choices.  I must admit that some make the wrong choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to vote in favour of my 
colleague's motion.  Both she and I realize that simply 
increasing payments will not solve the problem.  Unfortunately, 
the issue of poverty is too serious and complex to be disposed of 
so easily.  We must seize the opportunity and make use of the 
tools which are available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote another member of this House who said “Poverty 
is the enemy of a good start”.  That was said by the current 
prime minister, and he was indeed right.  I encourage all members 
of this House, especially members on the government side, to 
support the motion of my colleague from Shefford.  Let us give 
our children a good start.  When the prime minister said 
“Poverty is the enemy of a good start”, yes, he was right.  I 
agree with him.  I am hoping that everyone in this House does. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in the House today to speak against Private Member's 
Motion No. 198 regarding the indexation of the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge and am proud that this government is now on sound 
economic footing.  This stability has been attained through 
reworking government priorities and maintaining good fiscal 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the pre-budget hearings in the fall it was brought to 
the attention of the Standing Committee on Finance that this good 
news was achieved at a cost; a social cost in some cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion calls for a review of the level at which the child 
tax benefit is indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it the motion sounds plausible.  However, there 
are some compelling reasons why, after giving it thought, it 
cannot go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, income tax has been and will continue to be reviewed to 
make strategic adjustments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is a trigger.  The Income Tax Act states that the 
child tax benefit will be indexed each year by the amount which 
the annual change in the consumer price index exceeds 3%.  This 
policy of partial indexation is consistent with the treatment of 
most other parameters of the personal tax system and is 
respectful of the fiscal problems which are facing the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is the option available in the Income Tax Act, as 
it now stands, to allow discretionary adjustments to the child 
tax benefit as needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this government is committed to listening to the 
people's request to make strategic investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I would have to ask the question:  Why, when 
this government has shown commitments to low and middle income 
families and to combating child poverty, would the member 
opposite suggest a review?  I can only assume that the change the 
member is calling for is for that of full indexation of the child 
tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current policy of partial indexation in the tax system 
applies to the basic personal credit, spousal credit, tax bracket 
and others.  For this reason it would be difficult to go to full 
indexing for some parameters and not for others.  As the member 
opposite mentioned, there are not poor children, but poor 
families, and I believe this needs to be looked at in a holistic 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The full indexation of the child tax benefit in other parameters 
would mean a cost of about $850 million per year.  On a 
cumulative scale, this would mean $1.7 billion a year, and so on. 
The full indexation of the child tax benefit alone would mean, 
with the inflation rate of 1.6% per year, a cost of about $160 
million a year, and would keep building.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of yearly commitment is not one which would be 
withdrawn once it was made.  This commitment would threaten the 
government's program to restore and maintain fiscal balance and 
would therefore not be prudent at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has stated that it will review its policy of 
partial indexation once its fiscal position makes it appropriate. 
In the meantime, government policy has been strategic and 
targeted to assistance in priority areas, like families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government has maintained its position on partial 
indexing, it has made related adjustments to address the needs of 
low and middle income families.  This government has made and 
will make improvements to the child tax benefit.  This includes 
an increase of $850 million in assistance provided to low income 
families through child tax benefit implemented over the past two 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have promised a further enrichment of child benefits of the 
same magnitude during this current mandate.  This is just one of 
many initiatives that this government has made.  These actions 
demonstrate that assistance to families, particularly aimed at 
low and modest income levels, is and will continue to be a 
priority for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the prebudget hearings we heard from Canadians. 
Canadians are looking to this government for leadership.  They 
are relying on the delivery of policies that are sustainable and 
funding that will endure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians asked for strategic reinvestment in programs.  The 
government is answering this request slowly and carefully.  Have 
we done enough?  No, not yet.  Can we do more?  Yes, we can and 
we will.  However, this government cannot and will not put 
Canadians at the risk of bankruptcy as past governments have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion deals with exactly the type of uncalculated economic 
commitment which made this government's corrective fiscal actions 
a necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although child poverty is on the mind of almost every member in 
this House, regardless of party, this is not the step to take and 
I believe this is not the time to take it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion.  I believe it 
is important for us to understand what this motion is attempting 
to do so we can speak to it intelligently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the child tax benefit that has been in place since 1984 
has had a regime which requires a 3% adjustment for inflation on 
an annual basis.  If we do not have that 3% increase in 
inflation, there is no adjustment to the child tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have noticed with that is that there is a double whammy 
here actually for Canadians.  First, if someone's income goes up 
at about the rate of inflation, 1% or 2%, they are now in a 
higher dollar bracket with no real additional spending power. 
Therefore, their child tax benefit is actually reduced.  Over and 
above that, the child tax benefit is also not indexed with 
inflation and therefore the buying power of it is also lower each 
year.  Because we do not adjust this unless the inflation rate is 
over 3%, there has been a slippage over the last 12 years in the 
value to Canadian families of the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member opposite alluded to, the real buying power loss of 
those Canadian families who have participated in this over that 
12 year period is about a $900 million shortfall in the benefits 
that are paid out under this program when it is adjusted for 
inflation.  If it had kept in step with inflation, there would be 
$900 million more available for Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that we cannot afford to do this because we have 
to balance the budget.  It is interesting that we would 
prioritize drawing these funds on the backs of Canadian families 
to balance the budget.  I am suggesting there is probably quite a 
few other lower priorities that should be looked at first.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key point is that there is a continual ratcheting down 
effect so that the benefit to Canadian families continues to 
drop.  The winner is the federal government in that the program 
to which it has been committed is there for Canadian families and 
continues to cost it less and less even though its tax revenues 
continue to increase.  It is one small example of the beginnings 
of many incremental pressures on the backs of Canadian families 
for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the outcome of the incremental ratcheting effect of 
the pressures on Canadian families.  It is interesting to 
note—and some members in the previous debate made reference to 
it—that the average Canadian family has suffered a $3,000 drop 
in real income since the current government took office in 1993. 
It is this subtle, tax by stealth approach that has eroded the 
real income of Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1996 Statistics Canada said that the average 
Canadian family spent $21,000 on a combined tax bill and only 
$17,000 on food, clothing and shelter.  It is time to stop the 
kind of thinking which says let us take a dollar from a Canadian 
and give it to the government.  Then the bureaucracy and the 
overhead involved in it take a portion of the dollar and some 
fraction of the dollar in benefit is given back to Canadians. Our 
approach in this party is that it is best to leave the full 
dollar in the pockets of the Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many comments made about some of the 
government's programs and the rhetoric surrounding the concern 
for children.  I was glad the member who just spoke acknowledged 
that it was not children in poverty but the family.  The best way 
to care for the children is within the family.  I appreciate that 
comment and I concur with it.  We must make sure our policies are 
not blind to the fact that children are dependants within.  They 
are not entities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of the family cannot be understated.  The mothers and 
fathers are raising our next generation, our future Canadians. 
They are the ones who teach them right from wrong.  They are the 
ones who pass on our culture.  Within a family we learn the 
subtleties of human relationships and personal sacrifice and how 
to get along with one another.  It is a critical institution.  It 
is the foundation of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the United Nations General Assembly which said some 
years back that the family was a natural and fundamental unit of 
society and was entitled to protection by society and the state. 
The World Congress of Families in Prague last year said that the 
family was the first social unit and that it held primacy over 
all man-made communities, economic entities and governments.  It 
also said that policies which undermined the family eroded the 
bedrock of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of special interest groups and people 
clamouring for more rights.  This is going on while the mom, the 
dad and the kids are under attack.  I liken it to having a nice 
home.  The top floor is being renovated.  A crew is fixing things 
and changing wallpaper.  This is the people clamouring for more 
rights, the special interest group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately some of the policies in our current government has 
a demolition crew working on the foundation.  All the effort to 
try to renovate the house on the top floor is for not when the 
foundation is being torn apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best examples I can use to illustrate this point is 
the fact that we have a discriminatory policy surrounding 
children and child care.  We have had it for a number of years. 
We do not like to talk about discrimination in Canada.  We think 
we are above that.  Yet we have tolerated it for years when it 
comes to Canadian families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents who wish to care for their children at home are given a 
subtle message by the government.  There is no value in their 
doing that, but if they wish to have someone care for their child 
outside the home they will receive a full tax benefit.  Or, if a 
third party cares for their children there is tax treatment for 
that.  There is absolutely none for the parents who wish to care 
for their children at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not even a money issue to me although that is part of it. 
It is the subtle message to these parents, to these mothers or 
fathers who care for their children at home, that there is no 
value in what they are doing.  It is absolutely the wrong message 
to be sending to Canadian families who are working so hard to 
raise our next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Reform Party has long been calling for a child 
care deduction for all parents including those parents who care 
for their children at home.  They should not be excluded so that 
the parent could make the choice.  A number of studies have been 
conducted.  One study done in Ontario quotes the fact that most 
parents believe that the best way to raise and care for children 
is with a parent at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind I bring forward other proposals Reform is 
encouraging the government to adopt in its upcoming budget.  The 
government should consider a spousal deduction that would enable 
families to better support one of the spouses at home.  It should 
begin a plan that would see any surplus applied to reducing the 
debt and reducing taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very confident in our numbers.  If the government were to 
follow our plan, by the year 2001 the average family of four in 
Canada could have $2,000 in its pocket which it otherwise would 
have had to pay in the form of tax bills to the government.  That 
would be $2,000 in the pockets of Canadian families to take away 
some of the pressure they are under.  We would encourage that 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other proposals.  One is to take low income families 
right off the tax roll altogether.  There is no sense in taking 
money from someone who is at a low income level and then trying 
to give them money back because government overhead takes much of 
that money away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is a tiny step in the right direction because it has 
compassion for families and children.  We are not saying that it 
is our whole program or that it is even part of our program, but 
it is a step in the right direction that recognizes the 
importance of families and some of the inequities they have been 
dealt by the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a doubt the Canadian family is part of the foundation of 
society.  It is the commitment of the Reform Party to do 
everything possible in the days and years ahead in every act and 
bill we bring forward to strengthen and encourage the Canadian 
family in every way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
motion before us recommends that the federal government review 
the level at which the child benefit is indexed.  I believe this 
is a laudable goal.  The Government of Canada fully supports the 
broader goal of increasing assistance to families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government initiated a national system to prevent and reduce 
child poverty more effectively than ever before when it 
introduced the national child benefit system in the 1997 budget, 
scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1998.  The system has been 
designed to co-ordinate child poverty programs across Canada and 
to provide additional assistance to low income families working 
to provide for their children. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT96"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT96"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1755

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While programs have existed to assist low income families, the 
system has created disincentives and barriers to working.  In the 
past when parents chose to leave social assistance and join the 
job market they lost badly needed social services such as health, 
dental and prescription drug plans.  This clearly is a 
disincentive and is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit system is an enriched and improved 
federal child benefit which will complement 
provincial-territorial programs to provide more effective 
assistance for low income families.  These services will be made 
available to all low income families, the working poor and those 
on social assistance.  I applaud the objectives of the national 
child benefit system to prevent and reduce child poverty, to 
improve work incentives and to simplify administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have clearly recognized there is a significant 
problem in terms of child poverty.  It has increased about 50% 
since 1989.  The motion before us asks for a feasibility study on 
indexing child tax benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that the potential fiscal costs of such a 
measure cannot be supported at this time.  The financial impact 
of the proposal with the current inflation rate of approximately 
1.6% per annum would cost the federal government about $160 
million per year of indexation, that is $160 million in the first 
fiscal year, $320 million in the second and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit allows for partial indexation to help 
address the severe fiscal problems facing Canada.  The policy 
applies broadly in the tax system to spousal credit, basic 
personal credit, tax brackets, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be difficult to apply full indexing to some tax 
parameters and not to others.  It is estimated that the cost 
would be about $850 million per year.  This would have a major 
impact on the government's ability to restore fiscal balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, however, has made a commitment to review the 
policy of partial indexation once it in a fiscal position to do 
so.  In the meantime, the government has made it clear that it is 
targeting additional assistance in priority areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister stated in June 1997 that the government will 
double spending aimed at reducing child poverty once the 
government gets it fiscal house in order.  He stated “We would 
like to double the funding when we have the means”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget created a child tax benefit at a cost of $850 
million.  Since July 1997, over 720,000 low income working 
families have received increased benefits as a result 
restructuring and enrichment of the working income supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maximum benefits increased from $500 per family to $605 for the 
first child, $450 for the second child and $350 for each 
additional child.  For the lowest income families the increases 
in the child tax benefit represent a 50% increase in federal 
benefits.  Starting July 1998 these benefits will be extended to 
all low income families as a result of the national child benefit 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is assuming a larger role in providing 
basic income support to families which children.  We are moving 
in the right direction.  We are assuming our responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in a society that is compassionate and cares for the 
less fortunate.  It is interesting to note that Campaign 2000, a 
non-government anti-poverty organization, has abandoned its goal 
for the elimination of child poverty by the end of the century. 
It is taking up the need for sound fiscal management and 
furthering the interests of children.  In November 1997 it stated 
that the social policy community in Canada had a high stake in 
becoming public interest guardians of the fiscal stability of 
federal finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Campaign 2000 commended the government for being particularly 
articulate and passionate in its concerns for children.  It went 
on to say that strong fiscal stabilizers are an essential part of 
a sustainable social investment strategy for children and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has demonstrated that it is committed to this 
important issue.  Ken Battle of the Canadian Institute of Social 
Policy stated in February 1997 that a national child benefit 
system has the potential to be the most important social policy 
innovation since medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Globe and Mail</I> stated in May 1997 that in difficult 
times it made sense to focus government generosity on those who 
most need it.  The proposed child benefit is a good way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the government recognized the plight of those families that 
need support.  The government has chosen to act, to demonstrate 
its commitment that this is a priority.  A full review of the 
policy of partial indexation will take place once it is fiscally 
appropriate to do so. 
This is a commitment. This is our promise to the Canadian people. 
For those reasons, I cannot support the motion before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak in the debate on the motion of the 
member for Shefford on the indexing of the child benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to congratulate the member for Shefford on 
her fine initiative.  Clearly we must reduce child poverty now in 
any way we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by saying that the Bloc will obviously be 
supporting this motion.  Better yet, however, to ensure greater 
effectiveness, my colleague for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques proposed an 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking here of a relatively recent benefit, which 
dates from 1993.  Before then, the main federal tax measures for 
children were the family allowance, the child tax credit and the 
dependent child credit.  Under the Conservatives, the child tax 
benefit replaced these other measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefit is intended primarily to increase the income of 
less fortunate families and is therefore tied to family income.  At 
this point in time, the federal government no longer universally 
recognizes children.   Family policy and the fight against poverty 
are intertwined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather surprising to see today that roles have changed. 
At the time, the Liberal Party was sharply opposed to selective 
measures. 
In 1992, the Liberal member for Davenport stated in the House that 
universality is the work of the Liberal party, and something we 
still cherish today, as it is the best method.  Might the Liberal 
party have had a change of heart, perhaps? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current deputy prime minister also criticized this 
measure, and I quote his words: “In fact, a family with a $40,000 
annual income will only receive $44 more each year. Within three 
years, this benefit will be reduced by 10% and, in ten years, most 
families will no longer be receiving any assistance because this 
benefit is not indexed for inflation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, might the Liberal party have had a change of 
heart, perhaps? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to objecting to this benefit because it abandoned 
the principle of universality and merely gave the illusion of 
devoting more money to children, the Liberals were opposed to it 
because the benefits were not indexed. 
The Conservative party appears to recognize some of the 
shortcomings of the child benefit by proposing to re-examine its 
level of indexing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After several years of low inflation rates, the harmful 
effects of this measure are making themselves felt.  Benefits are 
not increasing, but consumer prices are.  In case the Liberals are 
not aware of this, in 1977 everything costs more than it did in 
1993, whether it be housing, clothing or food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While an attempt is now being made to make the necessary 
corrections in order to improve the child tax benefit, as was 
called for in part by the Liberals when they were in opposition, 
now they are the ones opposing it.  I would remind the House that 
they are the only party in the House opposed to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the opposition parties are unanimous on at least one point: 
this benefit should be indexed, for the sake of the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that I do not quite follow the logic of the Liberal 
Party. Why does this party, which claims to be concerned about the 
well-being of children, object to this motion? In its action plan and its 
speech from the Throne as well, it maintains that it is important to 
invest in children and in the fight against poverty. Fine promises and 
rhetoric are not enough. We want to see concrete action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard time and time again in this House, children are 
poor because their parents are poor. Talk is cheap. Actions speak louder 
than words. With its 1.5 million children living in poverty, Canada 
ranks second among industrialized countries for the number of children 
living in poverty. It that the Canada the Liberals want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as we in the Bloc are concerned, this is clearly not the 
kind of system we want, let alone the kind of leaders we want for our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am shocked to see that the Liberals are trying to make political 
hay at the expense of children when that serves their purposes and will 
not support a sensible motion to take positive steps. The well-being of 
children goes beyond partisanship.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are there: since 1992, inflation has never been 
higher than 3%.  What this means is that the value of the child tax 
benefit has been eroded by almost $850 million.  But what does this 
$850 million really mean for the 1.5 million poor children in 
Canada.  I am going to tell the House.  It means that hundreds of 
thousands of children across Canada and Quebec go to school on an 
empty stomach, that they lack the concentration to really focus on 
what they are learning, and that they will fall ill more often than 
other children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because inflation is under 3% that there is no price 
fluctuation? 
If you ask poor children to tell you what price fluctuation means, 
it is true they will not be able to tell you in so many words, not 
just because they have missed several days of school through 
illness, but because the concept is much too abstract for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask them, however, what rising prices mean.  Now they will be 
able to tell you that that means their parents have trouble buying 
enough food for the whole family, that they have trouble buying the 
school supplies and clothing they need.  In short, it means that 
Mom and Dad do not have enough money to provide for them. 
Ask these children to tell you about their daily reality. Then you will 
not say to me, as did the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Finance, that it is impossible to index the child tax benefit, because 
it would cost the Canadian government too much, particularly when that 
same government has a budget surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 Liberal Plan, a fairly recent document, says on page 58: 
“Research has proven consistently that investing in early support for 
families and children at risk yields real results.—By helping young 
children get off to a good start and preventing problems before they 
occur, these programs significantly decrease the need for far greater 
spending in future”. This is not from me. It is taken from the Liberals' 
action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to remind you that the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques tabled an 
amendment, to make the motion even better. The amendment seeks to delete 
all of the words after the word “review” and substitute the following: 
“the possibility of fully indexing the child benefit”, which gives the 
following motion: “That, in the opinion of the House, the government 
should review the possibility of fully indexing the child 
benefit”. The 
purpose of this amendment is merely to reinforce the motion, not to 
change its meaning. I therefore urge hon. members to support the 
amendment and, of course, the motion as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague, the hon. member for Shefford, has presented a motion 
concerning a review of the level at which the national child 
benefit is indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the human resources development critic for the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada, I feel duty bound to defend children 
and the quality of life to which they have a right to aspire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recall briefly that the question of child poverty has 
been raised on a number of occasions in recent years.  I was not an 
MP at the time, but I do recall this Parliament being unanimous in 
resolving the problem in 1989.  There was a projection that child 
poverty would be eradicated by the year 2000.  In 1989, one child 
in eight was considered poor.  Now the figure is one in four. In 
some regions, this proportion might be one in three, and in others 
perhaps a bit higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the principle is a simple one.  Today we are working to 
get an economy working that will redistribute benefits to strata of 
society where people are less active in the work force, whether the 
young, the old, the sick, or those forced into inactivity by the 
economic context.  If we do not focus on our children and provide 
them with a good quality of life, adequate health care and quality 
education, we will pay for it later.  We will end up paying for not 
having invested in our most important resource, people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, families have the prime responsibility for 
raising their children.  They must look after their development. 
They are our front line workers.  However, as a government, we must 
give them support.  We also share in the responsibility.  Many of 
us are involved in looking after society's greatest investment, its 
children.  Parents, federal, provincial and territorial governments 
and community and private agencies must join together to help those 
who come after us achieve their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not tell you that the experiences of our young people 
will shape their behaviour later on, that the living conditions we 
provide for them today will affect their future health and well-being 
and that their ability to learn and adapt is closely linked 
to the environment in which they grow up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another conclusion, which my colleague mentioned, seems 
relevant.  If children are poor, it is because their parents are. 
Naturally, the best solution would be job creation.  This would be 
the best way to eliminate child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not fall into a partisan speech on the merits of the 
Conservative approach to job creation, of reducing taxes and 
employment insurance premiums.  Although no one has a monopoly on 
truth, I do know that we are proposing the most realistic way to 
put hope back into the hearts of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us admit that these issues are closely linked, that it is 
difficult not to deal with all of them at the same time.  There are 
poor children because there are parents who do not work, or who 
work in bad conditions.  And bad working conditions stem from 
another problem I have not mentioned: education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in our children also depends very much on the 
framework in which they are given the chance to develop their 
skills.  With everything moving ahead so rapidly nowadays, how can 
investing in education not be regarded as a priority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the technological evolution of the last 30 years is any 
indication of the next 30, investing in education is no longer a 
priority, but an obligation.  If I mention education or employment 
when talking about child poverty, it is only because there is not 
just one solution to a problem such as poverty.  A series of 
solutions implemented simultaneously might help. 
Taken singly, each solution would not solve the problem, but each 
has its importance and the whole would not work as well if one were 
missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one solution that would play an important role in the 
national benefit reform that has been announced.  It is the only 
cash benefit that will be left once the federal program is 
inaugurated, hence its significance.  Under the new distribution of 
government responsibilities, the central government's role would be 
to deliver the cheques.  This money will constitute the only money 
coming in every month for many families, and in some cases would 
mean the difference between falling below the poverty line and 
managing to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these benefits are only partially indexed, a 
policy that was set at a time of rampant inflation.  Inflation is 
nibbling away at the benefits of people for whom every dollar 
counts. 
Now that inflation is stable, it is our duty as legislators to 
tailor the legislation to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, I support the motion of my colleague for a 
review of the level at which the child benefit is indexed.  I 
encourage all members of this House to do so as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
delight to stand up in the House of Commons, Canada's Parliament, 
and speak on behalf of families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw to the attention of the House and any 
Canadians who happen to be listening that the Reform Party 
believes very strongly in protecting families and in protecting 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a motion on the floor today to address the issue of 
family and child poverty.  We of course are adamant in saying 
that children are probably universally poor.  I know children of 
parents who are very well off but the children themselves do not 
have money.  These children are poor because they are dependent 
on their parents.  I think it would be certainly true that every 
child in Canada who is poor is poor because they are members of a 
poor family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons for this poverty and there are a 
number of different ways in which that poverty is measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading the other day that different countries use 
different measures of poverty.  In some countries a family is 
considered poor if it simply cannot afford 100% of the costs of 
basic food, clothing and shelter.  In other words, everyone in 
the country should be entitled to those basic necessities.  On 
the other hand in Canada we use varying definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One that is often used is that families are poor if their family 
income is less than half of the median income, and so this 
provides a movable measure of poverty.  Sometimes this is valid. 
Indeed we all know of families that are poor.  We all know of 
children who are poor.  We have encountered them.  We have 
encountered families that have a great deal of difficulty and 
sometimes find it impossible for a number of different reasons to 
meet the basic necessities of their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we have also of course this flexible measurement because of 
the percentage it is based on so that in some cases one could 
really say that there are many people who are living on a very 
small amount of income but they do so very efficiently.  By the 
measure of our normal standards of poverty they may classify as 
being in a poor home but as a matter of fact they are able to 
meet all their needs. They are comfortable, they are warm, they 
are fed and, most important, they are loved. Those children would 
not be classified as poor in the usual sense but they might by 
the statistical definition that they live in a family where the 
family income is less than half of the median income in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether I should be so bold as to say that I grew 
in what by today's standards would be called a poor family.  We 
were talking about it the other day.  We were talking about the 
great hardship that many families encountered because suddenly 
they had no electricity.  I was telling a friend of mine that as 
best as I recall I was around 10 when we first got electricity. 
Of course the big difference between now and then was that at 
that time we did not have it, so therefore we made other 
arrangements for heating our home and for providing light.  Those 
other arrangements were always in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I was really genuinely in a poor family.  My dad started 
farming in 1935 in Saskatchewan.  I do not know if members heard 
about the big depression out in the prairies but things were very 
bleak.  My family started farming and for several years did not 
get a crop. We raised a few chickens and a few animals and we 
were able to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We never thought of ourselves as poor.  There was a strong 
relationship not only within our immediate family but also among 
the neighbours.  We all shared.  We looked after each other. When 
I was a youngster we used to pile into the car, visit different 
neighbours and sometimes different relatives.  We did not have a 
refrigerator so we took turns slaughtering animals for meat.  One 
day it was this person's young heifer or a steer that got chopped 
up.  We would all divide it up and 10 families would go away with 
meat for a week.  The next week it went to another place and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By today's standards we were living in total abject poverty. Yet 
we never thought of ourselves as poor.  We were happy, we were 
loved, our parents got along well with each other and with 
everybody else.  We enjoyed firm and loving discipline in our 
families and we never thought of ourselves as poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother told me one of my favourite toys was a lid from a 
syrup pail.  I used drive around the House with that thing and 
push on it.  That would be my horn, beep, beep.  That is how we 
played.  Those were our toys. I am very proud to announce that 
after I left home my father finally got on his financial feet. 
There may have been a correlation there.  My parents are now in 
their mid eighties and doing very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to keep the idea of poverty in perspective.  I really 
believe we need to help those who have genuine needs.  We know 
they are there.  However, I greatly resent that we are taxed so 
much in this country that we find our governments are taking away 
from us the joy of sharing.  We no longer have enough disposable 
income that we can go to a person and say I see you are in need, 
let me help you get on your feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my favourite stories is of one of the most exciting 
events in my life.  A number of us got together to buy not a new 
bed for their child but a new house.  This guy came to me and 
said our rent is more than what I would have to pay per month if 
I could get into this low cost housing, but I cannot raise the 
down payment.  I went away and thought that was a young couple we 
should be able to help.  I got together with a bunch of my 
friends.  None of us were very well off.  I gave them the option 
of either giving an interest free loan or an outright gift. There 
were about 25 of us.  We all kicked in anything from $100 to 
$1,000.  We had the down payment for a house for this young 
couple.  They eventually paid us back and they had their own 
house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was no government program but how many people can now 
afford to do that when the governments are spending half of our 
income for us?  If they could only let us keep more of our income 
and cut the taxation then we could have families together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that one of the greatest stresses 
in families is money.  I also believe that one of the most 
important things for the security of children is to be in a 
secure home in which the marriage is strong.  I am going to make 
that connection.  If we can reduce the financial pressures on 
families, on couples, so there is less stress on the marriage, 
then the families will remain strong and our children will be 
wonderfully looked after by loving parents who care for them and 
who can provide for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to learn, as has been the topic all day today, that 
governments of all levels need to take as little as possible out 
of the pockets of the wage earners so they can have the pride and 
the dignity of providing for their own families.  Enough of this 
crazy concept of taxing every family so heavily that both parents 
have to work, get two incomes and give half of their total income 
in taxes.  Basically the income of one of the parents goes to pay 
taxes. 
Talk about shovelling wheat into the truck while the end-gate is 
open.  It does not make any sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we need to address the question of child poverty by 
addressing the question of family poverty.  If we can address 
that and particularly make the contribution of reduced taxation 
to give these families financial independence, I think we will be 
on the way to solving the problem of child poverty because we 
have solved the problem of family poverty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity 
to speak today to this private member's motion which recommends 
that the government review the level at which the child tax 
benefit is indexed.  In particular, I want to respond in the 
short time that is remaining in this debate, five minutes or so, 
directly to the hon. member's claims that were just made in this 
House moments ago.  He points across our hall here in the House 
of Commons to say this government has to be doing something in 
order to help the family, in order to help child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that in just the last two budgets the 
federal government increased by $850 million the assistance 
provided to low income families through the child tax benefit, 
$850 million.  It is a commitment that this government sees 
toward families, toward families in poverty, toward children in 
poverty, even though we are attempting to do exactly what the 
Reform Party wants this government to do, to take hold of our 
financial responsibilities in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else did we do?  Since July 1997, over 720,000 low income 
working families have received increased benefits as a result of 
the restructuring and enrichment of the working income 
supplement.  What does that mean in practical terms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maximum benefits increased from $500 per family to $605 for the 
first child, $405 for the second child and $330 for each 
additional child.  That is a commitment by the federal government 
toward child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next July these benefits will be extended to all low income 
families as a result of the establishment of the national child 
benefit system.  It is a joint federal/provincial initiative. The 
national child benefit has three objectives.  We are trying to 
prevent and reduce child poverty, improve work incentives and 
simplify administration, three solid goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the national child benefit system the federal government 
will assume a larger role in providing basic income support to 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For their part, the provinces and territories will be making 
corresponding reductions to the child component of their social 
assistance payments and reinvest all the savings in complementary 
programs and other benefits and services for low income families. 
Again, that is a commitment by the federal government of Canada 
toward child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the lowest income families, the increases in the child tax 
benefit represent a 50 per cent increase in federal benefits. The 
federal government has promised a further enrichment of child 
benefits of the same magnitude during this mandate.  We have 
promised that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite understands that.  He has heard us say 
this time and time again.  Selective memory, I suppose.  You 
know, when in opposition, we oppose.  No matter how good those 
government programs are, no matter how fiscally responsible the 
government opposite is, we have to piecemeal and pick out any 
opportunity we can to justify ourselves as an opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know why I can say that?  Because I sat over there from 
1988 to 1993.  I understand the mentality of opposition.  But 
there were times, even when I sat over there, that I applauded 
the federal government for initiatives it took between 1988 and 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most certainly there were not many of them.  When you recognize 
that the federal government is doing a job for the people of 
Canada, especially when we are talking about low income and 
children in poverty, this government has been very successful to 
date for children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
on October 6, 1997 I asked the Minister of Environment about 
additional cuts to her department's mandate and staff.  These 
cuts will affect up to 200 positions on top of the 1400 positions 
cut from the previous Liberal budgets.  There was an apparent 
shortfall of $8 million to $10 million to meet the finance 
minister's deficit quota. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire planet has realized that there are problems in our 
atmosphere yet the environment minister will be cutting the 
atmospheric environment program, a program that includes 
internationally recognized research, science and development.  As 
a nation we are beginning a journey to reduce our greenhouse gas 
emissions to meet international obligations from Kyoto and to 
take steps to protect the atmosphere for our children and their 
children.  How can the minister justify further cuts to the 
department that is so vital to understanding our atmosphere and 
climate change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the Yukon described last fall, the weather 
for the Arctic will be forecast and broadcast from southern 
British Columbia.  Will it take the loss of lives caught in a 
freak winter storm to bring the minister to her senses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Churchill River air services are a key component 
of our northern lives.  We now rely on weather reports from as 
far away as Winnipeg.  When will the cuts to weather services be 
stopped?  Enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Environmental Protection Branch is also slated for further 
cuts.  This is the very department which monitors most of the 
worst polluters in this country.  It is responsible for waste 
management and risk management in the mining, chemical, pulp and 
paper sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all companies are polluters, but to expect Canadians to 
believe this Liberal government and to tolerate the cuts to the 
very department which protects communities from the bad apples is 
asking a bit too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voluntary, voluntary is what Canadians are told by the Liberal 
government as the best way for industry to monitor and police 
itself.  Who is the Liberal government trying to protect? Is it 
the industry and its lobbyists or the health, safety and 
environment of all Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decline in environmental services is felt right across this 
fine country.  The big problem is not just the federal 
environment cuts.  One must consider the added insult that many 
Canadians share.  The provinces have been meeting deficit quotas 
as well and the environment departments are often the first to be 
sliced and diced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario has cut over 40% of its environment ministry since 1995. 
Staff levels have been reduced by 36%.  Who is protecting the 
environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Plastimet story reminded every Canadian that accidents can 
happen.  The health and safety of Canadians is being compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Churchill River we experienced severe flooding 
last summer.  Communities were not warned, properties were 
damaged and many lives were disrupted. I discovered that 
Environment Canada does not monitor rivers or possible flooding 
in my riding.  It has been passed off to the province or to the 
private sector, or even partnered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to keep track.  There are so many different names but 
the story is the same.  Cut, cut, cut.  The deficit quotas must 
stop.  With the deficit battle met and a balanced budget close at 
hand, will the minister stop the cuts and invest $8 million to 
$10 million in our children's sustainable future?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
make note of the contribution that the hon. member from the 
opposition has made in his hard work as a new member on the 
environment committee.  The House should also be aware that the 
member was a member of the Canadian delegation that went to Kyoto 
to discuss the very urgent issue of climate change.  We are all 
aware of his very important and continued contributions to this 
House on the ecological agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the minister I would like to take the opportunity 
to clarify several points regarding Environment Canada's program 
review.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was reported in the fall that this government had mandated 
new cuts to Environment Canada.  That is not true.  What is true 
is that Environment Canada announced to staff early last 
September that the department had to adjust its strategies for 
dealing with the 1996 budget reductions that will take effect on 
April 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 budget reductions are the result of program review two. 
The department's budget is reduced by 3.5% or $17.2 million. 
Originally the department felt that about 70% of the reduction 
could be met through increased cost recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While cost recovery revenues have been increasing, it is now 
clear that they will be insufficient to deal with the budget 
reduction in 1998-99.  So the department is having to eliminate 
approximately 200 positions, as the member opposite has pointed 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada will endeavour, as best as it can, to enforce 
regulations to reduce pollution and protect wildlife, to set 
national standards and to issue weather warnings to protect the 
health and safety of all Canadians.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>LITERACY

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, prior to my election to the House of Commons, I was 
involved with adult education and adult literacy.  It is an area 
of great interest to me and an ongoing concern. I know firsthand 
about the problems associated with the lack of literacy skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recently released international adult literacy survey ranks 
Canada near the top of those who participated in that survey, yet 
more than 40% of adults or 7 million people in Canada do not have 
the literacy skills needed to function effectively at work or at 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada still ranks near the top of the 12 countries which 
participated in the survey.  Indeed, it ranks first among 
the English speaking countries, including the United States, Britain, 
Australia and New Zealand.  However, this is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People with lower literacy skills are more than twice as likely 
as those with mid range to high literacy skills to be unemployed. 
Clearly this needs to be changed.  This is unacceptable and it 
has to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Literacy skills are necessary if Canada is going to keep pace 
with a rapidly changing workforce that expects more expertise 
from workers.  This is more so as we go into the globalized 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Literacy skills are necessary to enable people to get meaningful 
employment.  This is very important and it is part and parcel of 
Canada's inevitable march to globalization and the 
interconnectedness of the economies of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I call on the federal government to work closely with 
the provinces and other groups who want to improve the literacy 
skills of Canadians.  The Canadian government must continue to 
develop and support more effective strategies in order to improve 
literacy levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the parliamentary secretary commit to this very worthwhile 
undertaking? 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington has a very good question for us here this 
evening.  I can offer what I think is an equally good answer for 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Minister of Human Resources Development I can 
report that the Government of Canada places a high priority on 
literacy.  This was reiterated in the February 1997 budget where 
the funding was increased in the national literacy program to 
$29.3 million from $7 million.  Our commitment was also why on 
September 8 Senator Joyce Fairbairn was appointed as special 
adviser for literacy to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC and StatsCan released a report back on September 8 that the 
hon. member referred to which was the first of the international 
adult survey monogram series.  The first report highlighted the 
strong literacy skills of Canada's youth which is the highest 
literacy score of all Canadians.  HRDC supported this report as 
part of our commitment to understanding literacy issues better. 
It reinforces a serious literacy challenge that has profound 
social and economic implications faced by industrialized nations 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I promise the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington and other 
members of this House that this government will work in 
partnership to ensure Canadians have access to literacy skills. 
After all, this is a prerequisite for participation in an 
advanced economy.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1).
