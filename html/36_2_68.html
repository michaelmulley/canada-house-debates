<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MEMBER FOR WENTWORTH—BURLINGTON—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now prepared to deliver my final 
ruling with respect to Bill C-206 standing in the Order of 
Precedence for Private Members' Business in the name of the 
member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter, concerning the acceptability of the list of 100 
signatures, was originally raised on February 7, 2000 by the 
member for Athabasca.  The hon. member for Athabasca complained 
of the use made of his signature in helping to have Bill C-206 
placed in the Order of Precedence.  He maintained that his 
support for the bill was limited to the text in its original form 
as Bill C-264 and not to the current version which is before the 
House. 
The hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington, for his part, claimed 
that he had never attempted to mislead the House or any of its 
members by his use of the list of signatures which he had 
gathered during the previous session.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a preliminary ruling which I delivered on February 8, 2000, I 
indicated that, as the mechanism provided by Standing Order 
87(6) for having an item placed in the Order of Precedence was a 
recent addition to our rules, the Chair lacked any precedents on 
which to base a decision.  At that time, I requested that the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs consider the 
matter and provide some indication of how the provisions of 
Standing Order should be understood. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure and House affairs committee has presented the 
results of its deliberations in its 19th report, which was tabled 
on Friday, March 17, 2000 and I am thus in a position to make a 
ruling on the question.  I am deeply grateful to the members of 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for the 
advice that they have provided the Chair.  I appreciate both the 
care which they have exercised in their deliberations and the 
promptness with which they have returned their views to the 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the guidance provided by the procedure and house 
affairs committee, it seems to me that the most reasonable, and 
the fairest, way of proceeding in the present case is to declare 
the list of supporters, collected during the first session of 
this parliament in support of Bill C-264 in its original form, 
invalid.  The list was collected at a time when our new 
procedures were not yet in place and legitimate concerns have 
been raised concerning just what it was that members thought 
they were committing themselves to in signing it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore accepting their recommendation that the member 
for Wentworth—Burlington have the opportunity to demonstrate 
that current support exists for the debate of Bill C-206 by 
filing a new list in conformity with the provisions of Standing 
Order 87(6)(a).  I emphasize here, as the committee did in its 
report, that what is sought here is support for the holding of a 
debate on the substance of the bill, not support for the content 
of the bill itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is shown that there is widespread support for the 
consideration of this item, it will be allowed to proceed. 
Failing the filing of the necessary list with the Journals Branch 
prior to Bill C-206 being set down for the first hour of debate 
at second reading, the item will be removed from the Order of 
Precedence.  It will, of course, remain eligible to be returned 
to the Order of Precedence through a later filing of such a list 
or by the normal process of the draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the member for Athabasca for raising this 
issue and the member for Wentworth—Burlington for his clear and 
concise account of the order of events.  I would also like to 
thank the House leader of the official opposition, the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, as well as the member for Roberval, for their 
contributions to the consideration of this question.  I would 
also once again express my appreciation to the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs for its valuable assistance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, of course I respect your decision in this matter.  I 
would just like to make two observations.  Bill C-206 is due to 
come up for debate within about a week.  Because of the very 
close timeframe in which you have ruled that I should be required 
to get the signatures again, I would ask that if I can get the 
signatures in the next day or so that perhaps Bill C-206 could 
remain where it is on the Order of Precedence rather than being 
dropped to the very bottom and perhaps not being debated for some 
months to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would just like to make one comment.  I do believe 
this arises from a legitimate misunderstanding.  I regret that I 
never had the opportunity to speak before the procedures and 
House affairs committee to explain the origin of the 
misunderstanding and to clarify the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, I think your ruling is the correct 
ruling and I abide by it.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I believe the question the hon. member is 
asking is whether this bill will come up in the normal course of 
events.  The answer is, yes.  Is that what the question is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker.  I do not quite 
understand your ruling.  The bill is due to come up in the next 
few days.  If the hundreds of signatures remain valid, it is due 
to come up on Thursday or Friday at the latest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, is, if I can get the hundred 
signatures in the next day or two—and I would hope to have the 
co-operation of the opposition parties in this—can my bill 
remain on the order of precedence and come up on Friday, as it is 
currently scheduled to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That was the question I thought the hon. 
member asked.  The response is, yes.

Citizenship and Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a little sadness that I do so because the report 
outlines the release of in camera material by the member for 
Lakeland which the committee believes may constitute a breach of 
the privileges of the House of Commons. If you, Mr. Speaker, find 
a prima facie case of privilege, I am prepared to introduce a 
motion for the entire matter to be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to bring to the attention of the House that on 
Friday, March 17, I stood in the House on a point of privilege to 
address the same matter.  The first report of the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration is also doing the same 
thing in asking the Speaker to rule on this very important matter 
which deals with the privileges of all members of the House with 
regards to confidential material being released prematurely 
before the committee and this House has had an opportunity to 
consider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask for your guidance and your advice on 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I thank the hon. 
member for London North Centre for his intervention. The Chair 
will take the member's comments under advisement and the Speaker 
will be apprised of his concerns.

BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK49">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the poor 
management seen at the Department of Human Resources Development, 
particularly in the award and use of grants for partisan 
purposes, and that it recommend the creation of an independent 
public commission of inquiry, whose members will be appointed by 
the House, and whose mandate will be to inquire into all 
practices of that Department and to report to the House by 
September 19, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I simply wish to bring to your attention that the hon. member 
for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques will be 
sharing his time with the hon. member for Québec and that, 
subsequently, other Bloc Quebecois members will be sharing their 
time in the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to recall the theme of 
today's opposition motion, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the poor management 
seen at the Department of Human Resources Development, 
particularly in the award and use of grants for partisan 
purposes, and that it recommend the creation of an independent 
public commission of inquiry, whose members will be appointed by 
the House, and whose mandate will be to inquire into all 
practices of that Department and to report to the House by 
September 19, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in Canada is now aware that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is responsible for an administrative 
scandal relating to the funds available for all grant and 
contribution programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of our motion relates to the poor management seen 
at Human Resources Development Canada.  It may be worthwhile to 
remind hon. members that, according to an internal departmental 
audit, 87% of cases bore no indication of the supervision of 
officers dealing with projects, while 75% of projects receiving 
contributions had no indication of whether the expected results 
had been attained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly in the case of job creation programs, they are able 
to announce to us how many jobs they want to create, but unable 
in a single case to tell us whether the objective has been met, 
and particularly unable to indicate whether the business used 
the money for the planned purposes.  This is a very concrete 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also said that 70% of projects have no invoices or pay 
stubs to justify expenditures. 
In 36% of cases where funding was increased, no reason for the 
increase was given.  For 36% of budgets in which there was money 
given in addition to the original amount, they were unable to 
justify the increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will surprise no one that the Bloc Quebecois is today calling 
for an independent public commission of inquiry into the matter. 
From the day the minister made public the findings of the 
internal audit, instead of taking a responsible attitude and 
seeing to it that they got to the bottom of the whole situation, 
the Liberal government and the Prime Minister—who is very much 
involved in the problems at HRDC—had no other concern but to 
cover up the situation. They tried to conceal from Quebecers and 
Canadians the fact that, at HRDC, they had lost control of the 
management of all the jobs creation grant programs and all the 
grant programs aimed at helping handicapped people and fostering 
literacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is unable to say what was done with the money and 
what it wanted to do with it. 
It is hiding behind a six point program that should deal with 
the situation in the future, but refusing to get right to the 
bottom of what happened in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For weeks, during oral questions period, the Prime Minister 
simply stated “There is no problem. The only problem involves 
$251”. Yet, we were talking about $1 billion. We have seen that 
when this Prime Minister wants to hide from realities, he is 
very good at doing so, but he has no right to try to conceal the 
fact from every Quebecer and Canadian.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the probing by the opposition parties, we have 
learned, over the past few weeks, all about the $251 problem. 
For example, we have found a $150,000 grant that was supposed to 
go to the riding of Rosemont but ended up in Saint-Maurice. We 
still do not know what actually happened to the money. An 
investigation was launched further to the questions asked by the 
member for Rosemont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened in other cases brought to light by the 
members of the opposition. The Bloc Quebecois has exposed the 
whole story behind Placeteco, revealing how the company was 
managed and how the friends of the regime have benefited from 
the whole operation. We always have to force the minister to 
reveal the facts, one question at a time. 
She has a reactionary style of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we manage to show her a file that has not been 
handled properly, an investigation is launched. This amount of 
$251 which the Prime Minister referred to again and again in the 
House lead to at least 19 RCMP investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> That is scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Last week, I asked the following question to the 
Department's director of internal audit. “How many of the 
internal audits you have made since you took up your duties have 
led to an investigation by the RCMP or any other police force 
before this particular audit?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His answer was really significant: none. Of all the previous 
internal audits, none had led to a full blown investigation. If 
19 investigations are now being conducted by the RCMP or other 
police force, it must be because there is something fishy going on. 
At any rate, this shows there is a very serious problem that 
needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, there are two periods that need to be analysed, which 
is one reason why the House should adopt this motion. The first 
one is the period during which the current Minister for 
International Trade was in charge of the Department of Human 
Resources Development. That is when everything was done wrong. 
It has been found that, during that period, the federal 
government managed public funds without proper control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day, during question period, the minister would tell 
us “Job creation programs are doing very well and the youth 
employment strategy is an excellent program. Don't worry, we got 
tough on the unemployed, but, on the other hand, we are very 
good at managing the available funds and creating jobs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time last year, the Bloc Quebecois exposed the fact that 
HRDC officials had quotas to meet. This means that there is a 
double standard in that department. When it comes to harassing 
the unemployed and taking as much money as possible from workers 
and businesses, all the necessary controls are in place. The 
unemployed worker who receives $275 or $250 a week in benefits 
should be careful not to make any mistake because he will get 
caught in no time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are investigations under way that cost $150,000. A 
$1 million dollar loan to the National Bank was supposed to 
create jobs. No jobs were created with that money, but there is 
no problem. It is perfectly normal. Jobs were consolidated but 
no new jobs were created, even though that money was supposed to 
help create some 40 new jobs. 
There is no investigation, nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all these situations, the minister hides behind answers that 
provide no new information. This is why a public inquiry 
is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to find out why the government treated the 
administrative discrepancies this way.  We might have said that 
had there just been the discrepancies, it would be easy to get 
out of it.  The government should say “There have been errors, 
we are going to change the situation, look at what was done in 
the past and try to correct our past errors”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wondered why the government had this attitude.  The answer 
lies in its use of the transitional jobs fund in order to win 
the 1997 election in a number of ridings.  Let us look at the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1997 election campaign, in the few months preceding 
and following it, the government spent 54% of the amounts 
accorded over three years.  In other words, in eight months, 54% 
of the money was spent on projects.  By some chance, 63% of the 
money was spent in the ridings of Bloc members.  That means the 
government decided to use the transitional jobs fund as a 
partisan tool, to advertise the Liberal Party of Canada, as a 
means of criticizing the opposition parties, but they used 
public money to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They decided to use the transitional jobs fund in order to buy 
votes. Today, we know why the federal government does not want an 
inquiry, does not want the facts to come out.  It is not because 
of a malversation of funds.  The federal government knows about 
malversations, mismanagement of public funds; we saw this last 
year.  We have seen the deficits they created.  Today we see 
that the problem in Department of Human Resources Development 
exists in other departments as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real reason is that it exposed the system put in place by 
the Prime Minister, a system that allows the government to use 
public funds to win elections, particularly in ridings where the 
outcome is uncertain. We will recall that, in the riding of 
Saint-Maurice, 58% of people voted yes in the 1995 referendum. 
The Prime Minister of Canada was not at all certain that he 
would win in his own riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, they decided to turn on the tap. 
Memos written by officials state that “it is imperative that 
this particular issue succeed, because that is what the Prime 
Minister wants”. Numerous cases were exposed, some in stories 
like the one broadcast by Radio-Canada yesterday evening, which 
clearly show that, politically, there is something fishy going 
on in the riding of Saint-Maurice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have good political debates, to have people who opposing 
views, whether they are federalists, sovereignists, Liberals or 
Bloc Quebecois, is normal. What is unacceptable is to undermine 
democracy by creating a patronage system designed to influence 
voters using every taxpayer's money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the money given away by Human Resources 
Development Canada is not that of the members of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, but that of all taxpayers in Quebec and in 
Canada. It was intended to help create jobs in all the ridings, 
in compliance with the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example of what the Liberal government did can be found 
in the riding of the minister responsible for the transitional 
jobs fund. To qualify for a grant, ridings must have an 
unemployment rate higher than 12%. The government decided to 
give grants to businesses located in the minister's riding and 
invented a new rule to support its decision. Under that rule, in 
ridings where the unemployment rate is below 12%, grants may be 
awarded if there are so-called pockets of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with the example involving the minister's 
riding. The problem is that the other ridings in Canada were never 
informed of that rule. So, the minister herself used the 
transitional jobs fund for her own partisan purposes. This is 
why all Quebecers and Canadians want an independent public 
inquiry. Action must be taken to correct this unacceptable situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member opposite. In 
terms of what he was saying, I am offended that he would paint 
the Prime Minister and the people of Shawinigan, and 
Saint-Maurice, the riding which the Prime Minister represents, 
into a corner and make the implication that the Prime Minister, 
as any good member of parliament, should not work very hard on 
behalf of his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject that premise.  I reject the implication of the member 
opposite because it is not only wrong, it is duplicitous.  Why 
will he not understand that a good member of parliament can be 
effective, as the Prime Minister is repeatedly, to ensure that 
the kinds of job creation programs are put in place not only in 
this case in Quebec but across Canada in the best interests of 
Canadians, groups in the ridings, students, young people, the 
disabled and others who genuinely require these kinds of grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that he always has to reduce everything we do in the 
House somehow into an aggrieved state that he must project and 
talk about?  It is unfortunate.  He should stand on his feet and 
congratulate the Prime Minister for working very well on behalf 
of Quebecers and for doing the kind of work that is necessary not 
only for Quebecers wherever they live in Quebec but for all 
Canadians.  He should stand and give congratulations but instead 
he always has to feel aggrieved. Why?

It was later demonstrated that Mr. Fugère is an acquaintance of 
the Prime Minister and that he gets a cut on the grants he 
obtains. There is, for instance, this $11,500 cheque from the 
Grand-Mère Inn for a $100,000 grant for which no evidence was

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree that instead of making deep cuts in the

government should have cut less? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand very well my

with many people on employment insurance, seasonal workers, 
people who work very hard to earn a living to provide for their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find out that this department, which keeps such a tight 
rein on the unemployed, has set recovery quotas for each Canada 
Employment Center. Failure to meet the quotas resulted in 
employees losing their job. I am not making this up. This is what 
departmental memos are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, when it comes to the transitional jobs fund, 
the government does not hesitate to help itself—this is the way 
Liberals do things—to taxpayers' money to win elections, 
particularly in the riding of Saint-Maurice, by putting in place 
an unacceptable system in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of attitude that was witnessed 50, 60 or 70

be well inspired to read the documentation. It contains 
overwhelming evidence, and we can table it. We are calling for an

handing out money in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair enough for members to work to get funds into their 
communities, but when four investigations in Quebec and 19 in 
the whole country are being carried out on how the money is 
distributed and on how certain ministers and members in Quebec 
and elsewhere in Canada have managed to get top funding for 
their ridings, we have every reason to be worried and to move 
the debate on to a higher level than the one where Liberal 
members and ministers seem to want to keep it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development also lacks foresight 
and rigour, as far as this scandal is concerned. We know full 
well that, from the very beginning, she tried to minimize the 
problem. The opposition parties, including the Bloc Quebecois, 
persisted and succeeded in revealing this huge scandal and 
shedding some light on this mismanagement by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister told us that she learned about the main elements of 
the report in November. She said that she was aware that 
something was going on in December and that there could have 
been some irregularities, but she never told us that she was 
aware of this report as far back as August nor that she had been 
informed of the situation in the Department of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After being pressed by the Bloc Quebecois and the other 
opposition parties, the minister started admitting that maybe we 
had been right to be concerned about the situation. People 
sometimes tell children that they are setting a bad example. The 
Prime Minister also minimized the significance of the problem, 
saying that $250 were at issue and that, therefore, there was no 
cause for concern. But the more we dig and the deeper we delve, 
we discover new problems and examples of mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems were found in 37 of the 459 files sampled. Some experts 
might say that these cases may have been revealed as examples, 
but that we could discover much more serious problems if we did 
a major clean up of the management of public funds at HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tried to hide the facts and that is what concerns 
us. First, she tried to hide the facts about the dates on which 
she was made aware of the report. She was informed in October but 
said she was not until the end of November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four months later, she was maintaining that no rules had been 
broken, that there had been no preferential treatment and that 
no money had been paid out without authorization. That was on 
December 16. However, she was aware of the auditor general's 
report.  She knew about the mismanagement at HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She knew that grants had been awarded for partisan purposes. 
She knew that there had been political interference and that 75% 
of the funds available had been awarded in the Prime Minister's 
riding, during the election campaign or about that time.  She 
knew that 54% of the money from the transitional job fund had 
been awarded, during the election campaign, six months before 
and two months after, in order to reward friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to the criteria in relation to the pockets 
of poverty.  I am insulted because there are such pockets in my 
riding.  As a member of parliament, I would have liked to know 
about this.  In my riding, the average income is higher than the 
poverty level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean that there is no poverty in lower town, in 
Saint-Roch, in Saint-Sauveur or in Limoilou. I have said to 
groups, to community networks “You are not eligible, the 
unemployment rate must be higher than 12%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned by the way this department, this government takes 
the taxpayers' money and uses it here and there for partisan 
purposes to look good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous instances have been uncovered. In the case of the 
Canadian tourism institute, the grant went into the  director's 
pockets: $2.5 million paid in December 1998. 
Two people resigned after blowing the whistle on what was going 
on in that administration. Within the institute, people were 
awarding themselves money for sitting on the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We told them “Do not do anything before the RCMP has completed 
its investigation and we have completed our own”. These people 
were forced to resign because they had exposed the problem. The 
same thing happens to us here, when we raise a problem. They try 
to gag us, to tell us that we are wrong, or else they shout at 
us, as they did earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also mention other investigations. The Fugère affair is 
another case in point. Mr. Fugère's lobbying activities were 
denounced. We know that he has done some work in the Prime 
Minister's own riding. The Prime Minister said he did not know 
him, that he had not given him any money. 
We know that the recipient of thes grants was a lobbyist who 
sometimes works for Mr. Chrétien's riding office.  Once again, 
no invoice has been produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get back to the auditor general. He has expressed 
great concern about the mismanagement at Human Resources 
Development Canada.  We are not the ones saying this, the 
auditor general is.  He takes administrative audits seriously. 
There are shortcomings, problems of compliance with legislative 
requirements, weaknesses in program design, poor control and 
insufficient information about the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general expressed frustration about the general 
administrative situation. 
According to him, there are other shortcomings.  There are other 
irregularities in the list obtained via access to information 
and the one released by HRDC.  Again, we are not the ones saying 
this, the auditor general is.  Might not someone who is above 
the whole mess, who is not partisan, who wishes to inform this 
House, be trusted?  He has said that something is going on in 
HRDC.  There seems to be no desire on the government side to 
take him seriously; the desire is to minimize the problem 
underlying the scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to intimidate us by telling us to pipe 
down, by telling us to go and settle it outside.  As a woman, I 
know what settling it outside means.  I am not going outside.  I 
am going to stay here, and I am going to speak out here.  It is 
high time people were told how things are done in this 
parliament.  I am not going to step outside, because I do not 
want to settle it with fists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move an amendment to my colleague's motion.  The 
door has been opened somewhat, but I would like to open it 
wider. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK53">&nbsp;</A>

At one point she said that words failed her.  Words should fail

She was not speaking the truth, and she should know better.  Let 
me tell the House why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is frivolous and vexatious. 
Instead of grandstanding and fabricating mythology, she should

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today they are putting on this big grandstand show, trying to 
agitate and get people worked up by vigorously objecting and all 
of these kinds of nonsensical things.  I vigorously object to the 
kind of mythology that is being promoted in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that all of the projects in Quebec, as in other 
provinces, had to be signed off by the Parti Quebecois, the 
Government of Quebec, in a partnership role.  This fact they 
conveniently leave out of their fine words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these grants were so bad, why is it that the Government of 
Quebec, the Parti Quebecois, signed off on them?  If they were 
that bad, why did the separatists in Quebec sign off? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The amendment is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again we can see how 
seriously my colleague takes RCMP investigations. Are RCMP 
investigations a myth? Is the auditor general's report a myth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tells me just how much the government members want to 
minimize the problem, saying “Yes, but the Quebec government 
approved the grants”. One can approve a grant but the 
responsibility is theirs to do a follow-up on the programs, to 
have the right funding and to see to it that the criteria are 
met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of bad faith, we are told for example that our 
communities need that money; I agree. Why do we want all these 
programs to be clarified? Because we want all communities to 
benefit from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where has all that money gone? We are talking about $100,000 
here, $1 million there and $200,000 elsewhere. 
I would have preferred to see these amounts to go to my 
communities instead of discovering that they got lost somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should stop blaming the opposition parties for 
wanting to get to the bottom of this scandal. I will not stop 
using the word scandal, because this is in fact a scandal. A 
government that does not know where the money has gone, that 
does not do a follow-up on its grants, should not be in charge of 
managing the public finances. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the hon. member for Québec, who gave an excellent 
speech. She is perfectly right to condemn the $1 billion scandal 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals brag about being good managers. The hon. member for 
Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister, and the hon. member for 
LaSalle-Émard, the Minister of Finance, are running surplus after 
surplus. How did they manage to run a surplus while losing one 
billion dollars at HRDC? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody knows that it was by cutting transfer payments and EI 
for those who needed it. Today, we are faced with a scandal. 
More than 50% of the funds earmarked for grants and 
contributions were spent a few months before and after the 
elections to buy votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it very unfortunate that the Minister for International 
Trade, who was then the minister responsible, cannot answer some 
questions. The current minister is now responsible. And she is 
because she knew about the report and misled the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague confirm that that minister should resign, not 
because she was responsible for the $1 billion boondoggle but 
because she was aware of the situation and misled the House?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I want to be sure 
that what we are doing is proper and that there has not been an 
accusation that the hon. minister deliberately—and I underscore 
the word “deliberately”—misled the House.  I will leave it 
there.  As far as the Chair is concerned, there was not the 
impression that there was a deliberate desire to mislead the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will recognize the hon. member for Québec for a short 
response. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, all we can say is that we 
did not get answers to our questions and that opposition parties 
are also there to shed light on the management of public 
finances. This is one of our responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for calling for the resignation of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development in light of this huge scandal, we can 
certainly do that, but we could also call for the resignation of 
the Minister for International Trade, who just skated around 
while he was in charge of HRDC, claiming that he really knew his 
department and how it was managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have to look at how that department is managed. We know 
where the orders come from. They come from the big boss. It is 
urgent to shed light on HRDC's management process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not satisfied with the minister's replies. She knew about 
the report and about the internal problems long before all this 
was made public, but the government tried to downplay the 
situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague from Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say at the outset that I am grateful to the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques for his 
timely motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that this subject has consumed the House since we 
returned from the winter break.  In question period the 
opposition commands the agenda because it gets to ask the 
questions.  There has been what I would call a feeding frenzy on 
this particular topic.  The reason for that is because in six and 
a half years this is the first time the opposition has found 
common ground, one with the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members have not been very successful at criticizing 
the government or co-ordinating their efforts in the face of our 
major improvements to Canadian society over the last six years: 
the reduction of the deficit, the lowering of unemployment, 
bringing under control the nation's finances to the point that we 
now have the best financial situation we have had probably in 15 
or 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that, but we have found one area that needs a lot 
of improvement.  Through an internal audit we have identified a 
section of our government that needs some serious work.  Our 
internal audit told us some bad news, and we took it as bad news. 
We took it seriously and we admitted ownership because we are the 
government.  We came up with an action plan to address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not dream up the action plan.  We devised a plan and into 
it we incorporated the advice of the auditor general, the other 
financial institutions of the government, the Treasury Board 
Secretariat, and we have even called in the private sector to 
look at our plan and how well it will address the problems 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the specialty of Bloc Quebecois members is moral 
outrage, they have found this a very comfortable file to hone in 
on.  I am actually surprised at how well they have slid into the 
agenda of the Reform Party.  We all know why Reform Party members 
want to go after this file.  They want to go after this file 
because they want to erode the confidence of Canadians in federal 
social programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to suggest to Canadians that HRDC is not well managed 
and to do that they have not painted the full picture.  They have 
taken something that a painter might think of as painting a 
picture by paint by number.  In the paint by number card that 
they have pulled out they are painting one section out of 60 over 
and over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to put it into perspective.  One has to remember 
that the Department of Human Resources Development has a budget 
of $60 billion.  For eight weeks the section that has 
commandeered the attention of the opposition and the media 
represents $1 billion or 1/60 of the department's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not hear many complaints from those 3.7 million people who 
are receiving their old age security cheques.  I do not hear many 
people complaining about their guaranteed income supplement. 
There are 1,381,000 of them.  I do not hear too many people who 
have qualified for EI complaining about their cheques.  There are 
1,263,000 of them.  Nor do I hear complaints from the 1.4 million 
families representing 2.6 million children who are receiving 
national children's benefits.  Instead they attack what is a good 
department, what is representing the social programs administered 
by the federal government, with the exception of health which has 
its own department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reformers are trying to paint a black picture based upon 
essentially a job creation fund that is part of that $1 billion 
and is worth $330 million.  That is 1/180 of the department's 
budget.  Now we have this in perspective: 1/180 of the 
department's budget is being attacked for eight weeks.  That is 
1/360 of the Government of Canada's budget.  I ask Canadians 
whether this is worth eight weeks of the time of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to trivialize the problem within that 1/360 of 
spending.  That is important and we take it seriously.  We accept 
responsibility and we accept ownership.  It has been said that we 
try to hide things.  I invite all members to go their whips' 
offices to see the 16 binders of information, each one being five 
and a half inches thick and piled on top of one another.  They 
almost reach to the ceiling.  Therein they will find a 
description of every project that has been funded under grants 
and contributions across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as we have collected this information for the 
perusal of all, the media, the opposition and our own members who 
want to know, we have been transparent.  It is an unprecedented 
release of information for a government.  We did not do that 
because the opposition was forcing our backs to the wall.  We did 
that because we want to govern well.  The population of today 
wants to know and we want to let the population know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sent lists of the projects in my riding to various 
constituents who have asked for it.  They have phoned me back 
with questions.  It has created a great deal of work but for 
transparency purposes it is worth it.  It is this minister who 
has led the drive to openness and transparency.  I am proud to be 
assisting her because she is leading into the new era of the new 
century with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that there was a lot of money spent in 1997. It 
is true that the budget for this has gone down from the $3 
billion, which is part of this, to less now because in the 
meantime we signed labour market development agreements with the 
provinces and a huge chunk of money was taken out and moved to 
them.  If we compare 1996 with 1999 we will say that it has gone 
down.  It was not because it went up in 1997 because there was an 
election.  It was after 1997 that one at a time we signed 
agreements with the provinces and transferred the relevant 
training money to them, so today it looks like we are spending 
less. 
It was not for partisan purposes.  That is a figment of the Bloc 
Quebecois' imagination.

are talking about the possibility of worrying about $330 million 
in the Canada jobs fund.  Just to update the House, at this time 
we have recovered $225,729 because we have identified some 
overpayments with our work.  We have called it back and it has 
arrived.  It will be different tomorrow and it was different last 
week, as we gather the information and put it together day by 
day, but as of today we are owed $640.21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this puts it into perspective for the viewers who have 
been bored to death by eight weeks of talking about 1/360 of the 
Government of Canada's budget.

can see that government members, ministers and parliamentary 
secretaries do not fully understand the problem with the 
scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development says that we do not fully appreciate all the 
government does to help, with income security, employment 
insurance benefits or the national child benefit. I wish to 
point out that these are not grants. They are fixed amounts 
which are given. Accordingly, one cannot really use those 
amounts for partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she says that she does not hear any criticism about 
employment insurance benefits, I can tell her that we often 
pointed out that they have been reduced and that six persons out 
of ten are not eligible for those benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am currently touring Quebec to look into poverty and the 
social safety net, which is gradually shrinking over the years. 
An election is coming up and a little more money might be added, 
but Quebecers will not be fooled. We will know what they are up 
to with public spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to her, Reformers are using the scandal to say that 
the programs should be cut back. However, we want to shed some 
light on this scandal. The government is minimizing the scandal 
at Human Resources Development Canada by saying that much is 
being done elsewhere, that this only involves a mere $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 19 cases are mentioned. A comprehensive investigation 
should have been ordered for the government's overall 
administration and the auditor general should have been asked to 
look into the way it is using taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the issue we have to deal with. Opposition parties are 
doing their duty when they ask—

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we know that a billion 
dollars is a lot of money.  As for the point that we do not get 
it, it is not true.  We do get it.  What I do not get is how they 
will play this game with the Reformers and continue to erode 
people's confidence in the social programs which I know they 
believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the social conscience of most Bloc Quebecois members is 
extremely strong.  They have a true idea of community and as such 
I see members of that particular party as supporters of the way I 
view the world.  I try to recruit them to the causes we believe 
in together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However damage is being done by the consistent use of the word 
scandal and by this opposition day.  They do not seem to realize 
that the impact is not necessarily eroding support for the 
Liberal government or helping them to win seats. It is 
strengthening the right wing in the country as personified by the 
<I>National Post</I>.  They are giving the <I>National Post</I> 
more and more fodder every day to feed to the people so that they 
lose faith in social programs.  I do not understand why the Bloc 
Quebecois is co-operating with that.

there is a huge scandal going on at HRDC at the moment.  It is 
unprecedented in Canada's political history.  Even in the time 
of the Conservatives, during the nine years when scandal 
followed scandal, never was a scandal worse than the one before 
us now at HDRC.

use the phone line set aside for MPs to request information.  I 
used the line and then went through access to information because 
they would not give me the information on the direct line.

secrets being traded, when we have public money being stolen, 
when we have what the movies call sex, lies and videotapes, then 
we have a scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem of management in our grants and contributions. 
We accept responsibility.  We are working on it.  We are turning 
up new information every day as our 20,000 employees go through 
the files and check on everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this member has been having trouble getting the 
information he wants on one file.  I offered just yesterday to 
help him get that information.  However I must caution members 
that we cannot give information that would erode the privacy of 
individual Canadians.  It is probably something about the Privacy 
Act that is restraining the official from giving him everything, 
but I am happy to work with him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to be open and transparent for our colleagues in the 
opposition and for Canadians to know that we are working on it 
step by step to clean it up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
at the outset I commend the parliamentary secretary for her very 
thoughtful words and the insight that she provided not only for 
the House but for Canadians wherever they live in our great land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She mused a little out loud about why the Bloc and the Reformers 
would be so cozy, cheek to cheek in this kind of debate.  It 
struck me that it was not so long ago that the Reformers held a 
convention in London, Ontario, or maybe Toronto.  In any event, 
who was their lead speaker?  It was the separatist, Mr. Biron. 
The lead kick-off speaker of the Reform Party of Canada was none 
other than Mr. Biron, a separatist from Quebec.  I guess the 
parliamentary secretary's musing about where they are at is no 
secret.  They are playing toe and toe, playing cheek and cheek 
and playing pretty cozy these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Frontenac—Mégantic talked about scandal.  Let me 
tell him that the only scandal is that the Bloc members and he, 
instead of standing up for Quebecers and getting the kind of 
money that is necessary for hard pressed areas in Quebec and in 
other places in Canada, should be defending— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I insist that you ask this member to withdraw his remarks.  The 
members of the Bloc Quebecois were elected democratically 
without buying votes one after the other. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I listened very 
carefully to the words of the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington and I did not hear anything in his words 
that were inappropriate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to point out 
that the only scandal we are talking about today is the inability 
of the Bloc members to support their constituents, to support 
Quebecers in getting jobs and finding out the kind of money that 
is necessary for each of their individual ridings. That is the 
scandal here today and not what they are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get to some of the facts.  We heard the member for 
Quebec speak and we heard the member for Elk Island bellow across 
the aisle.  Incidentally he is the member who is on record in 
<I>Hansard</I> as having called me a liar not so long ago. That 
very member is part of the Reform Party which, let me see now, 
was to bring a fresh start to parliament, a new way of doing 
business, was it not?  And the member for Elk Island sits and 
bellows across the aisle.  There he sits calling people liars. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask you to ask the member to stick to the debate.  They 
say we flirt with the Reformers.  Can I talk of Bill C-20, which 
was passed at Quebec's expense and on which they wanted to gag 
us?  They applauded the Reformers, but those two were going on 
hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of thing can be said for a long time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We need to cut each 
other a little bit of slack here today.  There will be a fair 
amount of debate going back and forth.  We will all have to 
develop thicker skins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington gets started, we 
can bring the word liar in the front door and we can bring it in 
the back door, but let us just leave it outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what clearly is not left 
outside the House is the thick skin those members should be 
prepared to put on.  They can dish it out, but it appears they 
cannot take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the member for Quebec and the member for 
Elk Island who was bellowing across the aisle not so long ago 
that the auditor general is very much part of the process. 
Instead of getting up and parading mythology like the member for 
Quebec was doing a minute ago, she should know her facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I was vice-chair of the public accounts committee. I 
have worked very hard and long with Mr. Denis Desautels over the 
years.  I know the kind of thorough work he is prepared to do. 
He will do it and rightfully so on behalf of the taxpayers of 
Canada.  His report will come out in the fall. What will his 
report say?  We do not know, but we do know that Mr. Desautels, 
the Auditor General of Canada, will be conducting the kind of 
review necessary to get to the bottom of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear both of the members opposite, the bellowing one too, 
talk about the auditor general not being part of the process, I 
have to scratch my head because he is an integral part of the 
process.  Instead of perpetuating that kind of mythology, the 
hon. member for Quebec should get her facts straight.  So should 
the bellowing member by the way.  They should make sure they know 
what they are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of facts, I want to point out that over and above that, 
the standing committee on human resources development is taking a 
look at all this kind of information.  Why? It is trying to get 
to the bottom to see exactly what transpired and how.  More to 
the point, and I think the minister has repeatedly said this time 
and time again over the last seven weeks, she instigated the 
audit.  She brought it forward and she is now trying to correct 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  The member for Calgary—Nose Hill tries to 
take the lead.  Other members here today, the Bloc types, by 
grandstanding are trying to cash in and to carve a name out for 
themselves.  It is really shameful.  What they should be doing 
instead is defending people who require this kind of money, 
people who are unemployed, people who are disabled, young people 
and people in areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are areas of high unemployment in Quebec. There are areas 
of high unemployment in the east.  There are areas of high 
unemployment in the west. Instead of caterwauling away and trying 
to stir up all kinds of ridiculous things, they should be 
congratulating the government and saying what a wonderful thing 
it is doing in the best interests of Canadians. 
They should be congratulating us.  Instead they seem intent on 
distorting the facts and that is too bad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are very smart people.  They see through that kind of 
political posturing. They see through those kinds of political 
shenanigans.  They see through the kind of nonsense which the 
Bloc is trying to promote today.  Canadians see through it. 
Quebecers and Canadians wherever they live in this great country 
of ours see through the kind of shenanigans that the people 
opposite are trying to pretend is true.  We will have no part of 
it and rightfully so. Canadians expect no less from the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the committee taking a look at this very 
important issue, the minister herself has said that four times a 
year she is prepared to come forward with a report and make sure 
all of the facts are on the table in terms of what is happening. 
It is important to note that we have put in place the kind of 
safeguards that are required in this all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me zero in on the point I believe the Bloc is missing in 
this very important debate.  Should the government be providing 
these kinds of grants and contributions to constituents wherever 
they live in Canada?  I do not know what their answer is but the 
way the Bloc members are talking and posturing, it would appear 
that their answer is no, the government does not have a role. 
Like the parliamentary secretary said, they are in bed with the 
Reformers with the right-wing agenda of trying to cut off 
Canadians at their knees when it comes to these important things. 
Canadians reject that kind of right-wing nonsense.  They want 
absolutely no part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought the Bloc was more progressive than that.  I thought 
the Bloc had a better social conscience.  I thought it would be 
more prepared to defend Quebecers and defend people who genuinely 
need this kind of assistance.  Instead, we hear them toady behind 
the Reformers and the best they can come up with is a flat tax. 
Imagine.  Even the right-wing Republicans, the wing nutty types 
in the United States have rejected the flat tax.  Maybe Jerry 
Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker and a few others of their 
ilk— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think it might be good if the member were to speak with some 
relevance to the motion before the House instead of acting like 
his dog just died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> That is certainly not 
a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about 
dogs.  He is the last one who should be speaking about dogs 
because that party they are trying to assemble, that dog will not 
hunt. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am tired of hearing this sort of thing.  The Prime Minister 
spoke about sleeping dogs with reference to sovereignists, and 
now dogs are dragged in, in connection with Reformers.  Can 
members express themselves some other way or is this how they 
always criticize people? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have got to stop 
barking at each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it really is quite 
interesting to see how upset the Bloc members get.  I thought 
they were good politicians.  A good politician is able to dish it 
out and take it, not simply to dish it out.  Tut, tut Madame.  It 
seems to me she should develop a bit of a thicker skin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two fundamental values which Canadians support when it 
comes to this kind of issue.  We on the government side support 
the values of listening to Canadians and of being caring and 
compassionate.  These values are intrinsic to the very core of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the hon. Reform member caterwaul and laugh because he 
does not understand this.  He does not understand that caring and 
compassion is a core Canadian value because he is a Darwinian 
economist.  We were speaking of dogs a minute ago.  He wants to 
let dog eat dog because he cares only about his rich friends.  He 
does not care about people who are less fortunate and people who 
genuinely require our assistance.  Blessfully and thankfully, we 
on the government side do.

clear that we on the government side will not do that and 
rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have several 
members who wish to ask questions.  We will keep the question to 
one minute and one minute for the response. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
grateful for the opportunity to speak.  The member opposite did 
not address the motion.  The motion has to do specifically with 
the mismanagement in the Department of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke glowingly of the auditor general, yet he failed to 
point out or to remember the fact that it was the auditor general 
who almost a year ago released his report that drew attention to 
this great mismanagement. As a matter of fact the auditor general 
has been raising such questions for a number of years.  Finally 
the media and the official opposition were able to get together 
in such a way to make this an issue across the country because 
Canadians are concerned about the mismanagement of their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is not on whether or not some of the programs are 
good.  Some are, some are not.  The debate is about the lack of 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that the member did not see fit to address the real 
question.  For example, some 85% of the applications did not have 
even a supporting application form. That is mismanagement of the 
greatest form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are trying to address.  We will continue to do 
that.  I think members of the public in Canada will applaud us 
and not the wasteful Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not need a lecture from 
the member opposite.  I was at the table when the auditor 
general's report came out.  I was vice-chairman at that time. I 
know full well what the auditor general reported.  We as a 
committee then went into detail in terms of what we were prepared 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point something out to the hon. member.  He should 
really think hard, deep, fast and long about getting his facts 
straight. It was not the media, it was not the grandstanding 
opposition types, especially the member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
who with grandstanding kerfuffle and all kinds of outrageous 
statements has tried to take credit for somehow flushing the 
government out on this.  That is incorrect, it is wrong and it is 
nonsense. It was the minister who came forward and through her 
audit and her process was able to begin correcting the problem. 
Instead of sitting there and fabricating those kinds of myths, 
members should be congratulating the minister for doing her job 
and doing it effectively. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to get back to this morning's motion.  Essentially, 
this motion recommends “the creation of an independent public 
commission of inquiry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened is that HRDC's internal auditor selected 459 
projects at random—somewhat like in a survey involving 1,200 
people across Canada.  Of these 459 projects, 80% were 
problematic, had not followed the normal procedure.  What is 
worse is that 37 were extremely problematic.  Of these 37, the 
RCMP are investigating 19 throughout Canada, three of them in 
the riding of Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With his usual verve, the Prime Minister told us that only $250 
had been misspent.  Our suspicion is that, if all 11,000 
projects were audited, the HRDC scandal would involve somewhere 
between $1 billion and $3 billion, an amount unprecedented in 
Canada; it is mind-boggling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party has been accused of buying votes, and what 
happened in Saint-Maurice in 1997 clinches it.  The Prime 
Minister literally won the election by handing out taxpayers' 
money and, unfortunately, this money was misused as in the case 
of Placeteco.  This was on the news last night.  It is 
scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member opposite to tell me how the Liberals are going 
to be able to refuse to create an independent commission of 
inquiry to look into all the projects when the vote is held at 
5.30 p.m. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed in the 
hon. member's assertions and I totally reject, out of hand, his 
comments, especially with respect to the riding of Saint-Maurice. 
He should be a little more careful in terms of what he says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of denigrating the constituents of that great riding, 
instead of denigrating, by extension, Quebecers, he should be 
standing in his place and celebrating the fact that the 
Government of Canada wants to put in place the kinds of grants 
and contributions that are appropriate for people who are in 
need.  He should be celebrating that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In direct response to his questions—and I got to the substance 
of this in my speech—we have the kinds of checks and balances 
that are in place.  We have the auditor general's report, for 
example, which will come out in the fall.  The auditor general is 
an officer of the House.  I cannot believe the opposition is 
taking the kind of swipes at the auditor general that it is 
doing.  It is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auditor General of Canada, who is an officer of this House, 
has the prerogative to look into this whole issue, to examine it 
thoroughly and to bring about the kinds of recommendations that 
will be meaningful for Canadians. What do the Reformers do?  They 
dismiss it out of hand and say that he is not good enough.  I 
take exception because I work with the auditor general and I know 
exactly the kind of work he will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the RCMP, I was involved with the regional police for 10 
years.  I was chairman of the police.  I know that those kinds of 
investigations go on all the time.  For the member to stand in 
his place and imply that there is some kind of scandal going on 
here is absolutely outrageous and he should retract. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
unlike the previous speaker from the Liberals, I would like to 
speak specifically about the motion that is before the House 
today and hopefully not get into the same kind of rant that he 
decided to get into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the poor management 
seen at the Department of Human Resources Development, 
particularly in the award and use of grants for partisan 
purposes, and that it recommend the creation of an independent 
public commission of inquiry, whose members will be appointed by 
the House, and whose mandate will be to inquire into all 
practices of that department and to report to the House by 
September 19, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be keying in very specifically on the issue of the 
independent public commission of inquiry.  There is nothing more 
important to this scandal than that we get to the bottom of it 
and the only way we will get to the bottom of it is with an 
independent public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing the Liberals would want is an independent public 
inquiry.  I know this because of my experience in attempting to 
pursue the involvement of the Prime Minister in the APEC affair 
as it happened and unfolded in November 1997 in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government knows by experience that the longer the process 
is drawn out the less relevant it is.  Clearly, it has managed to 
bury the Prime Minister's involvement in the suppression of 
Canadians' freedom of expression and their fundamental rights 
that they hold as Canadian citizens.  It has managed to bury this 
in a totally irrelevant process which, again I say, is why I am 
speaking specifically to the issue in the motion of the 
importance of an independent inquiry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's answer to accountability is damage control.  It 
deflects the issue hoping that people become bored and it 
complicates the issue until it is no longer recognizable.  As I 
said, the APEC inquiry is an absolute classic example of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Prime Minister's 36 years of public life, he has learned 
how to use the system to protect himself, particularly by burying 
the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people want simple answers to the question in APEC: 
Was the Prime Minister involved in suppressing Canadians' freedom 
of expression?  Is there support for my position that indeed that 
was the case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is why that matters, as expressed by Craig Jones, one of 
the jailed protesters.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root issue for me is to what extent we are going to accept 
the political control of the RCMP by the executive branch of the 
government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why it is important to the people of Canada is the significance 
of the separation of executive and enforcement or politicians 
from police.  Where there is a dictatorship there are politicians 
directing the police.  Where there is a democracy we are supposed 
to have a firewall between politicians and police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the issue of accountability and to the issue of an 
independent inquiry, I refer you, Mr. Speaker, to September 21, 
1998 when I asked the Prime Minister the following question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Prime Minister one more time...Will he admit that 
his fingerprints are all over this process, that he is fully 
responsible for the fact that democratic rights of Canadians were 
taken away as a public statement, a political statement by him? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general of the day said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appeal to the members opposite to recognize the 
appropriate role for the public complaints commission that was 
established by parliament.  It deserves our support and I would 
ask the members opposite to give it to the commission. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relevance to this motion is that the public complaints 
commission was the incorrect body to be looking into this issue. 
The relevance to this motion is that I suggest that the human 
resources development minister's appraisal of the problem, as she 
sees it under her so-called six point program, is the incorrect 
vehicle to be taking a look at this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the APEC affair to see how this became 
convoluted and how a proper inquiry ended up being twisted and 
pulled out of the realm of possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the following question on September 24, 1998: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no level of inquiry.  There is the public complaints 
commission, and I quote from the RCMP Act “They only may look 
into any member or any other person employed under the authority 
of this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the public complaints commission can look into.  It 
is strictly a snow job that the solicitor general is doing— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general again said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This inquiry has exactly the same powers as the kind of inquiry 
that the hon. member was demanding, very specifically the powers 
of a broad inquiry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out again that throughout this entire affair the 
respective solicitors general and the Deputy Prime Minister all 
said that this was the correct vehicle, which is why we support 
the Bloc Quebecois motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to get to the bottom of this scandal at Human 
Resources Development Canada, the only way we will get there is 
through an independent public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 20, 1998, I asked the Prime Minister, with respect to 
the APEC affair, why he was trying to bury this affair under the 
public complaints commission.  I quote the Prime Minister, who 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want people to understand that it is the opposition that should 
apologize for depriving the Canadian people of an independent 
body to look into that problem. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was either unaware, uninformed or in fact wilfully said 
things that were not accurate when he made that statement because 
this has never been an independent public inquiry.  This has 
always come under the public complaints commission which was 
never ever designed to uncover the fingerprints of the Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that Commissioner Ted Hughes has a tremendous task 
ahead of him.  In my judgment he has been doing an outstanding 
job, yet he is still not getting to the bottom of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1999 the Prime Minister committed to the House that 
everyone from his office and the government would be available to 
testify.  Considering the number of fingerprints the Prime 
Minister had on the APEC affair, we assumed everyone included 
himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, totally contrary to the representations made by the 
Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the respective 
solicitors general, and contrary to the answers to the questions 
that we had posed in question period, the lawyers for the 
government, understandably, argued in front of the commissioner 
that the Prime Minister should not appear.  It was something of a 
surprise that the solicitor for the commission itself also argued 
to the commissioner, in public at the commission hearing, that 
the Prime Minister not appear.  However, it went over the top 
when the lawyer for the RCMP argued at the public complaints 
commission that the Prime Minister should not appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I say that the reason we support the Bloc Quebecois motion 
that is before the House is because of the importance and 
significance of an independent public inquiry to get to the 
bottom of the HRDC scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 28, 2000 the Prime Minister said that he did not 
have to go to the inquiry because he could reply to questions in 
the House. He has repeatedly stated in the House that he will not 
answer questions and that we should let the commission do its 
job.  However, forget that, the commissioner is trying to do his 
job.  When it was convenient, the Prime Minister hid behind the 
incorrect vehicle and this government chose to cover up for the 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out that there were three important differences 
between the House and the APEC inquiry:  First, witnesses are 
under oath; second, witnesses may be cross-examined and their 
statement of facts may be challenged; and furthermore, the answer 
from a witness may exceed 35 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, from the example Canadians have before them about 
the coverup by the politicians directing the police at the APEC 
inquiry and the fact that the government wilfully chose to hide 
that inquiry under the incorrect vehicle, the public complaints 
commission, clearly the House must support the Bloc motion to 
call for an independent inquiry to uncover the facts relating to 
the scandal at HRDC.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech by the member of the Reform Party and I 
would have a few questions for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said, I want to thank him for it, that he will support the 
motion brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois to have an 
independent, non-partisan public inquiry. The Liberals have great 
difficulty telling what is non-partisan. Perhaps I misheard, but 
I would like to know if this is the member's personal position 
or that of his party, if this will be a free vote or a party 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for him, I would like to respond briefly to the 
Liberal member, who is accusing us of all evils. I think that, 
if he could eliminate us, he would do it in a flash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He accuses us of having an alliance with the Reform Party on the 
issue of good management of public funds. We are not against 
having programs. But regardless of the amount, be it $100,000, 
$1 million, $10 million or $1 billion, I think all Canadians, 
whether Reformers, BQ, NDP or what not, want that money to be 
well spent and well managed. That is all we want. Priorities 
will be identified later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are accused of ignoring the auditor general's 
recommendations. For the benefit of the Liberal members who will 
follow this debate, I would simply like to point out that the 
auditor general wrote, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two decades, my office has carried out several 
audits of the management of grant and contribution programs by 
federal departments and agencies. These audits identified 
persistent shortcomings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He further wrote, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can't help but express a certain degree of frustration with 
the management of grant and contribution programs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows the role of the auditor general in denouncing the 
shameless squandering of grants by the Liberal Party. I would 
also like the Reform member to comment on that and to tell us 
what his party's position is on the matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, our party will be supporting 
the motion for the reasons I stated.  Clearly there must be a 
full independent public inquiry into this affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This affair is a matter of principle, which is something that 
the parliamentary secretary clearly did not understand in her 
presentation for the government today.  She said “What is the 
big deal?  This is only one—” and then she gave some kind of 
fraction, 1/186th or whatever it was.  I do not know.  It had 
something to do with Liberal math, so I do not really understand 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are dollars and cents involved.  However, the most 
important issue is not the dollars and cents.  The most important 
issue is that the government goes out of its way constantly to 
pat itself on the back, calling itself a wonderful manager of the 
Canadian taxpayers' funds, when in fact it is not.  It is 
absolutely cavalier with the money that comes from the Canadian 
taxpayer to the public treasury.  On top of that, it gets 
involved in a process that is a cover-up, because it works these 
funds as it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday and Friday were absolutely classic examples.  The 
minister herself did not have a clue as to whether there was a 
fourth police inquiry into this affair in the Prime Minister's 
riding.  First she said there was, and then she said there was 
not.  It struck us over the weekend that the people in her 
department changed the facts so that they ended up supporting the 
minister's utterances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was ever a reason for an independent public inquiry, 
this is it, and the time is now.

weeks we have been led to believe that the Reform Party is 
opposed to the government's regional development programs and 
that all it wanted to do is object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House briefly that there is a 
$27 billion surplus in the employment insurance fund. The 
transitional job fund was created to try to make up for the 
money taken away from unemployed workers, and to help them find 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my hon. colleague tell us if the Reform Party is opposed 
to the program or only to the way it is managed and to the 
government's lack of accountability for taxpayers' money? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, very clearly what this is 
about is the mismanagement of funds.  There is a difference of 
opinion between ourselves and the NDP on how to effect these 
changes.  That is part of the political process.  Indeed, when we 
get to an election it will be part of the dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the issue.  The issue is the gross mismanagement and 
the cavalier attitude that the Liberals have toward hard earned 
tax dollars.  It does not even control the disbursement of those 
tax dollars.  That is the issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in debate on this supply day motion from my 
colleagues in the third party, that the House condemn the 
government for the very poor management brought to the attention 
of the Minister of Human Resources Development, notably in the 
allocation and use of grants for partisan purposes, and recommend 
the creation of an independent public inquiry commission whose 
members would be named by the House and whose mandate it would be 
to investigate the overall practices of that department and to 
report to the House no later than September 19, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking on behalf of members of the official opposition, we 
intend to support this motion, although we would like to see an 
inquiry into this very grave matter conducted by the auditor 
general rather than an independent commission.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The predicate of this motion is that the government has engaged 
in classic pork barrel political spending of the most grotesque 
kind, the kind of politics which I thought a modern liberal 
democracy would have advanced beyond.  But in fact what we see 
through the granting programs administered by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and many of her other colleagues is 
that public money is increasingly being used under this 
government for partisan purposes.  That ought not to be happening 
in a liberal democracy under the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the very diligent research of the official opposition, we 
have managed to uncover a mountain of information about the 
misadministration of over a billion public dollars through the 
human resources department.  We know that because of access to 
information requests submitted by the official opposition special 
audits revealed that 80% of grants made by HRDC showed no 
financial monitoring, 87% showed no supervision, 97% showed no 
attempt to find out if the recipient already owed money to the 
government, 11% had no budget proposal on file and, incredibly, 
15% had no application on file for money that was received from 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have uncovered more and more information as the weeks have 
gone by.  Just yesterday we revealed in the House an internal 
audit conducted of the TAGS program during the period 1994 to 
last year which revealed similar misadministration and abuse of 
public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the minister of HRDC say that this is 
just an administrative error, a series of coincidental 
administrative errors for which the political ministry takes no 
responsibility and merely passes the buck to what the 
parliamentary secretary to HRDC yesterday referred to as lowly 
bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only have we seen the complete rejection of the concept, 
tradition and convention of ministerial responsibility, but, more 
shockingly, what we see when we look below the surface, when we 
look at these grants, is the gross politicization of granting 
programs of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take an example, the number of grant approvals from the HRD 
department skyrocketed near the end of the last election.  What a 
surprise.  What a coincidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may recall having seen a graph.  I think it was 
published on the front page, above the fold, in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> some three weeks ago.  It graphically represented 
the findings of the official opposition's research, which showed 
that the grant approvals and announcements were on a flat line 
throughout most of 1996 and 1997.  Then, all of a sudden we came 
to April, May and June, the time of the last federal election, 
and there was this huge spike in the number of approvals and 
announcements of HRD grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure it was just a coincidence that it was concurrent with 
the last federal writ being dropped in May 1997.  When we look at 
the hard numbers, though, 592 approvals were made in April 1997 
when the government knew it would drop the writ for the last 
general election, and that number, the 592 approvals, was four 
times higher than the monthly average of targeted wage subsidy 
approvals for the period April 1996 to August 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is clearly the government abusing its power, abusing 
its control over public resources, abusing its control of the 
bureaucracy to force the approval of granting programs in the 
targeted wage subsidies administered by HRD for its own political 
advantage.  I find this to be really quite reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is further evidence.  Last year the minister of HRDC's 
riding received over three times the national average in targeted 
wage subsidy money.  In spite of the fact that her own riding did 
not qualify for any such grants, in spite of the fact that it had 
one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it was 
receiving more grant money than ridings with much higher 
unemployment rates which qualified for the program.  This is more 
political interference.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's riding, the home of the famous Versailles 
water fountain, the home of the hon. member for let them eat 
cake, received more grant money than all of the prairie provinces 
combined.  I am sure that is just a coincidence.  I am sure that 
all of the phone calls, faxes and letters from the Prime 
Minister's office to bureaucrats in HRDC asking for the 
expedition and approval of granting programs, some of which had 
not yet made application, were merely coincidental.  There was no 
political pressure.  I am sure it was just one lowly—to coin a 
phrase—member of parliament doing his job for his constituents. 
If members buy that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not buy that kind of evasion.  Canadians know the 
abuse of public funds for political purposes when they see it, 
and they see it now in spades with the Right Hon. member for 
Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A letter from a human resources department official reveals 
that the Prime Minister deliberately broke the rules regarding 
regional distribution of grant money, because he was instructed 
to approve grants in the Prime Minister's riding.  We see this 
pattern over and over again.  We find that there is substantial 
and compelling evidence that the government has systematically 
engaged in the partisan use and abuse of public funds for its own 
political benefit.  I am talking about senior ministers' ridings 
and the Prime Minister's riding.  Grants have been forced to be 
approved and announced immediately before election time.  This 
demonstrates the kind of corruption which is at the heart of the 
granting process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that in a modern liberal democracy, governed by the 
rule of law and parliamentary conventions, these kinds of pork 
barrel spending programs are outdated.  I am sure this is news to 
the Prime Minister, but this is not money that belongs to the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  It is not money held in trust by the 
member for Saint-Maurice.  It is not money that belongs to 
anybody but the people who have earned it and paid for it, and 
who have had it taken away from them by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in this place we debated the fact that the government 
has cut some $21 billion from health care during its tenure since 
1993, all the while increasing boondoggle prone spending such as 
the HRDC grants.  We saw in the recent budget tabled in the House 
by the hon. Minister of Finance that the government is going to 
increase boondoggle prone spending and granting programs like the 
transitional jobs fund and the targeted wage subsidies faster 
than it is going to increase spending on health care, which is by 
far the highest public priority.  Why?  Not because these 
programs create jobs.  On average, the jobs created by these 
programs cost several times more than the job is actually worth 
on an annual basis.  It is because the government is seeking to 
gain and maximize political partisan benefits for its members and 
perspective candidates in the next election.  That is why we will 
concur and support the Bloc Quebecois motion to seek an 
independent inquiry, although we would rather see it conducted, 
as we have asked already, through the office of the auditor 
general, an officer of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Official Opposition has written to the auditor 
general seeking such an inquiry.  We hope that he will respond. 
If not, we hope that an independent inquiry, the likes of which 
are contemplated by this motion, will finally get to the bottom 
of this mess and this corruption.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He seems to be indicating that the programs are not creating 
jobs. I come from Acadie—Bathurst, in northeastern New Brunswick, 
and I can tell you that we have been hard hit by the changes to

program did not help our small businesses create jobs. The

disagree.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the hon. member from the Reform Party. I 
would like him to be somewhat clearer than his colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he believe government programs can help create jobs in 
regions like mine where there are no jobs? If one looks at the 
peninsula, the unemployment rate climbs to 40% in winter when 
there is no more fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the program that should be criticized, but its 
management. We would like to get to the bottom of this. We would 
like a public inquiry to get to the bottom of this and save 
those programs that are good for Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I concur with my colleague 
from Acadie—Bathurst in that our principal concern today is the 
misadministration of these programs.  That is the focus of this 
motion, which is why we will be supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked if I and my party oppose programs of this 
nature in principle.  I believe, having studied the case 
experience of governments across the world, that a dollar left in 
the hands of an entrepreneur, an investor, a small business 
person or working family is more effective in creating wealth, 
jobs and a higher standard of living than a dollar transferred 
through the enormous federal bureaucracy and distributed through 
so-called job creation schemes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that there ought to be an effective program for job 
creation, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions.  I 
think that the most effective program would be significant tax 
relief which would increase the incentives for people to invest, 
take risks, work and save. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we may have a philosophical difference with the member 
for Acadie—Bathurst on that point, we do have an agreement with 
respect to the need to review and completely overhaul the 
misadministration of programs, such as the one we are discussing 
today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, further to what the member for 
Calgary Southeast just said, I know that he does not want to deny 
people with disabilities money any more than we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where would he draw the line?  Could he amplify on what he has 
just said in terms of these grants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not addressing grants 
for the severely disabled.  I worked for organizations raising 
money for the severely disabled.  I believe that the severely 
disabled, more than any other constituents in society, deserve 
our public support.  They are the most vulnerable and, in most 
cases, do not have the capacity to find gainful employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not what we are talking about.  We are talking 
about the targeted wage subsidies and the transitional jobs fund 
that have been misadministered.  I doubt very much that the huge 
increase in the number of approvals for the targeted wage 
subsidies in April 1997, one month before the federal writ was 
dropped, was done for reasons of compassion for the disabled.  I 
rather suspect it was done for reasons of partisan necessity on 
the part of Liberal candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with the member that there ought to be programs to 
assist the disabled, but I do not think that has anything to do 
with the explosive numbers of so-called job creation grants 
announced concurrent with the federal election.  Those are two 
entirely separate issues and we ought not to confuse them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government definitely has a role to play in job creation, 
but by using these funds for political purposes the Liberals 
have taken away Canadians' confidence in their government and in 
their MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a role to play because Canadians have always 
asked “What are we getting in return for all the taxes we pay?” 
From 1986 to 1993, the Conservative government initiated the 
cuts to employment insurance, and now the Liberal government is 
continuing these cuts.  What was needed, supposedly, was 
something to try to get some jobs back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it working?  Perhaps not, but there are certainly some for 
whom jobs have been created. 
In my riding of Acadie—Bathurst, the money helped businesses in 
my region.  The people who got work, who were able to work, are 
proud of it.  At issue in the House today is the way it was 
managed, and I will get back to that a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It suits the Reformers to have the government's credibility 
undermined by this mismanagement, but it is not in the interest 
of Canadians.  The Reform Party wants us to end government 
assistance programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put questions twice in a row to my Reform colleagues.  They 
told me specifically that they are not in favour of job creation 
programs.  They did say it was all right for the 
handicapped—perhaps they will have a hard time answering that—but 
they are willing to drop the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that I believe that when a person has no work, 
that person is almost handicapped.  When a man has no work and 
has a wife and children to feed and the children go to school on 
an empty stomach, he is almost handicapped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to maintain the programs and for the government 
to gain back some credibility through them.  If the government 
has hidden nothing regarding the programs, it should undertake a 
public inquiry, it should put it out on the table.  For the past 
five or six weeks this House has been held hostage because of 
government credibility in the programs it has mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform members would be happy to see the government get out 
of pension, health and income security programs.  Now the 
Liberals are helping the Reformers with their agenda of reducing 
the role of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I just said, this House has been paralyzed for five weeks 
because of the scandal at Human Resources Development Canada. 
What is clear is that, in spite of the efforts of all the 
opposition parties to shed light on what happened, we have no 
answers to fundamental issues surrounding the management of HRDC 
grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must immediately set up an independent public commission of 
inquiry to get non partisan and legitimate answers. Canadian 
taxpayers' money was mismanaged and there are clear indications 
that it was used for political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal, for instance, for a company in the region of 
Mataquac, to receive about $16,000 and then, during the same 
month, to give the Liberals over $7,900, just before an election 
campaign. This is not normal. We have to look into this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal for the Prime Minister of Canada to sell his 
share of a business to a friend who does not even have the money 
to pay him and then, all of sudden, for that friend to receive a 
grant from the government. When will Canadians wake up, once and 
for all, indicate in the polls that their support for the 
Liberals is much less than 60% or 50%, and tell the Liberals 
that the programs are being mismanaged by the Prime Minister? 
This is the same person who authorized the cuts to employment 
insurance. My riding of Acadie—Bathurst loses over $65 million a 
year because of these cuts to EI benefits, and people are 
suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take an example. The riding of Vancouver East, my 
colleague's riding, could not even qualify for the transitional 
jobs fund, since the unemployment rate there is over 13%. 
Before she was elected as an NDP member, her predecessor, the 
incumbent before 1997, was entitled to the benefits of the 
transitional jobs fund. Is this not an issue that should be 
looked into?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I was at the meeting of the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities.  I asked the question:  When was the transitional 
job fund criterion changed to allow projects in regions with 
unemployment rates of 8% when there are other regions with 
higher rates of unemployment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer was that it was changed in June 1998.  How was it 
that the Liberal member for Vancouver East received money 
before 1997? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sick and tired of these lies that are offered up day 
after day.  We want a public inquiry to lay the matter to rest 
once and for all and to save our programs.  That is why the NDP 
will be voting in favour of this motion and I congratulate the 
Bloc Quebecois on moving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister afraid of the truth?  Does it make any 
sense that an American company such as Wal-Mart, which is making 
billions and which has just set up a warehouse in Canada and 
does not need money, should receive $500,000 from the 
government, when this same government and the Prime Minister are 
saying that Atlantic Canadians abused the EI system and that 
that is why benefits had to be cut? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of thing looks bad.  It is the sort of thing that is 
going to lose us programs.  This is why it is very important 
that this commission of inquiry be created, so that some light 
can be shed and so that the House can be freed up to deal with 
other problems facing Canadians, such as health, which is the 
number one problem in this country, and the cutbacks in our 
health care programs.  Right now, the NDP is the only party in 
the House that has risen every day and asked questions on health 
since the budget was brought down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we did not have this problem at HRDC, maybe the opposition 
parties could do their job and take their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister of Canada has nothing to fear from 
whatever was done in Shawinigan, then he should allow the 
setting up of a public commission of inquiry that could finally 
shed some light on this scandal and on the lack of credibility 
of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in our ridings tell us “This does not make sense. These 
things have to stop. It is high time this matter was cleared up 
once and for all. We want you to be able to work on other 
issues, such as our health care system, which we are in the 
process of losing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is very important, and I will repeat it again. They 
say sometimes you have to repeat something 27 times before it 
gets into people's heads. 
The transitional jobs fund was created only and specifically 
because of EI cuts. Today, the Reform Party would like that 
program eliminated. The only reason for that is that they do not 
have any member in our part of the country. In winter, in the 
Acadian peninsula, the unemployment rate, can reach 40%, because 
the fishing industry is closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am asking the House to support the motion brought 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois for the creation of a public 
commission of inquiry to enlighten parliament and all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I consider myself very lucky that I happened to walk by 
the House and I overheard the comments made by my colleague, the 
member for Acadie—Bathurst, who is also the whip for the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind him that for several years the city of 
Cornwall, which is the biggest city in my riding, had a 
unemployment rate much higher than the national average. However, 
in the last two years, thanks to the programs provided by Human 
Resources Development Canada, we have been so successful that we 
have managed to reduce the unemployment rate by 8%. The 
unemployment rate is now at 10% in the largest city in my riding, 
Cornwall, Ontario. Members opposite referred to one company in 
particular, which is Wal-Mart.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not apologize today no more than I did yesterday. I can 
assure the House that if I had the opportunity I would do the 
same thing all over again. In partnership with Human Resources 
Development Canada which made an important contribution of 
$500,000, and the city of Cornwall, we made an agreement with a 
developer, Metrus Properties, which turned the site into a 
commercial distribution centre for a company known as Supply 
Chain Management. This company, and I say it openly and with 
pride, has one customer, Wal-Mart. Today this distribution centre 
in Cornwall has around 250 workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will say “But, sir, would you have us believe that if 
HRDC had not made this $500,000 investment, the company would not 
have settled in Cornwall?” I cannot say for sure, but before, 
when we did not have HRDC funding, we were never as successful as 
we are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even venture to say that without this significant 
investment from HRDC, this would not be such a success story. 
What I am saying is what is important is not so much who gets the 
money as who gets the job done and creates employment. What my 
colleague from Acadie—Bathurst wants for his constituents and 
every Canadian is jobs. This is a case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst is whether 
he agrees that this outcome shows the importance of this program 
which made it possible to bring 300 jobs to our area, plus all 
the indirect ones? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, this might give me the 
opportunity to make another speech instead of answering a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to thank my hon. colleague, the chief government 
whip, who talked in his speech about Wal-Mart and another 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that these transitional jobs fund programs were 
meant to help companies which lacked the necessary cashflow to 
create jobs, not to induce a company to settle in one riding 
rather than another. When Wal-Mart settled in Canada, it was 
going to have stock distribution centers whether we liked it or 
not. Automatically it did not really need this grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to take anything away from my hon. colleague. He 
got it and I am happy for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> It could have gone to Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> The hon. member says the company could have 
gone to Toronto. It does not matter, that is Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, each and every day the Minister of Human Resources 
Development stands in the House and says “It does not matter 
where jobs are created in Canada. It does not make any difference 
if these jobs are created in Toronto, in Montreal, or in 
Acadie—Bathurst. What is important is that we are creating 
jobs”. That is what she said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wants to change her tune and say that we are 
going to help the regions in need, such as the Acadie—Bathurst 
region where our people are in a big black hole, with no 
employment insurance, no social assistance and no jobs, because 
that is where the money should go, I will stand up and I will 
applaud her and I will tell her that she is doing the right 
thing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague the member for Acadie—Bathurst for his 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just come from the HRD committee. The former deputy 
minister of HRDC was before the committee for a couple of hours. 
I managed to get in a couple of questions before coming to speak 
in the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220
<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing really struck me. Obviously committees are important 
for questions and answers and trying to uncover what happened at 
HRDC.  But if anybody in the House or in the public believes that 
we will get to the truth of what happened at HRDC in terms of the 
internal audit and the findings that have come out of that and 
what happens at this point, they are badly mistaken.  It is a 
very limited format.  The deputy minister was there for a couple 
of hours.  A member gets one or two questions.  The limits of 
that format really prescribe that we will not get at the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to say that because the Bloc Quebecois motion before us 
today calls for an independent public inquiry.  As my colleague 
from Acadie—Bathurst has said, we in the NDP wholeheartedly 
support the motion.  We have been calling for an independent 
public inquiry from day one, for the last six weeks when the 
issue first surfaced in the House.  We believe that if the 
Canadian public is really to understand what has happened at HRDC 
and in fact to understand how government works and how these 
decisions are made, it will take an independent public inquiry to 
do that job, with the resources and scope, and unfettered by the 
rules of the committee and even what happens here in the House. 
We support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another very important reason for holding a public 
inquiry.  We in the NDP philosophically have always strongly 
supported job development programs.  We support the role of the 
government in intervening in the marketplace and trying to ensure 
that we bring about a greater equality in our society. The 
marketplace is the greatest instrument of inequality in the 
country.  We believe very strongly that the purpose and role of 
government among other things is to provide an intervention and 
to use public funds and to say that job development is a 
legitimate use of public funds.  We believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in the last six weeks in the House has 
undermined that. If there is any question about that, just look 
at the Reform Party opposition day motion yesterday.  What have 
Reformers been doing?  They have been asking questions every day 
in the House about the HRDC scandal.  They have chosen the path 
basically to undermine these programs and now even say that they 
want to divert moneys from other programs in the last federal 
budget and put them back into the Canada health and social 
transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very different view and perspective on the issue.  We 
want to see public programs strengthened.  We want to see these 
public programs have credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have played right into the hands of the Reform 
Party.  Because of this scandal, because they have refused to 
come clean, they have played right into the hands of the Reform 
Party.  Now there is a great public cynicism about any 
expenditure of public funds.  Our job is to restore confidence. 
One way to do that is through a public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would a public inquiry do?  Two key issues need to be 
looked at and as I said earlier, they will not be addressed in 
any parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is administration.  There is no question that the 
internal audit uncovered very sloppy practices.  Paperwork was 
not done. Follow up was not done.  Accounting was not done. There 
are the administrative issues in terms of what happens when the 
public service is cut back, what happens when people are thrown 
out of work and the work is loaded on to the remaining public 
servants.  I think it was 5,000 people who were thrown out of 
their jobs at HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues in terms of the administration of the department, the 
accountability, the hierarchy, how those decisions were made are 
very important to get at because my guess is, and I think 
everybody in the House would agree, that what has happened at 
HRDC is probably a reflection of what goes on in other 
departments.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a massive department.  It is the single 
largest federal government department. If those problems were 
uncovered in a random internal audit, what else is there that 
needs to be dealt with and brought into line? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be the first major issue in terms of a public 
inquiry.  It must look at the administrative questions in terms 
of this huge department that effected cutbacks and has sloppy 
administration and what needs to be done there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue and the reason for our support of the motion is 
to get at something that is a lot more difficult to examine. It 
has to be done very carefully and with a sense of good faith and 
genuine process.  It is to look at the relationship of a 
parliament, a governing party and the bureaucracy. That is the 
political nature of the grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all elected representatives.  We are political creatures. 
I have been involved in politics for 25 years.  I understand 
politics.  I know we are political people. We make political 
decisions.  However something that happened at HRDC goes beyond 
that.  I believe that billions of dollars were being used for a 
partisan political purpose. To me that goes beyond the line. The 
questions that have been raised in the House day after day have 
not been answered. That is another reason an independent public 
inquiry is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP want to know exactly what are the rules.  I asked 
Mr. Cappe that a few minutes ago in the committee.  The knowledge 
I have is that there is a huge variation in terms of how members 
of parliament were involved in these decisions.  In some areas, 
and I would suggest Liberal dominated areas, the involvement of 
the members was massive and it was very politicized.  In other 
areas it was much more of a staffing decision about the 
transitional jobs fund or other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one member of parliament I want to know that there are fair 
rules.  I want to know that my riding or my colleague's riding of 
Winnipeg Centre are not being treated differently from a 
government member's riding because we are in opposition. It 
scares the hell out of me when we see what is coming out of the 
audit and the questions that have come up.  We see the 
contradictions, the double standards, the different rules 
depending on where people are from and who they are. That is 
scandalous.  We have got to get to the bottom of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members represent ridings that have very high unemployment, 
yet they did not qualify for transitional jobs funds.  Why?  We 
were told that the unemployment rate was not high enough, because 
the region we are part of, such as Vancouver or Winnipeg, did not 
have high enough unemployment.  We said fine, if that was the 
rule we could live by that.  Then we found out that in other 
areas exceptions were made. Fuzzy little pockets were created and 
somehow lots of money slipped into areas with much lower 
unemployment. Warning bells went off in my head when I heard 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want there to be clear rules. We want there to be an end to 
the politicization.  We also want to get at some questions of 
where public funds should go.  I heard the government member in 
response to my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst say that it is not 
a matter of who gets the money, it is the jobs that are created. 
I say that it is a matter of who gets the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have big questions about why when we look at the 100 most 
profitable corporations in Canada 49 of them including the five 
major banks get public funds.  Who is handing out what and to 
whom?  That is the question.  Why would we support a program that 
puts other businesses out of work? If some guy wants to create 
the sock company of the world and it turns out that he is putting 
every other poor little business person around him out of 
business, is that a good expenditure of public funds?  I do not 
think so. There are some very major questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we represent the Canadian public. 
Canadians have a right to feel a level of confidence in the 
expenditure of their funds.  It is our duty to be accountable in 
the House for those funds. It is the government's duty to be 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that only if there is an independent public inquiry 
will the public's confidence be restored in terms of HRDC and 
other departments and then we can move on.  We support the 
motion.  We call on the government to not let politics get in the 
way of this.  Do the right thing and support an independent 
public inquiry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
reason I rise to ask a question of my colleague from Vancouver 
East is that I want to go on record, and I want her to go on 
record, with the question that I will raise with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the time those pockets of unemployment were in Vancouver 
East, we know that the Liberal who was in Vancouver East before 
1997 received money.  We just heard our colleague say that she 
was not told that the riding could get money if it had pockets of 
unemployment that were even higher than its own region.  We heard 
the minister say it existed for a period of time.  I raised a 
question in the committee of human resources last week and was 
told it started in June 1998 and all MPs were advised of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is clear and I want the hon. member to answer.  Was 
she advised that if her region had pockets of unemployment it 
could apply for a grant from the government to help the workers 
of Vancouver East where there is a high level of unemployment?  I 
think this is important.  If the answer is that she was not told, 
then I would suggest that that is why we need this inquiry to 
clear the air once and for all to save our programs for Canadians 
who need it badly and to be able to help people in regions where 
there is high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for the question because it is a question that is very 
specific.  It does address one of the big issues that we have had 
with this whole process in terms of how information is provided 
to members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many new members, when I was elected in 1997 the first 
thing I tried to do was make myself familiar with what was 
available in terms of government programs and support because we 
get people coming to us all the time and the first thing they 
want to know is what federal funds they can access.  I think all 
of us make it our business to try to find out about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that I have a good working relationship with the 
local HRDC office and staff.  It is important that I know what 
they are doing, that we know what the priorities of the riding 
are and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I heard about the transitional jobs fund that I 
actually checked to find out whether or not we qualified.  The 
information was that Vancouver East did not qualify because of 
these regions.  Then we heard about pockets that exist.  The 
issue of how those rules were made and how that was communicated 
is a mystery to me in terms of one member of parliament 
absolutely not being aware that certain areas could qualify under 
different kinds of rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I think it begs the question about who makes the 
decisions, how are those decisions followed through and whether 
or not we have rules being made after the fact in order to cover 
up where those disbursements were made.  This is what we want to 
get clear.  We want to have fair rules for everybody.  We want 
the rules to be transparent.  We want the rules to be clear so 
that we can say to the government that public confidence can be 
restored in the way these programs work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
appreciated the remarks by my colleague from Vancouver East. I 
would like to draw her attention to the internal audit report, 
which indicated very clearly the carelessness this government 
has shown in managing the transitional jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the internal audit report shows that there was no 
indication of supervision in 87% of the projects, no indication 
of financial control in 80% of them and no indication that the 
expected results were obtained in 75% of them, there is a 
problem. 
I could go on, because the internal audit report speaks volumes 
on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member for Vancouver East is very simple: In 
light of these conclusions, does the internal audit report not 
indicate more than ever that an independent public commission of 
inquiry has to be set up right away?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from my hon. colleague.  Just to reiterate and affirm, we in the 
NDP see two basic problems.  One of the reasons we need to have a 
public inquiry is because of the serious administrative problems 
that were uncovered by the audit, such as the lack of 
follow-through, applications not being filled out adequately, 
lack of monitoring and so on.  The results of the internal audit 
make it abundantly clear that the implications for the government 
as a whole are enormous.  If this is happening in HRDC, where 
else is this taking place?  For that very reason alone, an 
independent public inquiry is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also stress that the political nature of the decision 
making is something that is very serious.  It is more difficult 
to get at but it also needs to be part of that inquiry.  We 
support the motion on that basis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to rise today on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to take part in this very important debate. 
Canadians have many questions about what went on at Human 
Resources Development Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly a pleasure to enter into the debate today 
because we still have many questions that are unanswered. The 
government has tried to downplay what has happened in HRDC. Not 
too long ago the Prime Minister got up in the House and said that 
it was only 250 some odd dollars.  I said what did we do? Was 
that a mistake?  Obviously, on our part, it was not. Something 
went terribly wrong in HRDC and something went terribly wrong 
with the administration of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it all started about six or seven weeks ago, this was 
supposed to go away really quickly.  This was supposed to be 
buried underneath the carpet.  It would take a couple of days and 
we would not hear any more questions on HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department first started auditing the grants and 
contributions programs in 1999 and it came up with a report in 
January 2000.  We certainly were not aware that there was an 
audit going on.  It did well in keeping us in the dark.  When the 
department released it, as critic for HRDC for my party, I called 
for a copy of the audit so I could go over it and review what had 
gone on with HRDC and the grants and contributions programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I called for my copy, I received it.  Maybe 10 minutes 
later I received a call from HRDC to tell me that it had sent me 
the wrong cover sheet and if I would be so kind to destroy the 
cover sheet, it would send me a new one.  La-di-da, I still have 
the original cover sheet on my desk today.  I did not destroy it. 
Is that not a shame?  I received the second cover sheet.  I do 
not want to use the sheets as a prop, so I will not put up the 
cover sheets.  When I look at the both of them, the original one 
is dated October 5, 1999 and is signed off by the director, 
Gilles Duclos, and James Martin.  On the other one, there are the 
names of the people who signed off but no date. The date has been 
deleted. This is a major cover-up.  This is the biggest scandal 
in Canadian history.  It is scandalous to try to keep Canadians 
in the dark on the goings on in a government department, a 
department which is owned by Canadians.  This is Canadians' 
parliament.  They have a right to know the truth.  From the very 
beginning everything that has gone on has been tainted.  The 
government has tried to cover up important information from the 
Canadian taxpayer.

We have been working hard to try to get to the truth.  We even 
asked for the audits for 1991 and 1994. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked for a copy of the 1991 audit, an audit conducted 
nine years ago, as well as the 1994 audit. That was three weeks 
ago. Why have we not received anything yet? Let me tell you why.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Canada is a bilingual country. I think we all 
agree on that. 
The reason why copies of the audits were not distributed to the 
opposition parties is that the 1991 and 1994 documents have not 
been translated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> It took nine years to translate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> They had not been translated into French. It 
is absolutely incredible. Last week, a senior official, whom we 
have seen on several occasions on TV since the scandal broke 
out, told us it was unfortunate they had not been translated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year 2000, in this new millenium, in a democratic and 
bilingual country, it is not unfortunate, it is unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, trying to 
get some money from the government to create jobs in your riding. 
Forget the application, it is not needed.  Many files that were 
opened did not even have an application.  That is terrible.  As a 
matter of fact some of the files were empty.  I am talking about 
billions of dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Grandstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>—they will say grandstanding because the 
government thinks that health care is secondary for Canada. 
Whatever the provinces say does not matter to the government. It 
is because of this type of attitude that we have such a problem 
in Canada.

care, and guess what?  The Liberal government in Ottawa turned a 
blind eye and closed its ears.  It is absolutely unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Baloney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  In my home province of New Brunswick I 
have had the pleasure of meeting with the minister of health. The 
member says baloney.  The minister of health certainly does 
not say baloney.  The minister of health from the province of New 
Brunswick said that what the Minister of Finance budgeted in his 
budget for health care represented $20 million for New Brunswick. 
He has been reading the papers quite well.  It represents three 
days of hospital care for New Brunswick.  Will that fix the 
problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At HRDC in Ottawa they are throwing money out the window when 
people in Canada, sick people, the most vulnerable people, need 
proper health care.  The government would rather throw money out 
the window, not discipline people for what they have done, and 
turn a blind eye to health care.  That is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all hear about the privatization of health care.  The Liberal 
government is forcing the privatization of health care because of 
its lack of investment in it.  It is even forcing people to go to 
other countries for care. It is terrible.  All this time at HRDC 
we see mismanagement, lack of transparency and lack of 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly are Canadian taxpayers looking for today?  Canadian 
taxpayers are looking for honesty.  Canadian taxpayers are 
looking for transparency.  Canadian taxpayers are looking for the 
truth.  We have been trying very hard to get the truth for 
Canadian taxpayers but it has not been forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the Prime Minister flip-flopping in the House of 
Commons.  We have had the minister of HRDC stating to the House 
and to Canadian taxpayers through the House that she knew nothing 
about the goings on in grants and contributions before October 
15. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we believe this? It does not make any sense that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development would be unaware of what 
was going on in her own department. I find this absolutely 
incredible. We are talking about the management of programs, the 
management of taxpayers' money, billions of dollars worth of it, 
and the minister in charge does not know what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have every right to be upset here in the House. It does not 
make any sense. Nobody knows what is going on, and even the 
minister knows nothing at all. The Liberals are more concerned 
about what is happening within their party. 
On the one hand, the finance minister is trying to become the 
leader of the party, and, on the other hand, the Prime Minister 
is trying to hang on to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want changes, and I can tell them that we are going to 
keep them informed, we will tell them what is going on in 
Ottawa. And what is going on here is not nice.

have a big problem, because we do not cultivate relationships 
any more. Nowadays, we have to contend with the arrogance of a 
government that fails to understand how the provinces feel, and 
does not listen to them. 
By not paying attention to what is going on, the government is 
putting our federation—ours, yours and that of our children—in 
jeopardy.  What we are trying to do here is to protect that 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just come from the Standing Committee on Human Resources, 
whose proceedings were televised today.  We heard the testimony 
of Mel Cappe.  I had the opportunity to ask him questions.  I am 
persistent in my questions, and I asked him if he was aware of 
the study.  He said, as everyone on the government side has 
said, that he was not.  That is the usual thing we hear from the 
government: they do not know, they are not aware of what is 
being done with public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have they done right from the start?  They have changed 
nothing since they came to power in 1993. 
The free trade agreement and the GST were brought in by the 
Conservative government.  The free trade agreement generates 
$280 billion, not $80 billion, and the GST $24 billion yearly. 
What are the Liberals up to?  They do not know what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Cappe said he did not know.  I asked him if it was not his 
duty to be informed.  His response was no.  It was not his duty 
to know what was going on.  “It is the duty of the minister and 
deputy minister”, he said.  If the blues are checked, it will be 
seen that he said “It is the duty of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and Deputy Minister Claire Morris to know 
what is going on”.  They were not aware either.  That is what we 
were told, here in the House.  So hon. members can well imagine 
the trouble the opposition parties have to find out the truth.

the HRDC scandal will stick.  It will not go away.  I have been 
doing interviews across the land, across this great country, and 
some government members across the way must be very 
uncomfortable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to see when the Prime Minister will call the next 
election.  I am very anxious to campaign and tell Canadians the 
truth of what has been going on here.  The hard earned money of 
Canadians has been ripped off.  Canadians pay heavy taxes. 
Canadians work hard for their money.  Canadians want their money 
to be well invested.  Their money has not been well invested. 
Their money has been mismanaged.  It is a lot of money.

Canada tell us that they do not have enough.  Job creation has 
not been going on in the government.  We have noticed that the

been doing.

the way I get the feeling that this place is awash in crocodile 
tears. The hon. member sounds to me a bit frustrated.  It is 
perhaps because of his recent experience a few minutes ago at the 
committee where Mr. Cappe appeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the hon. member question Mr. Cappe.  I can assure 
the House that he did not lay a glove on Cappe.  He did not touch 
Cappe.  Mr. Cappe performed extremely well.  Perhaps it was 
because the hon. member did not know how to ask questions, or 
perhaps it was because the hon. member really was not interested 
in extracting information from the deputy minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  This is comments and questions. 
Opposition members have not been interested in the whole exercise 
that has been going on for more than eight weeks. They talk about 
wanting to get to the bottom of this issue, as we do.  The 
minister has said on a number of occasions that they have a 
management problem.  She wants to get to the bottom of it but do 
opposition members, as reflected in the motion today?  Does one 
really think opposition members are interested in getting to the 
bottom?  No. They are interested in hurling mud.  The more mud 
they can throw, the better for them.  They really think that 
Canadian voters will fall for it.  They will not fall for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to comment.  This is 
the hon. member who called the minister of health baloney a while 
ago, that what he thought was not realistic.  I am glad the hon. 
member was at committee.  It is the first time that I have seen 
him there.  I have never seen him there before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  I am not a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  That is probably why.  I have the 
questions I asked of Mr. Cappe on what happened to over $1 
billion of taxpayer money.  Opposition members questioning top 
civil servants on what went on is very important.

the truth, because we do not have the truth.  We are concerned

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
January I spent some time in New Brunswick, more specifically 
in Fredericton. I heard a lot of good things about the member 
for Madawaska—Restigouche, in particular in Fredericton's <I>Daily 
Gleaner</I>. He has a very good reputation in New Brunswick. I must 
admit that I have discovered this in his transparent and 
convincing speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, happily or unhappily, New Brunswick was represented 
by Doug Young, who was minister of human resources development. 
Fortunately for all Canadians, they taught him the lesson of his 
life by showing him the way out. I congratulate the NDP member 
for Acadie—Bathurst who made him bite the dust. I hope we will 
not have the unpleasant surprise of seeing this man back in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to HRDC, we are witnessing the greatest scandal in 
modern times in the House of Commons. The party across the way 
probably has mismanaged between $1 billion and $3 billion. The 
Prime Minister mentioned 37 cases. There are now 19 files under 
investigation by the RCMP. Out of some 495 or 500 files picked 
at random, 37 were fraught with problems. Today, 19 cases are 
under investigation by the RCMP. If we examined all files 
thoroughly, the amount would probably be much higher than $1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, we have an opportunity to defeat the government during 
tonight's vote. It appears from discussions we had this morning 
that all opposition parties are going to vote in favour of an 
inquiry into HRDC. 
I do not expect the Liberals to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche 
if he would be ready to defeat the government so that we could 
all look forward to sound management on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague 
for the excellent comments and praise he has given me. I hope he 
enjoyed his time in New Brunswick, one of the most beautiful 
provinces in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to the question, yes, together we can bring down the 
government, and that is what we must do.  We remember very well 
that the Prime Minister said in the House “It is only $251”. 
The member for Frontenac—Mégantic is absolutely right.  The Prime 
Minister said $251, some three weeks ago, a month ago, and today 
we are up to 19 police investigations.  Yes we will vote 
together and hope that we will bring down the government.

considerable interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a question to him.  In my opinion, in 
connection with the problems at the Department of Human 
Resources Development, and in the context of this motion, the 
Access to Information Act is a useful tool in getting at the 
truth in government management.  I wonder whether my colleague 
would support an update of this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he support a bill to modernize the Access to Information 
Act in the context of this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised, because only rarely 
do we get a good question from the members on the government 
side.  I would like to congratulate my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many in this House know, it is difficult to obtain 
information under this law.  Often, we can wait months, or even 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We rarely get all we asked for.  So it is difficult for us as 
parliamentarians, representatives of the people of Canada, to 
guarantee transparency.  It would be an idea for all of us in 
the House of Commons to consider such a measure in order to give 
Canadians more transparency in the management of various 
programs and in the management of funds in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would indeed be pleased to review this law at some point.  If 
the member opposite would care to sit down with me to discuss 
the matter, I would be pleased.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois has moved today for debate a motion that refers 
directly to the scandal at the Department of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion recommends: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the creation of an independent public commission of inquiry, 
whose members will be appointed by the House, and whose mandate 
will be to inquire into all practices of that Department and to 
report to the House by September 19, 2000. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several reasons have led the Bloc to move this motion for a vote 
in the House at the end of the day, among others: the lack of 
transparency of the government, which refuses day after day to 
answer straight out questions by the opposition; the 
government's cover-up of a fiasco that is still going on in the 
Department of Human Resources Development; the fact that 
Liberals are mixing up government and party and are using public 
funds for partisan purposes; the too numerous projects under 
investigation by the RCPM or the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the minister received a very bad legacy from her 
predecessor. Consequently, since she became aware of the huge 
fiscal abyss her department is in, she tried to hide 
information, problem cases, patronage cases and criminal 
investigations that have been piling up since the scandal broke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister—or one of her colleagues who answers for her, 
as the Minister of Veteran Affairs did yesterday—does no longer 
know what to say, we hear as an answer that the Quebec 
government had recommended and signed these projects. Very well. 
But this information has absolutely nothing to do with the 
problem raised by the opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though Minister Harel put her signature on all the 
projects, neither she nor her department were responsible for 
the management of the funds. It was HRDC and not Emploi Québec 
that managed the funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade and the Prime Minister, who 
talked about it in an televised interview last weekend, are 
really in no position to ridicule the work of Minister Lemieux 
and Emploi Québec. The hon. member for Papineau—Saint-Denis should 
remember that it is easier to look at the speck of dust in a 
neighbour's eye than at the plank in one's own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear: Minister Harel could certainly not recommend 
projects that received grants from the minister of HRDC even 
before any application was filed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The serious carelessness in the management of the program made 
fraud, mishandling of funds, political interference and 
patronage possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the minister imagine for one moment that we believe 
her? What happened to her honesty, her integrity, her good 
conscience, her sense of ethics and the oath she swore when she 
assumed responsibility for the department last August? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example that illustrates this whole mess 
perfectly, the case of Placeteco. Listen carefully, you will be 
enlightened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Placeteco is a manufacturer of plastic casts. In 1996-97, 
Aérospatiale Globax, the parent corporation of Placeteco, 
applied for a grant from the transitional jobs fund. HRDC 
approved a $2 million grant, and a first payment of $400,000 was 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Placeteco, owned by Mr. Giguère, a friend of the Prime Minister, 
sought protection from its creditors under the Bankruptcy Act. 
The balance of the grant, $1.6 million, was placed in two trust 
accounts, one for Placeteco, and the other one for Technipaint, 
another subsidiary of Aérospatiale Globax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Placeteco knew that it would eventually get a $1.2 million 
grant, but it kept this information from its creditors, in 
violation of the Bankruptcy Act. 
Through underhanded schemes—this is a bit harsh, but I cannot 
find any other way to describe the conduct of the Prime 
Minister's cronies—HRDC put $1.2 million in trust accounts while 
the situation of Placeteco was being sorted out, in violation of 
Treasury Board guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lawyer, Gilles Champagne, was hired as a trustee for HRDC. 
Ironically, Gilles Champagne is also the lawyer of Claude 
Gauthier, another friend of the Prime Minister. Claude Gauthier 
would eventually buy Placeteco for a cool $1 and promise to 
invest $200,000 in the company. After that, Claude Gauthier 
received a $1.2 million grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members must not forget that grants under this program are to be 
used to create jobs. What did Mr. Gauthier do with his $1 
million? He paid off a loan at the National Bank, Placeteco's 
main creditor. 
That kind of behaviour is called misappropriation of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the use of trusts is against the rules of Treasury Board, 
Technipaint had to submit a new application for a grant that was 
finally awarded to it. As for Placeteco, it did not have to make 
a new application, it received a grant of $1.2 million and its 
directors refused to be held accountable to HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1993 and 1997, Claude Gauthier and his various companies 
donated a total of $48,673 to the Liberal Party of Canada. Is it 
any wonder that Placeteco was given preferential treatment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claude Gauthier is also the owner of Continental Paving, the 
company that got the subcontract for paving the RCMP road leading 
to the Prime Minister's cottage, whereas the initial contract had 
been awarded without tenders to Rénald Cloutier, a building 
contractor who had also built the Prime Minister's cottage in the 
area.

the golf course he bought from the Prime Minister, but that would 
simply add another scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be naive. The Prime Minister prides himself on being 
a good member of parliament. I am not in a position to assess 
that statement, therefore I cannot confirm nor invalidate it. It 
will be incumbent on the voters to do it in the next general 
elections, if he succeeds in maintaining himself at the helm of 
the party up till then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, with the employment insurance reform and the 
billions in surpluses pocketed by the government, and in light of 
what happened at HRDC with the management of the job creation 
program, which is funded with savings made on the backs of the 
unemployed and the disadvantaged, one is justified in decrying 
this a unfair, indecent behaviour on the part of this government, 
which cloaks itself in its Caesar-like arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job creation program is a good program when it is 
implemented in accordance with the existing rules. It is a good 
program when it is available to eligible ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is a bad program when the funds are squandered left 
and right, when these funds are used to make the Prime Minister's 
friends or the Liberal government's friends richer, when they are 
used to unduly favour Liberal ridings that do not meet basic 
criteria, when these funds are set aside for some at the expense 
of distributive justice, when they are mismanaged with no serious 
monitoring, and when grants are given without any application 
having been submitted to the department. The program must be 
reviewed, but it is definitely not with a six point plan from the 
minister that patronage, corruption and major violations of 
ethics, justice, honesty and integrity will be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the minister will not have the courage to face these 
problems, she will not be able to recognize them, let alone deal 
with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wants to do her job, if she wants to respect her 
oath and restore confidence in her department, she has no choice 
but to order an independent public inquiry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the member for Rimouski—Mitis for explaining so clearly 
the scandal that took place in the riding of Saint-Maurice, the 
riding of the Prime Minister who is there, across the way, with 
his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As she so rightly said, this government must at least order an 
independent inquiry. According to observers, this scandal might 
involve an amount of up to $3 billion. This is money that has 
allegedly been handed out here and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Rimouski—Mitis if, for the 
benefit of all members of the House, she could explain just as 
clearly what happened in the riding of Rosemont, a poor riding in 
Montreal's east end, where a $165,000 grant was supposed to go 
before it drifted further east, ending up in the Prime Minister's 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the member for Rimouski—Mitis to give us a clear 
and simple explanation, like she just did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Frontenac—Mégantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Rosemont, who is scheduled to speak 
immediately following me, is probably in a better position to 
answer that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will take this opportunity to say that, in the case 
mentioned by the member, we know that a $165,000 grant that was 
supposed to go to Rosemont was transferred to Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we started asking questions in the House, the minister 
immediately launched an investigation. Another investigation by 
someone from Toronto, whom she probably knew very well. Perhaps 
it was a friend of the government, who knows? In any event, a 
week later, this person asked that the matter be referred to the 
RCMP. Now the Rosemont affair is in the hands of the RCMP.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked other questions concerning Mr. Fugère, the Prime 
Minister said that, as soon as he became aware of the situation, 
as soon as his office became aware of it, he referred the matter 
to the RCMP and that an investigation was underway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is the following: Why was Placeteco not under 
investigation? Or why was Placeteco put under investigation last 
Friday, if departmental officials could not give us an answer? 
Since the minister knows nothing about what is going on in her 
department, she did not know that it was under investigation. She 
stopped the investigation so that, at 5.30 p.m., we could be told 
that there was no investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be an independent inquiry because we no longer 
trust any internal investigation this government may conduct. We 
trust even less calling on the RCMP, which is a way of covering 
up all the dirty dealings that are going on in that department.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member opposite and 
I caught a reference to Toronto.  She seemed to say it in a 
manner that reflected in a way that I thought was maybe 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why Mr. Lucien Bouchard, when it came to health care 
money, put all kinds of dollars—I think it was upward of $1 
billion—into a Toronto bank.  While Quebecers were calling for 
good solid health care, Mr. Bouchard had money, close to $1 
billion worth, in some Toronto bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always have to be careful when we get into these kinds of 
little tugs and pulls because it really is quite duplicitous for 
the hon. member to say what she did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that the auditor general, who is an 
official and an officer of the House, will look at this whole 
issue and report back in the fall of this year.  As vice-chairman 
of the public accounts committee, I worked with Denis Desautels 
and I know he will do a very thorough job when it comes to 
looking at this whole issue.   He will investigate it in a very 
meaningful way.  The HRDC committee is also doing it, as is the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member is why will she not protect the 
interests of Quebecers?  Why will she not stand in her place 
today and say that the money that the human resources development 
minister has earmarked for the poor, for the disabled and for the 
students is money well spent in Quebec and in all parts of 
Canada? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> In all fairness, Mr. Speaker, I believe 
you must give me the time to answer and I will ask for unanimous 
consent to have at least two minutes to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two years, the auditor general's office has 
conducted several audits of the management of the grant and 
contribution programs in various federal departments and 
agencies and found persistent flaws. “Persistent” is the term 
used by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should stop giving me this fancy footwork about the 
auditor general. It all depends on what the government will do 
with the auditor general's reports. He said himself “I could 
have shown a certain degree of annoyance with the management of 
the grant and contribution programs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the demagoguery shown by the member concerning the 
$841 million kept in Toronto, for his information—since he is 
apparently not aware of this—it is now $1 billion, because the 
finance minister is constantly hiding his surpluses in trust 
accounts. We will use the money kept in Toronto when we really 
need it. We did not need it because we had money in our coffers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I speak to the motion introduced by my party, 
which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the poor management 
seen at the Department of Human Resources Development, 
particularly in the award and use of grants for partisan 
purposes, and that it recommend the creation of an independent 
public commission of inquiry, whose members will be appointed by 
the House, and whose mandate will be to inquire into all 
practices of that Department and to report to the House by 
September 19, 2000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all the more pleased to speak to this motion today because 
of the horror story I am about to tell the House in the ten 
minutes allotted me.  It is a horror story because not only were 
lies told to the citizens I represent in the House, but because 
they were also told to yours truly, the member for Rosemont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the story of a numbered company, 3393062 
Canada Inc.  This company was formed on July 16, 1997.  At that 
time its headquarters were at Place Ville-Marie in Montreal. On 
August 4, 1997—a mere three weeks after the company was formed 
on July 16—it applied to Human Resources Development Canada for 
a grant under the transitional jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 21, 1997 HRDC officials faxed my office a copy of the 
project, which I am now holding, a 35-page proposal to create 106 
new jobs in my riding.  This $2,750,230 project was supposed to 
be located in Rosemont and to create 42 jobs in 1997 and 64 
additional jobs in 1998-99.  This business was supposed to be set 
up in my riding, specifically at 5800, rue Saint-Denis in 
Montreal, in what is known as Place de la mode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 27, when I recommended this project, I sincerely 
believed and thought I had the department's assurance that the 
jobs which were supposed to be created would be in my riding, 
that the jobs which were supposed to be created would serve the 
riding of Rosemont, one of the poorest ridings in Montreal, one 
of the ridings in the neighbourhood known as La Petite Patrie, 
which has one of the highest unemployment rates in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally supported the project and it was naturally 
recommended by the Government of Quebec.  In addition, on 
December 16 Human Resources Development Canada supported and 
approved the sum of $165,984, which was supposed to be used to 
create these 42 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except that on March 5, 1998, at the HRDC office in my riding in 
Montreal, we learned at a meeting with the promoter and president 
of the numbered company that was going to create 42 jobs that 
there was no longer any space available at 5800 Saint-Denis 
Street. It was therefore impossible to create jobs in the riding 
of Rosemont, it was impossible to create jobs in Montreal and it 
was also impossible to create jobs in the metropolitan Montreal 
area. The company had no choice but to move and create these 
jobs, not in Rosemont, as had been recommended by the member for 
Rosemont, but in the riding of Saint-Maurice, the Prime 
Minister's riding.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Goldenberg indicated to Human Resources Development Canada 
that there was no longer any office space available at 5800 
Saint-Denis Street. I personally phoned the promoter of that 
building and learned that 40,000 square feet are available at the 
address where that business was supposed to settle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did HRDC officials not bother to check things at the time? 
Instead, they looked the other way. The fact is they preferred to 
see these jobs created in the town of Saint-Élie-de-Caxton, in 
Saint-Maurice, in the Shawinigan area, rather than in a riding 
represented by a Bloc Quebecois member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is more to tell. On March 19, a few days after the 
March 5 meeting, we learned that the president of that company 
had submitted invoices for the purchase of machinery and the 
renting of space in a building called, guess what? Confections 
Saint-Élie. Where is that company located? In 
Saint-Élie-de-Caxton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is Confections Saint-Élie? If members would like information 
on that company, I invite them to read the election folder 
distributed on the eve of the Prime Minister's election campaign. 
The president of that company said “Our exports to the United 
States have doubled, which means we had to increase our staff 
quickly to meet the demand. The grant received with the help of 
Mr. Chrétien allowed us to do that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from the president of the company called Confections 
Saint-Élie. It was this company which found space for the company 
which was supposed to create jobs in Rosemont, which was supposed 
to create 106 jobs in my riding.  Furthermore, we have learned 
that the number of jobs created by this numbered company was 
five, not 42.  This is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more. We learned on March 19, less than one month 
later, that officials at Human Resources Development Canada 
nonetheless decided to give the $166,000 grant to the company 
knowing full well that only five jobs, not 42, had been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What became of the money?  We asked the Prime Minister and we 
asked the minister.  No response was forthcoming until February 
25, 2000 when the deputy minister responsible for human resources 
development in Quebec confirmed for me everything that the Bloc 
Quebecois had been saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was when the government and the minister decided to ask a 
Toronto firm to look into the matter.  That was when the 
minister was informed of the results, one week later.  On the 
19th, she had to quickly recommend a police investigation into 
what is now known as “Shawinigangate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are calling for today is for the minister to immediately 
make public the report by the Toronto firm into the Rosemont 
affair, in the interests of transparency and out of respect for 
my constituents, and for members of the House to vote in favour 
of the motion presented by the Bloc Quebecois today for an 
independent public commission of inquiry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of the House 
that, indeed, a public inquiry and study of grants and 
contributions by the Department of Human Resources Development is 
already ongoing at the level of an all-party committee, the House 
of Commons Standing Committee on Human Resources Development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee began its study of this subject matter because of 
a motion put forward by the opposition.  In fact, the member of 
parliament for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques at the committee moved a motion, which we adopted, that 
there be an interim report by the middle of April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a delay in the proceedings of the committee because of 
the votes that took place in the House as a consequence of the 
filibustering of the Bloc.  However, today the Clerk of the Privy 
Council appeared before the committee.  It was a televised 
hearing.  Speaking of transparency, an all-party committee of the 
House of Commons is doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring to the attention of Canadians that it was 
an internal audit of the government which unearthed the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of police investigations, let us not prejudge.  The 
investigations indicate that, indeed, our police force is 
determined to ensure the integrity of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that there is a motion before us which calls for 
an inquiry, and for the inquiry to report by September of 2000, 
many months later.  I ask the member, would he like a report on 
this issue by the middle of April, or would he like it much, much 
later for political reasons? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is good that the hon. 
member has referred to the committee meeting but it is clear, if 
I am not mistaken, that in all of the cases mentioned this 
morning by Human Resources Development Canada, we were unable to 
find evidence that there was any transparency within the 
committee's criteria.  We are calling for an independent public 
inquiry because the committee has its limitations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The witnesses that spoke this morning showed us that indeed the 
committee does have its limitations, and in our opinion the scope 
needs to be broadened in order for there to be an independent 
public commission of inquiry into the entire matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member opposite talk of process, in 
terms of inquiry and in terms of where this whole issue should be 
headed.  I want to remind him that an officer of the House of 
Commons, the auditor general, is looking at this whole process 
and will be reporting in the fall.  We have the committee 
process, as was alluded to by my hon. colleague from Winnipeg. 
Moreover, we have the minister's commitment that four times a 
year she will appear before the committee to discuss all of these 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear duplicitous comments from the Bloc opposite, it 
really is outrageous.  It almost implies that they are not in 
favour of these types of grants and contributions to Quebecers 
and to Canadians.  I would hope that is not the intent of the 
hon. member and his colleagues opposite.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
hon. member's question.  This morning he described the entire 
Human Resources Development Canada matter as nothing but myth 
and mythology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that the case I have just described 
in Rosemont, the direct transfer of a grant for the people of 
Rosemont into the riding of Saint-Maurice, was myth and 
mythology?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the February 15 report, the $165,000 grant was to 
be for the riding of Rosemont.  Instead, in response to 
unreasonable pressure, it went to the riding of the member's 
leader, the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe that the question we raised today is a serious 
matter, that our motion is a serious one.  We want an 
independent inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could you ask the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington, he who is 
so quick to speak and so quick to tell us that we are getting 
emotional over this matter, to stop yelling out in the House, to 
stop making fists, to stop saying that the matter can be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, while I am pleased to participate 
in this debate, I do not think that debating this question is a 
very productive use of House time.  The motion introduced by the 
member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques 
is not the best use of public resources and our time.  It will 
end up costing taxpayers far more than it is worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an ongoing barrage of questions on this issue for 
a sustained period of time.  The issue has been recycled time and 
time again, day after day, to no useful end.  Members of the Bloc 
have already shown how little they care for the time and effort 
that should be put into productive issues when they kept the 
House sitting, around the clock, for two days of voting on 
meaningless amendments to the clarity bill, a bill which members 
of every other party in the House supported.  Nevertheless, our 
friends opposite are entitled to bring issues like this.  That is 
one of the advantages of being part of the Canadian system.  For 
our part, we are willing to discuss the motion and to look at 
their concerns from a broader perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion suggests that the government does not take the 
management of public funds seriously.  I want to reassure the 
hon. member that the government takes the management of public 
funds very seriously.  I want to remind him that the government 
has made every effort possible to ensure responsible public 
sector financial management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after we took office the government undertook a 
comprehensive review of federal spending programs.  We showed our 
determination to ask the hard questions about the money the 
federal government was spending.  We made the tough decisions to 
cut back in some areas and to redirect funds to other uses when 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Program review was one of the government's toughest and most 
comprehensive programs.  It was one of many.  As a result, we 
have been successful.  We took a $42 billion deficit and turned 
it around for the benefit of all Canadians.  Members of the 
government acted decisively.  There is no doubt in my mind that 
the government and the Minister of Human Resources Development 
are acting decisively now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has already told the House about her six point plan 
to improve the management and administration of grants and 
contributions in her department.  It is a good plan and it is a 
solid plan.  It includes improved reviews of administrative 
procedures.  It has been reviewed by the auditor general and the 
Treasury Board, as well as accounting experts in the private 
sector.  The plan will work, but we must give it time to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no point in looking yet again at the management 
processes at HRDC.  We have done that and we have identified some 
areas that need to be fixed.  We are fixing them.  We should let 
the minister and her staff in the department get on with the 
business of implementing the action plan and serving the clients 
who need their help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second issue which the member opposite raised is a concern 
that HRDC funds are being used for political ends.  I am glad the 
member raised this issue because it gives us a chance to put some 
facts on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, politics is not the criteria by which we determine HRDC 
funding.  The money goes where it is most needed.  Indeed, a good 
portion of HRDC program funds have gone to the member's home 
province of Quebec.  That is because Quebec is a province with a 
large population and a comparatively high unemployment rate.  The 
people of that province need federal program support.  The 
unemployment rate in Quebec in 1997 was 11.4%.  In 1999 the rate 
was down to 9.3%.  We have a ways to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec received more transitional jobs funding and Canada jobs 
funding than any other province because the need was greater.  In 
the period from January 1995 to the present, the number of 
unemployed people in Quebec declined from 430,000 to 311,000; 
that is, 119,000 less unemployed people in five years with the 
help of HRDC programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt if the member opposite would seriously complain about 
receiving support from a federal program that helped to create so 
many jobs in Quebec.  Does he feel there has been political 
interference on party lines?  If so, he will be reassured to know 
that according to our figures Liberals represent 53% of the 
population and 52% of the ridings and we have received 52% of the 
HRDC funding.  The numbers speak for themselves.  When we look at 
the facts it is pretty hard to see any political favouritism. Let 
us take British Columbia as an example.  Most members opposite 
receive a huge part of the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the need to inquire into the way HRDC programs 
operate?  Again, probably that is a big waste of time and money. 
It is not only that, but it is a bit like reinventing the wheel. 
There are at least three other ongoing HRDC reviews at this time. 
First, the auditor general is conducting a government-wide audit 
of the department's grants and contributions and will report in 
the fall.  HRDC will be an active participant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the standing committee of the House on human resources 
development is holding hearings on these issues.  The former 
deputy minister, the deputy minister, the minister and the 
officials have all appeared before the committee.  That committee 
includes members from all parties in the House.  The committee 
can call the witnesses it feels would add useful information. 
That includes departmental officials and members of the House who 
can participate in the committee and obtain information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a special unit has been set up inside HRDC to track and 
report publicly on the department's grants and contributions. 
After seven years in that department I know those individuals.  I 
know their competence and their expertise, and that is the reason 
they have been chosen for this unit.  I know that being headed by 
an official they will do an outstanding job to this end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these review activities the minister of HRDC 
continues to be responsive to parliament.  Indeed the minister 
has earned high public praise for her willingness to stand and 
answer questions in the House.  Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast support the minister of HRDC in implementing the new 
administrative system.  They believe in these programs.  They 
know there is a role for government and they want the problems 
fixed.  That is what HRDC is doing.

As I listened to the speech by the secretary of state, I

scandal, to have an independent inquiry—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, we 
suspect that members opposite are more interested in playing 
politics with this call for an inquiry than they are in getting 
on with the facts.  There is clearly no need for the inquiry the 
motion proposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the speech and I would like to ask the 
member a couple of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get into her answering the question with regard to 
the political connections to these grants.  When we pool the 
information about what companies are getting the grants and what 
companies are great contributors to the Liberal Party, perhaps it 
is just a coincidence that they match up so well.  I do not 
expect her to explain that away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of things really bother me.  For years and years and 
years unemployment on some of the reserves in my riding has been 
at 80% and 90%.

was a saving of $25 million in social assistance funding.

this inquiry was conducted by the Liberal government and 
particularly by the Minister of Human Resources Development, we 
are very concerned.

design weaknesses, poor control and insufficient information on

and total transparency on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When commissions, studies and committees look into these

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member tell us her view on this point and whether 
she would favour an implementation of the Privacy Act in such a 
way that these things could actually be disclosed openly and 
honestly to Canadians instead of hiding behind the Privacy Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I resent the 
comment that we are hiding behind the Privacy Act.  The system in 
place has allowed them on February 21 to get 16 binders of 
information, five and a half inches thick and containing 10,000 
pages.  Once members have sifted through them and if they are not 
satisfied that is another question.  I would like to have more 
specific references than that.  I believe we could not be much 
more transparent and much more open than we have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a process that is fairly public.  The standing 
committee has members from all sides.  There too they have access 
to all the officials who could give them the information if they 
have specific questions.  We are not hiding behind anything. 
There has been complete disclosure.  Not everyone agreed that 
disclosure was the best thing but there it is.  There is the 
information.  How they use it and if they use it is entirely up

tolerated and that we will oppose it wherever we find it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this morning Mel Cappe, the former deputy minister of 
human resources, testified at the human resources committee.  He 
testified that there were no explicit guidelines focusing on 
pockets of unemployment when handing out HRD grants.  This 
directly contradicts what the human resources minister has told 
the House concerning the justification for handing out millions 
of taxpayers dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister explain this contradiction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said on a number of occasions, it is 
the flexibility in the transitional jobs fund that has allowed 
for the majority of the investments to be made in opposition 
ridings.  I ask the hon. leader to confer with and talk to 
members on his backbenches about how much they appreciate the 
investments that they have seen in their own communities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did not address the question at all. It was 
raised by testimony at committee this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has been using this pockets of unemployment 
rationale for handing out millions of dollars of HRD grants. This 
morning Mel Cappe blew her cover on that subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will again ask the minister to explain why there is a 
contradiction between what she told the House today and what Mel 
Cappe told the committee this morning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the whole point of the transitional jobs 
fund was to help communities where the levels of unemployment 
were significantly high and where they were stagnant and were not 
going to be reduced without assistance.  We know that party would 
just like issues that go along with unemployment to fester and 
for these communities to have to struggle on their own.  That is 
not the view on this side of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this party believes in fixing unemployment by lowering 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is that this morning Canada's most senior public 
servant contradicted the Minister of Human Resources Development 
Canada.  My question is, who should Canadians believe? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly the Canadian public does not 
believe that party.  The leader said that all we need to do is 
reduce taxes and everything will be fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that it is not just through a reduction of 
individual taxes that will ensure that Canadians with 
disabilities get opportunities in this economy.  Canadians know 
that trickle down economics will not ensure that young people get 
their very important first job in our economy.  They know that 
trickle down economics will not improve the levels of literacy in 
this country.  That is why we on this side of the House believe 
in grants and contributions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
talk about trickle down.  When that money goes to Liberals and 
they give money back to party, that is what is frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRDC minister has been picking pockets of unemployment as 
her alibi for long enough.  Today Mel Cappe blew the lid off her 
excuses.  People say that if we ask the guilty the same question 
long enough and often enough, the truth is bound to slip out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to know today who is telling the truth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, brochures describing the transitional 
jobs fund were available to all members of parliament for a good 
long period of time.  Any member of parliament who was worth his 
or her salt went to the HRDC office and talked about these 
programs to see if they applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the undertakings of this program we were intending and 
actually did create opportunities, along with partners in 
communities right across the country, for Canadians who otherwise 
would not have had opportunities to work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
the minister is not answering a very specific and a pretty simple 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mel Cappe said today in committee that there were no explicit 
guidelines.  Now the minister turns around and says that they had 
all kinds of flexibility with guidelines.  There are two

yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human

Technipaint and Placeteco. What she did not say is that 
Technipaint had to resubmit a grant application, while Placeteco 
did not do so, in violation of the department's administrative

there are 170 people who are working today thanks to our

Placeteco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that if Placeteco did not resubmit a grant 
application it is because Placeteco's Claude Gauthier, who

$500,000 lots that the Prime Minister had paid one dollar for?

Gilles Champagne was the Human Resources Development Canada

was, however, at the same time the lawyer of Claude Gauthier, 
the man who nevertheless benefited from the $1.2 million grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that, if Gilles Champagne was able, in

people employed there.  Over the course of time there were 
upwards of 135 people working for this company.  Today there are 
78 people working there and there are prospects for increased 
opportunity.

is still no investigation under way, several weeks after those

this deviation from the rules.

Today, however, Mel Cappe said that there were no such

former deputy minister of her own department, now the top civil

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

transitional jobs fund was to help areas of high unemployment, to 
help build with our partners opportunities that otherwise would 
not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would just take a trip up to northern British

the maintenance of 77 jobs and the creation of 42 new jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member what she would have had us do, 
nothing?  Take the money back?  If that is what she would have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the letter

the grant stipulates that 42 new jobs be created, but the

Canada's top public servant, Mel Cappe, told a committee this 
morning that there were no explicit guidelines for the use of 
this grant money in these so-called pockets of unemployment. The 
minister said there were guidelines but that they were flexible. 
Who are we supposed to believe, Canada's top public servant or

<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

what the clerk has said and what has actually happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed as I have said on a number of occasions, 75% of the money 
for the transitional jobs fund was to go to areas with higher 
than 12% unemployment.  The other 25% was to go to communities 
that needed help, where investments would create spin-off 
opportunities, where we found within the boundaries of a larger 
community, areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I point out that the vast majority of communities that 
received moneys in areas of less than 12% were in opposition 
ridings.  Many of them were ridings of the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister just said there was no discrepancy between what Mel 
Cappe said this morning and what the minister has been saying. In 
other words, she is telling the House and Canadians that there 
are absolutely no controls on the use of this money by 
politicians, by political leaders.  That is unacceptable.  That 
is why we have a problem in the country with the minister 
bungling the use of a billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the minister's position that there should be absolutely no 
controls on the use of taxpayers' money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, probably I should offer an apology to the people of 
Alberta because if we did not have any flexibility in the 
program, not one cent from the program would have gone to that 
province. It would have been the same thing in British Columbia. 
It would have been the same thing in Saskatchewan. It would have 
been the same thing in Manitoba.  But we knew there were pockets 
of unemployment in those four provinces and we adjusted the 
program to make sure that the money went into those provinces.

consultant for Placeteco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Is it the presence of

talked about administrative errors made on this particular file. 
Those were corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time it is clear to us that continuing to invest in 
Placeteco and Techni-Paint was the wise thing to do.  These

Speaker, if the finance minister is so concerned, why has he not 
done anything about it?  Fuel prices have gone up 40%.  If 
they do not come down, inflation will rise.  That means 
skyrocketing interest rates.  High interest rates mean higher 
debt service charges.  When that happens the finance minister can 
kiss his sorry surplus goodbye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very simple.  Will the government cut taxes on fuel at

talking about high interest rates.  When we took office our 
interest rates were substantially above those of the United 
States.  Today they are lower.

The minister is responsible for economic development in the

development in the north, yet the department has not done a thing 
in over a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is some hope because the Yukon government and the

</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Last Friday the member for London North 
Centre rose on a question of privilege concerning the premature 
release of a confidential document that was a work in progress by 
the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration.  At that 
time I decided to reserve my decision until the committee itself 
dealt with the issue.  The chair of the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration presented a report on this matter 
earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said I would hold my decision in abeyance until the 
member for Lakeland had an opportunity to address the House on 
this matter.  I would now invite the hon. member for Lakeland to 
do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased that you have given me a chance to speak to this 
very important issue.  In my presentation I will explain why I do 
not believe in fact that I was in contempt of parliament.  I 
would like to elaborate on that a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my statement by quoting from the constitution of 
our country.  There are a number of procedural requirements of 
the House of Commons provided in the constitution.  These 
procedural requirements make up the rules of the House.  These 
rules must be respected by the House and by its committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 49 of the Constitution Act provides that questions 
arising in the House of Commons shall be decided by a majority of 
voices.  Further, Standing Order 116 states that in a standing 
committee the standing orders shall apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration did not 
decide to go in camera by a majority vote.  It did not decide to 
go in camera as a result of a motion or a vote of any kind.  The 
committee did not make the decision.  The chair made the decision 
unilaterally.  In fact it decided the opposite and reaffirmed 
this on March 2, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though in my opinion the committee could go in camera by 
way of a motion pursuant to the rules and practices, it only 
confirmed what these rules are.  Specifically the evidence from 
the committee meeting of March 2 shows that the committee 
reconfirmed the House rules and therefore committee rules 
requiring a vote to pass by a majority to cause the committee to 
go in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very next meeting the Liberal chair of the committee 
decided on his own and against the clear rules of the committee 
to ignore the democratic process and move the proceedings away 
from public scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to note that the reason the issue came 
up on March 2 at the committee meeting and at previous meetings 
is that the chair of the committee, the hon. member for London 
North Centre, had unilaterally moved meetings in camera, in other 
words to become secret, apparently to protect the government from 
possible embarrassing comments that Liberal members might make 
during discussion of what the committee had heard.  That is what 
the discussion was on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussion was on what the committee had heard from 
witnesses who appeared before the committee.  There was no 
apparent reason other than political considerations.  After all, 
all the witnesses were heard in public.  I protested this 
improper decision and the committee chair agreed there was no 
good reason to hold these discussions secretly.  I fully expected 
of course then that the next meeting would be a public meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same March 2 meeting of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration the committee agreed, 
and I quote from the minutes of proceedings “that the draft 
report be considered in public”.  This is from the minutes of 
proceedings of the Thursday, March 2, 2000 meeting, the very 
meeting before the chair unilaterally chose to hold this meeting 
in camera with no vote from the committee.  I would be happy to 
table this document, the minutes of proceedings.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the chairman did not only breach the constitution and 
the rules of the House, I would argue, but he breached the 
committee's own internal rules and the clearly documented will of 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore I would like to draw the Speaker's attention to an 
argument at page 10464 of <I>Hansard</I>.  On October 9, 1997, the 
Speaker ruled that committees must address their work processes 
and be very clear about how they expect draft reports and other 
material relating to in camera meetings to be treated.  That was 
your ruling, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion the committee had set out very clearly that the 
draft report was to be discussed in an open meeting prior to 
meetings being held in camera and that prior to any meeting being 
held in camera a vote would be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration was in 
camera illegally.  If anyone were in contempt, I would charge 
that the chairman was in contempt of the House for usurping the 
authority of the House as provided for in the constitution of our 
country, in the rules of the House of Commons, and as decided by 
this committee itself.  Therefore I believe the House should find 
the member for London North Centre in contempt for exercising 
authority beyond the authority granted by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons I believe that I was not in contempt of 
parliament.  To make it clear, the committee was not in camera. 
Therefore I was providing public information to the public.  I am 
not in contempt, in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one important and very pertinent piece of information 
which I feel I should present.  The document I released was not 
the final draft of the committee report.  Because the committee 
had gone illegally I believe in camera, this draft document was 
the only record I had of the proceedings of the committee.  As 
the House knows the official record of the committee is not 
available to the public if the meeting is declared to be an in 
camera meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already explained, I believe the meeting was in fact a 
public meeting because the chair of the committee, the member for 
London North Centre, had illegally convened the committee in 
secret.  The final draft of the committee has yet to be tabled in 
the House, but as I am sure you will find when it is tabled, Mr. 
Speaker, that draft is not the same as the draft of the document 
which I released in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  We are here on a question of 
privilege.  I would prefer not to have any interruptions.  I want 
to hear what the member has to say.  I listened to the other 
member before, as did the House, and I want to hear what he has 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really would 
appreciate if the chair of the committee would allow me to say my 
piece.  That is the respectful thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could add a few more comments regarding the minister 
and the chair of the committee.  The committee launched at my 
request into hearings on the issue of illegal migration into our 
country.  The chair of the committee, the hon. member for London 
North Centre, assured members of this all-party committee that 
our findings would culminate in a report which would be 
considered by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in 
developing long awaited new immigration legislation.  The 
minister also assured committee members and Canadians right 
across the country that the report would be considered in 
developing this new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do you think, Mr. Speaker, Canadians who are carefully 
following the proceedings of this committee, and especially the 
people who appeared as witnesses, must feel when three weeks 
before the committee presents its report I have received a draft 
copy of the new act which I released in public some two weeks 
ago?  This new act is not to be confused with the draft committee 
report which I released in a media conference last Thursday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did I receive a copy of the new act, but I also 
received along with it the schedule called the critical path for 
the final stages of approval and tabling of the legislation.  I 
have a copy of that here to be tabled, Mr. Speaker, if you would 
so choose to accept that document.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I would like to refer to just three dates in the 
critical path.  It is important.  The draft bill was sent to all 
the provinces on Monday, February 21.  The final draft of the 
bill was to be signed by the minister on Thursday, March 7 and 
the act was to be introduced to parliament on March 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the very legislation which was supposed to have 
included information from the report of the committee on 
citizenship and immigration was a done deal before our draft 
report was even written?  What a sick joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the committee, each witness who appeared and all 
Canadians should be furious for using them like this.  They 
presented to the committee with the best of intentions believing 
what they said would be taken into account in developing the new 
act.  What a complete lack of respect for democracy and what a 
complete lack of respect for the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today to answer to the government's charge that I 
stand in contempt of parliament for my action of releasing to the 
media, and to Canadians, a draft of the committee report which 
was marked confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I have made the case that in fact this report was a 
public document.  I am here today as well to charge the chair 
of the committee, the member for London North Centre, with 
contempt of parliament for the reasons I have outlined in this 
presentation.  I ask the Speaker to rule at his earliest 
convenience.  I am looking forward to your ruling on both the 
charges which have been laid against me, contempt of parliament, 
and the charges which, Mr. Speaker, I am presenting to you 
against the chair of the committee, the member for London North 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to your rulings, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you in 
advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  If members have new facts to share with the 
House, I want to hear them.  I do not want to get into a debate. 
I will hear the hon. government House leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was a little hard to go 
through all of this and to assume that it would work.  I am sure 
that Your Honour probably has difficulty in that regard as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, on one hand we hear the hon. member say that he as 
a way of defence is accusing the chairman of the committee for 
having used an improper procedure and that is tantamount to his 
justification for the act he has committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of what occurred, that is not justification for his 
own behaviour.  If the proper motion was not adopted by the 
committee for the committee to go into camera, that is a matter 
for the committee to discuss.  The fact still remains that 
citation 877 of <I>Beauchesne's</I> still applies.  It says very 
clearly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No act done at any committee should be divulged before it has 
been reported to the House.  Upon this principle the House of 
Commons of the United Kingdom, on April 21, 1937, resolved “That 
the evidence taken by any select committee— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the equivalent of a standing committee in the British 
House. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—of this House and the documents presented to such committee and 
which have not been reported to the House, ought not to be 
published by any member of such committee or by any other 
person”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only was the document published and circulated by the hon. 
member, but the chair of the committee informed the House and 
provided both the chair and the table with written proof of a 
press release in which the member for Lakeland was actually 
advertising the fact that he was committing this act.  I read 
further where it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The publication of proceedings of committees conducted with 
closed doors or of reports of committees before they are 
available to Members will, however, constitute a breach of 
privilege. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not say “and”.  It says “or”.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that citation was read into the record when I was in 
the House by the chair of the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the committee moved the appropriate motion to 
proceed to in camera or if the chair concluded that there was 
agreement to that effect and it was not challenged.  Whichever 
way it was, the fact still remains that the committee was 
considering a report which of course was eventually going to be 
tabled in the House.  Until it is tabled in the House, the 
relevant citation of Beauchesne's, 877, still applied.  This was 
a premature disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final argument we heard from the hon. member is that his 
disclosing this report was somehow immaterial.  He says that the 
minister was not going to give the report consideration because 
the minister was already working on a draft of the bill.  First, 
those two concepts are not mutually exclusive.  Second, it is 
immaterial.  Whether or not the member believes that a minister 
would or would not have considered the report is not 
justification for a breach of the rules of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I think we are going to win a vote tonight on supply or any 
other issue, would that justify me or anyone else in the House 
dispensing with having the vote because we firmly believe that 
based on our numbers that we would win it anyway?  That is 
ridiculous.  That kind of defence by the hon. member clearly does 
not work and I suggest that it will not wash with Your Honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

intervention by my colleague from Lakeland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his intervention, as you noted when you tried to restore 
order to the House, Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the standing 
committee in question, the hon. member for London North Centre, 
was heard very clearly to shout out that my hon. colleague is an 
embarrassment to the House.  I would ask that he retract those 
words.  It is despicable that he would— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I would first like to deal 
with this point of privilege.  If such a thing occurred, then I 
did not hear it.  We will hear one side and then the other.  I do 
not want to get into the debate.  Is there more information to 
offer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe there is a 
clarification.  In his reply, the hon. House leader for the 
government said that somehow I was using my complaints against 
the chair of the committee as a defence, and I was not.  That is 
a separate issue.  I only raised it at this time because the same 
information applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could just also mention that the hon. House leader talked 
about whether or not a committee goes in camera is a decision to 
be made by the committee.  That was part of my argument.  That 
never happened and the record will show that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are getting into debate.  I am looking 
for new facts on this particular matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, very briefly, I am on that committee.  I knew nothing of 
the concerns of the hon. member for Lakeland.  I arrived one day 
at the committee and found that it was in camera on the 
discussion of the report which was very important.  I moved a 
motion such that the in camera committee report would be available 
to the public as soon as it was tabled.  I think that 
would have been a way to get around the problem expressed by the 
hon. member for Lakeland, but unfortunately this motion was 
unable to go forward because we did not have quorum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will leave it in your good judgment and perhaps the good 
judgment of the procedure and House affairs committee to 
determine which facts are right and which facts are wrong as put 
forward by myself last Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you know, I gave notice on Thursday, half an hour 
after the member prematurely released a confidential document.  I 
will not recite the citations.  I also stood this morning and 
indicated with a heavy heart that the committee itself, in its 
first report, indicated that it felt its privileges were breached 
because of the premature release of a draft report in confidence 
that will be made public tomorrow.  Everyone's rights have been 
breached.  That is the additional piece of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one clarification because obviously an awful lot 
of information has been put before you with regard to this 
matter.  It is an embarrassing matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I want to say that I respectfully informed the whip 
of the Reform Party two hours before the member for Lakeland was 
to make this issue public.  He, I might add, was as concerned as 
I was as to the actions of the member for Lakeland.  I point that 
out to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I think we are getting into 
debate.  I will go now to the hon. member for Mississauga West. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have some new information that I think might be of interest to 
you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lakeland mentioned the meeting on March 2.  At 
that meeting he said he objected to the fact that the committee 
would be moving in camera to deal with the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out to you that he actually 
threatened the committee at that meeting by saying that if we 
went in camera he had a tape recorder, which he showed the 
committee, and he would be tape recording the proceedings to 
release the information in whatever way he chose to release it, 
notwithstanding the fact that the committee would have ruled in 
some form of obvious democratic way.  That was the kind of 
intimidation tactic frankly that we were faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wentworth—Burlington has pointed out to you, Mr. 
Speaker, that it was his suggestion that the minutes of the 
meeting be made available to the public after the document was 
completed and reported to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point of information that I would leave with you, Mr. 
Speaker, is that the member has actually admitted that the 
document he released was not a completed document.  In fact, this 
same member has refused to participate in the amendments at 
committee to finally get the document to a stage where the 
committee was ready to pass a motion to present it to the House. 
We know that with 301 members in this place, not all members are 
able to serve on every committee.  By extension, the committee is 
therefore required to report to the House before it reports to 
anyone else.  That is understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also add that if you look in the rules and 
procedures, which I am sure you do not need to do because you 
know this, it also says that even if a draft report is written in 
public session, it is still confidential until it is reported to 
the House.  Mr. Speaker, that is some additional information for 
you to consider. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would just like to reinforce one thought and that is 
the reason the standing orders are there.  They should override 
any decision contrary to them because, as has been said, every 
privilege of each member of the House will be adversely affected 
if a report, deemed expressly prohibited to be released, is 
released.  Therefore, as a member I feel aggrieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have now heard the original claim of 
privilege by the hon. member for London North Centre.  We have 
heard an explanation by the member for Lakeland.  Now we have had 
interventions by at least another five members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Lakeland said that he had a document that he 
would lay on the table.  I invite him indeed to lay all of the 
documents on the table so that I can examine them.

<A NAME="LINK224">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty frustrating sitting here in the nosebleed section 
listening to what passes for debate in question period as being 
informative to the Canadian public.  There seems to be an endless 
amount of accusation on what seems to me to be a fairly thin 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of human resources apparently can never be too 
transparent.  It does not seem to matter that the minister has 
released over 10,000 documents.  It does not seem to matter that 
she has established a website.  It is essentially a feeding 
frenzy.  Regrettably it feeds into some of the most cherished 
notions of Canadians who do not take the time to inform 
themselves with respect to debate in the House, namely that 
government is wasteful by definition, that government is 
intrusive into the lives of Canadians, that government is 
therefore corrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC is a very big department.  It spends something in the order 
of $60 billion of taxpayers' money on an annual basis. It 
administers the pension program but I assume that members of the 
opposition are against pension programs.  It administers programs 
with respect to people with disabilities but I assume that 
members opposite are against people with disabilities.  It 
administers funds in all kinds of areas of interest to Canadians 
including jobs funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frequently government is faced with some fairly unhappy choices 
in areas of high unemployment.  We all wish our country could be 
equally blessed and enjoy equal areas of low unemployment such as 
the community from which I come, Toronto. Nationally the 
unemployment rate is 6.8%, and for us it is something lower, 
around 6% and possibly even under 6%.  We wish that all Canadians 
were able to find employment wherever they find themselves in 
this country but regrettably that is simply not a reality for 
many of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government tries to address these problems, it does an 
uneven job.  Usually the focus is on some area of high 
unemployment.  Frequently the choices are social assistance, 
unemployment insurance or some form of job training program. 
These are unhappy choices.  We look at a constituent or a fellow 
citizen and ask “What do you want to do here?  Do you want to 
collect social assistance, do you want to collect unemployment or 
do you want to try this job program?”  That is what it boils 
down to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on this issue has generated a great deal of heat and 
very little light.  I want to put on the record a number of 
statistical facts which hopefully will get somewhere close to the 
facts on the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money in question is something in the order of $1 billion 
which by anybody's definition is a lot of money.  Bear in mind 
that $1 billion is out of the entire government's budget of $160 
billion.  What we are talking about and focusing on is 1/160 of 
the government's overall budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government to its great credit did an audit of about 20% of 
its $1 billion program, in other words about $200 million. It 
audited something in the order of 459 projects.  Of those 459 
projects 37 were found to have some problem, some administrative 
problem, some filing problem, some this, some that. 
About 8% of the projects were found to have something wrong with 
them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 37 projects involving some irregularities, all moneys 
were accounted for except at this point something like $600. 
That is not big money, but in the House it seems to be an 
exaggerated amount of money.  Even if we project that forward and 
say that something in the order of $80 million of this $1 billion 
is in question, and that is the highest it gets for the 
opposition, if we say that is true, that is roughly 8% of the 
overall project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bear in mind we are dealing with people who are in some 
considerable distress.  As I indicated earlier, the choices are 
social assistance, unemployment insurance or this jobs fund. 
Frankly it does not work all the time.  What is the insight 
there?  I am perfectly prepared to debate hon. members opposite 
if they think all of this kind of thing should be cancelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view at this point on the evidence that is available to 
us, even projecting forward the $600 that is missing, we have 
$3,000 in question.  Members opposite think we should call a 
public inquiry over $3,000. That level of absurdity even this 
House has not seen in a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is never in the interests of either the media or the 
opposition to talk about success stories.  In my riding no one 
seems to be interested in the money that the University of 
Toronto spends in this program, nor is there interest in West 
Hill Community Services.  There are 800 volunteers on the ground 
each and every week providing assistance to all kinds of 
Canadians in my riding but no one wants to talk about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the West Rouge Community Centre?  The canoe club 
burned down and we helped to get some money together so that it 
could be restored.  No one wants to talk about that.  It was not 
in the Scarborough <I>Mirror</I>.  It was not on the local Shaw 
Cable. It was not in the Toronto <I>Star</I>, the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> and it was certainly not in the <I>National Post</I>. Does 
anyone want to talk about the Scarborough Philharmonic Society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these programs in my riding make us a more civil nation. 
Frankly, it gets a little tiresome listening to what passes for 
debate in the House over what is utter nonsense. These are ways 
in which government civilizes our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Classically businesses are not interested in this sort of stuff. 
To be perfectly blunt about it, businesses want to make money.  I 
understand that.  That is their area of expertise.  I just do not 
quite understand why businesses should adhere to a failure rate 
of something in the order of 25%, if we compare first year 
businesses, and governments on the other hand have to achieve a 
standard of absolute perfection or else those opposite go 
absolutely nuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the grants are problematic.  I am prepared to admit 
that.  The government depends on the community, the province and 
local businesses to generate the projects. Clearly not all 
projects are equal.  Clearly the conception of the project may be 
different from its execution.  No advocate of a project ever 
starts off with a proposition that it is going to scam the 
government, that it is going to be one big wonderful scam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best projects and the vast majority of projects are welcome 
in their communities and no one ever hears about them. Good news 
is no news.  It does not hit the headlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ones that do hit the headlines divide into two categories: 
the projects that are problems that have an explanation and can 
be fixed and the projects that are problems with no explanation 
and cannot be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first category is one question in question period and it 
dies.  What is the biggest killer on a question period question? 
It is facts.  No one really wants to hear the facts.  When the 
issue can be explained, that is it.  It dies and it is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second category is more problematic for the government.  The 
question becomes the size and the percentage of impact.  I 
understand that the opposition is criticizing the spending in 
HRDC.  At this point in time what is known is what I reiterated 
earlier.  What is known is that 37 projects have raised some 
question in an audit of something in the order of $200 million. 
I do not see that as a big issue; 8% is not a great thing. 
To be perfectly candid about it, how in heaven's name can we 
expect the government to adhere to a standard of perfection 
working in an area that is difficult at best?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a category of questions and the issue is whether the 
glass is half empty or half full.  Hon. members opposite think 
that something in the order of $600 missing, which is the only 
fact that is on the table at this point, requires a public 
inquiry.  This is an interesting exercise.  Even projecting 
forward that we have only hit one-fifth of all of the projects, 
this would be $600 times five which is $3,000.  I do not know 
whether we really want to deal with facts here because that is 
not really good for politics, but the fact is that based on this 
the members opposite wish to call for a public inquiry on an 
issue of a missing $3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge hon. members to vote against this motion for the very 
simple reason that this is one major tempest in a very tiny 
teapot.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to have the opportunity to put a question to the Liberal member 
on the opposition motion introduced by he Bloc Quebecois, but 
before asking my question, I would like to remind the House of 
the motion we introduced. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the poor management 
seen at the Department of Human Resources Development, 
particularly in the award and use of grants for partisan 
purposes, and that it recommend the creation of an independent 
public commission of inquiry, whose members will be appointed by 
the House, and whose mandate will be to inquire into all 
practices of that Department and to report to the House by 
September 19, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example of mismanagement which is 
happening right now in my riding: the closure of a plant where 
several older workers have been paying into employment insurance 
for 30 years, 35 years or more. The employer has been paying his 
share too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plant will be closing at the end of the month and these 
workers will probably have to go on social assistance. 
Since it came to power, the government has withdrawn from a 
program called POWA. Under this program designed to help older 
workers, they were guaranteed $1,000 a month until their 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government's own data, when a worker gets to be 
45, it becomes very hard for him to find another job. These men 
have worked for 30 years at the same job, in the same plant, in 
the same place, they have acquired great experience. Now that 
they are 50, that they still must look after their family, that 
they have a mortgage, that they have children in university, if 
the plant closes down, they will be left without means, they 
cannot get back into the labour market. As a result of the 
government withdrawing from the program for older worker 
adjustment, they are pushed on social assistance. 
If this is not mismanagement, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my Liberal colleague whether he thinks it is 
all right to waste money handing out partisan grants while 
nothing is being done to help older workers? What is the 
government willing to do for these older workers who are losing 
their jobs due to a plant closure? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker,  I thank the hon. member 
for giving a classic illustration of exactly what I was talking 
about. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT70"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT70"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is faced with an unhappy situation in that 
riding.  I understand that.  Possibly it is a pocket of high 
unemployment, one of those terrible things.  Since it is a pocket 
of high unemployment what is the government supposed to do?   Is 
it supposed to walk away and say “Well, that's too bad, you are 
on your own?”  There are choices.  Do they want to go on social 
assistance, do they want to go on unemployment or do they want to 
try this program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know much about the POWA program but the illustration 
is perfect.  How in heaven's name that translates into some sort 
of partisan exercise escapes me altogether.  Presumably that 
program and the transition jobs fund program are available in a 
Bloc riding.  Presumably, if this was truly partisan, these 
programs would not be available in a Bloc riding, a Reform riding 
or an NDP riding.  The only places they would be available would 
be in Liberal ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the facts come out—and it is a strange concept that in 
fact 52% of the grants under these programs have gone to 
opposition ridings as opposed to Liberal ridings—one has to ask 
oneself what the basis is for this silly motion on partisanship.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate as a former 
member of the human resources development committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to read the text of the motion 
brought forward by the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. The motion reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the poor management 
seen at the Department of Human Resources Development, 
particularly in the award and use of grants for partisan 
purposes, and that it recommend the creation of an independent 
public commission of inquiry, whose members will be appointed by 
the House, and whose mandate will be to inquire into all 
practices of that Department and to report to the House by 
September 19, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an amendment, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by 
adding after the word “condemn” the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“vehemently” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, after the 1993 election I was a member of the 
human resources development committee. 
That committee toured major cities in all the provinces, 
including Quebec. My colleague opposite was on that tour. If he 
could talk he would certainly tell us that every place we 
went the majority of witnesses who came before the committee 
were against cuts in social programs. They were against cuts in 
the unemployment insurance program, as it was then called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were several protests. I do not encourage protests but it 
happened several times during that tour. My colleague is nodding 
in agreement. He remembers. He may be a Liberal but he 
witnessed those protests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember our visit to Montreal, where people turned over 
tables to protest against the government's intention to cut 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A subcommittee had been set up and on the last day we went to 
Bathurst. I wondered why we were going to that riding, the 
riding of the former minister of human resources development. 
Why were we going there at the very end, as a subcommittee, without 
the TV cameras? That was Doug Young's riding. Protesters were 
particularly vocal there. People told us that the situation in 
Acadia was similar to that in the Gaspé Peninsula. The Liberal 
majority had rejected the idea of going to the Gaspé region or 
the Magdalen Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor did we go to the Abitibi or the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region, 
where seasonal unemployment is extremely high. Still, even if 
the subcommittee's destinations had been carefully selected, we 
had to go to the minister's riding. But the minister did not 
come on that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite a surprise for me to see that the protest was even 
better organized there than elsewhere. 
This was because there were real problems. The wives of fishers 
came to testify. They told us that switching from a number of 
weeks to a number of hours of work would have a major impact in 
their area.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember that Doug Young, the former minister, was ousted, as 
had been the Conservative minister before him, Bernard Valcourt, 
who, at the time, had wanted to proceed with an unemployment 
insurance reform. I remember—that is Quebec's motto—that at the 
time the current Prime Minister had criticized the idea in a 
debate against then Prime Minister Kim Campbell, saying “You 
intend to cut social programs and the UI program. This is 
unacceptable”. The Prime Minister has left a trail. He even 
wrote a letter, using the same arguments ans stating that social 
programs and unemployment insurance should not be tampered with. 
These programs were necessary in the so-called seasonal 
unemployment regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Ms. Campbell would not promise not to follow through on her 
plans, or the plans of Human Resources Development Canada 
officials.  So the plans went ahead and the minister made the 
cuts in question, but it will be remembered that there was a 
marvellous transitional fund with up to $300 million for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction was  “Fine, they are making changes but, with the 
transitional fund, people will be able to adapt”.  But the 
problem was the way in which this transitional fund was managed, 
when it was realized that it would be limited to regions where 
unemployment was higher than 12%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment in my riding, and in most ridings in the Quebec 
City and Chaudières-Appalaches region, was less than 12%. 
They therefore did not qualify for this program but, in the 
riding of the present minister, where unemployment stood at 6%, 
businesses and organizations did.  Why?  Because, she said, 
there were pockets of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members in the House are capable of showing that there are 
pockets of poverty everywhere.  There are pockets of poverty in 
my riding.  I go to the Lauzon and, when the shipyard lays 
people off, it is not long before there is a pocket of poverty. 
There is still one right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, oddly enough, we in the Bloc Quebecois and members of all 
the opposition parties were not informed of this directive. 
Only the Liberal members heard about it.  Luck was on their side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It hits even closer to home is when one realizes that 54.3% of 
the sums allocated over three years through this transitional 
job fund were during the six months before and the two months 
after the election.  Promises had been made and there had not 
been time for the grants to be authorized.  After the fact, when 
questions were raised, it became obvious that the money was 
sometimes six months or a year in coming.  This is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has said that there were partisan attacks from 
the opposition.  Why are there such attacks which he calls 
partisan?  Simply because the facts point very clearly to there 
having been partisan action in Liberal ridings or in ridings 
with opposition MPs on which the Liberals had designs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are even more worrisome. 
I will not spend much time on the Prime Minister's riding, but 
it is clear that, particularly in the riding of Saint-Maurice, 
there was a sort of flood of grants.  Sometimes grants that had 
been awarded to another riding, such as Rosemont, got added to 
the ones already promised.  In the Prime Minister's election 
literature, he was not shy about mentioning that this was the 
result of his interventions.  He even included a quote from the 
business owner in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recall another instance, during the first mandate, 
involving phone-in centres for the unemployed and other people 
with problems.  There were a number of these centres, more or 
less everywhere, but they were reduced to two.  In the Quebec 
City region, there was one in the riding of my colleague for 
Louis-Hébert.  It was not a face-to-face service.  Everything was 
done over the phone.  They did not receive any clients.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden, when there was not even an office, and it was 
not one of the centres concerned, the number dropped from 10 to 
2.  There was not even one in the riding of Saint-Maurice and, 
all of a sudden, they were cut to two, and one was opened in the 
riding of Saint-Maurice.  The one in Montreal they left there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one in the riding of Saint-Maurice was to serve eastern 
Quebec.  I can tell you that the Prime Minister's riding is a 
long way from eastern Quebec.  This is an example of decision 
making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Trois-Rivières pointed out what happened when the 
employment office in Trois-Rivières had to be moved. 
They streamlined, and where did the office go?  Once again, to 
the riding of the Prime Minister, the riding of Saint-Maurice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We reveal all these facts, plus those mentioned by my colleagues 
before me, and the Liberal member opposite looks offended.  It 
seems to him that the members of the Bloc Quebecois are making 
partisan interventions.  These facts are never contradicted.  In 
19 instances, the RCMP, as the Prime Minister said repeatedly, 
is investigating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, the evidence is very clear.  There was political 
influence in the awarding of grants in the transitional jobs 
fund.  Since I find that scandalous, I add my voice to those who 
are protesting. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker,  I 
first want to address my questioning in the form of motive and 
then put three questions to the hon. member with regard to his 
presentation to the House this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to motive, Madam Speaker, you, like many of us in 
the House, have had an opportunity over the past number of years 
to sit with Bloc members on numerous standing committees of the 
House.  I certainly believe that no opposition members and no 
government members have any confusion that the Bloc members bring 
forward a very partisan position at the committees, the end goal 
obviously being secession and to eliminate the role of the 
federal government in their ridings in Quebec regardless of the 
good work that comes out of the federal initiatives that do great 
work for their ridings.  That is an indisputable fact.  I can see 
heads nodding from the various opposition parties.  It is a very 
partisan position that Bloc members take at the committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Bloc member is threefold.  It is very simple 
and requires only yes or no answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, does the hon. member recognize that more money was 
actually distributed to opposition ridings through the 
transitional jobs fund than there was to government ridings? This 
is a simple question and the answer is either yes or no.  He 
either recognizes that or he does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member does not argue that absolute fact, I have a second 
question for him.  Is he aware that in the province of Quebec the 
provincial government must sign on as a partner on every one of 
those transitional jobs funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last question also requires a yes or no answer.  Does he 
believe that Mr. Bouchard is working in collaboration with the 
federal government to put in place a slush fund to support 
Liberal members of parliament in Quebec?  Or, is the true fact of 
his argument and his presentation simply that regardless of the 
good work the federal government does in supporting the Canadians 
in Quebec and all across the country, he does not want a federal 
role in supporting these great organizations within the province 
of Quebec and, for that matter, other provinces as well? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, the fact that more money went 
to ridings held by opposition members before 1997 is part of our 
argument. For instance, the Anjou riding was held by a Bloc 
Quebecois MP. The Liberal Party wanted to win it over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> It is a fact. We noticed how focussed it all 
was. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Quebec City and Chaudière-Appalaches region, there are ten 
ridings, none of which got any money from this fund because they 
were considered impossible to win over by the Liberal Party. 
Those where the Liberal Party had no hope of winning did not get 
any grant but those where it might win did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Is he or is he not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé: </B>The member is asking me whether or not I 
believe Mr. Bouchard is creating a slush fund. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois have always asked for cash transfers to finance active 
employment measures. 
Speaking of the transitional jobs fund, we went along with it 
and we still support it in principle because of the impact of 
the drastic cuts on individuals. Where there have been quotas, 
in some cases they even went back five years and required 
workers to reimburse so-called EI overpayments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have bled the unemployed dry in order to doll out grants 
for electioneering purposes. This is a vicious, undemocratic 
attack. I thought those days were long gone. Unfortunately the 
Liberal Party came out of the same mould as the parties that 
came before it under previous regimes. It wants to use public 
money for partisan purposes, which is unacceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I cannot 
say I am pleased to take part in today's debate because it is 
not always pleasant to debate issues that reek of scandal. 
However, we must do it since this is about taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a consensus here on the importance of 
democracy. However, I am one of those who claim that several 
elements or factors are currently threatening democracy. I will 
not name them all because there are a number of them. There is 
one in particular that really gets me fired up. I am often 
invited in CEGEPs, universities and even high schools. The first 
question that I ask at these meetings is often “If I mention the 
word politics, what comes to mind?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not always pretty. I hear words like “corruption”, 
“money” and “liar”, and comments such as “They put money in their 
pockets”. 
Many words are used and this is probably the case all over the 
country. Politicians have a very poor reputation. In fact, only 
4% of the population support members of parliament and trust 
them. This is a profession for which support is among the 
lowest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that serious, because I tell these students, who would 
often like to be in the House and say “You are all corrupt, you 
put money in your pockets, you mishandle funds” and so on, that 
they are not necessarily right, that in fact the problem is not 
politics, but the way it is practiced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, the threat to democracy is the fact that an 
increasing number of people are losing interest in politics, 
because they are disappointed to see how it is practiced. 
They are saying “I am never voting again.  I am keeping right 
out of politics.  There is no point.  Nothing ever changes. 
Politicians are all liars”.  This is a very pervasive belief and 
I think it must be taken very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate is at the heart of this issue because we are 
talking about the management of public money.  I think that, for 
many people, when the Human Resources Development Canada scandal 
hit the news, everything I said earlier certainly was in many 
people's minds.  They saw it as one more scandal and nothing 
new.  This is deplorable and I think it has very negative 
repercussions.  People see this as politicians helping 
themselves to public money.  There are ramifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all began with the tabling of HRDC's internal audit report 
on grant programs.  Approximately seven categories of programs 
were investigated.  These programs represented approximately $1 
billion annually in grants and contributions over three years, 
or a total of $3 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1605

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report described important problems in the management of 
these programs, grants handed out unbidden, a serious lack of 
documentation showing an unbelievable laxity on the part of 
officials and provided statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some figures to illustrate what I am saying: in 87% of 
projects there was no sign of monitoring by officials; in 80% of 
projects—that is quite a few—there was no evidence of financial 
control; in 75% of projects there was no evidence that expected 
results had been achieved; in 70% of projects, there was no 
invoice or payroll to justify expenses; in 66% of projects, there 
was no analysis or documentation explaining the recommendation or 
approval of the project; and finally, in 36% of the cases where the 
amount was increased, the reason for such an increase was not 
indicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This carelessness in management opens the door to fraud, 
mishandling of funds, political interference and patronage. This 
is how the lack of integrity of the government and the 
department with regard to grants and contributions began to 
surface. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation, which I think is alarming for the majority of 
Quebecers and Canadians, led the Bloc Quebecois to bring forward 
this motion on this opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the poor management 
seen at the Department of Human Resources Development, 
particularly in the award and use of grants for partisan 
purposes, and that it recommend the creation of an independent 
public commission of inquiry, whose members will be appointed by 
the House, and whose mandate will be to inquire into all 
practices of that Department and to report to the House by 
September 19, 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally agree with that. If the government has nothing to 
hide, it should not be against an inquiry. I think the amounts 
involved justify an inquiry, not to mention the fact that public 
opinion could believe that these programs are useless, that they 
are used only for partisan purposes and that they should be 
eliminated, which is cause for concern. To me, this is a serious 
threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally had the opportunity of working with HRDC officials 
in my riding.  Although we are sovereignists, that does not 
prevent us from working with federal officials, far from it. 
The taxes of my fellow citizens end up here in Ottawa.  This is 
where things are managed and, even though we do not always agree 
with the way the money is distributed, I tell myself that a 
dollar invested in my riding should be invested as well as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are calling for an inquiry in part because of the lack 
of an answer.  Although we have an Oral Question Period every 
day here, we do not have an answer period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit disappointed by the responses we have had to our 
questions.  In fact, we have had no responses at all.  It seems 
that the minister is avoiding questions, that she is trying to 
get round them and has been for several weeks now. 
I think she has definitely honed her political sense of not 
answering questions.  It is deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot get answers here, where are we going to get them? 
I think this issue must be brought to light.  An independent 
inquiry would certainly be a relevant way to get the answers the 
party opposite does not want to give us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed by this whole scandal. In a time of plenty—I am 
talking like an old hand at politics, but it is nothing—a few 
decades ago, when governments were floating along on the wealth 
and money flowed, which perhaps contributed to the incredible 
debt our generation will have to pay all its life, there was 
some limit to spending here and there. 
A zero deficit and balanced budget policy was instituted.  I 
said to myself “From that point on, expenditures were probably 
made judiciously”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As proof, in my riding, when an organization or company applied 
for funding, for example under the FPCE, I saw the forms 
regularly.  There had to be a concrete and highly detailed 
explanation of why the money was needed.  There was an audit 
carried out.  It all seemed to be above board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the scandal has broken, and I realized that the public's 
money has far too often been used to win votes.  I know that the 
hon. member across the way is going to say shortly some 
opposition members got more money that government MPs, but the 
timing has to be looked at.  When 54% of funds were allocated in 
the six months before the election, and when there was no audit, 
this is a great disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why the public has less and less faith in politics is 
obvious.  A public inquiry, such as that being called for by the 
Bloc Quebecois today, would strike me as one way of casting some 
light on the matter and perhaps even bringing some peace.  I 
hope that my colleagues across the way will be voting in favour 
of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no more time left.  I am sorry this is so, because I 
would dearly love to continue, but I will yield the floor to my 
colleagues.

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to respond.  I have done this a couple of 
times before, but I would like to give an immense thank you again 
to the interpreters.  Their brains must hurt by the end of the 
day, listening to this debate and speaking at the same time the 
words they hear in one language.  I am actually a trilingual 
Canadian, but French is not one of my extra languages and I am 
totally dependent upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is actually twofold.  First, in view 
of the fact that the motion calls for the creation of an 
independent inquiry, do Bloc members have any concerns when they 
look at the history of the Krever inquiry, the Somalia inquiry 
and the peppergate inquiry?  These so-called independent 
commissions do not really appear in the end to be very 
independent.  Would the hon. member have any comments on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, does he know whether in his riding taxpayers are paying 
more to Ottawa than they get back, or do they get back less than 
they send to Ottawa?  I am not sure if he would have the answer 
to that question, but I would like his opinion on it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay: </B>Madam Speaker, I also wish to thank the 
interpreters who make it possible for us to carry out a 
dialogue in two different languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my colleague's question about a commission of inquiry or an 
investigation, it does not matter which term is used as it is 
clear that this will not solve the problems.  The harm has been 
done and that is the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already several investigations underway, particularly 
in the Prime Minister's riding.  I am beginning to understand 
why he had the RCMP cottage renovated in Shawinigan county. 
Maybe it was so he can go and take up permanent residence there 
in comfort, because there are so many investigations underway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seriously, Madam Speaker, it is true that one cannot say that a 
commission of inquiry will solve everything, but I do think that 
it might cast some light on certain matters. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
too commend the interpreters.  Sometimes I wish they could change 
some of the words because some members do not make too much sense 
either in French or English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point I would like to make is that the hon. member 
commented on his experiences when he travels throughout his 
riding and what his constituents feel about politicians.  My 
experiences have been far different, so he might reflect on 
himself, his party and the separatists as to why some Quebecers 
have a feeling in that regard.

democracy, if that is not an oxymoron I do not know what is. 
Time and time again Quebecers have said no and time and time 
again the Bloc has continued to force the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to use the word scandal, as my hon. colleague has, 
but nothing could be further from the truth.  The facts are very 
clear.  There was no misappropriation of spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to hear once and for all, does the Bloc recognize, 
regardless of calendars or dates, that more money has gone into 
opposition ridings than Liberal ridings in Canada? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, sometimes I do not even 
feel like answering certain questions.  The only question the 
hon. member has asked today is whether more money went to the 
opposition party members' ridings.  I would be delighted if that 
were the case and if ridings represented by the Bloc Quebecois 
had received more money, but the point is when and why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If opposition ridings are receiving more money because the 
applications coming in are perhaps more relevant and the needs 
greater, so much the better. That would only make sense.  But 
when we find that 54% of money was spent in the six months 
leading up to the election, there is something odd going on. 
It may be an incredible coincidence, and it could be, but something 
smells.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for York West, who is a very valuable and 
active member of our all-party human resources development 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member opposite for bringing his motion before 
the House.  It gives the government an excellent opportunity to 
explain to Canadians how our programs really work.  The point of 
the HRDC programs is to help develop our human resources to help 
those Canadians in greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally reject the substance of this motion.  Is the hon. 
member being constructive?  Does he really care whether we are 
successful in working with Canadians to expand and build on their 
opportunities for the new economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite really wanted more effective grants and 
contribution programs they would support our ongoing work in 
fixing existing programs.  They would let the auditor general do 
his work.  They would let our all-party standing committee carry 
out its legitimate role and functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something should be said about the public servants in the 
Department of Human Resources Development.  Should we not allow 
the internal audit process to fulfil its mandate?  Should we not 
allow the department to carry out its action plan and modernize 
its administration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that is sadly lacking in this whole discussion is an 
informed debate.  For example, the reason for creating the 
transitional jobs fund in the first place was to assist those who 
needed help the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who were in the House prior to the last election, 
including my colleague who brought forth this motion, will recall 
that the government brought in much needed legislation to 
overhaul the 25 year old unemployment insurance system.  The 
result was the new employment insurance, the EI system.  It 
brought forth a series of measures to help Canadians adjust to 
program changes and, most importantly, return to the workforce as 
quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of the transitional jobs fund was to support job 
creation in areas of high unemployment and generate new permanent 
jobs in areas where people were having a difficult time finding 
work.  The TJF was designed to be flexible and to have buy-in 
from all important partners.  It had four basic criteria:  to 
create sustainable jobs; government partners must contribute at 
least 50% to the cost of the projects; projects must meet local 
development plans; and the provinces or the territories must 
support the proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each region was allotted funds based on two specific criteria. 
Seventy-five per cent of the funds were allocated to areas where 
unemployment was at or above 12%.  Twenty-five per cent of the 
funds were allocated to a province or a territory based on a 
decline in UI benefits resulting from the implementation of the 
new EI fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process ensured that every province and territory received 
program funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TJF was designed to recognize that regional officials, 
working with partners, were in the best position to assess the 
needs of local communities.  Built into the program was the need 
for regional decision making and flexibility.  The goal was to 
meet the overall program's objectives and have a positive impact 
on the community in terms of job creation and job opportunities. 
Specifically, regional officials were encouraged to work with our 
partners to identify strategic priorities that would benefit the 
local communities.  These partners included provincial and 
territorial governments, community groups, the private sector and 
local MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me clarify the meaning of an unemployment rate at or above 
12%.  Human Resources Development Canada, which administered the 
program, used the 12% figure as a guideline for TJF eligibility. 
Based on the 1995 Statistics Canada regional rates of 
unemployment, 18 of 62 regions were eligible for TJF funding. 
Yes, to be fair, northern B.C. and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia were 
also included because their rates of unemployment were 11.9% and 
11.5% respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the opposition and the media have raised a hue and cry 
that the transitional jobs funds went to areas where the rate of 
unemployment was under 12%.  True, but within those regions were 
pockets of high unemployment that exceeded 12%.  Provided the 
province or the territory agreed, those pockets of high 
unemployment met the criteria for funding TJF projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a process for determining those pocket areas within 
regions where the rate of unemployment was under the 12% 
guideline.  Data was compiled from various sources, such as the 
Statistics Canada census, labour force participation surveys, as 
well as labour market information developed by the local HRDC 
offices.  Decisions as to where transitional jobs funds were 
allocated were based on a real need to help hard-working 
Canadians adjust to the new EI program.  After all, hon. members 
will agree that the goal of government programs should be to help 
those who require help and to help Canadians help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the TJF did.  Funds were allocated to regions or 
pockets within regions that met the greater than 12% unemployment 
rate percentage or met the program's overall objectives for 
supporting areas that lacked a strong labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, community projects were approved in regions with 
under 12% unemployment.  They were approved because there was a 
higher rate of unemployment amongst aboriginal persons or persons 
with disabilities or within the visible minority populations. 
The TJF also helped regions with economically depressed 
industries, such as forestry, mining and fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify this 
issue.  However, it is not as if this information was not readily 
available to all members of parliament at the time.  At the time 
this program was announced and implemented, in fact as early as 
December 1, 1995 when the minister of HRDC announced the TJF 
program, the backgrounder to the news release said:  “The 
regional allocation of the transitional jobs fund will target 
high unemployment areas across Canada.  Allocations will be 
determined through discussion with provincial governments and 
other relevant partners”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the summer of 1996 brochures were distributed to HRDC centres 
in Canada explaining to people who had an idea for a project how 
to apply for TJF funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the pocket issue, it was made abundantly clear in both 
the 1997 EI monitoring and assessment report and in the 1998 
“Services for Canadians” binder, which was distributed to all 
MPs in the House.  Both the report and the binder stated:  “TJF 
projects are targeted to areas of the country and to geographical 
areas within communities that have unemployment rates of 12% or 
higher”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is simply that Human Resources Development 
Canada distributed plenty of information on the TJF and involved 
MPs and community leaders as much as possible.  I hope hon. 
members now have a better understanding of how the TJF worked. It 
was an enormously successful program that funded nearly 1,100 
projects and created some 30,000 jobs between July 1996 and March 
1999.  Instead of unduly criticizing the grants and contributions 
programs, hon. members should be explaining those programs to 
their constituents and helping those who qualify make use of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this brief opportunity to talk about some of the 
investments of HRDC in my riding of Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox 
and Addington.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my hometown of Napanee, Ontario, the county seat of Lennox 
and Addington, money was invested, partnering with the town, the 
county and the business improvement association.  Small amounts 
of funds were invested in many facets of our town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Napanee was named one of the 10 prettiest towns in 
North America.  Some of the funding involved local partners.  As 
we cleaned up our town and planted flowers with the Communities 
in Bloom program, it made a great difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other money invested in the riding went into literacy programs, 
museums and historical sites, and a lot of money was invested in 
our youth.  In my office today I have more requests from the 
municipalities for funding of these programs than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like to see the politics that are played during Oral 
Question Period.  The same party that has been attacking our 
minister is going around behind the cameras, asking us to get the 
programs into their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Madam Speaker, more money went into many of the 
ridings of Reform members than went into those of government 
members.  It is not justice; it is politics.  They are picking on 
the people who are unemployed, and I detest that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a few questions for the hon. member.  I 
took some notes and, with all due respect for the member 
opposite who, I think, has been a member of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities for a while, it must be hard for him 
to defend the government in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, he mentioned that projects under the transitional 
jobs fund had to show that they could improve the regional 
economy. 
When the member says, in good faith, that projects had to 
include similar arguments in their application, that means there 
was an application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does he explain the internal audit report's observation that 
there was no evidence of financial control in 80% of cases? 
According to the report, some people had not even filled in an 
application.  I would like to believe—and this is often the 
answer given by members opposite—that there were only a small 
number of cases like this, because we are only talking about an 
internal audit report, but why then will they not agree to a 
public inquiry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer we are getting is that they trust the auditor 
general. However, last fall the auditor general said, in 
answer to a question, that he intended to table a report in the 
House in the fall of 2001 and to look into the matter at that 
time. But what he said he wanted to do was make general comments 
on the quality of the management of these programs across the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must know how an audit is conducted. If the auditor general 
is not asked specifically to analyse the whole list, we will 
never know. As far as the issue mentioned by the member in his 
speech regarding the regional unemployment rate, if it is above 
12%, the riding is eligible, and when it is below 12%, people 
can still apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The population must understand one thing, the Bloc Quebecois is 
not questioning the usefulness of the grants as a catalyst and a 
boost to regional economies. The Bloc Quebecois is not blaming 
the civil servants. It is saying “The Liberals did not set any 
guidelines”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which 
represents HRDC employees, stated in a press release no later 
that this spring that the criteria made public recently did not 
exist before the program ended. The public servants themselves 
are saying they only had loose and flexible guidelines to go by, 
and that at no time were they informed of possible pockets, when 
they were managing this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member maintain a public inquiry into this matter is 
not necessary?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague leaves a 
little bit of room in his questions.  I guess it is very natural 
to point them in whatever way we would like to see them go. 
However, the audit in HRDC was brought forward by the HRDC 
officials themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of all parties were present today when Mr. Mel Cappe, 
the previous deputy minister of HRDC, was before our committee. 
Questions were asked by members on all sides of the House. I 
believe that on Thursday of this week the auditor general will 
appear before us.  I do not think we can have a more independent 
body than the auditor general's department.  There are dozens and 
dozens of people there who are professionals in investigating 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audit that has been done so far did not point to any 
political interference.  Today Mr. Mel Cappe said that he never 
saw any sign of political interference during the time that he 
was deputy minister in the department, and he was there during 
most of this time.  If any member of the House wants to challenge 
that, I would suggest he or she had better say outside the House 
that Mr. Cappe, who has given his life to this country, is not a 
man of honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, Employment 
Insurance Fund; the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, Banks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to argue against this motion 
introduced by the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with the issue of management, which is what this 
audit is all about.  There is no money missing, as the opposition 
would like people to believe.  It is an issue of management and 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development has already dealt 
with the member's concerns about management.  She has already 
announced her six point plan for dealing with the management 
issues and the administration of the grants and contributions 
program of her department.  She has acknowledged that there are 
some problems that need to be fixed and they are in the process 
of being fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who is seriously interested in improving public 
administration should accept that and recognize that once a 
problem is identified, we get on with fixing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has shown her capacity to act decisively and those 
of us on this side of the House want to get on with it and to 
make sure that these programs are well managed and that Canadians 
continue to benefit from them.  Because, after all, it is 
Canadians who benefit from these programs who we should be 
concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A public inquiry will not do anything to improve the lives of 
those hundreds of thousands of Canadians who are helped by the 
programs delivered by HRDC.  It is important to note that it is 
not the people who use the programs who are calling for a public 
inquiry, it is simply the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear what some of the people who do not 
have a political axe to grind are saying.  These are the people 
to whom members should really be listening because these are the 
people who we were elected to represent in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a couple of examples.  I have quote from a letter 
written by the executive director of the Child Care Connection of 
Nova Scotia.  The letter refers to an HRDC program that supports 
child care research.  It says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—this (HRDC) research and development program is a significant 
means by which the federal government can provide leadership in 
increasing the quality of services and...support the development 
of an infrastructure to deliver child care services to families 
in Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Letters like this one illustrate the kind of support we have for 
these HRDC programs across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example of what Canadians think.  This letter is 
from the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada.  The 
Association has written a letter to the Hon. Jane Stewart to 
acknowledge the support that HRDC provides to help persons with 
disabilities.  The writers urge the minister to remain steadfast 
in the pursuit of her mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not government MPs that I am quoting. 
These are caring Canadians who work with individuals who need our 
help.  These people look to us for help and recognize the value 
and importance of our providing the grants and contributions.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion like this one before us will not help these people.  In 
fact it will work against them.  These people do not care about 
the kinds of issues raised in this opposition motion.  It will 
simply delay any help that those families are waiting for.  They 
are concerned with real answers and answers to real problems. 
How would a public inquiry help them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tempted to say shame of those who want to make a political 
issue out of this.  However, I assume that those who propose 
motions like this do not understand the importance of the 
Government of Canada's grants and contributions to those who 
receive them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that the opposition does not recognize that all 
across Canada, including Quebec, HRDC grants and contribution 
programs are working in partnership with municipalities and their 
governments, with concerned Canadians who help those who depend 
on the Government of Canada for support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From every part of the country we hear from people who know how 
important HRDC grants and contributions are to their well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Edmonton, Alberta we have heard from the Chrysalis Society 
about the value of HRDC's help to persons with disabilities who 
are trying to find work.  We have heard from the Junction Day 
Care Centre in the west end of Toronto about how HRDC funding is 
improving the quality of child care there and for thousands of 
children.  An organization called the Literacy Partners of 
Manitoba based in Winnipeg has also told us that improving 
literacy skills, awareness and resources for adults in Canada is 
vital work for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cases like this all across the country. They are not 
asking for public inquiries and neither are we.  Instead, we want 
to continue to help literacy skills so that Canadians can feel 
comfortable in today's information society. We want to make it 
easier for a person with a disability to find work and 
participate fully in Canadian society.  We want to keep funding 
the work to improve the capacity of our child care facilities to 
provide quality care for our children.  We want to help people 
find jobs and meet the other needs that these programs are aimed 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A public inquiry would not help any of the HRDC clients become 
more literate.  It would not help a person with a disability to 
find a job either.  It would not produce any jobs for people who 
really need them in high areas of unemployment.  In fact, it 
would interfere with our ability to do these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in the development of our human resources is one of 
the most importance things that governments can do.  It is the 
responsibility of the federal government to do this.  I doubt if 
the hundreds of thousands of Canadians whose lives have improved 
because of direct support from our grants and contributions when 
needed would vote for this motion either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has a responsibility to help those who are 
unemployed, to help those disabled and their families to find 
employment and to find usefulness in their lives.  I applaud our 
government.  We recognize that, yes, there are issues and, yes 
there are problems but the minister is fixing those problems. Let 
us continue on with helping people in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Since quite a few members

questions, followed by one minute for answers, and then we will 
see.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not 
know if my Liberal colleague took the time to read the motion 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois on this opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read it to her. It asks: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for the poor management 
seen at the Department of Human Resources Development, 
particularly in the award and use of grants for partisan 
purposes, and that it recommend the creation of an independent 
public commission of inquiry— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear here. We are not criticizing the transitional 
jobs fund. We are criticizing the mismanagement of that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers' money has been used for partisan purposes. Moreover, 
money was taken from workers to build up a surplus in the EI 
fund. That surplus has now grown to approximately $30 billion, 
but the money is being squandered and is not being used to 
create programs for those who need them, including older 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member think of that? Does she find that normal? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Madam Speaker, in answer to those 
comments, I would much rather spend the millions of dollars that 
it would cost for an inquiry into helping Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases, the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and all the 
other provinces of Canada were partners, as this money was spent 
to employ and help Canadians.

there is no one who supports the idea of helping people more than 
I.  I think we need to help people whenever we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the fact that the Prime Minister's riding received 
more money in grants than the entire provinces of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba put together, the fact that some of 
these dealings in the Prime Minister's riding involved some 
pretty shady characters and the fact that many of the grants were 
given to billion dollar organizations like Bombardier and 
Wal-Mart which are doing very well and just happen to be on the 
Liberal donor list, does that not cause any problems in the mind 
of this member?  Does accountability not enter her vocabulary?  I 
am talking about accountability for taxpayer dollars.  Does it 
not matter that these three provinces did not receive nearly as 
much money as one member's riding?  Does this not bother the 
member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Madam Speaker, when we talk about 
accountability and transparency that is exactly what we are doing 
through the minister and the HRDC officials. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for York West for an excellent maiden 
speech.  I know how difficult that is and she did an excellent 
job.  I also want to thank her for mentioning the carpenters' 
union in Manitoba, which is the union I used to lead.  In fact 
the program she mentioned, the literacy program for the 
carpenters, is the program that I initiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member if she is aware that in the area of 
Winnipeg Centre, which I represent, an area where the 
unemployment rate is 14%, we were denied access to any 
transitional jobs funds even though many individuals made 
inquiries to my office asking how they could get in on the 
transitional jobs fund.  They were told over and over again by 
HRDC officials that the overall regional rate of unemployment was 
too low.  We knew nothing about the pockets that everybody has 
referred to.  Is the hon. member aware of that fact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro:</B>  Madam Speaker, what we are talking about 
today is the CJF and TJF funding.  There are thousands of other 
programs that amount to millions of dollars which, from my 
understanding, went to all ridings throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I apologize to the House and to the member for not 
recognizing this as being her maiden speech.  I likewise want to 
congratulate her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Even though this is 
not a point of order, I think all members of the House are behind 
you. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will start off with a point that the hon. member made 
during her answers to questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that she would rather spend the huge amount of 
money, which it would cost for a public inquiry commission, on 
job creation.  I agree with that.  I think the best way to have 
this inquiry would be through the auditor general who already has 
a mandate to investigate and who we could rely on for some 
impartiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a habit of having independent inquiries.  I 
think we should look at this.  We do want to get some kind of 
inquiry on this.  We do have to come to some kind of settlement 
to determine how much political interference there was on this 
and how much cover up there was once the interference had been 
discovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at some of the things the government has held 
public inquiries on in the past.  Does this give us an example of 
something that we could rely on in the case of the HRDC scandal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I was more directly involved with in the last 
parliament was the Pearson Airport inquiry, which was an 
interesting story right from the start.  It began with two 
internal studies that were done by the department and both 
conflicting with the government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bet the Bloc Quebecois members wish they could do what the 
government does. The government just hires someone else, tells 
them what they should say and then gets them to say it. I am sure 
the Bloc members would like to have that kind of power in 
determining the next referendum where that could decide who would 
vote in the referendum and then get the people to vote their way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government named Robert Nixon, a close friend of the Prime 
Minister.  This is supposed to be an independent inquiry so we 
are off to a good start with the word independent.  He is someone 
who worked with the Prime Minister and, as I say, is a close 
personal friend and very heavily and closely connected to the 
Liberal Party.  Even at that, his original report conflicted with 
that of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I should have done this at the start, but at this 
point I would like to announce that I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original Nixon draft report still conflicted with the 
government.  He did not say exactly what the government wanted to 
have him say, so there was a second report that changed that and 
surprise, surprise, it said exactly what the government wanted to 
say.  So much for independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know he is a close friend of the Prime Minister.  Is there 
another connection that we can use in this HRDC situation right 
now?  As a matter of fact there is.  This is a wonderful 
coincidence because Robert Nixon, the independent inquirer for 
the government, is none other than the father of the current 
minister of HRDC who is knee deep if not neck deep in this whole 
scandal.  In fact the question has been asked in the House if the 
current minister of HRDC learned her tricks from the Prime 
Minister and this suggests the fruit fell a little closer to the 
tree than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Mr. Nixon from whom there was an independent 
inquiry, what did he get out of it aside from his fee, which I 
believe was $50,000 but I am not sure on that so do not quote me. 
If during questions and comments hon. members want to say that 
no it was not that, it was $70,000, I will not argue with them. 
Aside from that, what did he get when it was finished?  He became 
the chair of Atomic Energy of Canada.  An independent inquiry. We 
really like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did this independent inquiry cost us?  Not in terms of what 
we paid that individual, but how well did this work for us here 
in parliament to resolve the problems of the House by having an 
independent inquiry done in this manner?  It cost us hundreds of 
millions of taxpayers' dollars because instead of proceeding, as 
all the studies prior to the independent inquiry suggested, by 
getting Pearson airport going, the government instead bought out 
the people involved who in fact were trying to sue the 
government.  It bought them out and spent hundreds of millions of 
dollars just for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were to rebuild terminal two at no cost to the government, 
but what did we get instead?  The government will have to provide 
this money now.  Here we are years later, and if anybody has been 
in terminal two lately, they will see that it has not been 
rebuilt.  In fact, nothing at all has happened except that we are 
out of pocket by hundreds of millions of dollars.  This is the 
way the government works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I would like to have intervened after listening to 
the mad dog act of the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington.  It 
was certainly an interesting performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I believe that the 
hon. member is getting very close to the fine line.  I will 
advise him to please try to be more judicious in choosing his 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will and I apologize.  I 
certainly should not have characterized the hon. member in the 
way that he acted.  That was standing to justification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington said that the House, 
particularly members of the opposition, instead of what we are 
saying should be praising the Minister of HRDC for attempting to 
solve the problems, that she is a great minister and she is 
attempting to solve the problems.  There was some one handed 
clapping on the other side as a result of this. It seems that the 
hon. member's definition of a good minister is one who can solve 
a problem which, if she had done her job, she would not have got 
into in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  An hon. member across the way says that is 
not true, that that does not make her a good minister at all.  I 
bow to the judgment of the hon. member who is now basically 
saying that she is not a good minister.  Far be it from me to 
argue with him on that point.

about job creation.  There is job creation at its pinnacle.  The 
government is filling a need.  First it creates one and then it 
fills it.  It creates it through its oppressive tax regime so 
that companies need help just to survive.  That is terrible.  It 
is absolutely unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in response to some of the other comments that have 
been made in the House by the government, I want to say that I am 
not necessarily opposed to all of these programs.  I will be the 
first to say that my riding has done very well. If hon. members 
would button up long enough, I would tell them about the success 
of the program in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it a success?  I have worked with the HRDC people in my 
riding. They are good people.  There have been no scandals or 
cover-ups. Criteria have been laid down.  The first one is to 
determine if there is a need and if it is going to provide real 
genuine benefits.  We do it to ensure that we never give a 
subsidy to anybody who is going to use it to compete with a 
company that is not subsidized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of things have been going on in the minister's riding? 
Companies have been lured away from a neighbouring riding.  That 
is good job creation.  Funds were used to get a company in the 
garment district into the Prime Minister's riding.  That is an 
interesting conflict.  What about a much needed subsidy for a 
really oppressed company that is struggling to survive and make 
ends meet, Wal-Mart?  Is that not interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear all the cries from the other side.  The crocodile 
tears are coming down.  It is a sorry sight to see the few 
Liberals who are crying out here because they have been caught 
manipulating the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals have an inquiry into this, the kind of inquiry 
they want is one that they control.  They want to appoint the 
person who will make the inquiry.  They want a draft report to 
see if it is appropriately done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take responsibility for its mistakes when 
it makes them.  Nobody expects it to be perfect.  Heaven forbid, 
we certainly do not expect the Liberals to be perfect, but when 
they make a mistake, they should own up.  They should say “yes, 
we made some mistakes but we are going to correct them.  Let us 
move on.  We are sorry and we will not do it again”.   Had they 
done that, it probably would have been okay but no, they had to 
deny it, blame others and cover it up. That is not the way the 
government should respond to the waste of Canadian taxpayers' 
dollars. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
wish I had more time to respond to the absolutely ridiculous 
rhetoric which has been brought forward in the House today by the 
member from the Reform Party.  These typical ultra right-wing 
positions, this rhetoric is divisive.  The Reform Party is very 
clearly trying to divide Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot use the words I want to because they are not 
parliamentary and are not supposed to be used in the House, but 
when the hon. member speaks there should be exceptions in that 
case.  He has made statements that quite simply are not factual. 
Wal-Mart did not receive one cent yet he is trying to convince 
Canadians that it did.  He made statements that were not based on 
fact.  At the same time I see him grinning and smiling. He thinks 
it is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is that Canadians are being misled.  It is not 
right.  There is no scandal.  The only scandal is the fact that 
there is an ultra right-wing party in the House so bent on 
destroying the social fibre of the nation that it will say 
whatever it takes to get Canadians to support it.  At the end of 
the day I think we have witnessed how Canadians perceive the 
Reform Party.  We saw the drop it took in the polls.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, in fact I would beg, the hon. member to make use of 
the facts and have an open mind.  There has been enough 
right-wing rhetoric and political posturing.  Day after day I 
have sat in the House and heard the hon. members simply denounce 
the facts.  It is just not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would hon. members please try to have an open mind for once in 
this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be more than happy 
to respond to the hon. member.  He is right.  I was kind of 
smiling.  I am sorry.  I got carried away.  When I hear nonsense 
I do tend to laugh at it.  It is considered the best defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would suggest that although it is likely that the hon. 
member does not appreciate parliamentary language, nonsense is 
not an appropriate term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I do not think that 
the word nonsense is unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, I assure you that in using 
the word nonsense I was trying to be polite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear things like ultra right-wing because we want to examine a 
scandal that the hon. member says does not exist.  He said there 
is no scandal, that everything is fine in Liberal land.  If that 
is the case, why are there 19 RCMP criminal investigations going 
into misconduct in the handling of these funds? 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, there are members of the 
opposition Reform Party, such as my hon. colleague, the member 
from Yorkton, who did a lot of good work on the HRD committee. 
Members worked across the country on behalf of all Canadians. I 
challenge these other members to come forth and tell us how they 
also joined us in doing a lot of this good work on behalf of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member of the Reform Party who just 
spoke.  Members of the opposition have accused our government and 
our minister of political interference.  How can the member 
explain the fact that several ridings held by the Reform Party 
received much more money than did any riding on this side of the 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member's preface to 
his question asks why anybody on this side of the House does not 
stand and talk about the successes in the program. Obviously he 
did not listen to my speech because I did just that.  I said that 
my riding has done extremely well and is the second highest 
recipient of these funds in the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in their ridings is that they are inappropriately 
handed out, not all of them, but certainly in some particular 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, because of the scandal of the minister and the 
Prime Minister, they had to do an audit.  The audit was done 
early on in my riding.  It was completely clear and there was 
absolutely no problem.  The program has resumed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting listening to the hon. member who spoke out 
previously.  He does not want to listen.  He asks the questions 
on behalf of his other colleagues and does not answer them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the Bloc motion today.  At 
the outset, the objective of the motion and of all of the people 
in the opposition, is to make sure that taxpayers' money is being 
spent wisely.  That is the beginning and end of this motion. I 
will articulate how and why this motion came about, and the 
reason the opposition parties have been so critical of the 
government over the last month and a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion condemns the government for the very poor management 
of the Department of Human Resources Development which was 
brought to the attention of the minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion can actually be used as a stepping stone to describe 
growth and widespread abuse by the government of the taxpayers' 
money.  This is not the government's money.  It is the taxpayers' 
money and I am going to demonstrate how and why that happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the grants put forth by HRDC supposedly to rescue 
jobs, save jobs and make jobs.  We would agree that has to happen 
in this country, but we disagree on how it happens.  Where were 
those jobs created? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example is in the minister's own riding.  It has one of the 
lowest unemployment rates in the country.  The Minister of Human 
Resources Development received grants that were three times the 
national average.  Why is it that the Minister of HRD, whose 
riding has unemployment rates much lower than the national 
average, received grants three times higher than the national 
average?  Why is that so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the Prime Minister's riding received more grant money than 
that of any prairie province.  We have seen the devastation that 
has been wrought upon the farmers in the prairies.  We have seen 
that farmers, the salt of the earth of this country, have lost 
their farms, their homes, their families, their jobs and their 
futures and lost hope.  Yet, HRD pours money into the riding of 
the Prime Minister or that of the Minister of HRD, which has a 
rate of unemployment far less than the average and far less than 
in the prairie provinces which have been crying out for help for 
so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRD officials say that they were forced to break the rules and 
instructed to approve grants in the Prime Minister's riding.  If 
that is not enough to make the public go ballistic, then I do not 
know what is.  That is part of the reason why we and other 
parties have been bringing this issue to the front.  We want this 
problem fixed and we want it fixed now.  We are sick and tired of 
the half answers or no answers that we have been getting for so 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only HRD.  Let us take a look at the Export 
Development Corporation.  This crown corporation uses the 
taxpayers' money to loan funds to Canadian companies.  But who 
does it lend to?  It lends to 5% of the companies that export, 
which represents less than 10% of the companies in the country 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of companies?  Bombardier.  Bombardier received $1 
billion in loans.  Bombardier, which has $5.6 billion in assets 
and $11 billion in revenues, received a $1 billion indirect loan 
through EDC to support Amtrak.  The Canadian government supported 
$1 billion of the taxpayers' money to be given to Amtrak, an 
American company that the U.S. government would not even put 
money into because it has been running deficits for a long time. 
That is what the EDC has done.  That is what the government has 
done with the taxpayers' money.  The public should be aware that 
it is out there slaving away and its money is being used to put 
into an American company, Amtrak.  That company has lost billions 
of dollars and the U.S. government has said it is not going to 
give it any money.  Yet EDC steps in with Canadian taxpayers' 
resources and says it is going to give money to Bombardier, which 
makes $11.5 billion, so it can get a contract.  What 
justification is there for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What justification is there for the Canadian government using 
the taxpayers' money to give money to China, which is building a 
superheated military complex as we speak and which has a $5 
billion surplus with Canada?  We have given money to it to do 
what?  We have given money to it so it can build the Three Gorges 
dam which sits on a fault line.  The Canadian government is 
loaning China money to build the Three Gorges dam on an 
earthquake fault line.  The U.S. said it would not have anything 
to do with this program.  The World Bank said it would not have 
anything to do with it.  It is rife with corruption.  It is an 
environmental disaster currently and waiting to happen.  It is 
going to displace 1.3 million people.  Yet what does the Canadian 
government government do?  It takes millions of dollars of the 
Canadian taxpayers' money and loans it to China, which is 
building a superheated military complex as we speak.  We do not 
have enough money to buy choppers. 
We do not have enough money to buy search and rescue and 
anti-submarine warfare choppers.  Our military people are falling 
out of the sky in choppers that are 25 plus years old.  On the 
other hand the Canadian government is saying to China, “We'll 
give you money to invest in the Three Gorges Dam that the U.S. 
has walked away from, that the World Bank has walked away from”. 
That is what the government is doing with Canadian taxpayers' 
money.  That is what the government is doing with the money that 
Canadians have slaved for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else has happened?  With respect to the Three Gorges Dam 
the Prime Minister violated the Export Development Corporation's 
own environmental code of conduct and said “We're going to 
invest money in this project”, completely ignoring the comments 
by the non-governmental organizations, by international 
observers, by the World Bank.  When those organizations chose not 
to go, and for obvious reasons, Canada chose to lend Canadian 
taxpayers' money. If that is not rot, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the money, there is $22 billion in outstanding 
loans from EDC.  Who is on the hook for this?  What does the EDC 
do?  It loans money on the good name of the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  It makes money.  There is a 
profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  The Minister of National Defence says 
it earns a profit.  Let us take a look at that.  There is $22 
billion in loans outstanding.  The auditor general does not know 
where that money is.  $2.8 billion of Canadian taxpayers' money 
has been forgiven.  They do not know where this money has been 
loaned and they cannot get it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore the EDC, under the rules that the government agrees 
to, is forbidden to have access to information requests.  We 
cannot find out what is happening in EDC.  The public cannot find 
out what is happening in EDC with their money.  Parliament cannot 
find out what is happening in the EDC.  Yet the EDC sees in its 
good ways to lose $2.8 billion of taxpayers' money, and for what? 
So it can give it to China while our people in the armed forces 
cannot even put a roof over their heads half the time, while the 
private married quarters are falling down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with the Canadian Police Association today in my riding in 
Colwood.  They do not even have enough money to put their cars on 
the road.  The RCMP does not have enough money to put cars on the 
road when they break down.  In Vancouver they do not have money 
to put cars on the road.  In east Vancouver, which is one area 
that is rife with crime, they do not have enough money for 
policing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an acute gross shortage of police officers in this 
country.  Why?  Because there is not enough money.  What does the 
government do?  The government takes the Canadian taxpayers' 
money and says “We're not going to invest in our military. We're 
not going to invest in our police force.  We're not going to give 
the hepatitis C people a package”, which is currently $95 
million short.  These are the people who were infected innocently 
in the hepatitis C scandal that is $95 million short which the 
government saw fit to exclude in its compensation package.  While 
the government will not even spend that for Canadians who are 
sick with hepatitis C, it sees fit to lose $2.8 billion to 
foreign companies, foreign governments, foreign agencies, the 
Chinese government and American companies that have lost money 
and on and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on but I welcome questions from the other 
side. Suffice it to say our objective in the Reform Party is to make 
sure that the Canadian dollar is spent wisely and what money is 
there is going to be used for creating jobs and that the government 
stop wasting Canadian taxpayers' money.

Madam Speaker, I listened to the various members who spoke in 
the House today. The last speaker gave another example of where the 
government seems to have mismanaged taxpayers' money. It really 
looks like the Liberal government is not operating in a 
transparent way and in conformity with sound management 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree that people be 
appointed by this House to conduct an independent public inquiry 
into what happened? We know that the future always depends on 
the past. If we want to know what the Liberals did wrong, I 
think we need such an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> Madam Speaker, the situation in Quebec hospitals is 
currently very serious. They have no money to care for patients. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cancer patients in Quebec who are waiting 14 weeks for treatment 
are being sent south of the border because the province of Quebec 
does not have the money to pay for their treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the money in HRD was spent wisely, we would not have a 
problem.  We hear the question: Why waste billions of dollars 
through HRD, EDC or CIDA?  Why not make sure the money is spent 
wisely and maybe money will be left over so the patients in 
Quebec will have an opportunity to receive the medical treatment 
they require? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I would completely agree to a public inquiry into the 
spending of HRDC.  I would extend it to involve CIDA, HRDC, EDC 
and aboriginal affairs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments made by my hon. colleague.  I would like 
him to comment on one thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the Liberals over and over again are saying there is no 
problem, there is no money missing.  Yet, the question is 
obvious.  Why did the auditor general bring this problem to our 
attention a year ago?  Why did officials in the human resources 
department call for an internal audit?  Why have these things 
taken place if in fact there is no problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are probably much more engaged in damage control 
and trying to smooth this issue over than to acknowledge the fact 
that there is a huge mismanagement of grant money and I would 
like my hon. colleague to comment on this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Elk Island for his very germane question.  He is absolutely 
right. The members on the other side of the House should have a 
deep interest in ensuring that money that is available is spent 
wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is an apolitical institution. The auditor 
general is a man who has been giving very good advice for a long 
period of time to all governments to ensure that Canadian 
taxpayers' money is spent wisely.  Is his advice ever adhered to? 
No, it is not.  In fact, that is part of the problem.  Despite 
the very effective solutions which the AG puts forth, the 
government completely ignores them.  Why?  Because the 
disposition of money has become highly politicized within the 
government. All members in the Liberal Party should be very 
concerned about this to make sure taxpayer money is spent wisely. 
If it is spent wisely, they will benefit politically and, more 
importantly, their constituents and all constituents will benefit 
effectively from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask them to put away the partisan padding and the pork 
barrelling and use the money wisely.  It would be in the 
government's best interest to pursue this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the Chamber in 
support of the hon. member and his Bill C-244 with respect to the 
taking of blood samples.  The bill reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act to provide for the taking of samples of blood for the 
benefit of persons administering and enforcing the law and good 
Samaritans and to amend the Criminal Code. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important and very timely piece of legislation 
that has been brought forward.  The hon. member deserves a great 
deal of credit for taking the initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently police officers, firefighters, ambulance attendants, 
nurses and many others involved in similar professions can 
accidentally or deliberately be contaminated by another person's 
bodily fluids while performing their professional duties, 
emergency first aid or other lifesaving procedures; that is to 
say, what is expected of them.  The very nature of their jobs 
puts them very much potentially in harm's way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could also happen to a good Samaritan, an example being in 
the performance of CPR or in the performance of attending to an 
individual who has been injured and where blood and bodily fluids 
might be transferred accidentally.  This is about encouraging the 
humanitarian aid of both those in the profession where they do so 
in the normal course of business and those who, as good 
Samaritans, might choose to lend assistance or help to a person 
in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to imagine in any great detail how commonplace 
this has become across the country.  We can all envision an 
accident scene where individuals, sadly, because of the fear of 
contact with disease or the fear of somehow putting their own 
health at risk, might be reluctant to become involved and be 
reluctant to aid an individual who is in dire straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a very practical approach that would, at the very 
least, protect individuals who, by virtue of their good and 
humanitarian acts of assistance, may have made contact with a 
victim. The bill would give them the ability to find out whether 
the individual who is harmed, the victim, has contracted or is 
suffering from an illness that could be spread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a piece of legislation that is worthy of support in the 
House.  It was brought forward, I am sure, with the very best 
intentions and it is one that the Progressive Conservative Party 
of Canada will support. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT101"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT101"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1850
<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the timeliness of this motion based on the fact that 
members of the Canadian Police Association were on the Hill today 
meeting with members of parliament.  Their lobby efforts on 
behalf of the police and community have become very fruitful and 
positive.  They met individually with members of parliament to 
raise awareness of issues that affect them.  By virtue of 
affecting them, it has widespread implications right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, therefore, is timely in the sense that members of 
the police association are very much in support of this because 
of how it affects their operations and their day to day 
interactions with the general public.  They are in favour of this 
and other very important motions that affect not only their 
profession but Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the performance of their duty, police officers and people in 
other professions could, either accidentally or deliberately, 
become infected as a result of the actions of an unintended 
victim.  Sadly, there are instances where individuals, who have 
knowledge of their infection, deliberately try to spread it by 
biting a police officer or by using a syringe that might have 
been contaminated with HIV or another such illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, police officers, firefighters and those in the 
medical profession, such as practitioners and nurses, are 
particularly susceptible to exposure and are in high risk 
positions by virtue of their day to day practise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that said, it is incumbent on us, as members of parliament, 
particularly in areas of justice where we can draft legislation 
and change the existing provisions of the criminal code and other 
statutes, to protect and support those brave souls who are 
putting themselves in harm's way on behalf of the public. 
Legislation such as this would do just that and would help to 
achieve that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a high risk person is well within his or her right to 
refuse, for example, to supply a sample of blood.  However, this 
legislation would prevent that refusal.  Obviously, there are 
considerations as to privacy which certainly warrants protection 
under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us draw a similar analogy.   As it currently stands with 
respect to the need to protect the public, there is the ability 
to take a breath sample because of the carnage that results from 
impaired driving.  There is the ability to get a warrant, for 
example, to take a blood sample in the pursuit of a criminal 
investigation.  Similarly, there is the ability to demand a blood 
sample with respect to impaired driving.  There are provisions 
that override an individual's right to protection for refusing to 
give a sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blood analysis or a similar type of sample has to be given where 
there is a risk to an individual who has, by virtue of his or her 
profession or by virtue of simple humanitarian altruistic 
efforts, potentially been exposed.  Why should we not do 
everything in our power to ensure that person is encouraged and 
supported in the effort that he or she has made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the consent, the victim must undergo a series of 
chemical cocktails within the first six hours of the incident in 
an attempt to stop the spread of an undisclosed disease by a 
person who may have transferred this either intentionally or 
unintentionally.  Again, it puts a much higher and onerous burden 
on the person who has put himself or herself on the line in an 
attempt to do his or her job or to help a struggling person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that everyone understands, these types of chemical cocktails 
are very powerful drugs that often have serious side effects.  If 
it can be known at the earliest possible instance whether there 
is a need to undergo this process or no need at all and that 
could be determined quite quickly through a blood a sample, this 
would assist in the protection of the person who has rendered 
that assistance and undertaken that task. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the timeliness.  There are six hours in which to 
make the decision of whether or not it is necessary to provide 
the chemical cocktail.  It is not necessarily an antidote or it 
is not necessarily going to do the job, but at the very least it 
provides hope that it might somehow stave off the side effects 
and the long term effects of contracting one of the serious 
communicable diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has caused concern not only in the professional world but 
obviously it is something that subconsciously now is very much in 
the public's mind when it comes to acting in good faith and 
rendering assistance to those in need who have been injured, 
particularly where there has been bloodshed.  The most telling 
and obvious example is in performing mouth to mouth 
resuscitation, when CPR is administered.  There is the potential 
to contract a communicable disease just by virtue of rendering 
that breath of life.  The altruistic effort to safe a person 
might result in potential long term suffering or loss of life for 
the good Samaritan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-244 would at least allow the protection and give that 
person the knowledge as to whether they have paid that terrible 
price.  It would allow them to react appropriately and try to 
prevent or to minimize the effects of what disease they may have 
contracted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has caused concern across the country.  We have received 
numerous letters in support of the legislation.  For example, the 
Canadian Corps of Commissionaires Nova Scotia division has spoken 
in favour of the bill.  The Canadian Resource Centre for Victims 
of Crime has written in support, as have the Canadian ski patrol 
system and paramedics. The list goes on and on.  There is very 
broad support for the bill brought forward by the hon. member. 
We in the Conservative Party are in complete support of it. I 
mentioned previously the support of the Canadian Police 
Association and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No qualified medical practitioner or qualified technician is 
guilty of an offence only by reason of a refusal to take a blood 
sample from a person for the purpose of the act.  There is no 
criminal or civil liability for anything necessarily done with 
reasonable care and skill in the taking of blood samples.  There 
are protections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals should have confidence that the system is there to 
support them.  Integrity and safeguards are in place. Bill C-244 
is not an infringement of a person's human rights. I have already 
referred to current sections of the criminal code that compel a 
person to submit blood samples.  For those reasons, and I am sure 
more that will be sussed out in the course of this debate, we 
will be in support of the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to strongly 
support Bill C-244, the blood samples act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly commend the House leader of the official 
opposition for introducing the bill. It is very timely and 
effective.  I highly appreciate that the bill has been introduced 
and I am sure all members in the House will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the blood samples act is to protect good 
Samaritans, health professionals and the front line emergency 
service providers should they be accidentally or deliberately 
exposed to another person's bodily fluids while performing their 
professional duties, emergency first aid or other lifesaving 
procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very timely bill because those front line officers and 
people who are there to protect other citizens need protection 
themselves.  The blood samples will help them.  They will not 
have to go through the unnecessary hardship of having to take 
medicine and having to experience the side effects until a virus 
and antibodies show that the person was affected by a disease 
such as HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that the blood samples which will be 
ordered by a judge of the court will be taken and not used for 
any purpose other than for the intended purpose. 
It would not infringe on the Privacy Act or the confidentiality 
of the person because under this bill the blood sample would be 
used for the intended purpose.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of that knowledge, not only would the person 
suffer from very serious side effects, it would also put 
emotional stress on the frontline emergency personnel, the police 
officers and people in other agencies.  They would encounter 
shock.  They would have to deal with the families, the wives, the 
children and the co-workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers, firefighters, emergency response personnel and 
good Samaritans are at risk and should be entitled to reasonable 
information, protection and peace of mind in order that they can 
make informed decisions with respect to precaution and treatment 
to protect themselves and their loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation could be tailored to meet the concerns of good 
Samaritans and emergency personnel, while respecting and 
balancing the legitimate privacy and security issues of the 
source person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support this legislation and I look forward to seeing 
it become a permanent fixture in our criminal code and the 
judicial system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
one of the joys of sitting on the private members' subcommittee 
is that I get to hear detailed pitches for virtually every 
private member's bill that comes to the House.  I probably heard 
the hon. member speak in favour of the bill long before it was 
brought to the attention of the House.  At the time I think he 
made extremely valid arguments as to why this piece of 
legislation was required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we give it a bit of thought, I think in the last 15 or 20 
years blood related and blood transmitted diseases have appeared 
that were not around when the criminal code was crafted or 
amended the last time.  I think it is a very timely piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be a bit careful in terms of describing this as a 
panacea.  There are cases where, let us say, someone may have 
contracted HIV who was involved in one of these scuffles, but if 
they are still in the incubation period it may not show up in 
their tests.  Issues need to be hammered out.  However, 
absolutely those concerns are very minor compared to the thrust 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Fraser Valley.  I believe that the 
bill belongs in the committee.  From what I have heard from some 
of the previous speakers who are members of the justice 
committee, I think they are in a good position to come to terms 
with what needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting the bill.  I would encourage the member to 
let the debate collapse, because if he waits for his third hour 
we will be into May and I think it is important that we get the 
bill before the committee as soon as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, if 
there are no other speakers I would like a minute or two to 
summarize the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Madam Speaker, it appears as a bit of a 
surprise to me in many ways that the debate is likely to collapse 
at this time.  Therefore, I wish to thank the many speakers who 
have taken part in the debate for their encouraging words.  I 
recognize and all along I have said that there are other issues 
which need to be hammered out in committee.  I do not pretend 
that perfection ever comes to a bill in its first reading. 
However, I thank members for their general support for the drift 
of the bill, for the idea behind it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to mention two cases in particular.  One is the young 
gentleman in my riding, whom I named Tim, who actually spurred me 
on to get this bill on the order paper.  He was a young guy, 17 
years old, who went through six months of intensive cocktail 
chemical treatment as a precaution against becoming infected.  He 
was a good Samaritan who had just done his job as a good citizen. 
He had helped the police in an arrest and in so doing was 
covered with blood.  Because of the current laws he had no way of 
knowing whether the blood was contaminated. 
It is his story as the first one that spurred me on to bring this 
bill into the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other example is someone who is with us tonight, a police 
officer by the name of Isobel Anderson.  She has been brave 
beyond belief, in my opinion, to bring this issue forward and to 
use the story of her personal tragedy.  She went through trauma 
as an individual police officer not knowing whether or not the 
blood on a needle which she had come in contact with was 
infected.  Her story, her bravery and her consistency in getting 
this message out has been a good part of why the bill has 
received such wide support.  I want to thank her tonight. She is 
up in the gallery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that all parties will see fit to support the bill and 
send it to committee.  It is there where we can all do our work 
to make this an even better bill for the protection of our front 
line workers, our police officers, our firefighters, our people 
on the front line and the good Samaritans who help them in the 
commission of their good work for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is the House ready 
for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is it the pleasure of 
the House to adopt the motion?

may not be very familiar with the procedure when debates come to 
an end that way, but I would have liked the record to read it 
was agreed to but on division. I am not too sure what happened 
because it went so fast I had trouble with the translation. I 
would like the record to—

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Madam Speaker, I recently 
rose in this House to ask a question to the Speaker about the 
fact that in 1986 the auditor general recommended that the 
unemployment insurance account be integrated with the 
government's general funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Tuesday, the auditor general criticized the size of the 
surplus in the employment insurance fund and indicated that it 
should not exceed a maximum of $15 billion, instead of the 
current $25 billion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now about $28 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government listen to the auditor general, as it did in 
1986, and reduce the size of the surplus by increasing the 
number of unemployed who can qualify? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed by the reply of the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, since the beginning we have continually lowered 
employment insurance contributions. In 1993, these contributions 
were at $3.07, while today they are at $2.40. This is progress 
and we will continue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it regrettable, because the question had to do with the 
increase in the number of unemployed. In Canada, only 30% of 
women qualify for employment insurance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 15% of young people qualify for employment insurance, and 
the government says this is to encourage them to find jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what this means? It means that in my region, the 
Atlantic region, for example, in our fishing communities, the 
Liberal government is telling young people that they do cannot 
remain in Atlantic Canada and should move somewhere else in 
Canada. We are losing all our young people because of 
discrimination in the EI system. A young person who is a 
newcomer on the labour market must accumulate 910 hours of work 
to qualify, while someone who is already on the labour market 
only has to accumulate 420 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general said that too much money already, or 
$15 billion, has been transferred from the employment insurance 
account to the general funds. I saw no one in Canada take to the 
streets because employment insurance contributions were too 
high. Thousands took to the streets, however, because they no 
longer qualified for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saturday evening, the Prime Minister of Canada admitted that he 
had gone too far with his cuts to employment insurance and that 
this was why he had lost the election in the Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleague does not answer the same way his colleague 
did during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberal caucus of the Atlantic region made a proposal, 
during the Liberal convention held in Ottawa last week-end, to 
change employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government not recognize that it has hurt many 
Canadians throughout the country with the changes it has brought 
to employment insurance? The issue is not contributions to 
employment insurance, but rather the cuts to employment 
insurance that have hurt Canadians and, Canadian women in 
particular, with only 30% of women and 15% of young people 
qualifying for employment insurance. Those people contribute to 
the EI fund. They pay contributions, yet they are not eligible 
to benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have the opinion of the government on that. I 
hope not to hear the same things I have been hearing for the 
past few months. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in the <I>Economic and Fiscal Update</I> of last 
fall, the government announced it had agreed to set the 
employment insurance premium at $2.40 for the year 2000, as the 
employment insurance commissioners had unanimously agreed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the sixth consecutive year that employment insurance 
premiums had been reduced, from $3.07 to $2.40, for a total 
reduction of 67 cents since 1994, or a $260 annual saving for 
the average worker.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to say a few words about a question I had asked 
in the House back on December 2 of the last millennium to do with 
the banks. 
In 1999 the banks in this country made $9 billion in profits.  I 
am concerned about what the government will do to protect jobs in 
the banking industry and ensure branches are not needlessly 
closed in many communities around this country.  Banks are 
announcing the closure of branches in various parts of Canada and 
many people are being thrown out of work.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also concerned that despite these huge profits, we are 
seeing closures and a lot of the profits are going to the highly 
paid chief executive officers of the banks.  The 24 top CEOs of 
the banks in this country received remuneration in excess last 
year of $250 million.  That is 24 people and $250 million, 
equivalent to the salaries of some 12,000 bank tellers. This 
tells us the priorities of the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions 
responded to a question, but I thought his answer could have been 
a bit more forthcoming in terms of what he said.  The main issue 
is to protect the jobs of the people who are working in our banks 
and to protect the communities that are served by some of these 
banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fairly pleased with the Bank of Montreal in my province of 
Saskatchewan and in the province of Alberta. The Bank of Montreal 
announced a month ago that it was going to close over 30 
branches. This was going to be done by selling the branches to 
the local credit union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan some 17 Bank of Montreal branches in small towns 
and villages in the main park have been sold to 15 credit unions. 
These credit unions will expand by using some of the customer 
base of the Bank of Montreal.  In two of these communities a Bank 
of Montreal building will be renovated and changed into a credit 
union.  In the other case two of them will be amalgamated into 
one.  The people in these communities will have service available 
to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 63 people working in these 17 branches of the Bank of 
Montreal.  As part of the agreement for buying this business, the 
credit union will offer employment to each and every one of these 
63 people.  They will now be working for a credit union or in 
some cases taking early retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these branches are very small.  One only has one 
employee.  But the fact that it is small does not mean it is not 
an important institution to a lot of people in a small rural 
town.  This is a move in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see leadership from the government to make sure 
that when the other banks decide to close branches, there will be 
some service to the people in those communities.  Maybe we should 
look at what the United States has done.  It has a community 
reinvestment act which gives some power to direct some of the 
funds which banks raise in communities right back into the 
communities and indeed in some places, there is some power given 
to the community to try to prevent the closure of a bank which is 
serving people in a particular area.  This is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also important is the protection of jobs of the people who work 
in the financial services industry.  This is also very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks can afford to be more generous and more flexible. They 
can afford to concentrate more on service.  They made $9 billion 
in profits last year and those profits are still coming in very 
nicely.  The CIBC just announced that in its first quarter the 
results are anticipated to be about 25% to 30% better than it had 
expected.  The TD bank has said that its earnings are up by 42% 
from last year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my hon. friend has expressed 
his concern regarding the fact that several of Canada's large 
banks have decided to reduce their workforce even though their 
combined profits reached $9 billion last year.  He calls upon the 
government to prevent job losses and branch closures. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to create and to protect jobs is to have efficient 
and competitive businesses. This goes also for financial 
institutions such as banks. A strong, efficient and profitable 
financial sector is essential to our economic well-being. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government announced a new policy framework for 
the financial services sector last June.  This is a 
comprehensive, balanced and fair package of reforms that promotes 
efficiency, growth and job creation in the sector.  It also 
fosters domestic competition and empowers consumers to ensure 
that the sector remains responsive to the needs of Canadians. 
This new framework includes measures to ensure that banks have 
the flexibility they need to compete at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect banks to make their own business decisions, but at the 
same time we also expect them to take responsibility for them. 
That is why we intend to introduce a branch closure process for 
banks and public accountability statements for all large 
financial institutions.  The branch closure process will give 
communities time to react and adjust to the closure of a bank 
branch in their area.  It provides a minimum of four months 
notice of a closure, extended to six months for the last branch 
in that community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its annual public accountability statements, large financial 
institutions will be called upon to describe their contributions 
to communities, including their levels of employment and their 
branch openings and closings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents a fair balance between the banks' need to 
compete and the needs of consumers and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
