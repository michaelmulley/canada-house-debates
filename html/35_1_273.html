	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to present the 107th report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in relation to the 
operating budget and the vote structure in the estimates.
<P>
	Treasury Board officials presented a document entitled 
``Operating Budget and the Vote Structure''. This document 
explains the reasons for altering an aspect of the votes in the 
estimates and proposes that a new operating expenditures vote be 
introduced for the 1996-97 main estimates. The new vote would 
contain items of minor capital expenditure currently included in 
separate capital votes. Parliament would be presented with a more 
accurate view of the way departments and agencies expend the 
funds which are allocated to them. The proposed change is an 
interim measure that will be in place until the government adopts a 
new accounting system.
<P>
	Officials of the office of the auditor general have advised the 
subcommittee of the procedure and House affairs committee that 
the change being proposed by the Treasury Board Secretariat is 
largely administrative in nature and that it is designed to make it 
easier to manage government departments and agencies. The 
subcommittee was assured that Parliament's ability to scrutinize 
and approve the expenditure plans of the government would not be 
diminished by a change of this kind.
<P>
	I am pleased to present the report. There is no need for 
concurrence, Mr. Speaker, as it is simply for the information of

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to not enter into any binding trilateral 
aboriginal treaty or land claim agreements in B.C. in the last year of the current 
provincial government mandate in order to respect the views of British 
Columbians on this issue as expressed by both major provincial opposition 
parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the Reform Party had concerns about 
this matter before today. For example, on October 30 I asked the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development a question. 
On November 27 I asked a similar question of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans. I have also pursued this same subject in 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	The question I put to the minister on October 30 concerned the 
polls in British Columbia which now rate aboriginal issues as the 
number one issue. Among the provincial political parties, there 
certainly is a growing divergence of views on aboriginal issues. We 
now have an NDP administration which is in the waning days of its 
mandate.
<P>
	The question I put to the minister was whether he would assure 
the House that he will not entertain completion of any 
comprehensive agreement, such as the Nisga'a claim, until there is 
a new provincial administration with a fresh mandate. The 
response from  the minister included the fact that the Reform 
member was asking not to do anything until the non-Nisga'a 
government changed in British Columbia and he certainly was not 
prepared to do that.
<P>
	In addition, there is a major divergence of opinion on costs 
which was a supplementary to that question. The provincial 
government says that the cost of settling claims in British 
Columbia will be about $10 billion and the federal government 
says it will be about $5 billion. This divergence of views is 
something of which we should take note. We are talking billions 
not millions.
<P>
	On November 27 my question for the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans dealt with the apparent intended agreement on the Nass. I 
say apparent intended because everything is based on leaks. We do 
not have open negotiations. We do not have transparency. The only 
things we know are based on leaks. However, there apparently is an 
agreement to include some of the Nass fishery in the Nisga'a 
agreement. I wanted the minister's assurance that the Nass River 
commercial fishery would not be entrenched in a treaty which 
would then get further entrenched constitutionally, and be 
unchangeable, socially divisive and the very opposite of free 
enterprise. Once again, I received no substantive response from the 
minister.
<P>
	This is no longer an emerging issue in British Columbia. This is 
an established issue. The transformation happened over the last 
three years. It is considered to be an issue which has gone off the 
track. Public concerns are driving a re-examination of all of the 
basic assumptions underlying the treaty or land claims process in 
British Columbia.
<P>
	I can give a thumbnail summary of some of these concerns. This 
issue has tremendous long term implications and ramifications; 
socially, financially and in other ways. The issue has parallels with 
B.C. concerns about what many call the disunity bill that the House 
has been debating very recently and where we have seen closure 
adopted. There are many parallels here. It invokes, for example, 
special status, whereas the public is demanding the principle of 
equality.
<P>
	The whole question of public ratification of the government's 
aboriginal initiative has not been sought. This has all been done 
within a cloistered environment. Neither the provincial nor federal 
governments has involved the public in establishing the goals and 
objectives of the treaty process in British Columbia.
<P>
	At this time I should give a background to the negotiations going 
on in B.C. We have the Nisga'a negotiations which have been 
going on for many years. There is a framework agreement which 
was signed in March 1991. There are many who say that the 
openness associated with this agreement was really closed off in 
1991. That is a very self-serving analysis of the agreement by some 
of the bureaucracy and by some government parties.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17349"> 17349 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Clause 7.1.1 of the agreement states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The parties will, together, develop and implement a process of public 
information and consultation and will attend meetings with such selected 
individuals, organizations or groups as they may agree will assist in the process 
of public consensus building.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is a real stretch to suggest that any of that in terms of the 
Nisga'a negotiations has occurred. The Nisga'a agreement is the 
closest to completion in the province and is a major focus of 
today's opposition motion.
<P>
	There are some major concerns which are front and centre with 
the Nisga'a negotiations. One is the Nass River fishery which I 
have already mentioned. This is a public resource. Last week there 
were five British Columbia aboriginal fishery test cases argued in 
the Supreme Court.
<P>
	There is an outstanding class action suit from commercial 
fishermen involving the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. The 
outcome, if anything, would appear to rule against an aboriginal 
right to a commercial fishery.
<P>
	This is not so much an issue of allocation of commercial 
licences. It is an issue of treaty entrenchment leading to 
constitutional entrenchment and protection of a commercial 
aboriginal fishery which would be in many people's minds and in 
my mind socially divisive and the antithesis of free enterprise.
<P>
	Another major concern deals with costs. If we look at the costs 
involved in the Nisga'a agreement, once again we are dealing only 
with leaks. We never know where these leaks originate. They may 
be self-serving leaks, they may not be. This is one of the problems 
with the lack of transparency.
<P>
	I put out a press release in November. I talked about some of the 
statements which have been made very recently on the Nisga'a 
offer and which were reported in the popular press. Back in March 
when I was doing a series of town hall meetings in British 
Columbia, I had taken the known offer of the day and extrapolated 
it to British Columbia using the Nisga'a example as a precedent. I 
said that the total compensation package would work out to $8.5 
billion. At that time the Reform Party was accused of extrapolating 
figures from various sources in order to scare the British Columbia 
public.
<P>
	In October the minister of aboriginal affairs within the province 
of B.C. said publicly that the cost of land claim settlements in 
British Columbia would be $10 billion. According to the leaks, the 
Nisga'a offer had grown between March and October. This is 
consistent with what I was saying back in March.
<P>
	According to the latest leaks in the Nisga'a offer we are talking 
about a turnover of 2,200 square kilometres of land, a significant 
forest resource, $175 million cash and 30 per cent of the Nass River 
fishery. I might point  out that other bands also have claims on part 
of the Nass River fishery.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	When we talk about this total cost package of $10 billion as 
stated by the provincial minister, at the same time the director 
general from the federal ministry said that he was baffled by the 
number and said that the cost of the settlement was closer to $5 
billion. Either he knows something we do not know or I know not 
what. Maybe he is only talking about the federal component. 
According to the way I calculate it, it is about a 50:50 split 
provincially and federally. That is a very significant difference and 
one that should concern the public and the government.
<P>
	Against the backdrop of these Nisga'a precedent setting 
background negotiations, we also have the B.C. treaty process. We 
talked about that in the House not too long ago with Bill C-107 the 
enabling legislation from the federal end to set up the B.C. Treaty 
Commission.
<P>
	The Nisga'a negotiations are not part of the B.C. treaty process 
in terms of the treaty commission. They predate it and are not 
subject to the same terms of reference. The B.C. Treaty 
Commission has only been in place since 1993.
<P>
	An estimated 77 per cent of the British Columbia bands are 
currently involved in the process. There is a total of 196 bands in 
British Columbia. The other 23 per cent of British Columbia bands 
are not part of the B.C. treaty process and they have no other 
option. They either go with this process or they are left out. This is 
problematic for that other 23 per cent.
<P>
	In July 1993 the federal and provincial governments announced 
the establishment of a treaty negotiation advisory committee. They 
have also set up regional advisory committees in each treaty 
negotiation area to represent public and local interests. There is 
much public and participant unhappiness about the consultation 
process and about the ratification process at this time.
<P>
	If a band enters into the B.C. treaty process it receives 80 per 
cent funding repayable upon completion of negotiations. In effect 
this is a loan. The Nisga'a negotiations on the other hand are 100 
per cent paid for by the federal government.
<P>
	I have other concerns. The municipal level of government is not 
recognized in any of this. There is simply a sidebar arrangement 
through the provincial negotiators. Right now their intervenor 
funding or advisory funding or whatever we want to call it is 
capped at $250,000 a year. It comes from the province.
<P>
	The municipalities have many concerns about this. Some of the 
municipalities are dealing with multiple claims. Their costs are far 
and away exceeding the compensation they are receiving. They are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17350"> 17350 </A></B>
<P>
caught up in this process, not through their own doing but they 
cannot  afford not to be there. Their interests are certainly affected.
<P>
	There are no readiness guidelines to the regional advisory 
committee boards. They are not in the terms of reference of the 
treaty commission. This has also proved to be very problematical.
<P>
	Interim agreements have been negotiated at the provincial level. 
This has also compromised the B.C. Treaty Commission process. 
This was identified by the B.C. Treaty Commission in its 1993 
annual report. That is as far as it can go. The commission can 
identify it but it cannot deal with it unless one or the other or both 
levels of government agree to do something about it.
<P>
	Governments have lost their mandate in those parts of the 
province most familiar with and closest to the settlement process. 
There has been some movement toward openness and other things 
to which the federal Reform has contributed. We have done some 
things to open up the public process. In March we had an aboriginal 
town hall series in the province. We covered eight communities in 
11 nights province wide. In a separate exercise we set out through a 
10-month process new aboriginal policy initiatives. They were 
very well received in British Columbia and were considered to be 
very refreshing.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Much of what we were saying in March was common sense, 
bottom up thinking which had not been reflected before in B.C. 
political circles. Now much of what we have said is mainstream 
political dialogue in British Columbia. Issues being talked about 
are an end to the Indian taxation exemption and certainly a focus on 
not entrenching commercial activities in B.C. treaties.
<P>
	We have done more as a federal opposition party to open up this 
process than the B.C. Treaty Commission and both levels of 
government combined. The treaty commission is hampered by its 
mandate and the governments are still locked into an agenda they 
foresaw three years ago.
<P>
	The layers of bureaucracy surrounding this process are leading 
to inevitable massive gridlock. Unless the governments obtain a 
publicly ratified negotiating mandate, the public will never accept 
the terms and conditions which are being negotiated. This will 
foster further disharmony and misgivings.
<P>
	We are not objecting to a fair, open and complete conclusion to 
the process, but we do have a problem with the status quo 
arrangement. People are begging for leadership to break the binds 
of the status quo and they are not seeing it forthcoming. We are 
trying to fill that void. The manner and the approach currently 
being pursued is intrinsically wrong. It is neither enlightened nor 
receptive. Therefore, people conclude they are being manipulated 
and that the process is entrenched and resistant to change, despite 
mounting opposition.
<P>
	One might ask what the provincial opposition parties are saying. 
I can talk a little bit about a B.C. Liberal government. It is talking 
about instituting a series of public hearings and free votes in the 
legislature; initiating public consultation on a principal framework 
for treaty negotiations; and developing a set of guidelines that 
would have to be approved by the legislature with the approval of 
MLAs who would be free to vote without following party lines.
<P>
	A second step would be to set up new negotiating teams that 
would include local non-Indian representation. The next stage 
would be to send any agreements to public hearings. The final stage 
would be to take this back to the legislature through another free 
vote of MLAs.
<P>
	The B.C. Reform Party is saying many things about this whole 
process. It does say we must offer to negotiate treaties because it is 
the right thing to do. The goal of treaties should be to lift the yoke 
of the Indian Act off the backs of native people. Further, they must 
own their own reserve lands and govern their own affairs within the 
context of the Constitution and B.C. laws. Treaties negotiated 
should not aspire to the false promise of native sovereignty. The 
principle of equality is central to our support for treaty talks.
<P>
	A Reform government would insist upon renegotiating the cost 
sharing agreement as a precondition for B.C.'s ongoing 
participation in land claims negotiations. It would reject 
constitutional entrenchment of the inherent right of 
self-government, would reject a third order of government 
enshrined under the Constitution, would reject formal recognition 
of aboriginal title, and would define the meaning and scope of 
aboriginal rights, title and self-government. That is what treaty 
negotiations are all about. It would seek a clear negotiating 
mandate from the people, not the politicians.
<P>
	If treaties confer special rights, they must first pass muster with 
the majority. Any deal that purports to accord special status will not 
pass public scrutiny in their opinion. Treaties should be aimed at 
removing barriers based on race, not at entrenching new 
inequalities.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, given the importance of the issue, the costs of the 
issue, the social implications and the permanence of this, there is 
absolutely no way an outgoing government should be binding the 
public. I urge in the strongest possible terms for government to 
respect this position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Once 
the minister of Indian affairs has completed his remarks I would 
like to invoke Standing Order 43(2) so that subsequent Liberal 
speakers will be sharing their time.
<P>
	I also wish to seek unanimous consent to revert to the tabling of 
reports by standing committees. I understand  that a report was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17351"> 17351 </A></B>
<P>
unavailable earlier and that there is all-party consent to do that at 
the present time, which will only take a moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Madam Speaker, I am anticipated to be at the 
aboriginal affairs standing committee to finalize a report on 
co-management. Am I subject to a 10-minute question and answer 
period? If so, could we do that first?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Questions and comments, 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I do appreciate the chance to question the member on some of the 
things he has said. As a fellow MP from British Columbia, I share 
his concern that aboriginal issues are getting short shrift, especially 
here in Parliament by the government and the minister who seem to 
think, as with so many other issues, they have a made in Ottawa 
solution to what is really a problem affecting primarily B.C.
<P>
	B.C. is the area that is not covered by treaties within the country. 
Depending on who we believe, it is a $5 billion to $10 billion 
question. It is a huge issue, which even touches on the Constitution, 
where rights are entrenched and different rights are given to 
different people. It is a big issue in British Columbia. The 
government should take heed that this issue is something that also 
could be very divisive in the country if it is not handled and settled 
properly.
<P>
	Last week I was home on Friday and attended a public meeting 
where the chief federal negotiator for the southern half of the 
province gave a talk on the progress to date of the aboriginal land 
claim settlements. Afterwards we had a question and answer 
period. During that time I said there are three things I think people 
are saying they want to see happen in this federal negotiation for 
eventual settlement of the land claims. First, they want finality to 
any agreements. They do not want any leap-frogging ability and 
they do not want anybody to be able to reopen these cases in the 
future. When the deal is settled they want it settled for good. In 
other words, we do not want to do this again 10 years from now.
<P>
	Second, they say they want any deal they make with aboriginal 
communities in order to settle outstanding land claims to reinforce 
the idea of equality rather than inequality, hyphenated Canadians. 
If it does not lead to that equality in taxation and before the law, I 
do not think British Columbians are going to support it.
<P>
	Third, I asked the negotiator what his specific instructions are 
when it comes to the bottom line. In other words, how much money 
are we talking here? Are we talking $10 billion or are we talking $5 
billion or $1 billion? The rumour mill is rampant. Mr. Cashore, the 
minister in British Columbia, has thrown out a $10 billion figure. 
His response was you hate it as a negotiator when somebody starts 
throwing out those figures because it makes it so difficult to have 
negotiations. He  says that hidden away in his vault is an envelope 
with some kind of figure inside concerning how many dollars we 
are talking about. Because there is no openness in this process and 
we are dealing with rumours of rumours. I wonder if the hon. 
member could comment on those three things, about the finality or 
the extinguishment clause that should be in these agreements, on 
the principle of moving toward equality of all Canadians and 
because the minister will not give us anything, if he has any idea 
what kind of a bottom line we are looking at when it comes to 
settlement of British Columbia land claim issues.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member talks about the 
finality of these agreements. In many cases there is a major 
disagreement in the aboriginal political leadership concerning this 
concept. One of the concerns that I have about the finality of these 
agreements is that there is a word that is no longer used within 
hearing of the minister of Indian affairs. That word is 
extinguishment.
<P>
	One of the first agreements that came before the 35th 
Parliament, in terms of aboriginal agreements, was the Sahtu 
agreement in the western Arctic. There is certainly extinguishment 
within that agreement. When the major native spokesman for the 
Sahtu was at the committee hearings, he was asked about that 
clause. He said that was a natural quid pro quo or a trade-off for the 
other things that the Sahtu were receiving in exchange for an 
extinguishment of the aboriginal interest in lands outside of the 
settlement area.
<P>
	That is fine and dandy but the expectation has now been 
delivered by the current government is that no, that is not the case 
any more and we are quite prepared to reopen all of these old 
negotiations. The government is raising expectations at a time 
when it has not even fulfilled bottom line expectations. It keeps 
raising the ceiling on something that does not have a foundation at 
this point.
<P>
	This is most inappropriate and it is certainly not something on 
which the public has been well informed, nor is it something that I 
believe the public wants to accept. It is like a never-ending set of 
negotiations and everything once negotiated can be reopened at any 
time. That is not appropriate.
<P>
	The second question dealt with equality. This is probably 
demonstrated most clearly in the fact that the taxation exemption is 
becoming more and more of a problem in more and more locations 
across Canada. I are not talking about just British Columbia in this 
case.
<P>
	While other Canadians are taxed to the max there is a portion of 
the native population that is insulated from most forms of taxation. 
These are the people living on reserves. Perhaps this cannot be 
changed overnight but we have to move in that direction.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17352"> 17352 </A></B>
<P>
	Another major concern is that the governments be democratic 
and accountable with checks and balances that go far beyond the 
checks and balances of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. The lives of many people living on 
reserves are being regulated by one department. That becomes 
very problematic. If we had multiple jurisdictions that would be 
fine.
<P>
	We are finding that what resonates with the public is a municipal 
style of self-government as being an appropriate model. We have 
an example in the Sechelt Band, in my riding.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The final question posed deals with the cost and the negotiating 
mandate. The negotiating mandate provincially and federally, the 
way it sits right now, is a cabinet secret known only to the federal 
and/or provincial negotiators. Public ratification of that negotiating 
mandate is a major shift in thinking that has gone on and something 
that is being asked for more and more and something we promote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given 
that the 10 minutes has now expired, I wonder if we could now ask 
for unanimous consent to revert to the tabling of reports by 
standing committees.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is this agreeable to 
everyone?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois presented a minority report on the issue of immigration 
counsellors. This is a very serious issue. We agree with the 
diagnosis: we are indeed confronted with a serious problem. Some 
counsellors are good, but the ethics of others are questionable.
<P>
	But we differ on the constitutional issue, since we maintain that 
it is up to the provinces, and not to the federal government, to 
regulate trades and professions. That is the reason behind our 
minority report.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is an honour to rise again 
in the House to address this resolution. However, the motion has no 
thought behind it and therefore gives no idea of its consequences. I 
do not even know why we are entertaining such a motion. I 
honestly feel that we are not doing our job here debating it.
<P>
	This motion, as it is written, goes against the very democratic 
fabric of Canadian society. Basically it asks the federal government 
to stop doing business with a duly elected majority provincial 
government. If we were to stop conducting business with the 
current government in British Columbia we would be insulting the 
majority of British Columbians who voted for this government.
<P>
	Perhaps this is not the intent of the motion. Perhaps the intent of 
the motion is even more appalling. Perhaps the opposition party 
does not want the government to continue doing business with the 
duly elected government in British Columbia and not do business 
with the aboriginal people in British Columbia.
<P>
	What is it we are debating here? Are we debating whether the 
provincial government has a valid mandate or are we debating a 
motion based on race? If race is the issue, perhaps we can ask the 
hon. members of the opposition if they have any particular wishes 
regarding Sikhs in British Columbia, the Chinese people in B.C. or 
other minority groups, or are they just willing to continue this 
debate on aboriginal people in B.C.?
<P>
	I might remind hon. members that the negotiations to create the 
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were conducted in 1904, 
four years into the mandate of the second Laurier government. 
Would the hon. member have wanted these talks to be put on hold 
because the federal government was facing an election the next 
year? The second world war began four years into the mandate of 
Mackenzie King in 1935. Did Parliament say that it could not get 
involved because the Prime Minister had to go to the polls? In 
1956, the last year of the St. Laurent government, the UN 
emergency force was created, thanks to the work of Lester Pearson. 
He won the Nobel prize for his efforts.
<P>
	If the hon. member for North Island-Powell River had been 
sitting in the House back then he would have said: ``I object. 
Canada cannot enter into such an important international 
commitment, not with just one year left in the government's 
mandate''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17353"> 17353 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look at the history of treaty negotiations with the 
aboriginal peoples. Treaty 7 was signed in 1877. The Macdonald 
government had been in office since January 1874. It faced an 
election. It would come in the fall of 1878. Was there any question 
then that the government had no mandate to sign? Of course not.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Treaty No. 8 was signed in 1899 when the Laurier government 
had been in office for three years. It would go to the polls the 
following year.
<P>
	In our time, the James Bay agreement was signed a year before 
the end of the Quebec Liberal government.
<P>
	Would the hon. member for North Island-Powell River be 
prepared to defer his authority on votes on issues that come before 
the House because the other parties in his constituency have not 
nominated their candidates yet or have nominated them but there 
has not been an election yet? Of course he would not.
<P>
	Let us not hear any more self-righteousness from the Reform 
Party with its claims that it speaks for the people. The people 
elected the hon. member for North Island-Powell River on 
October 25, 1993, just as the people of Sault Ste. Marie elected me 
to come here.
<P>
	Why have a Parliament at all? Why not just have an office where 
public pollsters send their findings to the bureaucrats? If that is the 
argument of the hon. member for North Island-Powell River, I 
invite him to give up his seat, go back home, take up his old job and 
do something worth while.
<P>
	The First Nations in British Columbia have waited 200 years to 
reach agreements. Most have never had an opportunity to sign an 
agreement outlining their rights. That is an historic anomaly in 
Canada which the Liberal government inherited from the leader of 
the Reform Party of B.C. He was a minister in the Social Credit 
government that signed an agreement with the Nisga'a. He was on 
the committee that pushed the B.C. treaty process.
<P>
	What do Reform members have to say about that? What have 
they said to the leader of the Reform Party of B.C.? Is he not a little 
embarrassed by the Reform Party in Ottawa about all his work and 
efforts of the past? I commend him. He at least had the courage to 
do something for aboriginal people.
<P>
	In 1990 Premier Vander Zalm reversed a longstanding position 
of the province of British Columbia which held that aboriginal 
rights had been extinguished prior to B.C.'s entry into 
Confederation, or if the rights did exist they were the exclusive 
responsibility of the federal government. That has changed the 
climate out there. Premier Vander Zalm said: ``You have been 
sitting there with the Nisga'a for 15 years by yourself. We will do 
these things. We will get some certainty for B.C.''
<P>
	The current government came into office in October 1993. We 
opened the doors in December 1993. Since that time 70 per cent of 
the just under 200 First Nations in B.C. have been at the table. They 
are doing it our way. They are saying: ``We will trust you white 
people once more. We will not build roadblocks. We will come to 
the negotiating table''. And this is the way they are treated.
<P>
	The Reform Party has not voted for one piece of aboriginal 
legislation in the House in two years, except in the one instance 
when it benefited an oil company. When an oil company could 
make a profit vis-à-vis aboriginal people, the Reform Party voted 
unanimously in favour of it. That party says it will speak for the 
people, that it will come here with an open mind and not vote like a 
bunch of sheep.
<P>
	Last week 42 Reform members showed up in the House to vote 
against the B.C. treaty process, the enabling legislation which 
allows us to sit down with the First Nations. Yet Reformer 
members stand every day to denounce Adams Lake and the 
Penticton blockade. So do we, but the difference is that we are 
prepared to sit down with the First Nations people. What I hear 
today is that the Reform Party will not even sit down with the First 
Nations people to negotiate.
<P>
	I once said that the House of Commons in many instances 
sounds like the ill informed conversing with the ill intentioned on 
any given day. For the first time today I heard the ill informed 
conversing with the ill intentioned of the same party when they 
questioned each other.
<P>
	I will give the Reform Party some correct information. 
Reformers said vis-à-vis the Nisga'a that we gave them money for 
negotiations. That is incorrect. It is based on loans 100 per cent. 
The people who are supposed to know the issues out there said that 
in the House.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Let me go back and refer to some of the history. I am in cabinet 
representing the poorest of the poor people in the country. Most of 
the time I am on my knees and my colleagues know that.
<P>
	Just before the election when we were hoping to be elected, we 
said that the Pearson airport deal was illegal and immoral and that 
if we were elected we would reverse it. Why? We alleged there 
were a lot of people making a lot of money. There was a lot of 
lobbying and a lot of money being made by lobbyists. A few weeks 
before the election we came into the House and who defended the 
lobbyists and voted against the legislation? It was the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	Reformers should think about what they are doing today 
vis-à-vis aboriginal people and what the Reform Party did in the 
protection of lobbyists on the Pearson airport deal. Reformers are 
saying today that there may be an election a year from now because 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17354"> 17354 </A></B>
<P>
the opposition parties are opposed to dealing with the poorest of the  
poor. However they will stand here righteously two weeks before 
an election and defend the right of lobbyists to make a bundle of 
money. It gives Canadians an idea of the priorities of that party.
<P>
	They say: ``Let us have a referendum''. This is much the same. It 
is another way of saying we should have a referendum. I remember 
last year when this was placed before the Prime Minister as an 
important issue. They said: ``Let us have a referendum''. The 
Prime Minister said: ``It is our job to make decisions and if we do 
them well we will be re-elected; if we do not we will be turfed''. 
When will Reformers learn that, as we did in 1984? Reformers will 
learn that because the public is coming to understand the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	Reformers thought they were the party that would talk about 
fiscal responsibility and bring a new spirit to the House. Instead 
they found a party that lusted badly for power. It had such an 
anti-francophone bias they were willing to destroy the country on a 
fraudulent question to which the answer was yes by 50 per cent plus 
one. It shows the public the bias of the Reform Party. It shows the 
public how badly the Reform Party leader wants to be Prime 
Minister of Canada, that he would do that, destroy the country on a 
50 per cent plus one response to a fraudulent question.
<P>
	I sat here and I listened. I have waited two years and listened to 
aboriginal bashing from the Reform Party. Some Reform members 
actually go out and talk to aboriginal people, an insignificant 
portion of that group that is deserving of respect. An insignificant 
number of Reformers know what the Reform Party is doing, and 
that it is wrong.
<P>
	After two years the Reform Party has an interim policy on 
aboriginal issues, but it did not talk to the aboriginal people. The 
leader of the Reform Party says that they did not. I do not know if 
they could not find them; there are a million and a half aboriginal 
people out there. There are 608 reserves. There are 50 tribal 
councils. Where was the consultation? It did not exist.
<P>
	A key member of the committee that devised this is the member 
for Athabasca who said, and it is there in two papers: ``What is this 
treaty? The treaty process is a fraud''. We negotiated in good faith 
and now they are saying it is a fraud. ``We defeated these people''. I 
notice an uneasiness on the face of Reformers because those with a 
conscience know that what that member said was wrong. He was a 
member of the committee that devised this. He said: ``If we did not 
defeat them, why did they allow themselves to go to small, 
worthless reserves?''
<P>
	There are only two ways of looking at it. We said the treaty was 
honourable. We made these agreements and told them in B.C. that 
some day we would get to them. We finished the numbered treaties 
at Edmonton, Alberta. We said we would with the honour of the 
crown and the honour of Canadians sit down with them. Or, we can 
take  the attitude of the member for Athabasca, a member of the 
Reform Party. I refuse to use a name in the House again unless I put 
the party behind it. The member for Athabasca is a member of the 
Reform Party. He said: ``We beat these people. We beat them into 
the ground. That is why they are on small reserves. This treaty 
process is a fraud. Rebut that''.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Then I heard another member of the Reform Party say that he 
knows all about reserves, that those people live in a south seas 
environment-I was in the House that day-and the men go around 
burning women with cigarettes. That is the most atrocious, ill 
informed, ignorant comment I have ever heard about aboriginal 
people. That was from the Reform Party.
<P>
	Now we have the B.C. treaty process and Reformers do not even 
want us to go to the table and after 200 years do the honourable 
thing. What they would rather do is stand here and have us sing O 
Canada. At the same time they will say: ``Side with the 
separatists''. I see no difference. I see different geography but I do 
not see any difference with the separatists facing me or the 
separatists from western Canada to my far right.
<P>
	They would say to the Prime Minister that they we want the 
country dismantled on a 50 per cent plus one vote in Quebec on a 
fraudulent question. They say that day after day all week. Yet what 
did they waste the time of the House on last week? A crest. They 
would destroy the country but keep the crest. They can have their 
crest but I want my country. It will never be saved by the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	This is the new insight. Let us process the situation. We have the 
Reformers' position on francophones. We can take them out of the 
equation of what is the Reform Party. We know their non-position 
on women. If I were a woman, I would be a little concerned. We 
know their position on immigration. They are for immigration but 
not to Canada. If I were an immigrant, I would be concerned. If I 
were a nationalist and wanted to keep the country together, I would 
be concerned. If I were a lobbyist, I would like that party. If I had 
big money invested in the Pearson airport, I would like that party.
<P>
	What do we have left after we strip the philosophy of that party? 
Not much. That party stood here and told the Yukon Indians that the 
negotiations with them would never work. They came here. They 
stood in the House in their costumes. It was one of the proudest 
moments of our party. It is working. Yet the Reform Party said the 
Manitoba dismantling would not work.
<P>
	I get a rough time in Manitoba from the media, and rightly so. 
Last week the Manitoba media reported:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In Manitoba, Grand Chief Phil Fontaine and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs 
are currently negotiating one of the most progressive, daring and risky 
self-government initiatives in Canadian history. For the first time since 
Confederation, the  federal government says it's prepared to give back to First 
Nations what many say was never relinquished in the first place.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17355"> 17355 </A></B>
<P>
	Harvard University called the Manitoba dismantling the most 
progressive move in self-government negotiations in the world. 
The same party denounced inherent right; the Reform Party 
denounced inherent right. There were over a hundred editorials in 
the country by people who are paid to be critical. That is their job in 
the democratic process. A hundred of them were favourable and 
one was not favourable. The criticism was that we should have 
waited until the royal commission report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> The people voted on the Charlottetown 
accord-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> I am not talking about the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> You do not want to talk about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> -or a group of intellectuals sitting around 
discussing the Constitution. I will address the Reform. I am talking 
about the poorest of the poor, the constituents of the Reform Party 
that seems to think they do not count. Reformers do not consult 
with them. They do not talk to them. They do not meet with the 
chiefs and we have roadblocks. It is the job of the Reform Party to 
go out and represent these poor people. We were not elected to 
come here to cater to the rich, to the haves, to the white 
communities. We were elected to come here to cater to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> What about the Bronfmans?
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Sorry, Mr. Minister. I ask 
for order, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Once in the four-year mandate I would like to hear 
Reform members talk about the housing conditions and what we 
can do on reserves. Once I would like to hear a Reform member 
talk about suicide problems. I have to go out there and meet with 
people who have lost their children. Once I would like to hear the 
Reform talk about health. All we get is denunciation, denunciation 
of Indian people for one reason, because they are Indians.
<P>
	The country will not tolerate that. What Reform learned in New 
Brunswick and in Abbotsford it will learn in the next election. The 
people of B.C. want to be proud of the members they send here. 
The people of B.C. are nation builders and what they see strips 
away that pride. The Reform Party will learn that in the next 
election.
<P>
	When the Reform Party came to my riding it said to the 
steelworkers of Sault Ste. Marie when the company went under and 
the unions had to take it over ``do not give them a penny''. They 
now have eight months of profit and two weeks ago the men did it, 
the men this party does not want to represent. They now have $400  
million in the financial community and have invested it. They are 
working, no thanks to the Reform Party.
<P>
	Every time the Reform Party comes up to my riding of Sault Ste. 
Marie every steelworker there will know that along with all the 
other things I have said about Reform and the groups it excludes, it 
has excluded the working people of the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the minister. If he wants to blame the Reform 
Party for anything, he should first do his homework and pay close 
attention to this debate. He compares the Bloc Quebecois with 
Reform. Well, when I as a member of this House tabled a bill to 
limit the interest collected on delinquent mortgages, for example, 
Reform was not the only opponent. His party was also opposed, 
because it was eating into the fund, the large amounts put at its 
disposal by Canada's large banks, the so-called seven sisters.
<P>
	So he is in no position to throw snowballs at the Reform Party. It 
is his party that abolished the council on the status of women. What 
I mean is that, in spite of everything, I recognize that native people 
have been here for 20,000 years, according to some experts, that 
they have rights, and that we must recognize these rights. What 
better way to do so than by signing treaties? I think that the party I 
represent in this House will oppose the motion tabled by Reform 
because it is unacceptable.
<P>
	Some people who have been here for 20,000 years are being 
denied their very right to exist, while some first- and 
second-generation Canadians claim that they have all the rights. I 
feel that all the people here, whatever their origins, have rights, but 
why deny them to native people? Although I disagree with the 
minister, I say that we should oppose the motion tabled by the 
Reform Party because it does an injustice to an important group of 
fellow citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate what the hon. member 
has said. I see the member for Saint-Jean out there working hard.
<P>
	However, we have a fundamental difference. We just went 
through the referendum. Last week we heard the guru of the Bloc. I 
thought he was gone but he just stepped to the back of the bus. He 
was quoted in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. What did Mr. Pierre Bourgault 
say? It is the Jews, the Italians and the Greeks who vote in an ethnic 
block who are the racists, not us. They only have one objective, to 
obstruct things. They are saying these Jews, Italians and Greeks, 
because they want to be Canadians, are obstructionists. If we 
multiply that by about fivefold we have an idea of the Cree, the 
Montagnais, the Attikamekw and the Micmac and their feeling of 
alienation within the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17356"> 17356 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	We have to have a uniform philosophy. As much as I appreciate 
what the Bloc is saying today it cannot blame the Reform for what 
is happening out in B.C. and have a different philosophy in Quebec. 
Reform in B.C. cannot side with us to protect the Indians of Quebec 
because it fits its agenda and because it is taking an 
anti-francophone position, but not do the same thing in B.C.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am not going to get into a long diatribe of rhetoric as the 
hon. minister put forth today against the Reform Party. The Liberal 
government does not have a monopoly on caring and compassion 
nor a monopoly on stupidity.
<P>
	The goal we have today is shared by the minister and by every 
person in the House. Each and every one of us wants to ensure 
aboriginal people, particularly those who as the minister referred to 
are the poorest of the poor, are able to stand on their own two feet, 
and that we are able to decrease the terrible parameters of rape, 
sexual abuse, crime and violence that occurs within their societies.
<P>
	I was going to ask the hon. member a question, but he has 
departed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member knows 
we do not refer to the presence or absence of anyone in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
goal is to help aboriginal people, working with them in a 
co-operative fashion. That is the goal of Reform members, many of 
whom have aboriginal people in our ridings. We work closely with 
them to resolve these difficulties.
<P>
	I listened to the individual responsible for the B.C. treaty process 
on Vancouver Island. I listened for one hour on what they were 
going to do for the aboriginal people. I asked: ``At the end of the 
day will the B.C. treaty process actually help the poorest of the 
poor, the people I mentioned earlier? Will it actually help them?'' 
That individual said: ``I do not know''.
<P>
	That is the basis on which we do not approve of this process. The 
process will not help the poorest of the poor in aboriginal 
communities. That is what we want and I know that is what the 
government wants. The course the government is pursuing will not 
help the poorest of the poor.
<P>
	Other concerns we have are in the resource management. Who 
will ensure the resources are taken care of? As the minister knows, 
at Stony Creek we saw a terrible tragedy with the timber on that 
reserve. We are also concerned about where the money goes. The 
minister well knows that aboriginal leadership in many cases have 
been known to pocket vast sums of money  that were supposed to 
be going to those people who are the poorest of the poor. Those are 
our concerns.
<P>
	Does the minister think the B.C. treaty process will truly help 
those aboriginal people who are the poorest of the poor? Who will 
preserve and safeguard the resources in the areas they are asking 
for in terms of land? Does the minister not believe that the 
fundamental and most important part of developing self-respect 
and respect in one's community is the ability for an individual, 
whether aboriginal or non-aboriginal, to stand on their own two 
feet and take care of themselves and be gainfully employed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Madam Speaker, I want this question because I often 
hear this member questioning the health minister and I have always 
wanted to respond to him.
<P>
	This member is a doctor and we would think he would bring his 
skills to the House. If he brought those skills as a doctor to the 
House he would see the suicide problems we have in First Nations. 
He would realize that a lot of these suicides are a result of no 
self-sufficiency because there is nothing left. We took all the lands. 
We took it all.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	He would realize that there is more than having social workers 
there. There has to be self-sufficiency. He would realize that where 
there is self-sufficiency, where there are richer reserves there is 
stability and there is health. He would go out and learn this. He 
would know what is happening there.
<P>
	Instead he sits here in a nation that provided him with medical 
skills and encouraged him to go to school, subsidized him and 
encouraged him to go through school and become a doctor, to bring 
this knowledge and skill to the House. But he says: ``Let us spread 
this poverty equally. They are poor. Let them go out and be 
self-sufficient''.
<P>
	The bottom line is when we negotiated these treaties, and he 
should know this, in many cases we spent a day or two. In British 
Columbia, with treaties 6, 7 and 8, in a couple of days with three 
treaties we took away a whole province. We took away the 
resources from the native people.
<P>
	We have spent 200 years to not make the same mistake in B.C. 
and make sure there is some self-sufficiency there, that we have a 
vision and we can work together as partners. What does this hon. 
member do? He is going to vote: ``Stop the process. Do not 
negotiate any further. Let those poor people fend for themselves''. 
Shame on him.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, the opposition 
motion.
<P>
	I will read the motion, for the benefit of the members who are 
here. It goes as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17357"> 17357 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to not enter into any binding trilateral 
aboriginal treaty or land claim agreements in B.C. in the last year of the current 
provincial government mandate in order to respect the views of British 
Columbians on this issue as expressed by both major provincial opposition 
parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My comments will be twofold. In the first part, I will discuss the 
constitutional validity of such a proposal, and in the second part, I 
will deal with the issue of aboriginal claims.
<P>
	Does a government, democratically elected in Canada according 
to the laws of the land and in compliance with our constitutional 
principles, have the right to govern? In other words, does a 
government that is the government have the right to be a 
government?
<P>
	The Reform Party's answer to that question is no. Indeed, it is 
asking this House to urge the Government of Canada to not enter 
into any agreements to which a provincial government, duly 
elected according to the Constitution, would be a party, because 
such an agreement would not reflect public opinion, as expressed 
by the two major provincial opposition parties. In other words, the 
Reform Party is asking the House to ascertain, before entering into 
an agreement with a Canadian province, whether public opinion, as 
expressed by the opposition, is favourable to the proposal.
<P>
	Our friends from the Reform Party do not seem to understand the 
nature of our institutions. This motion is wrong in the sense that it 
is an attack against the legitimacy of our institutions. It provides 
that the House should ask the government to determine, through 
polls, through supposedly scientific studies, perhaps through open 
lines in B.C., or editorials from the <I>Vancouver Sun</I>, the opinion of 
British Columbians, before entering into an agreement supported 
by the legitimately elected government of that province.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I am not sure whether our Reform Party friends realize what they 
are asking from the House. People participating in a political 
meeting could say: ``Since the B.C. government is in the last year 
of its mandate, it no longer has the democratic or political rightto -'', and so on. As you know, it is easy to organize a partisan 
political meeting. It is easy to resort to inflated rhetoric and to 
exaggerate, so as to make an impact on public opinion.
<P>
	The motion before us comes from an official party in the House 
of Commons. That party got 52 members elected in the last federal 
election and is now asking the House to pass such a resolution.
<P>
	Let us change the wording a bit in order to examine the 
unbelievable nature of a resolution such as this. What, for example, 
would our reaction be if the motion were to read, selecting Quebec 
at random as an example: ``That the House urge the government to 
not enter into  agreement with the Government of Quebec on the 
sharing and devolution of manpower training until such time as the 
Government of Quebec has passed a motion in the National 
Assembly recognizing the landslide victory by the no side in the 
last referendum''? I think everyone here would say it was 
unbelievable.
<P>
	To take another example, what would our reaction by if the 
motion were to read: ``That the House urge the government to not 
enter into any agreement with the Government of Ontario as long 
as that government plans to cut back on welfare payments''? We 
would say it was impossible.
<P>
	Yet here we have a government, the Parliament of Canada, being 
asked to pass judgment on the legitimacy of another duly elected 
government within a federation. The legitimacy of the B.C. 
government is just as important, just as valuable, just as 
constitutionally justified, as the legitimacy of the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	Just looking at the wording of the motion would be enough to 
make the Bloc oppose it.
<P>
	But there are other grounds. Basically, this motion casts doubt on 
the entire issue, on the whole process for settling aboriginal land 
claims in Canada.
<P>
	I have just listened to my Reform colleague's defence of the 
proposition. He touched on many topics. He spoke of territorial 
rights, of the fact that aboriginal people living on reserves pay no 
taxes. When it comes down to it, he has challenged the rights of 
these first inhabitants of Canada to demand any particular rights 
whatsoever to certain lands within Canada. He even referred to the 
B.C. Reform Party's program on aboriginal issues which proposes 
that it oppose inclusion of aboriginal self government in the 
province's legislation. Yet it has been in the Canadian Constitution 
since 1982. According to a Reform government out there, however, 
there must be no mention in any of the laws of B.C. of any 
entitlement whatsoever to aboriginal self government.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	There was another resolution that I hesitate to mention here, 
because in many ways it challenges the position of minorities in 
Canada. According to the Reform Party's provincial platform, 
before aboriginal peoples obtain certain rights in Canada, they 
should first have the consent of the majority of the population.
<P>
	It seems this party wants to propose that in British Columbia, 
minority rights shall be subject to the will of the majority. It is 
unthinkable, in a democratic country like Canada that recognizes 
the rights of specific populations subject to certain criteria, that 
these rights should be subject to injunctions or decisions by a 
majority of the population.
<P>
	Basically, the Reform Party's proposal challenges the whole 
issue of aboriginal rights in Canada. That is its general purpose, but 
the Reform Party also challenges  specific aspects. Somewhat 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17358"> 17358 </A></B>
<P>
ironically, the Reform Party's comments were fuelled by several 
kinds of issues.
<P>
	There is a reference to the Nass River agreement now being 
negotiated with the Nisga'a in British Columbia. In fact, the 
Reform Party would rather see the agreement dropped, because of 
issues like commercial fishing rights, for instance. There are 
groups who are making representations. However, I think we 
should keep a sense of proportion in all this.
<P>
	Today in Canada we have a major problem concerning aboriginal 
land claims. It is a problem that must be dealt with as quickly as 
possible, in a way that is fair to all Canadians and respects the 
rights of all concerned. The issue should not be used as an excuse to 
postpone agreements that may be finalized very shortly.
<P>
	I think they are playing with fire, because today in Canada, there 
is a polarization of positions on these issues. If we read editorials in 
Canada or Quebec and listen to open-line shows, we realize that 
non-aboriginal groups are critical. They think there is some 
exaggeration in the whole issue of aboriginal claims, and they are 
right, but as a result of this situation, prejudice is rife, which is not 
conducive to good relations between aboriginal peoples and the 
general public in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Opinions are becoming polarized, often with somewhat bizarre 
results. As an example of what will happen if we do not deal with 
these issues fairly quickly, I was reading a speech made by the hon. 
member for Churchill yesterday at a sacred assembly held in Hull. 
Now we should realize the assembly is more or less religious in 
nature and often the language is very symbolic. Our colleague said 
in his opening speech that the Creator had put aboriginal peoples in 
this part of the world known as Canada.
<P>
	I agree one can argue that aboriginal peoples have certain rights 
because they were here before we were, because they were the first 
occupants, but I think it is a bit much to say the Creator put the 
aboriginal peoples in Canada.
<P>
	This was said in a particular context before an audience of 
important dignitaries.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada was present at this gathering. 
Ministers of the crown were also in attendance. There was little 
reaction. The context is, however, a particular one. If native 
peoples get the idea now that Canada was given to the aboriginal 
people, like in the Bible, things are going to get tougher.
<P>
	So, I think, in order to avoid things getting out of hand-because 
I think it could happen, and I am sorry to have to say it, out of 
respect for my colleague for Churchill-native claims have to be 
settled as quickly as possible and, in British Columbia, where 
things are  developing, matters must be resolved right away. 
Because, in British Columbia, things go back a long way.
<P>
	Between the end of the 1880s and 1990, native claims were not 
considered valid. In 1990, the British Columbia government began 
to recognize native rights, but only then. I heard the Minister of 
Indian Affairs say earlier that the situation of native peoples in 
Quebec was terrible. He said that journalists and some people are 
making remarks about the referendum vote. People are saying it 
must be awful for the native population.
<P>
	In 1985 or 1986, the National Assembly of Quebec recognized 
11 native nations. One of these nations barely has 500 members, 
but it was recognized because it had rights. The people of Quebec 
did not vote on whether a nation of 150 people constituted a nation. 
There was no vote. The National Assembly looked at the cultures 
and the characteristics of all the nations and recognized them. That 
is what happened in Quebec.
<P>
	There is the James Bay agreement, which was signed in 1974 or 
1975, as the minister pointed out. It was the first major agreement 
between Canada and the native populations. It was concluded in 
Quebec, while, in British Columbia, it was not until 15 years later 
that the territorial rights of native peoples were recognized and the 
validity of their claims acknowledged.
<P>
	I think Quebec can hold its head high. The Montagnais of 
Lac-Saint-Jean, the Montagnais on the north shore and the 
Mohawks have always been respected. The Attikameks and the 
Maliseet are few in number, but worthy of respect and have certain 
rights they are claiming. It happened in Quebec. We the people of 
Quebec were among the governments and peoples of Canada to 
recognize the First Nations. We know that there is a Quebec nation, 
a Quebec people. But Quebec also includes other peoples.
<P>
	We recognized 11 other nations. We negotiated. Our National 
Assembly recognized them. Agreements were signed with some of 
these peoples. An agreement is being negotiated with the 
Montagnais of the North Shore and Lac-Saint-Jean. Things were 
done. No one in Quebec told the government that it should not sign.
<P>
	No one in the 1970s tabled a motion here in the House of 
Commons urging the Government of Canada not to sign an 
agreement with Quebec because the Bourassa government, which 
signed this agreement, was in the last year of its mandate. It was the 
James Bay agreement; it was not about fishing rights on a river 
somewhere. The James Bay agreement covers a vast territory. The 
Cree hold property rights over some lands, surface rights over 
others, fishing and hunting rights over other parts of the territory.
<P>
	We did not undermine these people's rights by signing treaties 
with them. We respected them. We told them: ``You are a nation, 
you will have territorial rights, you will be given money for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17359"> 17359 </A></B>
<P>
development''. It was not a  bargaining session, as demonstrated by 
the fact that, in the last referendum, 95 per cent of these 
people-this figure is a little conservative; it is probably 
higher-voted no in the referendum. Ninety-five per cent is a lot of 
people.
<P>
	What this means is that, on some parts of this reserve, not a 
single person voted yes. No one in Quebec questioned these results 
or these people's legitimacy. No one accused them of being 
ungrateful after we gave them territorial rights. That is not how we 
do things.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	We did not give them rights. They already had rights, which we 
recognized and enshrined in legislation. This legislation, this 
treaty, this agreement was also ratified by the federal government, 
which also had fiduciary rights and was a party to the case.
<P>
	I hope that the House will carefully examine the content of this 
motion. First, it should realize that the motion limits the rights of a 
democratically elected government in Canada. Second, the motion 
challenges the rights of people in Canada who belong to a nation 
different from the so-called Canadian nation and from what we call 
the Quebec nation.
<P>
	I feel it is important to be aware of all this and of native people's 
right to demand some land claim agreements in Canada. We must 
hasten to correct some visible mistakes that are emerging so that 
we do not end up in situations that would adversely affect the future 
for the people of Quebec and Canada and for all the native peoples 
in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
makes me curious when an hon. member refers to the Quebec 
people and the Quebec nation. I am not quite sure what he means 
by this in terms of the population of Quebec. This is a point of 
concern for me. Obviously I am a Canadian to be able to sit in this 
Chamber. I came to this country after the Hungarian revolution in 
1957. My 10-year old daughter was born in Canada. My wife is 
Irish going back seven generations.
<P>
	When we talk of people within the confines of a province, I want 
to make sure there is some definition to it. Looking at the 
demographics of the population in Quebec, the direct descent 
French is 74.6 per cent; British, 4.2 per cent; German, half a per 
cent; Italian, 2.6 per cent; Chinese, half a per cent; aboriginal, 1 per 
cent; Dutch, one-tenth of one per cent; east Indian, three-tenths of 
one per cent; Polish, three-tenths of one per cent; Portuguese, 
one-half per cent; Jewish, 1.1 per cent; Greek, seven-tenths of one 
per cent; Filipino, one-tenth of one per cent; Hungarian, one-tenth 
of one per cent; other, 5 per cent; people of multiple origins, 8.4 per 
cent.
<P>
	Maybe the hon. member could clarify for me that all the people 
living in Quebec are indeed Quebecers and are indeed Canadian.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I question the pertinence to 
the subject of today's debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member may want to respond, but I do question the 
relevance of the question with regard to the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Madam Speaker, I will gladly answer the question 
because some members may wonder how to define a Montagnais, a 
Malecite or a Nisga'a.
<P>
	Allow me to answer by first asking a question and answering it. 
How do you define a Canadian? As far as I can understand, 
Canadians are persons who live in Canada and call themselves 
Canadians. Our hon. colleague told us: ``I am a Canadian. I have 
been living in Canada since the late 50s''. He said he came to 
Canada from Hungary after the insurrection over there.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member calls himself a Canadian, probably in 
his Hungarian or Magyar mother tongue, and never doubts for a 
moment that he is a Canadian.
<P>
	Similarly, Quebecers are people living in Quebec who call 
themselves Quebecers. These people's ancestors may have been 
established in Quebec since 1636, or for 360 years, like mine, or for 
just two, three, four or five years. Perhaps their mother tongue is 
Greek or Spanish. Perhaps they are like my hon. colleague from 
Bourassa, originally from Chile, who calls himself a Quebecer.
<P>
	Therefore, a Quebecer is someone who lives in Quebec, claims 
to be a Quebecer and recognizes that he or she and the other people 
living in Quebec share the same identity as Quebecers. Of course, 
this identity is coloured. The Prime Minister himself mentioned in 
his distinct society proposal that it should be recognized that, in 
Quebec, we have a French speaking majority and a unique culture, 
although the Prime Minister told us yesterday that there was no 
Quebec culture. At any rate, such are the vagaries of politics.
<P>
	We have our own civil law tradition inherited from old France. 
Of course, the people of Quebec have a colour, as do the people of 
Canada. From what I can see, the predominant language among 
Canadians is English. There is a Canadian culture defending itself 
against the American culture, and Canada also has its social and 
legal institutions.
<P>
	In short, a Quebecer is someone living in Quebec who claims to 
be a Quebecer, like a Montagnais from the Lac-Saint-Jean region, 
who speaks the same language as me and looks somewhat like me, 
come to think of it. It is someone who says: ``I am a Montagnais 
from Lac-Saint-Jean, living in Mashteuiatsh, attending school  in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17360"> 17360 </A></B>
<P>
Roberval, working at the Canada Employment Center in Roberval 
and proud to call myself a Montagnais''.
<P>
	A Montagnais is someone who claims to be a Montagnais and is 
recognized as such by other Montagnais, the same way that a 
Quebecer is someone who claims to be a Quebecer and agrees to 
belong to this nation, without any distinction based on culture, race 
or language. Quebec gladly welcomes everyone, as long as you call 
yourself a Quebecer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, because I did 
not have the opportunity to address the minister's comments on 
debate, I will take the first few minutes of my intervention to 
address some of the remarks which he made.
<P>
	It is difficult to listen to the sheer arrogance of the minister and 
the government on the subject of aboriginal issues. The minister 
talked about it being a democratic process. He talked about the 
Government of British Columbia being a democratically elected 
government which has a mandate to engage in the negotiations 
which are currently taking place. I beg to differ.
<P>
	The current NDP Government of British Columbia was elected 
by 40 per cent of the popular vote at the last general election. That 
means six out of ten people who cast a ballot did not vote for the 
policies, the platform or the party which is now governing British 
Columbia.
<P>
	When we speak about democratic principles, we have to 
recognize that the system of voting does not allow for a proper 
representation of the views of a majority of citizens on many 
issues, and this is one of them. This is a very important issue for 
British Columbia.
<P>
	The second thing I want to address with respect to the minister's 
remarks is that he made the comment that natives have waited for 
200 years in Canada to have the issue resolved. I do not dispute the 
fact that since Confederation the federal government has had the 
clear constitutional responsibility to deal with the issue in British 
Columbia and in other parts of Canada. However, in British 
Columbia for whatever reason, the federal government chose to 
abrogate that responsibility. It is not the province of British 
Columbia which has the responsibility to deal with the issue, it is 
the federal government. I might also add that for the majority of the 
time since Confederation there have been Liberal governments in 
Ottawa. What is the minister doing throwing stones at the Reform 
Party or anybody else when it is clearly the federal government and 
a host of Liberal governments since Confederation that have 
created the problem in the first place?
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The third point the minister made, and one which needs to be 
responded to most strenuously, is the point that the Reform Party is 
not interested in helping the  poorest of the poor. It is his 
government and him, as minister of Indian affairs, who is really 
deeply concerned about these poor people who live on reserves in 
Canada. I suppose he has a lock on caring.
<P>
	A lot of native people live in my riding. There are a large number 
of reserves and nine Indian bands in total in my riding. I have 
written on behalf of many people who have come to see me who 
have demanded financial accountability from the minister. Can 
they get it? This $5.8 billion a year that the minister and the 
government is funnelling into aboriginal affairs is going to benefit 
a very few at the top.
<P>
	The minister does not have any lock on caring for the poorest of 
the poor because it is the very people in these communities who are 
the poorest of the poor and they are not receiving the benefits the 
taxpayers of Canada are contributing. It is because of the minister's 
refusal to take on his responsibility and demand accountability that 
these people are in the position they are in.
<P>
	I ask the House to recognize that although the minister may be 
making these grandiose statements and engaging in the flaming 
rhetoric that he loves to engage in so much, the reality is that the 
minister cares more about the entrenched leadership in Canada's 
aboriginal communities than he does about the poorest of the poor 
or the ordinary people. It is very clear to me that the leaders in the 
aboriginal communities are as much out of touch with their 
constituents as this government is out of touch with the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	In talking about the land claim situation in British Columbia, we 
started by saying that almost nobody in British Columbia disagrees 
with the proposition that we have to resolve these longstanding 
disputes between aboriginals and the Government of Canada. No 
one disputes the fact that we have to get these outstanding claims 
resolved and get on with life. No one disputes the fact that there 
have been injustices done to native people historically and I might 
add in contemporary terms.
<P>
	How did we get to be where we are today? The government is 
saying that there is a a huge problem out there which has to be dealt 
with. The government says it has a mandate to deal with it, 
although there are many who would disagree with that, so it has get 
on with it and it is going to engage in a modern treaty making 
process in British Columbia.
<P>
	We have to go right back to the Act of Union by which British 
Columbia joined Confederation to understand where we are today. 
By that Act of Union in 1871 British Columbia joined 
Confederation with an agreement that the federal government 
would be responsible for all existing and future obligations to 
aboriginal peoples. That is stated in the Act of Union. The federal 
government has a clear responsibility going right back to the day 
that British Columbia joined Confederation. However, it has never 
addressed that responsibility and that is why we are in the situation 
we are in today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17361"> 17361 </A></B>
<P>
	Going back to the 1970s some Indian bands decided they were 
going to commence legal actions to have their grievances aired 
and dealt with because they could not get them dealt with any 
other way.
<P>
	The most famous legal case, the one that is the pre-eminent legal 
case in Canada today with respect to aboriginal issues, native land 
claims and the inherent right to self-government, is the 
Delgamuukw case. This was launched by the 
Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en people who also happen to be within the 
riding I represent.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	The B.C. supreme court listened to 360 days of testimony, to all 
kinds of anthropological evidence, oral evidence presented by the 
elders of the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en people, listened to all kinds of 
legal arguments made on their behalf. At the end of that process 
when the court rendered its decision it found clearly that there is no 
inherent right to self-government and there is no aboriginal title to 
land.
<P>
	The court also found that the federal government had a 
constitutional obligation to address the issues of concern to 
aboriginal people and urged it to get on with it. In the meantime, 
after the court decision was rendered the Government of British 
changed. We had an outgoing Social Credit government and an 
incoming NDP government with an ideological bent on this issue, 
fervent in its belief it has to deal with the land claim issue in a way 
the province has never considered doing until then.
<P>
	What did it do? The Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en people are continuing 
with their court action. They have appealed the decision to the B.C. 
court of appeal. The province of British Columbia fired the 
successful legal firm of Russell &amp; DuMoulin, which had won the 
Delgamuuku case on behalf of the people of British Columbia, and 
replaced it with the firm Swinton &amp; Company, a registered paid 
federal lobbyists in 1994 on behalf of the very people it was to be 
squaring off with in court, the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en people.
<P>
	Furthermore, Swinton &amp; Company was also engaged in an action 
on behalf of the Gitksan in the B.C. supreme court against the 
province of British Columbia at a time when it had accepted this 
landmark legal case to represent the province of British Columbia 
on the very issues it was fighting the province with on behalf of the 
Gitksan at the time it was appointed. Talk about a conflict of 
interest.
<P>
	This is the way the NDP government in British Columbia has 
behaved with this issue. It wanted a political decision from the 
court. It was not prepared to allow the process to be followed 
through as it should have.
<P>
	In following the ideological rather than the legal decisions of the 
court and totally ignoring how the people of British Columbia, and 
in Canada for that matter, voted against the inherent right to 
self-government in the  Charlottetown accord, British Columbia in 
concert with the federal government went ahead and started to try 
to implement these things anyway, much as the federal government 
is trying to do with distinct society and a veto for Quebec in the 
unity issue right now.
<P>
	This is a slap in the face to British Columbia and a slap in the 
face to democracy. When the people have spoken in a democratic 
referendum and the government ignores that decision and goes 
about implementing the decisions anyway, legislatively rather than 
through constitutional change, that is a clear slap in the face to the 
people of Canada, particularly the people of British Columbia.
<P>
	The native population in British Columbia voted against the 
Charlottetown accord with almost the same percentage as the 
non-native population did. I have talked to enough native people to 
know very clearly they do not favour this notion of inherent right to 
self-government. I am talking about the ordinary grassroots people, 
not the chiefs, not the people benefiting from it.
<P>
	Now we have a process in place designed to achieve ends the 
public does not support. They are not supported by legal 
jurisprudence. The public is shut out of the process. There is no 
opportunity for the public to even be involved. What do we have 
but a bunch of bureaucrats getting their marching orders from 
Ottawa and Victoria. They are up in my riding negotiating with the 
Nisga'a. We hear rumours of these negotiations although we do not 
even know for sure what has or has not been put on the table.
<P>
	We hear rumours of a potentially massive conveyance of land, 
$175 million in cash, 2,200 square kilometres of land and a 
constitutionally protected right to 30 per cent of the Nass River 
fishery on a basis of forever and ever. Let us not forget the deals 
will be set in constitutional concrete. They will be forever. It is 
vital that we not make mistakes. Of course, the governments of the 
day are totally ignoring that.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I took the time to canvass people in my riding. One of the 
reasons I became so deeply involved in the issue is that I was 
receiving hundreds of letters and phone calls from constituents 
extremely uneasy with what they perceive to be a process taking 
place behind closed doors with the potential to alter the social 
fabric and the economic fabric of British Columbia with no 
legitimate opportunity for public input.
<P>
	As I said before, there are many parallels to the current national 
unity issue we are seized with. There are two agendas in Canada, 
the government's and the people's. Most of the time those agendas 
are not in sync. The government is proposing to give distinct 
society status to Quebec and to provide vetoes on a regional basis, 
but it is not in sync with what the people of Canada want. We can 
understand why the people of British  Columbia, in particular the 
people of rural British Columbia, are uncomfortable with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17362"> 17362 </A></B>
<P>
current process. There is no legitimate opportunity for them to be 
involved. This is all going on behind closed doors.
<P>
	The ratification process proposed by the government is that once 
an agreement in principle is signed it will be brought to the House 
for a vote. That means for the most part there will be members of 
Parliament from the rest of Canada voting on legislation which will 
have major, long term, far reaching consequences for the people of 
British Columbia, which has a leaderless, lame duck administration 
in Victoria that has lost virtually any shred of credibility.
<P>
	That is the thrust of the motion today. It is in recognition of the 
fact that the Government of British Columbia has no mandate and 
has never sought a mandate to be involved in negotiations of this 
magnitude. It has no credibility with the public. Its administration 
is in shambles. It is caught up in scandal. The aboriginal people of 
British Columbia, the ordinary grassroots people, are saying: ``We 
are not represented in this process. The people negotiating on our 
behalf do not have a mandate for us. We do not feel comfortable 
with it. We do not feel comfortable that this will ever benefit us. 
We think it will benefit the leaders. We think it will benefit the 
negotiators''.
<P>
	We are in the process of entering into agreements which will 
forever change the landscape of British Columbia. They have the 
potential to do that.
<P>
	In canvassing my constituents, which I have taken the time and 
the care to do, they have said very clearly they are looking for 
finality and extinguishment. They want an end to the division. The 
root cause of most of the problems in which native people find 
themselves is that we have treated them separately from day one. 
We have never given them the opportunity to be ordinary 
Canadians. We have never treated them as if they are able and 
capable of looking after themselves. We have built a pervasive 
welfare system around native people in Canada which has robbed 
them of their dignity, their self-esteem and their initiative.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The minister was talking about the poorest of the poor and what 
we will do about aboriginal housing and about the plight of these 
people.
<P>
	Friederich von Hayek talks about the Liberal philosophy and the 
socialist philosophy, which are virtually indistinguishable in this 
country, and he talks about fatal conceit. The fatal conceit is that 
people elected to government somehow feel like they have a God 
given ability to correct all the problems of people and society 
rather than letting those people have the opportunity to resolve 
their own problems.
<P>
	It is because of these interventionist, elitist, arrogant, top down 
policies created by government and driven by government, 
supposedly to solve all the problems, that we have the problems we 
see on native reserves today.
<P>
	What we are doing in this process right now, from my window, is 
creating new and better ways to separate people by race. We are 
saying the way we kept them separate and distinct and apart from 
Canadian society in the past has not worked. It has been a failure. 
The Indian Act is no good. Virtually everybody agrees with that 
now. We will find a new and better way to keep them separate. We 
will find a new and better way to give them a status different from 
that of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	In the long run and maybe even the short run that as well 
intentioned as some members opposite are on this issue, and they 
feel this will resolve the problems of native people, it will entrench 
them that much deeper. It will not solve their problems.
<P>
	As the member for Esquimalt said in his remarks a few minutes 
ago, we should be considering what is right, doing what will 
actually work; an encouragement to these people to take control of 
their own lives on an individual basis and forget about expecting 
the government to solve their problems because the government 
has a disastrous track record in that regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague's 
remarks this morning, as I did with preceding speakers.
<P>
	For the record I will read the subject of the motion the Reform 
Party put forward today and then talk about the hon. minister's 
objection to it and why that is. In part it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to not enter into any binding trilateral 
aboriginal treaty or land claim agreements in B.C. in the last year of the current 
provincial government mandate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. minister said that for the federal government to do that 
would be insulting. I find that strange and more than a little 
contradictory because it is the same government that had no 
problem in arguing quite successfully that the EH-101 helicopter 
purchase which the Tory government had entered into was not right 
and we should not be doing that as a nation, that we should not be 
spending the money on that.
<P>
	It argued the Pearson airport deal was not right because it was 
entered into in the dying days of the Mulroney administration and 
should be cancelled.
<P>
	It does not find that insulting, to back out of commitments made 
by previous governments. Yet for some reason the hon. minister 
seemed to think today it would be insulting the government of 
British Columbia to insist that we do not enter into any trilateral 
agreements with B.C. and the natives of British Columbia in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17363"> 17363 </A></B>
<P>
dying days of that administration. I find it more  than a bit puzzling 
and I wonder if my hon. colleague would care to remark on that.
<P>
	I note with interest that the hon. minister spent almost his entire 
20 minutes bashing Reformers for being aboriginal bashers. I find 
that puzzling. That type of name calling and labelling is nothing 
new for Reformers. We have been labelled that and subject to those 
types of attacks right from the very beginning when we started our 
party. We are going to insist on carrying forward sensible 
arguments on this and other issues, even if they are non-politically 
correct arguments, regardless of how we are attacked or how often 
ministers openly attack us in the House.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Would the hon. member care to remark on what he has done. One 
of the things we have heard this morning is that the public is not 
well enough informed and the expectations of the native people 
have been raised. What about the awareness? What has this 
member actually done in British Columbia to bring to the attention 
of all British Columbians what is happening?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.
<P>
	He is absolutely right. The minister began his remarks today by 
having the gall to question the Reform Party for even wanting to 
debate this issue in the House. He asked, how dare we to even want 
to debate this issue? Is this not a democratic institution? Is this not 
what this House is for? But, no, we should not be debating this. 
Anytime we even raise an aboriginal issue and want to debate it, we 
are labelled. Frankly that has an odour to it that I cannot abide.
<P>
	Second, my colleague points out that the minister said that this 
would be an insult to the province of British Columbia if the 
government were to accept the motion of the Reform Party. For the 
benefit of members in the House who do not live in British 
Columbia, I could tell them how insulting the government of the 
province of British Columbia has been to the citizens of British 
Columbia in recent months. Its members have absolutely no regard 
for the public interest. They put their own interest forward all the 
time. They are so blatantly ideologically driven that there is no 
hope they could ever be re-elected as a government in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	Yet this very administration is the one that is negotiating behind 
closed doors, in secret, with the Nisga'a and with other aboriginal 
groups right now and contemplating, as rumours go, making 
agreements that are going to have long term implications for 
British Columbia.
<P>
	In response to the member's question on what I have done as a 
member of Parliament and as a representative of the people of 
Skeena since I was elected, I held a series of four town hall 
meetings in my riding, in Smithers, Terrace, Prince Rupert and 
Kitimat. I brought the issue  to the people and said that we need to 
have a public discussion on this.
<P>
	Subsequent to that, my colleague and I went around the province 
of British Columbia. We held town hall meetings at in Williams 
Lake, Quesnel, Prince George, Nanaimo, Cranbrook and in several 
areas in greater Vancouver. We have done as much as we possibly 
can to bring the issue to the people, something that the province of 
British Columbia, and I might add, the federal government have 
never cared one whit about doing, not one whit.
<P>
	The reason I feel so passionate about this, and I mean this 
sincerely, is this. What is going to happen if the province of British 
Columbia and the federal government sign a deal with which the 
people cannot live? The native people's expectation levels are at an 
all time high. They have been led to believe that these agreements, 
once they are entered into and signed, are going to be abided by, 
that they are going to be honoured. We already have opposition 
parties in British Columbia saying that they do not intend to honour 
them.
<P>
	Think of the tremendous social upheaval we are going to have if 
governments sign agreements with which the people are not going 
to live, which the people do not want and will not accept. It is 
absolutely critical that we do not sign agreements unless we are 
sure they are going to be supported by the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague from 
Skeena for actually standing up and saying what he wants to do to 
help those that the minister referred to as the poorest of the poor.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	It is interesting to compare both speeches. The minister went on 
a 20-minute diatribe against the Reform Party instead of stating 
what he was going to do for the people who he claims are the 
poorest of the poor in our society.
<P>
	While we stand in the House talking rhetoric among political 
parties, those aboriginal people who are on or off reserve that are 
suffering from sexual abuse, violence and the poverty that they 
endure, are still out there suffering. We should be ashamed in the 
House to be seeing that happening.
<P>
	Previous governments have created for the aboriginal people an 
institutionalized welfare state. They have done this by giving 
money to people in the honest expectation that it would help them.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague mentioned, one cannot keep giving things 
to people and expect them to have pride and self-respect. Pride and 
self-respect comes from within one's person and it is rooted in the 
ability of the person to take care of himself or herself.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17364"> 17364 </A></B>
<P>
	Contrary to what the minister said, I would like to ask my hon. 
colleague from Skeena, and for him to reiterate if he could, that 
the pursuit of the treaties is constitutionally and legally from the 
court's point of view, illegal.
<P>
	What does he propose to help those people on or off reserve who 
are suffering from the terrible things that I mentioned previously? 
How is he going to help the poorest of the poor stand on their own 
two feet and take care of themselves? That is the root of the 
problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. It is very clear that the plight of native people in Canada, 
the tremendous social problems that we see on reserves, are a direct 
result of the huge welfare state that we built up around them. It is 
the arrogance and the elitist notion on the part of government that it 
can fix problems by throwing money at them and creating new 
programs and so on that entrenches these very serious human 
conditions on native reserves.
<P>
	What is required is for the government to say first, stop treating 
aboriginals as if they all think and act and want the same things. 
They are not communists. They are individuals just like we are. 
They are individuals who have individual aspirations, desires, 
visions, hopes and dreams.
<P>
	We need to break that welfare state, start dismantling it. We need 
to give a hand up to those people and encourage them to get out into 
the private sector, to become ordinary citizens and provide them 
with a one-time opportunity to make that transition easier.
<P>
	We have to understand that the corollary of success is failure. 
The government cannot guarantee success and it cannot guarantee 
that people will not fail. That is axiomatic. That is something that 
we have to live with. It is a human condition. It is natural law, if 
you will. One cannot guarantee that anybody is going to be 
successful. All one can do is try to make the conditions as fertile as 
possible for success to happen.
<P>
	I believe very strongly that when the government backs out of 
this interventionist mode it is in right now and allows native Indian 
people to take the bull by the horns and start controlling their own 
lives, we will see some failures. There is no question about it. 
However, we are going to start seeing successes. We will see more 
success as time goes by.
<P>
	When we talk about having native Indian people as ordinary 
Canadians, I am not saying that I do not respect the culture. I 
respect the culture and I respect that there are differences. Those 
differences can and should be celebrated, but not celebrated in law, 
not entrenched in the Constitution, not entrenched in 
distinctiveness and separateness in law that is going to keep us 
apart forever.
<P>
	The gulf between native and non-native people is widening all 
the time because of the policies of government, not because there is 
a fundamental problem. It is the policies.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced he was going to 
increase access fees for fishermen, but the access fees were only 
going to go up by 50 per cent for native fishermen but 100 per cent 
for everyone else. I am convinced the native fishermen did not ask 
for that. It was this minister who came up with some 
woolly-thinking policy that this was what he should be doing. What 
it does is create division. Why is it that we have the problems with 
the native and non-native fishermen on the Fraser River system? It 
is because government created a policy that allowed access to a 
resource on a different basis based on race. That has to be done 
away with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing time with my distinguished colleague, the hon. 
member for Vancouver Centre.
<P>
	The motion put forward is an interesting one and I respect the 
spirit in which it was put forward. It raises issues going to what is 
called the lame duck status of government. It is a principle of 
American constitutional law that I think sensibly could become 
part of Canadian constitution law, but it is limited in its potential 
application to actions taken by governments between the dropping 
of an electoral writ and the return of the electoral writ and the 
formation of a new government or the continuance of an old one.
<P>
	Having said that, I would like to enter into discussion of some of 
the very interesting issues that have been raised. This is a subject, 
rightly said, of special concern to British Columbia. British 
Columbia, as we all recognize, is not a province like the others and 
in the area of land claims we do have elements of distinctiveness 
that separate us off from the other provinces of Canada.
<P>
	The substantial absence of treaties is one very important 
consideration which has led to a proliferation of sometimes 
overlapping claims. Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the public 
discussion and the lack always of full understanding of how these 
complications can be removed.
<P>
	I leave to one side the issue of the status of treaties, which is 
something that has always interested me professionally. Do they 
have international law status, as some argue, or are they simply 
constitutional documents within the ambit of provincial law?
<P>
	Elements of concern have been expressed in this debate on 
which perhaps we could offer some clarification. I was, I think, the 
first to suggest the implications for Canadian law of the 
International Court's judgment in Western Sahara in 1975 and the 
two concurring opinions which rested very strongly on the  
argument 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17365"> 17365 </A></B>
<P>
made by then counsel, Mr. Bedjaoui who is now the president of 
the World Court. Let me say that although I think they do raise the 
intellectual challenge very effectively, which the court has 
recognized, to the concept of acquisition of territorial title and 
sovereignty by European colonial powers, they do not necessarily 
raise any implications as to the dispositions in view of that and in 
substitution for that. These are issues to which a body constituted 
on an independent basis like the treaties commission, armed with 
the facilities for research and the time for thinking, can offer fresh 
light.
<P>
	Let me say that it is a misconception to assume that 
automatically by querying the original basis of acquisition of 
sovereignty over North America one automatically displaces 
supervening claims. In fact, in the most recent international law 
act, the two-by-four treaty, the treaty between the four occupation 
powers of Germany and the two Germanies about to be reunited, 
there is a specific clause that effectively saves supervening third 
party rights. It leaves open the issue of how one balances the 
claims.
<P>
	What I am saying is that one anticipates in British Columbia an 
orderly process of claims adjustments and settlements in which the 
claims of everybody can be and will be considered if properly 
presented by counsel as is counsel's duty. As yet no definitive 
answer can be given, but it should bring some satisfaction to many 
of the people who have raised these issues with us to know that the 
orderly process does allow taking into full account the acquired 
third party rights.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	In a sense the legal problems in British Columbia are sui generis. 
They are peculiar to British Columbia. To a large extent we get into 
conflicts between different cultural conceptions of law: the 
European concept of fixed territorial frontiers and non-European 
concepts which may emphasize mobility and expression of 
territorial interests in which land is secondary or subordinate to the 
notion of ethnicity. It is an interesting example of the clash of legal 
concepts. It is the sort of thing I expect the commission will 
consider because it will have to be considered in the process of the 
settlement of land claims.
<P>
	The issue of the participation and consent of local communities 
has been raised. It has been asked if there was full consultation. I 
cannot speak of the particular cases now being cited in the debate, 
but on the precedent that the federal government followed in the 
bill which was before the House in relation to the northern 
territories, there was a very substantial provision for consultation 
with local interests. I believe there is nothing in the implementation 
of the commission process which prevents local interests, local 
municipal authorities and others from bringing forward their views 
and making their arguments. It is not excluded by the act. The 
initiative rests with those concerned.
<P>
	When an independent commission is set up, it takes on a life of 
its own. It develops its own precedents. It is very much dependent 
on intelligent lawyer-manship by those people who want to bring 
forward their own interests and their claims. The commission is a 
body which has interesting people appointed to it. They are 
independent in their outlook. I would suggest to hon. members that 
they exercise to the full the process of making known to the 
commission the different and sometimes conflicting interests of the 
different people involved.
<P>
	One of the great problems in British Columbia which 
distinguishes it from the rest of the country is that, simply because 
of the absence of treaties, there has not been the process of the 
sorting out of claims which I encountered in my previous 
professional work in dealing with, for example, the province of 
Alberta. This accounts for the overlapping and competing claims 
which sometimes, in the superficial extent, exceed the total amount 
of land involved in a region. This can be sorted out and sensibly, 
this is the mandate of the commission.
<P>
	Problems of this sort complicate the matter in the public 
perception. In terms of the commission, I believe it is an excellent 
step forward. I am satisfied with the independence and the quality 
of the people concerned.
<P>
	I urge hon. members to indicate to their constituents, particularly 
to the very thoughtful people at the municipal level that the process 
is not closed. The door is open for participants to bring their 
interests forward. The commission itself is not in the position of 
deciding on a dichotomous basis all here or all there. There is room 
for the acceptance of third party claims. There is room for 
apportionment of benefits. Following the international law as it has 
developed since the western Sahara case, international law itself is 
in the making. One would expect equitable settlements in which the 
largest possible range of participants is involved.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	It is a new approach to the pluralizing of our legal system and the 
participation in it. This is better than doing it through the court 
system as such. Of course, decisions of commissions are also 
subject to limitation and control by the courts in respect to ultimate 
constitutional principles. Everything done is under the Constitution 
and under the charter of rights. The charter of rights as we know is 
a house of very many rooms.
<P>
	I compliment the speakers on both sides of the House on the 
fervour with which they have entered into this debate. I have taken 
note of the points they have raised, but I believe they can be 
achieved within this ambitious process that the bill the minister 
originally introduced involves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17366"> 17366 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talked about a substantial absence of 
treaties in British Columbia. That is correct. The assumption is 
often made that because there is a  substantial absence of treaties 
and largely a reserve system in place, there is somehow an 
overriding legal obligation on the part of governments to enter into 
treaties.
<P>
	A legal counsel for the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development confirmed to me very recently that the 
current federal government position is that there is no legal 
obligation or imperative on the part of the federal government to 
enter into treaties in British Columbia. That is certainly consistent 
with what I had thought. It is also consistent with the position of the 
provincial government.
<P>
	This means to me that government should only be entering into 
this process if there is something in it for all parties. This is the 
quid pro quo or trade-off I mentioned in my speech. My first 
question for the member would be whether that indeed is his 
interpretation as well.
<P>
	There was some discussion about an independent commission. I 
assume the member is talking about the B.C. Treaty Commission. 
There was some debate about the B.C. Treaty Commission recently 
in the House when we debated Bill C-107, which is the enabling 
federal legislation, albeit quite tardy.
<P>
	The terms of reference of the B.C. Treaty Commission actually 
leaves it rather toothless. In most areas of endeavour the 
commission can suggest but it is not very much of a decision 
maker. The commission is called the keeper of the process. Some 
things as basic as readiness guidelines for some of the participants 
in the negotiations were not foreseen at the time the enabling 
legislation was put together. For example, regional advisory 
committees do not have readiness guidelines that fall within the 
terms of reference of the B.C. Treaty Commission. This has been 
pointed out by many parties as a shortcoming. Therefore, it has no 
mandate.
<P>
	What has happened in some circumstances in B.C. is that 
negotiations have pushed ahead by either the federal and/or 
provincial negotiators without the regional advisory committees 
actually being ready. This is quite a handicap and of course creates 
consternation at the local level. My second question would relate to 
that area.
<P>
	The third and final area I would ask the member about would be 
the role of municipalities which he mentioned. Municipalities are 
recognized nowhere in the B.C. Treaty Commission terms of 
reference. There is a separate provincial memorandum of 
understanding. They are kind of a sidebar arrangement with the 
province. The municipalities through the Union of B.C. 
Municipalities are saying that their actual costs already, early in the 
process, are at least double that which the provincial government is 
compensating them.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I would say the door is not open. The door is ajar. It is a very 
unsatisfactory situation. There must be a much better way to 
approach this subject. Does the member have some suggestions in 
that regard?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his very 
thoughtful series of questions.
<P>
	On the first point, what we are talking about relates to what I 
spoke of as the ambiguity in the term ``treaties''. What one is really 
seeking is a movement from unwritten or customary law to written 
law. This could be done by a contract, by legislation or it could be 
done by something else. The ultimate aim of the process is to 
reduce to written uncontrovertible form what the legal rights are. 
The complication I referred to of overlapping claims is virtually 
inevitable and it has been demonstrated in jurisdictions other than 
our own when we do not have things written down. That was the 
big advantage of the treaties in whatever legal category we put 
them to.
<P>
	On the commissions, my own experience in administrative law 
and public administration is that it depends a good deal on the 
imagination and the civil courage of the commission itself and the 
players in it. The players include the lawyers and others appearing 
before it. To a very large extent an ambitious commission 
establishes its own agenda. It redefines its own mandate. I 
encourage all parties interested in the equitable disposition of B.C. 
land claims to try to do that.
<P>
	On municipalities, the hon. member was right in saying that the 
specific provision is not there. There is nothing excluding it. Since 
they are major players in relation to the third party claims, 
supervening claims, subsequent to any original title, such as it may 
be, municipalities are directly involved and they are important 
players in the political processes.
<P>
	In the previous federal legislation relating to the northern 
territories there was an enormous amount of provision by the 
federal government for consultation of local interests. I think the 
encouragement would be to the municipal councils where they 
have legitimate interests that they feel they want to express to 
communicate them. The answer can only be no or ``yes, we would 
love to hear you''. I would think in a facultative sense a good 
commission tries to do just that.
<P>
	It is law in the making. A good deal will depend on the good 
faith, good spirit but also the professional preparation that 
interested parties do. That would be the main message I would 
encourage our B.C. voters to adopt in this approach.
<P>
	I thank the member for his questions. I would add that the debate 
we are having today constitutes in legal terms travaux 
préparatoires, which simply means that it may be cited as evidence 
for the future of what the law in this area should be and is.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17367"> 17367 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is one further area I would like 
to explore with the member and I will do it very quickly.
<P>
	There is a lot of concern and a lack of support for the way the 
negotiations are occurring. There is a lack of confidence in many 
people because the negotiations are run provincially by an 
aboriginal affairs department and federally by the department of 
Indian affairs. People consider it a total conflict of interest which is 
lopsided.
<P>
	Could the member comment on that, please.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot comment specifically. 
My experience in negotiations in this general area was in situations 
where there were treaties in force, treaties 6, 7, 8 and 9. There the 
process of the negotiations was happy with all parties. If there is 
something at fault here it may go down to the handling of particular 
cases.
<P>
	I just do not have the direct information. If there is a feeling of 
dissatisfaction, maybe that is a matter to take up directly with the 
commission and to be led as such. The commission would want to 
satisfy itself that negotiations have been properly conducted and 
evidence properly assessed.
<P>
	I commend to the hon. member, if he has information, to bring it 
to the attention of the commission.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today 
to respond specifically to the motion of the hon. member for North 
Island-Powell River that the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-not enter into any binding trilateral aboriginal treaty or land claim 
agreements in B.C. in the last year of the provincial government mandate-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Inherent in the motion is the issue my hon. friend referred to 
recently, which is the lame duck issue that seeks to nullify the 
powers of any government in the last year of its mandate. This is 
the most cynical statement I have ever heard from any party of any 
legislature or House.
<P>
	Does this then suggest that any process-and one in this case 
that is so clearly in the best interest of the people of British 
Columbia and of the aboriginal people-must be put on the back 
burner for political consideration?
<P>
	Surely Canadians deserve to know that their governments can 
make policy decisions that are sustainable and not politically 
biased but people biased in the best interest of Canadians.
<P>
	Government serves the people. Whatever the stripe of 
government, good public policy and the integrity of government as 
a whole must be kept sacrosanct.
<P>
	Reformers are suggesting then, or are they, that they do not want 
to be bound by the decisions legally and morally agreed upon in a 
trilateral, provincial government, aboriginal people and federal 
government negotiated contract.
<P>
	Since the 1800s, that is over a century ago, aboriginal people 
have been trying to negotiate validity of land claims with the 
British Columbia government. It has constantly rejected this 
validity based on the fact that it was a federal responsibility, or this 
is what it said.
<P>
	The process has taken so long that finally in 1990 the B.C. 
government, a Social Credit government, took a major step and 
began a process to right this wrong. The three parties, that is the 
First Nations, the federal government and the provincial 
government, have since agreed to the process, and this is what is 
happening now.
<P>
	I hope we will not accept this motion which in effect seeks to 
further delay the process. The people of B.C., the aboriginal people 
and the people of Canada have been waiting for far too long.
<P>
	During the second reading stage of the bill that sets up the 
commission, members of the third party stood repeatedly and 
complained about how long the process was taking. Now they are 
seeking to set up another barrier to the process.
<P>
	In 1989 we witnessed the end of the cold war and the Berlin Wall 
coming down. One year later it seemed that another longstanding 
barrier had been removed, a barrier that had stood between 
aboriginal peoples in British Columbia and the economic and 
social development to which they aspired.
<P>
	Good governments must bring down barriers, not raise them as I 
see the third party in effect attempting to do with this kind of 
doublespeak. Future generations may well regard 1990 as a 
singular turning point in the history of British Columbia's 
aboriginal peoples, the year in which they were offered a glimmer 
of hope.
<P>
	Settling land claims is the single most important thing that can 
be done in British Columbia to help aboriginal communities. 
Uncertainty over land claims has been a barrier to economic 
development for all British Columbians for quite a while. 
Uncertainty has hindered aboriginal participation in land and 
resource management. All British Columbians know that when we 
solve these problems it will mean greater self-sufficiency. It will 
mean jobs. It will mean employment for the people who have long 
been disempowered to take their rightful equal place in Canadian 
society.
<P>
	In addition to the ownership of settlement lands in the area 
covered by the treaty, the final agreements may include specific 
measures to stimulate economic development. This may include 
resource revenue sharing. This may include sharing of royalties 
derived from resource extraction throughout the area.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	It is not only economic good that we seek in these treaty 
negotiations. We have seen in the aboriginal sacred summit that 
began across the river in Hull last week, a summit of aboriginal 
elders organized by the hon. member for Churchill, that the 
attachment to nature and to the Creator by aboriginal peoples is a 
central element of their spirituality. Land claims are more than just 
economic; they are spiritual to the people of British Columbia's 
aboriginal communities.
<P>
	I think the House would agree the decision by the provincial 
government to come to the negotiating table was of paramount 
importance. Prior to 1990 aboriginal Canadians in British 
Columbia were offered no hope and no equality of benefits. I 
remind the House of some of the developments that led to that 
turning point because in those developments there is a profound 
irony.
<P>
	One key player in convincing the British Columbia government 
to reverse its historical opposition to negotiating treaties was the 
minister of native affairs for the province at that time, Mr. Jack 
Weisgerber. Mr. Weisgerber was a Social Credit cabinet minister 
when British Columbia decided to negotiate. Today he is the leader 
of the Reform Party in British Columbia. What irony that the 
decision was taken by a man who had vision unlike what is being 
proposed across from the House.
<P>
	In 1989 provincial governments appointed the premiers advisory 
committee on native affairs. The council travelled through the 
province and met with bands and tribal councils to suggest a 
solution to address the social and economic issues facing 
aboriginal people. They were not seeking to continue to erect 
barriers. And so the province began the process of coming to the 
negotiating table.
<P>
	The advisory council made its recommendations to cabinet in 
1990 and shortly thereafter Mr. Weisgerber signed the Nisga'a 
framework agreement. For the first time in the history of British 
Columbia a province was negotiating a land claim. Soon the B.C. 
government was deeply involved in the process of bringing the 
First Nations to the table.
<P>
	B.C. participated in the First Nations summit and the province 
met with the federal government in B.C. By the time Bill 22 that 
created the legislative authority for the B.C. treaty commission 
came into the legislature, Mr. Weisgerber was no longer a cabinet 
minister but sat on the opposition benches.
<P>
	However the new NDP government continued the process begun 
by the Social Credit government although it was of a different 
political stripe. By doing so it reaffirmed people's faith in the 
certainty of public policy free from the vagaries of petty subjective 
politics.
<P>
	I quote what Mr. Weisgerber said at the time of the debate in the 
legislature. He pointed out that the strategy  for government in 
British Columbia for 125 to 130 years had been to deny that a 
problem with treaties existed, a philosophy it seems the third party 
still continues to espouse. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It became increasingly clear to us, as we travelled and met with groups 
around the province, that if we were going to address the root of the social and 
economic problems, we had to deal with the land claim question.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was a bold and visionary conclusion to make. It took great 
political courage. It overturned the accepted political wisdom of 
the day. It acknowledged a simple reality. It was a a daring act of 
great statesmanship by a politician who put the public good before 
political ideology. I urge members of the third party to take a leaf 
from that book.
<P>
	In 1991 a new provincial government, the NDP government, 
accepted the recommendations of the last government. Also in 
1991 a federal government accepted the recommendations of a 
provincial government that was not of the same political stripe.
<P>
	Mr. Weisgerber went on to predict to the B.C. legislature that the 
First Nations would be very able negotiators. He urged the 
provincial government to negotiate every bit as effectively for the 
interest of all British Columbians. He said that negotiations had to 
be tough but fair.
<P>
	These are the views of a British Columbian who is not only one 
of the founders of the current treaty process. I have quoted him at 
length because of the motion by the hon. member for North 
Island-Powell River. He asked that the federal government not 
enter into agreements in order to respect the views of British 
Columbians on the land claims issue as expressed by both major 
provincial parties. The leader of one of those provincial opposition 
parties, the Reform Party of British Columbia, is Mr. Jack 
Weisgerber, the man who in 1990 put justice before politics.
<P>
	It is clear British Columbians want to get on with the task of 
resolving land claims and to become a stable environment for 
economic growth once again. The process is a good one. The 
aboriginal peoples approve and both levels of government agree. 
We cannot put the process on hold each time a government nears 
the end of its mandate. It is unjust, unfair and cruel.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Where would we be today if we had followed the logic of the 
hon. member's motion? We would actually be a federal Liberal 
government and an NDP provincial government not taking up a 
policy that was carried on in good faith because it was in the best 
interest of the people.
<P>
	Back in May 1993 the previous federal government had been in 
power for nearly five years, since the 1988 election. The former 
Prime Minister had announced his intention to step down and the 
Progressive Conservative  Party was in the middle of a leadership 
convention. Did the provincial government and the aboriginal 
summit say at that time: ``Wait a minute. Maybe we shouldn't pass 
this legislation. After all, the federal government is nearing the end 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17369"> 17369 </A></B>
<P>
of its mandate. Let's wait until the next federal election?'' Did they 
say that? Of course they did not.
<P>
	Canadians elect their representatives to serve for a full mandate. 
The people hope that vicarious politics will not stop good public 
policy. This would leave to massive destabilization in Canada 
every four years and to a meaningless international trade and 
provincial controls. We have seen how this type of political 
grandstanding brought the United States government to a halt 
recently.
<P>
	Let us allow the British Columbia government to get on with its 
business in a way that it deems appropriate. Let us get back to our 
own responsibilities for taking measures that will improve the 
economic and social prospects of aboriginal people in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talked about the motion somehow being 
cynical.
<P>
	Under normal circumstances a government in the last several 
months of its mandate does not enter into major binding 
commitments. If it does so, it is at the peril of the arrangements 
being cancelled. There is a clear precedent for that in the province 
of British Columbia and there is a clear precedent for that federally. 
This administration should know that better than anyone. This 
administration cancelled the EH-101 project. This administration 
tried to cancel the Pearson deal.
<P>
	The province of British Columbia should voluntarily back off. 
However it has indicated that it wants a deal by January. The 
likelihood is that there will be an election between March and June. 
This is totally inappropriate for a precedent setting agreement. 
There are 47 other agreements being negotiated and this would 
become the precedent. As I mentioned earlier, $10 billion is the 
early price tag put on this business.
<P>
	There was discussion about the Nisga'a framework agreement 
entered into by Mr. Weisgerber in 1991. I talked about it earlier in 
my speech. I quoted section 7.1.1 which is often used to say there 
was no openness in the agreement and that Mr. Weisgerber had 
agreed to it. I do not have to defend Mr. Weisgerber. However I can 
read what the agreement says. To me it does not say what it has 
been interpreted to say. I will read it again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The parties will together develop and implement a process of public 
information and consultation and will attend meetings with such selected 
individuals, organizations or groups as they may agree will assist in the process 
of public consensus building, and the parties may separately carry out such 
additional consultation and communication initiatives as they see fit, including 
initiatives to obtain a broad range of input and consensus.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those are hardly cloaked in mystery, secret or non-transparent 
negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	There is a further interpretation by the member that somehow 
our motion is suggesting there should not be any negotiations. That 
is not what we are saying at all. We are saying there should not be 
no conclusive negotiations, no conclusive agreement during this 
latter part of this current mandate at the provincial level.
<P>
	It is a very simple, limited request. The member is 
misinterpreting it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased to answer the two 
points. The first is that is appropriate to create a lame duck 
government in the last year of any government's term. This is so 
inappropriate.
<P>
	This is a process that has spanned two governments. It is a 
process that began in the last year of a Social Credit government. It 
was picked up by an NDP government and continues to be carried 
on. It occurred because it was good public policy. Obviously, good 
public policy will be seen to be such and it must be a process that 
can be carried on.
<P>
	If a provincial government should stop in a tripartite process 
with another level of government and with a group of people duly 
set up by their own people to negotiate in good faith, then when the 
provincial government does that in the last year of its mandate and 
the federal government does that in the last year of its mandate, 
once in every three years will we have any negotiation at any 
signatory. It makes every single level of government ineffective.
<P>
	It also makes the aboriginal people, who are the third party 
negotiating with them, wonder whether this is a worthwhile process 
at all. It makes a mockery of any type of negotiated process.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member referred to what Mr. Weisgerber said 
and to the changes in the process of the Nisga'a treaty sinceMr. Weisgerber had set it up. He is right.
<P>
	What Mr. Weisgerber did say, and I listened carefully to the 
quote, is not that we stop the process but that we continue to refine 
it as we find flaws in it. That is extremely appropriate.
<P>
	What this member is asking is that we stop the process that has 
been on the table. Negotiations are going on. People may come to a 
conclusion any moment now and we must ignore all of the year's 
work that has been done to get to that point. This does not make any 
sense to me. It is an ineffective way for any government, any 
negotiations to take place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Reformers will be splitting their time from this point 
onward today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17370"> 17370 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to rebut one thing the hon. member preceding me 
said. She seemed to imply that somehow Reformers would be 
creating a lame duck government, as she called it. In actuality, 
the NDP in British Columbia has done a very good job of creating 
a lame duck government all by itself. That responsibility rests with 
it and no one else.
<P>
	We are now entering the 21st century. As we look at the B.C. 
treaty process we have an obligation to future generations of 
Canadians, aboriginal and non-aboriginal. We must enter into 
negotiations with a clear view of what we are trying to accomplish. 
I believe a fundamental objective to any negotiations with native 
Canadians should be equality.
<P>
	If there are historical grievances they should be resolved. The 
end result should be equality, not the creation of two classes of 
citizens and not the creation of more special rights to individuals 
depending on race. We are all Canadians and government policy 
should not be based on guilt or some misguided sense of righting 
past wrongs.
<P>
	British Columbians have recognized this. The opposition parties 
also realize the underlying principles of the current treaty 
negotiations in B.C. are flawed. It is time to look forward, not 
backward.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Certainly we must learn from the grim history of past Indian 
policies in Canada. However, what is the fundamental lesson to be 
learned? It is simply that policies which have given Indians special 
rights and status under the guise of protecting them have utterly 
failed. For many years Indians lost their status and right to live with 
their families on reserves if they received a university degree or if 
they defended our country or values in wars overseas. They were 
not even allowed to vote until the 1960s. Children were taken from 
their families and sent to foster homes or residential schools. 
Although Indian communities have known about it for decades, the 
stories of physical, emotional and sexual abuse suffered by those 
children are only now coming to light in the mainstream press.
<P>
	Just this week the church has finally issued an apology for the 
suffering caused by its members.
<P>
	That Indians were mistreated, used and abused is well 
documented. However, it does neither natives nor non-natives any 
good to dwell on the past. It will not solve today's problems. We 
must learn from mistakes to make sure we do not repeat them, but 
it is time to move on.
<P>
	The treaty process in B.C. is going in the wrong direction. It is 
designed to perpetuate inequality. In the Constitution Act of 1982 
aboriginal and treaty rights were given constitutional protection. 
That means any treaties we enter hastily into now will be virtually  
unchangeable, no matter how flawed or unsustainable they may 
prove to be.
<P>
	Any legal obligations to Indian communities should be cleared 
up as soon as possible because until we do, the question of 
aboriginal title will remain unresolved and the legal uncertainty 
over the ownership of land and resources will continue.
<P>
	Settlements must be affordable and settlements must be final. If 
the federal and provincial governments purport to represent the 
interests of all Canadians they will only negotiate what the courts 
have stated the government is legally liable for.
<P>
	As far as I know, the courts have not said the government has to 
turn large tracts of land over to native communities. In the 
Delgamuukw case, as has already been stated, the judges 
recognized an aboriginal interest in the land but not an outright 
title. Therefore legally the crown does not have to turn over title to 
all lands that a band claims as traditional territory, but it does have 
to recognize certain traditional rights to use those lands.
<P>
	We must respect these court decisions because they are based on 
the constitutional protection of aboriginal rights. Therefore any 
agreements the government signs should fully meet our legal 
obligations but should not go beyond them. If the government feels 
it has a moral obligation to offer more, then all such offers should 
be made outside of the treaty process.
<P>
	The governments of the day do not have a mandate to incur 
unsustainable debts beyond their legal obligation in the name of 
our children. They do not have the right to create citizens-plus by 
enshrining new treaties which give additional rights based on 
membership in a particular band or community. This will soon be 
the 21st century, not the 12th.
<P>
	I would be very pleased if any member opposite, in fact anybody 
participating in the B.C. treaty process, could point out where in 
the Constitution it states we must enter into new treaties. I 
recognize that existing treaties have constitutional protection but I 
have not found the section that states we must enter into dozens, 
perhaps hundreds, more treaties.
<P>
	Government has a legal and moral obligation to resolve disputes 
or grievances with all Canadians, whether aboriginal or not. I am 
not aware of the case law which states we must use a treaty process 
to do it. In every other segment of our society grievances are settled 
with some type of finite, quantifiable compensation. Why not 
Indian claims?
<P>
	It is long past time that historical differences were dealt with, but 
the end result should be some sort of cash compensation, not a 
treaty with constitutionally entrenched special rights or status. 
Cash settlements would allow individual natives to determine their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17371"> 17371 </A></B>
<P>
own futures. They could start their own small business, buy  land or 
put it in the bank for their children if that was there wish.
<P>
	If land is to be on the table also then it should be transferred to 
individual recipients on the same fee simple basis as to all other 
Canadians who own land.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	The tax exempt status of the current reserve system afforded by 
the Indian Act was based on a paternalistic idea that Indians would 
sell off the land to the first unscrupulous businessman who 
happened to walk by. Nobody, aboriginal or non-aboriginal, wants 
the Indian Act any more. That also means getting rid of the tax 
exempt status. If natives are to participate in today's economy they 
must participate on an equal footing with all other Canadians.
<P>
	Anyone who might suggest this would not be just or fair as a 
settlement is guilty of paternalistic racism. If government or native 
leaders suggest land can only be transferred as reserve lands held in 
common, they are suggesting native Canadians are incapable of 
making sound business decisions and government must still be 
responsible for protecting native interests because they cannot do it 
themselves.
<P>
	What is the legacy of past treaties? First and foremost, it is the 
reserve system. This was a deliberate policy by the government to 
isolate and concentrate natives in easily managed groups. It was a 
bad policy from start to finish. The poverty, low life expectancies, 
health problems and social problems found on so many reserves 
across the country cannot be a fluke. Natives from the east coast, 
from the north, from the prairies and from fishing communities on 
the west coast are not from the same cultures or traditions. The 
problems we see on reserves are not because the people are Indians. 
The biggest part of the problem is the reserve system itself.
<P>
	I believe first and foremost that all Canadians should have the 
right to equal opportunities. No one should have special rights or 
privileges based on race. This means we all pay taxes and we all 
have access to the same programs. All third party interests should 
be taken into consideration. This is not what is happening in B.C. 
today. The majority of British Columbians have grave concerns 
about the current B.C. treaty commission process.
<P>
	We must reach just settlements with B.C. natives as soon as 
possible so we can all move on. These settlements must be final, 
affordable and must extinguish all future claims to land, resources 
or special rights and privileges. Without equality we will never 
have long term social and economic stability in Canada.
<P>
	The enormous social problems we see on reserves today cannot 
be addressed through treaties. Treaties and reserves are, in my 
view, a big part of the problem.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member stated there should be 
direct cash compensation instead of negotiated settlements with 
aboriginal peoples. Cash does form part of the settlements 
negotiated with aboriginal peoples. However, cash alone will not 
provide the kind of certainty and long lasting, enduring settlement 
necessary in this type of negotiation. This type of negotiation will 
benefit all of British Columbia in the end because we will be able to 
put these negotiated settlements to rest once and for all.
<P>
	Negotiated agreements have been based on a range of benefits. 
There is a necessity to provide that range to continue to have an 
enduring and lasting distribution of rights for the native peoples, 
which have to cover harvesting rights, participation in wildlife and 
environmental management.
<P>
	The hon. member said he did not know where there was a legal 
basis for settlement comprehensive land claims. In 1973 the 
supreme court ruling in the Calder case acknowledged the 
existence of aboriginal title in Canadian law. More recently, in the 
Sparrow case the supreme court recognized a constitutionally 
protected aboriginal right to fish for food. The courts have 
emphasized in these cases that the proper way to resolve 
outstanding claims to aboriginal rights and title to land and 
resources must be through negotiated agreements.
<P>
	The hon. member said we should fee simple or its equivalent. 
That is exactly what we are doing. Perhaps the hon. member might 
acquaint himself better with what the treaty negotiation process is 
all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual 
the hon. member opposite has covered a lot of ground.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	She said I said I favoured direct cash compensation and that I did 
not favour negotiated settlements. That is ridiculous. That is not 
what I said at all.
<P>
	I said I was in favour of cash settlements but obviously it will 
have to be negotiated. How can government come to some 
agreement on how much cash to turn over to the natives without 
negotiating it? That is an absolutely ridiculous statement. That is 
not what I was saying. The only reason she said that was she was 
hearing, as is so often the case, exactly what she wanted to hear 
when she was listening to my remarks.
<P>
	That points to the fundamental problem Reformers have in the 
House and outside the House. We try to shed light on subjects that 
are politically sensitive, as so many are, whether outstanding native 
claims or immigration or gay rights, whatever is deemed politically 
incorrect to speak on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17372"> 17372 </A></B>
<P>
	When Reformers and put forward the policies we want to put 
forward, we are attacked. If we spend all our time  trying to defend 
ourselves from the statements we heard this morning once again in 
the House, we will never be able to put forward our own 
alternatives, which is the function of an opposition party, to put 
forward alternatives for the Canadian people.
<P>
	That is the real question here. Will we have an open process? 
Will we have a process that welcomes input from everyone? Will 
we continue to see these types of settlements actually being done 
behind closed doors where there are a very few people included in 
the process: the native leadership, the native industry comprised of 
consultants and engineers and lots of lawyers. Will we broaden that 
to include the people themselves, not only the aboriginal people of 
British Columbia but the non-aboriginal people in the process and 
make them aware of what is happening?
<P>
	Further, the member made a comment about the legal basis of 
these. What I was referring to is I do not see anywhere where there 
is a legal basis for entering into treaties. Yes, we have to have 
settlements. We have to have agreements. I do not see where we 
have to enter into a treaty which confers on one group special 
rights, constitutionally entrenched, not conferred on all Canadians.
<P>
	As long as we have that we will see more divisiveness. We will 
be driving the wedge between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people 
deeper and deeper instead of trying to mend the problems of the 
past that I referred to in my speech and instead of trying to move 
beyond that eventually.
<P>
	We cannot achieve equality overnight. The Reform Party is not 
saying we can wave a magic wand and all of a sudden we are all 
equal. We recognize that some segments of society, the poorest of 
the poor, are starting out a lot lower down and we have to give them 
a hand up. A hand up is not a continual and perpetual handout. The 
people do not want it and we should not want to give it to them 
because it is not the answer.
<P>
	If a handout forever were the answer, certainly spending 
upwards of $9 billion a year on aboriginal programs within the 
confines the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development and outside would have solved the problem by now.
<P>
	We are spending in the neighbourhood of $9,000 million on 
these people. Yes, we all want to see the problem solved, but 
throwing money will not solve the problem or we would have done 
it long ago.
<P>
	It has also been said repeatedly today that a very select few, 
although a growing industry, are profiting from that, this Indian 
industry. When I visit reserves in my riding like Fort Ware, a 
disastrous example of a reserve, I see the assistance that we all so 
desperately want to ensure gets to the poorest of the poor is not 
reaching them. It is not doing the job.
<P>
	No matter how much more we spend every year, it is not doing 
the job. We have to look beyond that. We have to look for new 
answers.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The whole thrust of my speech was that in the end the ultimate 
goal for all Canadians, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, must be 
equality, the equal treatment of all our citizens.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in this debate today. I will address the 
actual decision or policy to negotiate treaties.
<P>
	This government policy is more advanced in British Columbia 
than elsewhere across the country. A growing amount of concern is 
arising in British Columbia as this process takes place. The concern 
is not only in British Columbia but is starting to spread across the 
country. There is input today from grassroots aboriginals. Their 
concern is that this negotiation progress may lead to a situation in 
which there is just a transfer of power to a more local level where 
they still would not have any say as to what is going to happen in 
their lives. On the non-aboriginal side there is a growing concern 
that we do not know what is being negotiated.
<P>
	When we look at the concerns arising we tend to think an 
approach was taken to negotiate versus going to the courts. By 
negotiating it stays within the parliamentary jurisdiction whereas if 
it were taken into the legal field it would be within the court 
jurisdiction. It is still here in the House. This negotiation process is 
seen to be the route to go.
<P>
	When we get a good idea we have to market it for it to catch on 
and be accepted. There was not that communication for this policy 
and this approach to the situation. The concerns are mounting to a 
point that the concerns are being expressed in the provincial 
legislature in British Columbia by the opposition sides.
<P>
	There have been statements that they may not recognize the 
existing agreements. I believe the Nisga'a band is the one most 
advanced and used as the example.
<P>
	I do not wish to debate all the examples occurring within the 
negotiation process. I would like to address my remarks to the 
concerns. They are not only communication concerns from both 
sides of the table and the public. There is also the whole process of 
negotiation. If we put negotiation into a management-labour 
context, the membership knows what is on the table and what is 
being negotiated. The doors may be closed to the negotiation rooms 
when that is actually taking place but we still know the types of 
topics on the table.
<P>
	The municipalities are suggesting they are not represented at the 
table. Another comeback to that is the municipalities are repre-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17373"> 17373 </A></B>
<P>
sented by the provincial  representatives we elect. However, the 
problem is the information from the negotiation is not coming back 
to the people or is not even put to the people beforehand so that we 
know what is on the table, what is being discussed and what the 
possible parameters are for a subsequent decision. That is one 
aspect of the negotiation process that is very faulty.
<P>
	Another problem occurring and giving rise to concern is the 
various definitions. For example, there are a great number of 
Canadians who thought this negotiation process would be 
addressed to existing treaties or the historical treaties. I believe the 
government approach was to negotiate those treaties and come up 
with an extinguishment thereof, then satisfy that commitment 
made in our history and then get on to building life as Canadians in 
unity. What we are hearing now are things like modern treaties, 
living treaties, aboriginal rights, extinguishment. We do not really 
know what these terms mean. This again is causing concern.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	When the Hamilton report came out it tried to address the 
extinguishment and aboriginal rights. One of the things identified 
in the Hamilton report, or before that, is that when the aboriginals 
go in to negotiate a treaty they leave all their rights at the door. 
They go in trying to see what they can get. That is not cricket in 
negotiations. When a negotiation is entered into, one does have 
rights somewhere which should be identified. Even between 
management and labour the previous contract is a starting point.
<P>
	One of the things that is happening is the concept of rights. What 
does that mean? The Hamilton report tries to address it with the 
following point of view. When a treaty is negotiated, the decisions 
reached by all parties become the rights of all parties and the next 
time a treaty is negotiated it commences with those rights. The 
report also suggests we address the extinguishment aspect of this. 
Once the topic has been addressed and agreed on it is extinguished 
and no longer comes up. I believe there is an opening clause. If not, 
there should be an opening clause so that when society changes that 
can come back to the table.
<P>
	There is some sort of finality which could address the 
extinguishment. That tends to give rise to where this modern treaty 
or the living treaty comes into play. I do not believe this concept 
was apparent when the original policy was established. Unless we 
hear more information as to where this kind of thing can lead us, 
that in itself will provide concern.
<P>
	To get back to the process and concern aspect of it, there is 
concern from a parliamentary point of view of actually getting to 
the point. I do not wish to address the contents of the bill on the 
B.C. commission at this point. My point is we had a bill come into 
the House for debate that was actually established by an agreement 
between three parties that had representatives there. The House  
was actually debating something that had already been established.
<P>
	I can understand that the possibility of defeating that bill creates 
a horrendous amount of work. We would have to backtrack to all 
that was done before that. However, because these are our 
representatives, it could possibly have been debated in the House 
before the parties went into agreement and that there were some 
parameters set so that we knew what was going to be on that table 
when the negotiations were undertaken.
<P>
	Another thing that comes out of this when we are talking about 
cultural groups again is the process taking place. This concern 
arises when we hear such things as aboriginals referring to 
themselves as nations. The obvious conclusion to that would be 
nations within a nation. The perception of how that would work is 
unknown. That is a concern to us.
<P>
	We also must look at the unity point of view. We have on the one 
hand a negotiation process that could feasibly terminate in this 
nations within nation concept or be the first step toward that in our 
future. On the other hand we have a parliamentary kind of process 
going on with the Quebec situation, which is again a divisiveness 
kind of thing. I should restrict my remarks to the aboriginal 
process. But are we creating through this process another 
possibility to be debating unity somewhere down the line? I have 
some concerns on that.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	What we have to look at in this whole thing-and British 
Columbia is trying to get the message across to Canadians-is that 
a lack of information is getting out to the people. We do not know 
what is being discussed at the table. We are sitting here wondering 
with what we will be left.
<P>
	The counter argument to that is we do have representatives there. 
My point is that they have not come out and discussed things with 
whoever they are representing and then taken that information back 
to the table.
<P>
	To give my comments more clarity, think of management and 
union negotiations. We know what these people are talking about 
behind closed doors. We know all the parameters of it, but we know 
that their discussions will eventually lead to something. We may 
not get all we want, but we might get part of what we want.
<P>
	I suggest very strongly to the government that it can no longer 
negotiate behind closed doors. It has to be up front. B.C. is in a 
position that it is much further ahead than the rest of the country on 
this negotiation situation. If we are having problems in British 
Columbia, then it is going to transfer all across this country as we 
go along, unless we change some of the things we are doing in the 
process right now. Municipal governments have to be informed of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17374"> 17374 </A></B>
<P>
how their concerns get represented at that  table and there has to be 
a mechanism for that to occur, et cetera.
<P>
	The other item that has to be put out in general terms is what is 
this self-government thing we are talking about. Is it a municipal 
kind of situation? Is it a provincial kind of situation? Will it lead to 
individual territories within our country, or will it lead to the 
possibility of future negotiations in relation to unity? These are 
some of the concerns I have about the whole process.
<P>
	We should be looking at the British Columbia situation, not only 
with what is happening today, but where this will lead us in our 
future, 10, 15, 100 years from now.
<P>
	Is the Hamilton report strictly based on negotiations and setting 
the parameters? I would assume it is not far afield from being 
incorporated into this process as it was commissioned by the 
minister.
<P>
	The modern treaty, the living treaty, has to be identified. There 
has to be some kind of indication to the public, both aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal, that this negotiation process can be speeded up, 
that we are not looking at another 20 or 30 years to negotiate 
individual contracts.
<P>
	There is concern for the situation in British Columbia and it has 
reached the ears of the political components in that province. They 
are also expressing concerns about aspects of this process. I 
sincerely hope and recommend that the government stop and have a 
look at what is actually occurring here and coming up with some 
sort of options, if they choose to follow this policy, in which they 
can address some of these concerns.
<P>
	There is one other point I would like to make before I close. A 
great number of these negotiations are based on the fact that the 
self-government component of the band will be democratic. Yet for 
the band to establish that democratic process and hold elections, 
they really do not have an appeal process to a Canadian election 
officer, other than an appeal to the minister. This should be 
addressed as well and bring them into the Canadian process of 
elections.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
referred to the Quebec referendum process at one point. I recall the 
Reform Party talking about the need to continue government as 
usual. However, in this case we are being asked to hold back a 
process until there is an election in British Columbia. That election 
could be in the far distant future. It has not been called and it does 
not need to be called for some time. This appears to be a 
contradiction in the policy of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The second point which I want to make relates to the comment 
which was made about the negotiations being held in secret. It is 
very clear that any negotiation requires an element of secrecy. It is 
required when we buy a car. We do not let the bottom line be known 
right away. However, in the case of the negotiations about which 
we speak today, the Government of Canada has issued a statement 
indicating how it intends to ensure that the treaty making process 
will be open and accessible and how public records will be 
maintained. In fact, there will be a sharing of information.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member is aware of the statement and what 
her comments would be on the analogy with Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, my comment expresses my 
concern about the situation in relation to unity. There is a unity 
debate going on between one province and Canada. However, there 
is the possibility of future unity debates happening with various 
aboriginal groups if we pursue this course without some 
clarification of what it means.
<P>
	Those persons who are well informed on the process and the 
ultimate resolution may not share the same concerns I do. They 
may not see the aboriginal negotiation process as possibly leading 
us to another unity difficulty in the future. If that is not so, please 
share it with the rest of us in order to allay this concern.
<P>
	My main message is that in Canada we have two different 
processes happening which could lead to similar debates in the 
future.
<P>
	The second question concerned public information. I agree that 
there has been an effort made in the last year with respect to 
providing the public with more information. That stemmed from 
outspoken people expressing their concerns in the proper circles. 
However, a lot of the information, if not all of it, is after the fact. 
We still do not know the conditions we are negotiating. Basically 
what we are seeing are great claims for land. We do not actually 
know what is going to happen.
<P>
	I am suggesting that if we follow our democratic process of 
electing representatives, we do have those representatives there, 
but we have absolutely no idea what they are doing until after it has 
been done. If they looked at the process they certainly could allay a 
lot of the public's concern by being a little more informative of 
what their objectives are.
<P>
	With respect to the delaying of the process, that remark may 
have been related to political strategy concerning the election. Be 
that as it may, what I am addressing here is the fact that the delay 
should be to review what is actually happening because of these 
concerns. A stitch in time might save nine. The problem will not go 
away unless we see a concerted effort by those  persons involved 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17375"> 17375 </A></B>
<P>
and the government to come out with an outline of the objectives 
they are trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
hoping there would be some Reform members in the House to 
witness-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member knows how angry he 
gets when that comment is made from the other side of the House. 
It is not permitted to make reference to the presence or absence of 
other members in the House and I would ask the member not to do 
it again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> My apologies, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I would like to support the comments made by the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development on the importance of 
treaty negotiations. As members of this House are aware, only a 
small minority of First Nations in the province of B.C. have ever 
signed treaties with the crown.
<P>
	On lower Vancouver Island several First Nations signed treaties 
with Governor Douglas in the middle of the 19th century. By the 
end of the century the Peace River district was included in Treaty 
No. 8 signed by the Government of Canada.
<P>
	In the past two decades the Nisga'a Tribal Council has been 
actively negotiating with the federal and provincial governments. 
When these negotiations are completed and an agreement is signed, 
it will be the first treaty with B.C.'s First Nations signed in this 
century.
<P>
	We are approaching the threshold of the next century. British 
Columbians want to approach the 21st century secure in the 
knowledge that the unfinished business of the 19th century has 
been completed.
<P>
	The land claims of British Columbia's First Nations must be 
resolved because resolving these issues creates an environment of 
certainty. Certainty means economic growth and job creation. 
Settling land and resource issues creates an environment for 
investment and increased local economic activity.
<P>
	Over the past few years we have made a great deal of progress 
toward resolving this unfinished business. In 1990 the federal and 
provincial governments and the leaders of the B.C. First Nations 
agreed to establish a task force that would map out a negotiation 
process that would accommodate the many First Nations in B.C. 
that wanted to negotiate settlements.
<P>
	The task force reported on June 28, 1991 with 19 
recommendations. All of them were accepted by the First Nations 
summit, Canada and British Columbia. One of the key 
recommendations was to establish the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission or BCTC as an arm's length keeper of the process. I 
would remind the House that the current leader of the B.C. Reform 
Party was one of the key architects of this process. I congratulate 
him on his vision and wisdom.
<P>
	The agreement committed the principles to establish the BCTC 
through the passage of federal and provincial statutes and the 
resolution of the summit. As my colleagues know, Bill C-107 was 
passed by the House last week and has now been put before in the 
other place.
<P>
	The commissioners began their valuable work on December 15, 
1993 and have made considerable progress. Forty-seven First 
Nations groups are involved in the BCTC process to date. They 
represent over 70 per cent of the First Nations of the province, with 
more likely to become involved in the near future.
<P>
	The BCTC consists of five commissioners, two nominated by 
the First Nations summit, one by the provincial government and 
one by the Government of Canada. The chief commissioner is duly 
selected and appointed by all three of the principals.
<P>
	The First Nations summit includes all First Nations in B.C. that 
have agreed to participate in the BCTC six-stage treaty negotiation 
process. The summit provides a forum for First Nations involved in 
the treaty process to meet and discuss treaty negotiations. It worked 
closely with the federal and provincial governments in the 
development of the treaty negotiation process and in the 
establishment of the BCTC.
<P>
	As one of the principles of the process it continues to provide 
direction along with the governments of Canada and British 
Columbia. The B.C. summit chiefs believe that negotiation rather 
than confrontation and litigation is the best way to solve 
outstanding issues. It is unfortunate that the Reform Party does not 
think the same.
<P>
	I would like to tell the House a bit about the men and women 
who have offered to serve Canada, B.C. and the summit as the 
BCTC commissioners. Carole Corcoran was elected by the First 
Nations summit as one of the first treaty commissioners. She also 
sat on the royal commission on Canada's future in 1990-91 and 
serves on the board of governors at the University of Northern 
British Columbia. Unfortunately Ms. Corcoran has recently 
resigned.
<P>
	On October 4, the First Nations summit chiefs selected Miles 
Richardson of Haida Gwaii to succeed Ms. Corcoran as the second 
First Nation treaty commissioner. Mr. Richardson was a member of 
the B.C. claims task force which reported to the governments of 
Canada, B.C. and First Nations on how the parties could begin 
negotiations to build a new partnership. From 1991 to 1993 Mr. 
Richardson was part of the First Nations summit task group, an 
executive body reporting to the First Nations in B.C. on treaty 
negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The First Nations summit has also elected as one of its 
commissioners Wilf Adam of the Lake Babine Indian Band. Mr. 
Adam is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17376"> 17376 </A></B>
<P>
former chief councillor of the band. He is chairman of the Burns 
Lake Native Development  Corporation and is co-founder of the 
Burns Lake Law Centre.
<P>
	British Columbia has appointed Barbara Fisher, formerly general 
counsel and Vancouver director of the Office of the Ombudsman. 
She currently practices part time as counsel to the B.C Information 
and Privacy Commission.
<P>
	Since last April the Government of Canada's representative to 
the commission has been Peter Lusztig. Dr. Lusztig has been a 
professor of finance at the University of British Columbia and also 
brings considerable breadth of experience from the community. He 
has sat on the B.C. Royal Commission on Automobile Insurance 
and the B.C. Commission of Inquiry on the Tree Fruit Industry. In 
1991 he also chaired the Asia Pacific Initiative Advisory 
Committee struck by the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	Since last May the chief commissioner has been Mr. Alec 
Robertson, QC. The legal community is familiar with his past work 
as president of the B.C. branch of the Canadian Bar Association, 
chairman of the Law Foundation of B.C. and as a member of the 
Gender Equality Task Force of the Canadian Bar Association. Mr. 
Robertson spoke eloquently on Bill C-107 before the standing 
committee.
<P>
	The House will recognize that the BCTC consists of five 
distinguished British Columbians. They are doing excellent work 
to ensure that the comprehensive claims process moves along in a 
timely and orderly manner.
<P>
	The commission oversees the six-stage treaty negotiation 
process which includes: one, statement of intent; two, preparation 
for negotiations; three; negotiation of a framework agreement; 
four, negotiation of an agreement in principle; five, negotiation to 
finalize a treaty; and six, implementation of the treaty.
<P>
	The commission assesses the readiness of the parties to 
negotiate. This involves making sure that the First Nations have the 
resources they require to make their case. It also includes ensuring 
that the federal and provincial governments have established 
regional advisory committees so that the interests of the local 
residents who are not aboriginal can be heard.
<P>
	These regional advisory committees are part of an extensive and 
responsible effort to keep the public and all affected third parties 
informed of the developments in the negotiations as well as to 
ensure the advice of all sectors of B.C. society is considered. Other 
efforts include newsletters, public information meetings, a 1-800 
number, numerous speaking engagements, information brochures 
and other publications, and participation in trade shows. The 
Sechelt negotiations are televised.
<P>
	The commission allocates loan funding to enable First Nations to 
participate in the process. It works with all parties to ensure that 
they get on with the job in a timely manner. If required and if 
agreed to by all parties, the  commission will assist the parties to 
obtain dispute resolution services if the negotiations seem to be 
reaching an impasse.
<P>
	Finally, the commission helps ensure that the process remains 
open and accountable. It prepares and maintains a public record on 
the status of negotiations, and it reports to this House on that status. 
Its annual reports are tabled in this House. In summary, the B.C. 
Treaty Commission facilitates treaty negotiations; it is not a party 
to the negotiations.
<P>
	I am sure that members on both sides of this House would agree 
that settlement of land claims in British Columbia is long overdue. 
British Columbia is home to 17 per cent of Canada's aboriginal 
population, yet treaties have been signed with only a small 
minority of First Nations there. The question of land issues 
surrounding undefined aboriginal rights must be brought to a 
successful conclusion.
<P>
	The federal government is committed to settling land claims in a 
fair and equitable manner for aboriginal people as well as third 
parties and the general public. I urge the House to vote down this 
regressive and spiteful motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member two questions.
<P>
	The member made reference in the beginning of his speech to 
addressing the historical treaties. I agree. We have been 300 or 
whatever number of years at that. I also express some apprehension 
with this concept of the modern, living or new treaties, whatever 
we wish to call them.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member think that the creation of more treaties 
will put us in a similar situation as the existing or the back treaties 
have? Would it take us <I>x</I> amount of time to get these other treaties 
into some state of agreement between all parties?
<P>
	The next question is in relation to the B.C. Treaty Commission. 
We understand that body is preparing parties to negotiate and 
actually does not participate in the negotiation process itself. In the 
preparation of that body's mandate, would it ensure that the people 
who are going to the table have consulted with those whom they 
represent so that they go into the negotiation process with the 
blessings of their membership, or are they going in based on their 
opinions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, the whole treaty process is about 
making sure we give people a hand up and not a hand out. We want 
to end the dependence which has taken place over too many years 
while the treaties have not been solved. The native community has 
not had the opportunity to make a contribution and be 
self-sufficient.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17377"> 17377 </A></B>
<P>
	There have been many questions regarding the legal basis for 
settling comprehensive land claims and what their status is. I can 
say that the 1973 Supreme Court ruling in the Calder case 
acknowledged existence of aboriginal title in Canadian law. More 
recently in the Sparrow case the Supreme Court has recognized 
constitutionality protecting the aboriginal rights to fish for food.
<P>
	Since 1973, as a result of a number of court rulings the 
Government of Canada has as a matter of policy negotiated 
settlements with aboriginal groups that assert aboriginal title and 
where there is some evidence of continuing title. The Constitution 
Act, 1982 affirms and recognizes existing aboriginal treaty rights.
<P>
	We want to end uncertainty associated with unsettled land 
claims. By addressing it we produce certainty. The production of 
that certainty would result in jobs and investment and a healthier 
B.C. economy.
<P>
	Various studies have indicated that $1 billion in investment are 
forgone in the resource industries. Thousands of jobs could be 
made available if the treaty process were to be successfully 
conclude.
<P>
	In terms of whether the people are representing their 
stakeholders, I would say that yes they are. Beyond that I would 
like to draw attention to the 31 members who are part of the treaty 
negotiations advisory committee. They virtually cover the whole 
section of the economic activity in British Columbia: the B.C. 
Shellfish Growers Association, the B.C. Fishing Resorts 
Association, sports fishing institutions, the Steelhead Society of 
B.C., the Union of B.C. Municipalities, the Community Fishing 
Industry Council, Fisheries Council of B.C., the United Fishermen, 
northern fishing representatives, the Interior Forest Industry 
Coalition. There is representation from the unions, the Industrial 
Woodworkers of America, a fine union I was a member of at one 
point. There is the B.C. Real Estate Association, the B.C. 
Federation of Agriculture and the list goes on and on.
<P>
	It would seem to me that at some point we have to have some 
trust in the process. We have to end this injustice which has existed, 
and a costly injustice I might say. All studies have shown that 
economically British Columbia is suffering from the uncertainty. 
We want to establish some certainty on this question and give 
justice to the native people which I believe is long overdue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting to note that three government members 
have addressed our motion so far today. If memory serves me 
correctly, all three of them gave accolades to Mr. Jack Weisgerber, 
the leader of the B.C. Reform Party. I remember the hon. member's 
words: ``I congratulate him for his vision and foresight''. I would 
certainly agree that Mr. Weisgerber is a man with vision and 
foresight.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I would like to read into <I>Hansard</I> the following quote: ``The vast 
majority of British Columbians rejected the backroom deal that 
was Charlottetown. They rejected the constitutional entrenchment 
of an undefined inherent right of self-government and so I. They 
rejected a third order of government for native Canadians 
enshrined under the Constitution and so do I. We also reject the 
government's formal recognition of aboriginal title''. That is from 
a speech given on October 4, 1995 by Mr. Jack Weisgerber, the 
leader of the B.C. Reform Party.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member who is so free with accolades for 
this gentleman, which are richly deserved, would agree with those 
statements and that he truly is a man of vision and foresight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I referred to the decisions he made 
when he was a cabinet minister in the government of the Social 
Credit Party. Clearly, he is a perfect case in point as to how a 
reasonable person of the Social Credit Party can be transformed 
into a Reformer who does not make sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise to speak on the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
North Island-Powell River. I oppose the motion. I consider it to 
be ill-conceived. Why do I take that position?
<P>
	The first reason is that the correct approach to the issue was set 
out by the government in its red book promises. In the red book the 
government made it very clear that if we were elected we would be 
committed to building new partnerships with aboriginal peoples 
based on trust and mutual respect. We stated in the red book what a 
Liberal government would do.
<P>
	We stated that our goal was a Canada where aboriginal people 
would enjoy a standard of living and quality of life and opportunity 
equal to those of other Canadians. It would be a Canada where First 
Nations, Inuit and Metis would live self-reliantly, secure in the 
knowledge of who they are as unique peoples. All Canadians would 
be enriched by aboriginal cultures and would be committed to the 
fair sharing of the potential of our nation. It would be a Canada 
where aboriginal people would have the positive option to live and 
work wherever they chose. Perhaps most important, we set out our 
goal for a Canada where aboriginal children would grow up in 
secure families and in healthy communities with the opportunity to 
take their full place in Canada.
<P>
	As a result, we also said that the resolution of land claims would 
be a priority. This is our vision and we have been moving step by 
step to bring it alive. In two years we have already made 
considerable progress.
<P>
	On August 10 the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development and the federal interlocutor for Metis and non-status 
Indians announced the government's approach to the implementa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17378"> 17378 </A></B>
<P>
tion of the  inherent right of aboriginal self-government. We have 
fostered greater economic development opportunities for 
aboriginal communities through co-management agreements and 
support for business ventures. We have committed an additional 
$20 million annually to the Indian and Inuit post-secondary student 
support program. We have settled some 44 specific claims and we 
have seen five comprehensive claims come into effect. By any 
measure we have achieved a great deal in living up to the 
commitments we made to the people of Canada in the red book 
during the election.
<P>
	Perhaps the most complex challenge to the government and to 
the people of Canada in this area is treaty making in British 
Columbia. I would like to remind the House that British Columbia 
is unique in Canada. If I could remind hon. members of the debate 
which was recently held in the House, it is a distinct society in this 
respect, in that the process of signing treaties has never been 
completed. Only a handful of treaties were signed in the 
pre-Confederation period and they cover parts of Vancouver Island 
only.
<P>
	In 1899 Treaty No. 8 was signed with the First Nations in the 
Peace River area in the northeast of the province. However, in the 
rest of the province the issues of aboriginal rights remain largely 
unresolved. First Nations legitimately want to see a resolution to 
these issues.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	We have repeatedly seen the First Nations of British Columbia 
press for treaty resolution. Until this decade, however, the 
provincial government had been unwilling to negotiate. It took the 
position that there was no need to negotiate because whatever 
rights to land and resources the aboriginal people may have had in 
British Columbia had been extinguished by an act of the crown.
<P>
	The result was decades of legal acrimony. The First Nations first 
sought settlement through the courts of what they had been unable 
to achieve through the negotiation process. In 1973 the Supreme 
Court of Canada was asked whether the aboriginal title to the 
Nisga'a traditional territory had been extinguished in the Calder 
case. In that case the six judges were evenly split on the question. It 
fell on a very narrow technical issue in the way in which the case 
had been brought.
<P>
	It was very clear from reading the judgments in the case that 
there was a recognition by the courts of the country of a legitimate 
claim to aboriginal rights in British Columbia which had to be 
addressed equitably if we were ever to resolve this extraordinarily 
important issue.
<P>
	The courts for their part have expressed repeatedly and in the 
strongest terms that the issues brought before them ought to be 
settled at the negotiating table and not before the bar, settled 
through negotiations and not litigation. Many cases have 
determined this issue. I cite Judge Macfarlane in one who wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Treaty making is the best way to respect Indian rights. The questions of what 
aboriginal rights exist-cannot be decided in this case, and are ripe for 
negotiation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He went on to observe:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the course of these proceedings, it became apparent that there were 
two schools of thought.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first is an all or nothing approach, which says that the Indian Nations 
were here first, that they have exclusive ownership and control of all the land 
and resources and may deal with them as they see fit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The second is a co-existence approach, which says that the Indian interest and 
other interests can co-exist to a large extent, and that consultation and 
reconciliation is the process by which the Indian culture can be preserved and 
by which other Canadians may be assured that their interests, developed over 
125 years of nationhood, can also be respected-I favour the second approach.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I must say I agree. When I was in the private practice of law I 
had the opportunity of being involved in a case that was very 
interesting and very instructive in this area. It was the Baker Lake 
case. It took place in the Northwest Territories. The court also 
resolved and ruled that the applicants in that case had aboriginal 
rights, but the court failed to set out what those aboriginal rights 
were. It failed to set out what the specificity of those rights were.
<P>
	Therefore the aboriginal peoples in the area were left with the 
unpleasant situation of knowing they had a right but not knowing 
whether they could exercise it in contradistinction against mining 
companies that might be in conflict with their claims and exercise 
it in contradistinction against other claims.
<P>
	These issues cannot necessarily be settled by courts of law. The 
courts may lay out a general provision such as saying that there are 
aboriginal rights that have not been extinguished. That is a legal 
issue and an issue a court can rule on.
<P>
	What is the exact content of those rights and how they will be 
applied in a modern complex society where there are conflicts 
between urban and rural uses of land mixed with that of the 
aboriginal peoples? They have to be addressed in the negotiating 
process. That is being sought in the circumstances. That is why I 
agree with what the judge said in the case to which I have referred. 
I am sure members of the House would agree that the co-existence 
approach, based upon consultation and reconciliation, is the 
appropriate approach.
<P>
	I am sorry, I say to my legal fraternity friends, to suggest that 
court is not the place to be on this issue. There are places where we 
do not need lawyers and we certainly do not need judges to resolve 
them. We need the political will to have people sit down and 
resolve their disputes with a mutual trust and understanding among 
them.
<P>
	It pains me to say that in the province of British Columbia today 
quality of trust is absent. I happen to come from Vancouver 
originally. I happen to have the  privilege of going back to 
Vancouver regularly. I have seen the tremendous turbulent summer 
of pain and protest that took place last summer. These 
confrontations will not resolve the issues. It is only through 
negotiation and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17379"> 17379 </A></B>
<P>
mutual respect that we will be able to do that. It will not work 
through an all or nothing approach.
<P>
	We cannot leave the resolution of the issues for those who have 
little respect for the law. That is what worries me about the 
resolution. It astonishes me that a member of the third party would 
bring forward a resolution suggesting that this issue be pushed over 
for a couple of years. Basically that is the suggestion.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	I have listened to the passionate intensity with which members 
of the third party speak in the House about the rights of their 
constituents, about their need to defend their constituents, and 
about how their rights are not being properly regarded by the 
government and by the ways in which the laws of the country 
apply.
<P>
	What would they advocate to their constituents about the 
resolution of their essential rights, how their lives will be 
conducted and how they will be able to earn their living? These 
rights have been in abeyance in some cases for 30, 40 or 50 
frustrating years. Would they go back to their constituents and 
suggest that they just sit still and put this off? I find that difficult to 
believe. I do not believe they would do that. What is sauce for the 
goose is sauce for the gander. We should not be treating the 
aboriginal peoples of the country or of the province of British 
Columbia any differently than we treat other citizens in this 
respect.
<P>
	We have a B.C. Treaty Commission. It establishes a solid 
foundation for consultation and reconciliation. At the heart of its 
operations are the coexistence approach and consultative approach. 
There are those in the House and those in the community who 
would maintain that the process concedes too much to First 
Nations. This too is starting to sow discontent.
<P>
	I have heard radio shows in British Columbia. I have heard 
members say that 100 per cent of the province is covered by claims 
of the aboriginal peoples. However hon. members know better than 
this. We all know that claims are one thing, but to exaggerate them 
as a threat to the existence of the process is irresponsible. Claims 
are one thing. They are put forward but they can be resolved not 
necessarily in a court of law but in a framework of consultation, 
mutual respect and a desire to achieve a result that will be 
beneficial for all parties.
<P>
	If that approach is taken, rather than an in terrorem approach of 
having huge claims, of the whole province being swamped and 
taken away from us, we would move toward a much more 
satisfactory resolution of the issue.
<P>
	We know there are overlapping claims. The commission knows 
that is the case. They can be dealt with. We will not move forward 
by leaving the issue  fester for another two years, until after another 
provincial government election; pushing it off into the future; and 
allowing the distrust, mistrust and exaggerations on both sides to 
prevail.
<P>
	For those reasons I urge the House not to adopt an all or nothing 
approach. We should give to the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission its right to facilitate modern day treaties, to assess the 
readiness of parties to begin the negotiations, to allocate 
negotiation funding to aboriginal peoples, to assist parties to obtain 
dispute resolution services at the request of all parties and to 
monitor the status of negotiations.
<P>
	In that way we could move the issue onward and start the process 
of achieving an equitable, just and lasting resolution of an issue 
that is extraordinarily important not only to the citizens of British 
Columbia but all citizens of the country who wish to see a 
harmonious social climate in which to operate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened quite attentively to my hon. colleague's 
comments about the Reform motion that has been put forward 
today.
<P>
	We really have to describe the reason behind it. Perhaps we have 
not been explicit enough in explaining it. We feel very strongly that 
the British Columbia government at this time lacks credibility and 
does not have the confidence of the B.C. people to continue to 
proclaim it has a mandate to bring about some very comprehensive 
claims agreements and new treaties for British Columbia.
<P>
	I listened to the member say that trust was absent in British 
Columbia. Certainly it is, but we have to ask why it is absent. I 
assert that it is because of the bungling of both provincial and 
federal governments in the past.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Given the claims in the territories which in the opinion of a great 
many Canadians were very generous, is it any wonder there is 
concern among Canadians about the extent of the claims in British 
Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a 
complicated issue. The first part of the issue concerns the 
governance of the country. He is saying that his sense of the 
political process in British Columbia or that of observers is that the 
present government lacks credibility.
<P>
	I do not disagree the present government in British Columbia is 
in political difficulty. We live in a process whereby that 
government was elected for a certain term and has certain 
obligations to serve the people of British Columbia. This is not a 
new policy that has been brought forward. The argument would 
stand better both with the public and with the political process if 
this were some radical departure the present government was 
proposing, if it were something in the extreme. That is not what is 
happening.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17380"> 17380 </A></B>
<P>
	The commission has been put in place to take the venom out 
of the process and to get the negotiations moving along. There 
is no guarantee they will be completed before the government 
changes, but the process must be allowed to continue.
<P>
	To use the present government's unpopularity as a pretext to end 
what has been a long, extended historical process, which for some 
people has been going on for 40 years, would be unfair to the 
aboriginal peoples. It would be disrespectful to the political 
process of the country.
<P>
	Sometimes in parliamentary debate we exchange views about 
one another, but I am sure the hon. member would be very unhappy 
if I were to stand and say that the polls indicated that the Reform 
Party has <I>x</I> per cent and therefore nothing he says in the House is to 
have any credibility. The member was elected. He has a right to 
speak.
<P>
	That government was elected to do a job. It is doing its job. 
There is no sense that it will necessarily complete it but we must 
continue the process. We have a democratically elected process in 
the country that has established a mechanism by which we are 
finally seeing some chance for the resolution of these enormously 
complex, difficult and important social issues.
<P>
	I for one would like to see the process continue and to see a 
peaceful resolution achieved. That is why I find it very difficult to 
accept the basic premise under which the motion has been moved.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago I 
had the pleasure of visiting a dairy farm in Oxford County as the 
guest of Jim Donaldson of Donaldson International Livestock Ltd., 
Lubor Dobrovic of the Slovak State Breeding Institute, and George 
Heyder of the Slovak Holstein Association. Also present was a

	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is a sad 
day in that it marks the 20th anniversary of the invasion of East 
Timor by the Indonesian army. As you know, this invasion resulted 
in one of the worst holocausts since 1945, with the genocide of 
more than one third of the population.
<P>
	Unfortunately, East Timorians are still the victims of one of the 
harshest political repressions known.
<P>
	Year after year, reputable organizations such as Amnesty

On this sad day, which reminds us that too many human beings die

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on December 6 the ``Stop the Great Train Robbery'' bus 
came to Parliament Hill. This bus was covered with thousands of 
signatures protesting gross over subsidization of VIA Rail at a time 
when Canadian are facing crippling government debt.
<P>
	The bus carried supporters of the protest and a petition 
containing almost 10,000 signatures. The Minister of Transport had 
been requested to accept the petition from these concerned citizens 
but did not even bother to respond to the request.
<P>
	I accepted the petition, but because it is not in a form deemed 
presentable in the House for the government I cannot present it 
here. As an alternative I invite the Minister of Transport to accept it 
from me outside the doors of the House immediately after question 
period.
<P>
	I also ask the minister again to take action to stop VIA Rail from 
reducing already heavily subsidized fares so it can take Canadian 
taxpayers' money and use it to compete against customers 
unsubsidized in the private sector.
<P>
	The minister can choose to send out a message of goodwill to 
Canadian taxpayers or he can continue to squander their money. 
Thousands of people who signed this petition are waiting for his 
response.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, for more 
than 20 years successive federal governments have claimed to be 
fighting inflation and the deficit by cutting corporate taxes, raising 
interest rates and cutting programs. What have investors done with 
the interest earned and the taxes saved? They have used their 
surplus funds to bid up existing stocks to the point at which general 
stock values in Canada are reported to be up 35 per cent over last 
year.
<P>
	To continue generating existing levels of profit, their prices for 
goods and services provided will have to be pushed up, as will 
inflation.
<P>
	If the government is serious about fighting inflation and the 
deficit, a tax on transactions can both cool inflationary pressures 
and reduce the deficit. Such a multiple approach to fighting the 
deficit and inflation might actually work, unlike current policy 
fixation with high interest rates, low corporate taxes and deep 
program cuts.
<P>
	Surely after 20 years of failure to meet even one deficit target it 
is time to try some things that might actually work.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the big 
banks would like to sell insurance directly to their customers.
<P>
	Many Canadians are worried about concentrating economic 
power in the hands of a few large banks, putting the safety of the 
financial system at risk.
<P>
	In changing the Bank Act, the government should be careful not 
to reduce competition. Consumers would suffer from reduced 
choice in the financial industry. Banks selling insurance would 
have an unfair advantage over insurance companies. Insurance 
companies are not entitled to have the same government guarantees 
the banks have, including Canada deposit insurance. Banks will 
also have an unfair advantage if they are allowed to use 
confidential client information to help sell insurance.
<P>
	Any changes to the Bank Act must be fair to the insurance 
companies and must protect the consumer. Banks should stick to 
their mandate and start lending money to small businesses, the 
engine of the country's economy.
<P>
	Rather than letting the banks expand into insurance, we should 
tax their record profits and force them to lend more money to small 
businesses.

	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week in my riding of Scarborough-Rouge River we 
are completing the last of the work on the Malvern Remedial 
Project.
<P>
	This is an initiative to restore a residential area where soil had 
been contaminated by low level radioactive material dumped 
during the second world war. Although the problem was discovered 
in 1980, it has taken 15 years for all levels of government and the 
community to achieve their goal of removing the contaminants and 
restoring this neighbourhood of family homes.
<P>
	We want to recognize and thank the Minister of Natural 
Resources and the leadership of her officials, the province of 
Ontario for sharing the cost and purchasing the real estate required, 
AECL for its expertise, the city of Scarborough, the local advisory 
committee chaired by Mr. John Brickenden, elected representatives 
at the municipal, regional and provincial assemblies and, last but 
not least, the Ontario and Canadian taxpayers who underwrote the 
costs.
<P>
	The Malvern/McLure neighbourhood says thank you for this 
successful initiative. We hope the Malvern Remedial Project can be 
a successful example of community and government working 
together to correct environmental mistakes of the past.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
Quebecers from all political affiliations were stunned to hear the 
Prime Minister, a Quebecer himself, say that there is no such thing 
as a Quebec culture. Rather, there is a French and an English 
culture which he calls the Canadian culture.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's simplistic vision, which denies the very 
basis of his motion recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, shows 
that his roots in the Quebec society and culture do not run very 
deep. Given the comments made by her leader, it is surprising to 
see that the current labour minister, a former cultural affairs 
minister in the Liberal government of Robert Bourassa, has nothing 
to say on the matter.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have no problem agreeing that Quebec and Quebecers 
are or constitute a distinct society. My problem is with entrenching 
it in the Constitution. That for me and for many Canadians creates a 
problem. Why should Parliament resurrect an idea that Canadians 
voted down in the Meech and Charlottetown accords?
<P>
	I believe in the equality of all Canadians, that each province, 
each region and the aboriginal peoples are all distinctive in their 
own way. But the question of what it means to be distinct has no 
concrete answer at this time.
<P>
	Some say it does not mean anything but simply recognizes an 
historical fact. Some say it means the courts when they are looking 
at Quebec's laws will interpret them in light of the distinctiveness 
of Quebec. Therefore it is an interpretative part of the Constitution.
<P>
	This would be something no other province would have. If we 
believe in equality, then we do not believe in special powers.
<P>
	Please, let us not go through this again. Let us get on with 
rebuilding Confederation with new ideas. Let us look at what the

	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently we 
have had some strange echoes from the past in regard to maritime 
union. Let us hear what the past of maritime union has been.
<P>
	In his thesis on maritime union, John M. Wilkinson posed the 
question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Was there ever in any one, or all three, of the maritime provinces any general 
or popular movement in favour of their union, as distinct from those 
inaugurated by official classes, such as politicians or those actuated by profit?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The answer is that, unless the situation has changed, popular support for 
maritime union has been virtually non-existent. Even the legislators who in the 
1860s agreed to a conference to consider such a union did it without enthusiasm 
and certainly not in response to the express wishes of their constituents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Because of its lack of interest in maritime union, Prince Edward 
Island has been called the reluctant province. History indicates, 
however, that it has been different only in degree. It has been 
somewhat more reluctant than reluctant Nova Scotia and reluctant 
New Brunswick.
<P>
	Let me assure the House this situation has not changed. A recent 
poll on Prince Edward Island put opposition to maritime union at 
70 per cent-

nothing has been tabled so far, and federal cutbacks are to take

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was appalled the other day to read in <I>Le journal de Montréal</I><B> </B>how 
Pierre Bourgault, a staunch separatist and confidant of Mr. 
Parizeau, branded a group of Canadians as racists.
<P>
	It seems after a Canadian victory on October 30 the separatist 
had to blame somebody. Therefore Mr. Bourgault stated: ``The 
Jews, Italians and Greeks are racists''. Mr. Bourgault further states: 
``We are not asking them to be sovereignists, we are asking them to 
be Quebecers''. They are proud Quebecers and they are also proud 
Canadians.
<P>
	The separatists have now been completely unmasked and their 
hidden agenda is secret no longer.

the Bloc member and all other immigrants, myself included, 
arrived on these friendly shores, who welcomed us? It was Canada. 
Who gave us citizenship? It was Canada. It was Canada that gave 
us the opportunity to share in the Canadian dream.
<P>
	The vote on October 30 was not an ethnic vote. It was a Canadian 
vote, a vote for unity, a vote for home, a vote for Canada.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEFUND">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In his economic update yesterday, before the finance committee, 
the minister finally admitted that his government is putting the 
unemployment insurance fund surplus into the consolidated 
revenue fund, along with the other federal revenues and 
expenditures, and will continue to do so, rather than in a distinct 
reserve fund as the Minister of Labour claims. This admission 
leads to another, that his deficit for the current year is being 
lowered artificially with the U.I. account surplus.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, will the Minister of Finance admit 
that, because he is taking five billion dollars out of the U.I. account 
this year, the real federal deficit for the current year is therefore not 
$32.7 billion but $37.7 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
ought not to confuse annual surpluses and cumulative surpluses.
<P>
	To give an example, in 1993 when we became the government, 
the cumulative deficit of the unemployment insurance fund was $6 
billion. In 1994, there was an annual surplus of $2.3 billion, which 
brought the cumulative deficit to $3.6 billion. In 1995, the annual 
surplus was approximately five billion dollars. This is the five 
billion the hon. member is referring to.
<P>
	It will bring the cumulative surplus to only $1.4 billion. The two 
things must not be confused. We now have a surplus, not of $5 
billion, but of $1.4 billion.
<P>
	Our goal was not to reduce the deficit but to bolster the U.I. fund, 
which we have done, being good managers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a good 
manager knows the contents of his budget.
<P>
	Although I respect the minister, he is entitled to his 
shortcomings as much as anyone. He has certainly forgotten that 
next year he himself has projected taking $5 billion from the U.I. 
fund during the year. He is entitled to a mistake, so we will give 
him another chance.
<P>
	Will this minister, good manager that he is, admit that to bring 
his deficit, the federal deficit, down to $17 billion in 1997-98, as he 
has indicated to us, he will need to keep on dipping into the U.I. 
fund year after year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have great respect 
for the hon. member for Roberval. I clearly understand where the 
confusion lies. What he is really recommending is an accounting 
process which was in place prior to 1986.
<P>
	I would simply like to state that prior to 1986 the government did 
follow the procedure recommended by the hon. member and by the 
Bloc finance critic. But the auditor general came out with the 
following opinion in 1986. ``In my opinion''-I am quoting the 
auditor general here-``the unemployment fund operations ought 
to be consolidated with the government financial statements, with 
employer and employee contributions added on the reported 
receipts side, and benefits and administrative costs included with 
reported expenditures''.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Since this had not been done in 1986, the auditor general 
expressed reservations on the government's financial statements. 
That year, the government changed to the accounting process we 
are currently using. I would therefore suggest to the hon. member, 
if he does not like the way the government is accounting, and if he 
thinks he is better at figures than the auditor general-and perhaps 
he is-that he talk to the auditor general.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Two strikes against him 
now, Mr. Speaker. The Minister of Finance has neglected to point 
out that, at the time the auditor general made that recommendation, 
the federal government was contributing to the unemployment 
insurance fund. That is no longer the case. Two strikes, no hits.
<P>
	I will give him a third chance. Given the government's reticence 
to really streamline the federal machine and review all of its 
finances, will the Minister of Finance acknowledge that, if he does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17385"> 17385 </A></B>
<P>
not divert the sizeable U.I.  fund surpluses into his budget, he will 
be totally incapable of reaching his budget targets in coming years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member is 
capable of convincing the auditor general that we ought to change 
the accounting method because contributions now come only from 
employers and employees, we are prepared to examine the 
situation.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's questions but he is constantly 
quoting the auditor general as if he were quoting the Deity. 
Sometimes we have to accept that God does things that are not to 
our liking. Only the Pope is infallible.
<P>
	Instead of making forecasts, let me point out what we have done 
to date. The government's operating balance has risen from a $4 
billion deficit in 1993-94 to a $17.6 billion surplus this year, a 
$21.6 billion improvement. Within that amount, there was a $6 
billion improvement in the U.I. fund deficit. This means that, 
looking at the cuts, the reorganization of public finances, less than 
30 per cent has come from the unemployment insurance fund, and 
70 per cent from government activities, cuts and other steps.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="OLDAGEPENSIONS">OLD AGE PENSIONS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would first off remind the Minister of Finance that the 
Canadian Institute of Actuaries and almost all employer 
organizations, including the Conseil du patronat du Québec, are 
today calling for a separate account for unemployment insurance, 
separate from the government's revenue and expenditure budget. 
He seems to have forgotten it at the moment. He is talking about 
1988; he should be looking at 1995.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has made the unemployed carry a major 
portion of his cuts to program expenditures and he is now saying 
that, to reach his new deficit reduction targets by 1997-98, he has to 
make additional cuts of several billion dollars.
<P>
	With the Minister of Finance clearly indicating yesterday his 
intention to go after old age pensions, are we to understand that, as 
of next year, the brunt of the additional cuts will fall on current and 
future recipients of old age pensions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, there is a 
separate account for unemployment insurance, now employment 
insurance. So there already is one. However, even with the separate 
account, the auditor general is insisting it be included with our 
figures.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Second, unemployment insurance premiums have been reduced 
by a billion and a quarter dollars, as announced by the Minister of 
Human Resources. This is a huge reduction, which will contribute 
to job creation.
<P>
	Third, as regards the old age pensions, I said the exact opposite 
to what the member is saying. I said that the statements the Prime 
Minister has already made regarding old age pensions will 
certainly be foremost in our minds when we draw up the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we put the question to the Minister of Finance and he says 
that the unemployment insurance surplus is part of the consolidated 
fund; the next day he says it is not. We do not know which way is 
up.
<P>
	I will put the question to him another way. We are giving him his 
fourth and fifth chances today. Since his government has just 
grabbed the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund and 
dramatically limited access to it, will the Minister of Finance 
acknowledge that he is preparing to do the same thing to the old age 
pensions, that is, in addition to cutting them, he will make benefits 
harder to obtain?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is possible to have 
a separate account and still have consolidated funds.
<P>
	I understand the member's problem. He is an economist, and 
economists have a hard time understanding accounting. Perhaps 
the member for Roberval will explain it to him.
<P>
	Furthermore, we were very clear on the pension funds. Our aim 
is to leave seniors untouched and to protect the system so it will be 
there for young people.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, innumerable ordinary Canadians, business leaders, think 
tanks, economists and the IMF insist that setting interim targets for 
the deficit is not enough. They have urged the Minister of Finance 
to set targets for the complete elimination of the deficit within this 
government's mandate. I am baffled that the finance minister 
blinked and missed the easy opportunity to do so.
<P>
	Only relatively small additional cuts are needed to satisfy these 
Canadians. The interim targets he chose increase the uncertainty 
about the government's resolve and prevent getting into the virtual 
cycle of more growth, even faster deficit elimination and lower 
interest rates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17386"> 17386 </A></B>
<P>
	Why has the minister chosen to subject Canadians to essential 
surgery but not enough to get rid of the malignant tumour?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the best way 
to answer the hon. member's question is to cite an economist of 
great reputation whom I am sure the hon. member knows, Carl 
Weinberg from High Frequency Economics.
<P>
	In referring both to the IMF and to the kind of measures 
recommended by the hon. member, he says that the hon. member's 
advice is geared toward a country that cannot meet its bills or 
obligations, that is facing all kinds of international actions to try to 
withdraw money from it. He then goes on to say, showing far 
greater confidence than the members of the Reform Party, that 
Canada ``is not in that case and therefore should not be subject to 
those kinds of measures. I think those measures would succeed in 
bringing the deficit down but with catastrophic economic 
consequences. I do not think it is warranted to take that kind of 
extreme action''. That is his opinion, that is our opinion, and it is an 
intelligent opinion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the many economists and business leaders who 
testified in front of the finance committee will know they are stupid 
and do not know what they are talking about.
<P>
	I am somewhat surprised that the minister did not bring up this 
strawman comment that to do more would mean slash and burn. I 
am shocked that on other occasions the minister has attempted to 
portray all deficit cutting as slash and burn.
<P>
	We know of the minister's love for hyperbole and the risk it 
brings, but the minister knows he is knocking a strawman. The 
IMF, his own advisers and Reform have offered plans that would 
eliminate the deficit by cutting fat and unaffordable transfer 
programs. Frank McKenna, Clyde Wells and other Liberal friends 
of his have shown how to do it.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Why does the minister not follow the consensus advice and 
examples available to him and make the cuts needed to preserve 
Canada's social safety net and enable Canadians to get back to 
work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that Clyde 
Wells and Frank McKenna would be delighted to be cited by the 
hon. member. I now look forward to the finance ministers' meeting 
next week.
<P>
	The measures that we have taken are going to allow us to protect 
Canada's social fabric. If one looks at the  budget that was brought 
in by the Reform Party, there is no doubt about how quickly it 
would get the deficit eliminated.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> The members of the Reform 
Party applaud, but let us look at what they are applauding. They are 
applauding the evisceration of the health care system. They are 
applauding the evisceration of old age pensions. They are 
applauding the evisceration of the program to help small business 
into exports.
<P>
	What the Reform Party members are applauding are the basic 
programs that are going to enable this country to go into the next 
century far healthier than any other country in the G-7.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people who came to the finance committee 
complained about the terrible consequences of the $4 billion cuts 
that took place last year.
<P>
	What the minister does not want to admit is that because he cut 
so little all those cuts were for naught. All $4 billion was eaten up 
by increased interest costs. That is the issue.
<P>
	Furthermore, the finance minister's logic needs some help. The 
first premise he presented yesterday: deficit reduction leads to 
lower interest rates, more jobs, economic growth and tax cuts. 
Premise two, which is implicit in the free-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, let him go. That was a good 
question.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask hon. members, both those putting 
questions and those giving answers, if they could condense them. I 
would invite the member to please put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, but as a lead off questioner I 
thought I would get just a tiny bit more.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Even the same as the Bloc would be helpful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, if lower interest rates create jobs and 
lower deficits create jobs, why does the minister not follow his own 
logic and go all the way and eliminate the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that 
lower deficits lead to lower interest rates and to more jobs, but it is 
simply a function of balance. If we go too far, we are going to cause 
a great deal more long term damage.
<P>
	I thought it was expressed really quite well yesterday. The leader 
of the Reform Party, the member will remember, made an analogy 
to a fiscal drunk running  down the highway. That is probably not a 
bad analogy to the differences between our two parties. What we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17387"> 17387 </A></B>

are going to do is sober that drunk up. What the Reform Party does 
is run him over.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister explained that there was no 
Quebec culture, but rather an English-Canadian and a 
French-Canadian culture. Last week, however, the Prime Minister 
tabled in this House a motion saying that one of the characteristics 
of Quebec's distinct society is its unique culture.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister reconcile the comments he made 
yesterday with his distinct society motion, when there is an obvious 
contradiction?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I never said yesterday that there was no Quebec culture. I 
said that Quebec culture is not necessarily limited to French, and 
that French culture also exists outside Quebec.
<P>
	We believe so strongly in a Quebec culture that not only do we 
talk about it but we also tabled in the House a motion recognizing 
it. The hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata is voting against 
our distinct society proposal stating that Quebec is a distinct 
society by virtue of its French language, unique culture and civil 
code. This is a motion I tabled in this House to recognize Quebec 
culture, and Bloc members are voting against it.
<P>
	I also explained that French culture is celebrated in all of 
Canada, and I named a number of prominent Canadians of whom 
francophones in both Quebec and Canada can be proud. I talked 
about Antonine Maillet, Gabrielle Roy, Roch Voisine, Henri 
Bergeron, and many others who speak French and have a French 
culture, even though not all of them are from Quebec. That is what 
the hon. member does not understand.
<P>
	If she wants to recognize Quebec's unique culture, all she has to 
do is to support the motion that will be voted on next Monday in 
this House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, frankly, it sounds like there is a Quebec culture on some 
days but not on others. I would like to know if Quebec culture 
exists on odd- or even-numbered days. We are stumbling about in 
the dark.
<P>
	Does the obvious contradiction between the Prime Minister's 
comments and his motion not confirm that his motion is in fact a 
meaningless, empty shell that will not fool Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian House of Commons is voting in favour of a 
motion clearly stating that Quebec is a distinct society by virtue of 
its French language, culture and civil code. It is the best way of 
putting it. And yet Bloc members are set to vote against 
it-because they will rise one by one in this House to vote and be 
recorded as saying that they do not want to support recognition of 
Quebec as a distinct society. They should be ashamed of 
themselves.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously the Minister of Finance does not understand. The whole 
point of this exercise of eliminating the deficit and the debt is to 
lead the way toward social programs that we can sustain over the 
long run and also give people tax relief. That may be hard to 
understand if you do not pay taxes in this country, but that is what 
we are aiming for.
<P>
	Why does the minister insist on prolonging the suffering of 
Canadians and denying them hope? Why does he do that with this 
narrow, inch at a time deficit elimination policy? Why does he 
refuse to completely eliminate the deficit and reduce taxes? Why 
does he not do his job?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, because I have seen 
the alternative.
<P>
	I would ask the members of the Reform Party to take a look at 
the consequences of their own budget. It is impossible for the 
Reformers to say that what they want to do is protect old age 
pensions by reducing the deficit, when their means of getting there 
are to virtually eliminate the basic foundation for old pensions.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	It is impossible for the Reform Party to say that it wants to 
protect health care when it would erase the transfers that go to 
protect health care. It is impossible for the Reform Party to say that 
it wants to reduce taxes when it would pursue an industrial policy 
that would make it impossible for the country to create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
absolute rubbish. The fact is interest payments on the debt are 
undercutting social programs, which is exactly why the 
government is cutting unemployment insurance and making all 
kinds of other adjustments.

it right from the beginning.

	When can Canadians expect to get some tax relief? The minister 
is saying, trust me. It will be sometime in the next millennium, 
over the hill and beyond the horizon. When exactly are we going to 
get some tax relief in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the most important 
kind of relief that this country should look to is a reduction in 
interest rates.
<P>
	The member knows that if we were to proceed to a tax decrease 
right now that the net result would have an immediate impact on 
the budget. It would not lead to lower interest rates and might well 
lead to higher interest rates. In fact that is what is happening. That 
is what all the commentary is about now in those countries in 
Europe that are contemplating a tax decrease.
<P>
	We are dealing in a very measured and deliberate way with a 
huge debt and a huge deficit which this government inherited. It 
inherited it from a previous government, the government that most 
of those people, the crypto-Tories over there, probably voted for 10 
years ago.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. For the past two weeks, the 
Liberal members of the heritage committee have objected to the 
fact that two federal cultural agencies, namely the Canada Council 
and Telefilm Canada, subsidize artists or productions with a bias 
towards the sovereignist cause.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister skirted the issue yesterday, I am 
putting the question to him again today. Does he endorse the 
position taken by government members sitting on the heritage 
committee, who maintain that granting agencies should now fund 
artists according to their political opinions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our policy on the subject is clear. The Canada Council is 
an independent agency that grants subsidies based on its own set of 
criteria. The fact of the matter is that the Quebec artistic 
community has always greatly benefited from the Canada Council, 
and everyone in the Quebec arts community is very pleased with 
the objectivity displayed by the Canada Council.
<P>
	Members may not always be happy with the way a subsidy is 
granted or used. Freedom of expression is a privilege enjoyed by 
every Canadian.
<P>
	It is like when the Canada Council buys paintings for the 
National Gallery; some like it, others do not. But they are at liberty 
to do so, and I think that nowhere in the world is the arts 
community afforded as much independence as in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister not agree that there is cause for concern when the 
head of the government seeks not only to control the information 
provided by a government agency but also to provide political 
guidance on the content of cultural productions subsidized by the 
Canada Council and by Telefilm Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not see how the hon. member can say something like 
that, because the law has not changed. The Canada Council is the 
same as it has always been, and our members are doing a very 
professional job.
<P>
	I maintain that members are free to complain when they are 
unhappy about something, and they have indeed aired their 
complaints on many issues. That is what freedom of speech is all 
about. Members who have objections to raise should raise them. 
That is what they were elected to do. On the other hand, while it has 
to take their objections into account, the Canada Council is free to 
act as it sees fit.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
through access to information I received an audit from April 1994 
that revealed the practice of hiring family members at Natural 
Resources Canada.
<P>
	In one forestry office alone, the auditors counted 115 people in 
one year who got their jobs from relatives on the inside of the 
department. That was last year. This year a new audit says that 
there is still a major problem that the minister has yet to address.
<P>
	Will the minister initiate a department-wide audit of contracting 
in her department to uncover the real extent of the family compact 
at NRCan, or will she at least get a family member to look into it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me first point out to the hon. member that the audit 
to which he refers is an audit of contracting practices that took 
place during fiscal year 1992-93, before this government came to 
power.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17389"> 17389 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me indicate further that it was this government that 
undertook an audit in relation to contracting and management 
practices in the Department of Natural Resources. We determined 
that those problems existed. We have taken corrective measures 
in relation to them.
<P>
	An audit done in June 1995 indicates that we have corrected the 
mistakes of the past. We have put in place management practices 
and courses in relation to conflict of interest. I might say to the hon. 
member that to the satisfaction of the auditors involved we have 
been successful in dealing with the practices that were identified as 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to think that most of the relatives were already hired, 
but this year's audit also says that bypassing merit to hire family 
members has become an accepted way of doing business in the 
department.
<P>
	It is not acceptable, which is why I asked for the list of contracts 
the department had investigated so that we could have a look to see 
how deep this mess was within the department.
<P>
	Incredibly we find the department did not keep such a list or now 
it cannot find it. Will the minister undertake to find this list of 
contracts and table it in the House so we can see whether the 
problem of nepotism extends to her department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that corrective action 
has been taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Prove it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> I am quite happy to prove it to the hon. member. 
I have a list of measures we have taken in my department to correct 
the situation. I will be happy to share it with the hon. member.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the study commissioned by the CBC on the coverage of 
the referendum campaign reveals that the French network gave 
essentially the same coverage to the yes and the no sides, whereas 
the English network gave almost two thirds of its time to the no 
side. Yet, the study concludes that both the French and English 
networks were neutral in their coverage.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Canadian Heritage agree with the 
conclusion that CBC's English network was neutral in its coverage 
of the referendum campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I do not draw conclusions on studies I have not yet 
seen. The CBC's board of directors asked for some reports. I am 
told that these reports were  submitted to the board. I still have not 
received them. I will comment after seeing them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister does not want to make a pronouncement. 
However, given that today's newspapers mention that the French 
network gave 52 per cent of its time coverage to the yes side and 48 
per cent to the no side, while the English network gave 62 per cent 
of its time coverage to the no side and 38 per cent to the yes side, 
could the minister make some enlightening comments on these 
figures?
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I know that the CBC's board of directors intends to 
follow up on the report. Again, I am reluctant to comment on 
figures taken from a newspaper article. I want to get much more 
information on the CBC's coverage and on the exact nature of the 
report.

	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
greater Toronto area is home to 4.5 million people. The area has 
been disproportionately impacted by the recession and continues to 
lag in the recovery, with negative repercussions for the entire 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	The Government of Canada spends millions and millions of 
dollars in the GTA often in ways people do not see directly. My 
question is for the Minister responsible for the infrastructure 
program. Will he tell the House how that one program is 
contributing to economic recovery in the greater Toronto area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in answering the question I am pleased to note in the gallery 
opposite a holder of an office that I had the pleasure of holding at 
one time. I am pleased to note and welcome the mayor of Toronto, 
Her Worship Barbara Hall, to the House.
<P>
	In the greater Toronto area we have approved over 300 
infrastructure projects involving an infusion of some $850 million, 
which has created in excess of 11,000 jobs in that area. With the 
co-operation of Mayor Hall and the Toronto City Council many of 
these projects have been in the downtown Toronto area.
<P>
	All these projects, just like all projects across the country, have 
helped to put Canadians back to work, have helped to strengthen 
the infrastructure in our communities and to bring in additional 
investment dollars. They have all been done in a co-operative way, 
which proves that the federal, provincial and local governments 
can work together for the improvement of the quality of life of 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

appointments to the board of directors of the Museum of 
Civilization.
<P>
	Is he aware that one of the appointments is a senior partner of the 
lawyer who was responsible for the election campaign of the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs? Yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, appointments are made as a result of a very careful 
scrutiny of the ability of people to exercise office. This is what was 
done in that case, as with any other appointments in my portfolio.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I may 
have missed the answer. I was looking for a yes or no. The point is 
the scrutiny seems to include Liberal credentials because the 
Liberals continue the old-fashioned discredited practice of feeding 
their friends lucrative government posts. In so doing they denigrate 
our public institutions.
<P>
	Let me remind the minister that the appearance of conflict of 
interest is against the current code of conduct of public office 
holders. My question is simple. Did he know this appointment was 
against the conflict of interest code?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, these appointments are scrutinized from that 
viewpoint as well.
<P>
	As to the notion that Liberals have no capability to fill any 
office, the member should remember that the president of the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is Perrin Beatty who did not sit

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	At a meeting of the of the Société de développement du 
Saint-Laurent on November 23, the commissioner of the Coast 
Guard refused to rule out the possibility that the cost of icebreaking 
would be charged directly to the users of the St. Lawrence, which 
would mean that Quebec shipowners would have to bear nearly half 
of all the new costs charged to shipowners for Coast Guard 
services.
<P>
	How does the minister explain his government's contemplating 
making Quebec shipowners pay the cost of icebreaking on the St. 
Lawrence, when this service is free in the North?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know that the hon. member follows the activities of the 
Coast Guard very closely and he is no doubt aware that it now 
comes under the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	However, I wish to assure my hon. colleague that the costs that 
will be recovered in all transport sectors are not going to be limited 
to those who own ships in the St. Lawrence. Most of the ships 
plying the St. Lawrence do not belong to Quebecers, nor to 
Canadians, for that matter.
<P>
	That said, we will be ensuring that, in all sectors, costs incurred 
will be recovered from users.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister is forcing me to point out that the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was not present in the House, and 
that is why I asked him-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, does the minister, being 
responsible for marine transportation, realize that, by charging 
shipowners using the St. Lawrence the cost of icebreaking, he is 
threatening the competitiveness of the St. Lawrence ports, and 
particularly the port of Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the hon. member asked his question, he said clearly 
that the person in question, the one who made the statement, did 
not want to rule out the possibility that all costs would be recovered 
for icebreaking operations in the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	In the coming days, we will announce the future policy and 
strategy for the entire marine sector. At that point, we will certainly 
have an opportunity to properly discuss a question of potential 
concern to everyone. User costs will be discussed and debated.
<P>
	I would reassure the hon. member and the people directly 
affected that no final decision has been made on this yet.

new policies are being put in place with respect to access to 
telephones by prisoners in federal institutions. Work is ongoing 
with respect to mailing privileges as well.
<P>

institution?
<P>

sympathy, but I am pleased to hear at least a partial answer from 
the solicitor general.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice. Presently there 
is no effective enforcement for people who misuse our waterways 
and endanger the lives of other Canadians. The Contraventions Act, 
passed in 1992, would fix this situation but has never been 
proclaimed into law.
<P>
	Will the minister tell the House how he intends to ensure boating 
regulations are enforced and Canadian lives are protected on our 
lakes and rivers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no member of the  House has 
worked harder in the cause of facilitating the enforcement of safety 
rules on the waterways than the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka. I thank him for his help in that regard.
<P>
	It was through the work of the hon. member that I met with the 
executive of the Muskoka Lakes Association which brought home 
to me the urgency of dealing effectively with this matter. As a 
result, officials in the federal Department of Justice have worked 
with provincial counterparts to put the provincial schemes and 
mechanisms for ticketing of offences at the disposal of the federal 
government through the federal Contraventions Act.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	I am pleased to say that next week I intend to introduce 
legislation which will amend the Contraventions Act federally to 
enable us to use the provincial mechanisms. This not only allows us 
to keep the waterways safer and have effective enforcement but it 
also avoids duplication, overlap and needless expense. It serves to 
that extent the interests of the people of Canada.

moving to the province, many of them paid for by their own

<P>
	Recognizing that labour mobility is a national issue, would the

possibility of providing labour mobility grants to the province of 
British Columbia to offset some of the costs of 92,000 Canadians 
moving into the province each year?

<P>
	In the past when profits were made, more jobs were created. In 
light of record corporate profits in some sectors, the banks 
especially, can the minister explain why there are also a record 
number of layoffs? Does the minister have any plan to encourage 
reinvestment of these profits to create new jobs for Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member raises a 
question that is really one of the most difficult of the modern 
economy which is that because of globalization and because of new 
technologies a lot of companies are seen maintaining or increasing 
their profits, not as a result of increasing sales but because they are 
cutting costs. They are letting people go. Of course this sets in 
motion a vicious train of events where one company lays off and 
then others have to.
<P>
	As a result of this, the government has embarked upon a series of 
fundamental reforms in its job creation activities. The 
unemployment insurance reform announced last week deals 
directly with that question as do a number of the measures in terms 
of the information highway by the Minister of Industry and of 
course the very important activities of my colleague, the Minister 
for International Trade.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, it should 
come as no surprise today that the Bloc Quebecois has decided to 
vote against the motion presented by the Reform Party, a motion 
that of course aims to prevent and obstruct current negotiations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17393"> 17393 </A></B>
<P>
	It is clear, in our opinion, that a variety of concepts are implicit 
in this kind of motion. It is clear that trilateral negotiations 
between the federal and provincial governments and the First 
Nations must be redefined. The First Nations have consistently 
said that the status quo is unacceptable. They are not alone in that 
respect. I think that as far as Quebec is concerned, the results of 
the last referendum indicated that the status quo was unacceptable 
and that the only option is sovereignty and greater autonomy. 
Sovereignty will give us that greater autonomy, and we see the 
same need for autonomy among the First Nations.
<P>
	The Reform Party's motion also implies a desire to block 
negotiations for strictly political reasons which I will be glad to 
enumerate later on. But how could anyone consider putting a stop 
to a peaceful and equitable process that will redress the injustice 
perpetrated 150 years ago? We are about to begin a negotiating 
process, and out of the blue, for purely political reasons, the 
Reform Party introduces a motion to block negotiations that are 
peaceful and will correct past injustice.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable to us, and as I said before, it should 
come as no surprise that the Bloc Quebecois intends to vote against 
this motion. We should remember that cases involving aboriginal 
peoples and aboriginal rights are probably the oldest human rights 
issues in Canada. These issues remain unresolved, and this is a 
chapter of Canada's history that has been left unfinished. Attempts 
are being made to remedy this elsewhere. Attempts are being made 
across Canada, and in British Columbia the circumstances seem to 
have been ideal for bringing these negotiations to fruition.
<P>
	Now we have a proposal that would simply terminate these 
attempts. The debate on aboriginal rights started only twenty or 
thirty years ago and has been pursued openly and with great zeal in 
the political and public arena. Unfortunately, this proposal would 
simply extinguish those rights, blocking the whole process that led 
up to the current situation where we have all parties in a position 
negotiate on the same level. This is a proposal we cannot accept.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	I want to read the motion, because we feel that the Reform Party 
is not the only one to blame here. I think the motion reveals the true 
colours not only of the Reform Party, but also of the Liberal Party. 
The motions reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to not enter into any binding trilateral 
aboriginal treaty or land claim agreements in B.C. in the last year of the current 
provincial government mandate in order to respect the views of British 
Columbians on this issue as expressed by both major provincial opposition 
parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I talked with some of my colleagues from British Columbia and I 
learned that one of the two major opposition parties in B.C. is the 
Reform Party. Of course,  my colleagues hastened to tell me that 
the national Reform Party does not recognize any provincial 
subsidiaries. However, I find it strange that the Reform Party would 
put forward a motion supported by an opposition party in B.C. 
which happens to have the same name as it does.
<P>
	We now see the true colours of the Reform Party. But we also see 
the true colours of the Liberals. I heard my colleagues talk about 
their opposition to this motion. When we listen to the members of 
the Liberal government and when we look at the measures they 
take, we can see the true nature of these people. We can tell by their 
attitude towards the native people.
<P>
	When I look at everything the Liberal Party has proposed for the 
native people and when I see that the B.C. Liberal Party is behind 
this motion, the first question I ask myself is why has the Liberal 
Party here, in Ottawa, not contacted its brother, the B.C. Liberal 
Party, to try to settle this issue.
<P>
	I think that the current government here, in this House, is hiding 
behind the public opinion, which, as we may see later on, might 
well be unamenable to this initiative. Why is it that the Liberal 
Party and the indian affairs minister have not called the person in 
charge of the B.C. Liberal Party, one of the opposition parties in 
that province? One has to wonder about that. Especially since the 
policies put forward by this government in its famous red book 
have not even been implemented yet; we think that the Liberal 
government is dragging its feet on this issue.
<P>
	The famous self-government policy that was denounced by all 
aboriginal representatives in Canada is a case in point. This policy 
was developed behind closed doors, without consulting aboriginal 
leaders and representatives. We now have a proposal that will be 
difficult to put in place because it was not approved by aboriginal 
representatives.
<P>
	The same goes for the red book promise to create a land claims 
commission. The other day, a British Columbia member tabled a 
motion stressing the importance of creating an independent 
commission. Once again, the Liberal government is dragging its 
feet on this issue. Even with their speeches opposing the Reform 
motion before us, we wonder if they are not in fact a little 
responsible for what is now happening in British Columbia.
<P>
	This is a purely political matter. If we look at the motion before 
us, we know that an election will be held one year from now. What 
does this mean? I see this as a dangerous precedent. It means that 
the world stops turning just before an election. The things that have 
been put forward, that have been working for a while, must stop 
because opposition parties are opposed to them. This is complete 
nonsense, in my opinion.

<P>
	When I say that this is purely political, I mean not only for 
opposition parties but also for the party in power in that province, 
the NDP, which is going through a very hard time. I think that 
only 10 or 12 per cent of people intend to vote for them in the 
next election. This process was also held up by the Premier of that 
province a while ago, mainly as a result of public opinion because 
the public is unfortunately misinformed.
<P>
	In British Columbia, the issue of negotiations with aboriginal 
people has simply been held hostage by this type of political 
resolution. I think that such tactics should be condemned.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	These people have suffered injustices for 150 years. They have 
probably been the most patient in agreeing to peaceful 
negotiations. Today, we are being asked to stop this process, 
something we find totally unacceptable.
<P>
	I also raised a number of points when the legislative assembly 
appeared before us during consideration of the B.C. treaty 
commission legislation. I raised them because the B.C. 
commission legislation provides that we should educate the people 
of that province to dispel the rampant rumours and misconceptions 
and to set the record straight. I found out the worst misconception 
when I arrived here as native affairs critic. It came from my 
Reform colleagues from B.C. who were trying to show me that 125 
per cent of the B.C. territory was the subject of land claims.
<P>
	So I said: ``Does this 125 per cent mean that the native people 
would take over all of B.C. and then push the white people into the 
sea?'' They then explained to me that this figure was mostly due to 
overlap between land claims, that if we plot these claims on a map 
of the province, it is clear that their total surface area is bigger than 
all of B.C.
<P>
	I think that the people of B.C. must be told that this is an initial 
bargaining position. Some of my colleagues also expressed their 
views to the land claims commission last week. They said that 
some Quebecers sometimes fear that the map of Quebec will be cut 
up and that native people will own 80 per cent of the territory. But I 
think that many realize that this is an initial bargaining position. As 
the negotiations conducted in Canada in the past few years show, a 
native people's initial position may change by the time negotiations 
are concluded.
<P>
	This education work must be done. People also feel that 
negotiations are conducted in secrecy. What are the current 
headlines in B.C. newspapers such as the <I>Vancouver Sun</I>? Remarks 
made by Reformers often exacerbate this kind of paranoia toward 
First Nations. And this kind of motion goes exactly along the same 
lines. Members from British Columbia say: ``Look, they are going 
to take 125 per cent of the land and that will cause a great deal of 
uncertainty. Companies invest less in certain regions of B.C. than 
others because they are  afraid that the land will be taken over by 
the aboriginals''.
<P>
	That is not how bargaining works. In fact, a six-step process was 
instituted by the commission, and we should give it a chance to 
lead to a conclusion that is to everybody's satisfaction. These are 
the fundamentals of bargaining. You start at the beginning and you 
end at the finish line, and everyone has to compromise a little along 
the way to end up with a satisfactory position.
<P>
	I think it is important also to mention the contribution of the 
Nisga'a nation to the kind of discussions we are holding today. 
While legislation was passed last week respecting the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission, the Nisga'as were intentionally 
excluded from such negotiations, because they have been 
discussing vigorously with the government to settle a land claim 
and a self-government issue. We must always bear in mind the 
historical background and realize, with the help of examples such 
as the one I will give the House today, namely the case of the 
Nisga'a, that it is refreshing to see that First Nations are able to use 
peaceful tools known to everyone, and used in the British 
parliamentary system for ages. I am referring here negotiation.
<P>
	I myself had the pleasure and the privilege to visit the Nisga'a 
last summer. They live along the Nass River and they never signed 
a treaty with the government. In fact, this is a characteristic of 
British Columbia; very few treaties were signed in B.C. That is 
why the commission was established: to develop a process to 
encourage every First Nation in British Columbia to enter into 
agreements with the crown and the province.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	So, they never signed a treaty. Yet, they represent about 6,000 
people and they are pioneers as regards aboriginal negotiations in 
Canada. The case of the Nisga'a is a good example of the quest of 
Canada's aboriginals for legal recognition of their rights.
<P>
	Let us review a bit of history here. In 1763, aboriginal titles were 
recognized by the proclamation of King George III. Governments 
were the only ones allowed to buy Indian land, and could do so only 
through treaties. As I said earlier, the first nations of British 
Columbia signed only 15 agreements, and 14 of them deal with 
Vancouver Island. The Douglas treaty was signed by James 
Douglas, of the Hudson's Bay Company.
<P>
	In 1858, British Columbia became a colony. It joined the 
Canadian Confederation in 1871. At the time, the majority of the 
province's population was made up of first nation members. Yet, 
the first nations agreed to share the land with newcomers. The 
result of all this is that, today, these people are to be found in close 
to 200 reserves in B.C., while the rest of the land is occupied by 
white people who develop its natural resources. The aboriginals 
have been left to fend for themselves. This is why it is so important 
to establish the British Columbia  Treaty Commission and give it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17395"> 17395 </A></B>
<P>
time to reach agreements with the first nations. However, the 
Reform Party motion would keep us from doing that.
<P>
	I will move along in time to get to more contemporary events. In 
1910, Prime Minister Laurier promised, in Prince Rupert, that the 
land issue would be solved. In 1913, the Nisga'a, ever careful when 
negotiating, sent a first petition to the Privy Council, in London. 
Some years later, in 1927, in response to that initiative, the federal 
government prohibited aboriginals from organizing themselves for 
the purpose of discussing land issues and claims. The government's 
reaction was: ``Listen, there are problems, but we do not want to 
discuss them, and we do not want you to discuss them''. The way 
things were done at the time is somewhat reminiscent of Reform's 
1995 proposal: preventing parties from talking to each other.
<P>
	I think that what was hardly acceptable in 1927 has become 
totally unacceptable in 1995. My B.C. colleagues may be surprised 
to learn that the first native member of Parliament in the 
Commonwealth was a Nisga'a. The first native member of this 
House, Frank Calder, is behind the Calder decision to which I will 
come back later.
<P>
	In 1955, the native lands committee was re-established thanks to 
the Nisga'a tribal council. In 1968, the Nisga'a went to court to 
have their aboriginal titles recognized. In 1973, there was the Frank 
Calder case I referred to earlier.
<P>
	After over 14 months of deliberations, the Supreme Court of 
Canada handed down a divided ruling. Of the six judges who 
concluded that the Nisga'a did hold aboriginal land titles, three 
ruled that these titles had expired while the other three decided that 
they were still valid.
<P>
	This ruling was important because, in 1972, Pierre Trudeau was 
still leading a minority government. The opposition parties during 
and after the ruling urged the government to recognize its 
obligations and settle the land claims in that province. On August 
8, 1973, the current Prime Minister announced that the government 
was committed to settling the claims.
<P>
	In 1976, land claims negotiations started between the Nisga'a 
and the federal government. The claims had been filed almost 70 
years earlier. And the province entered into negotiations in 1991. 
As I indicated last time I spoke on this issue, at third reading of the 
bill dealing with the British Columbia Treaty Commission, the 
B.C. Indian affairs department set the whole thing in motion.
<P>
	Why negotiate treaties? So far, the status quo has proven costly 
in terms of energy, legal and strategic battles, but also battles in the 
streets, on highways and on the reserves. Those who advocate 
violence to resolve their problems must not be proven right. We 
have here a nation who keeps believing in going the way of 
peaceful  negotiation. I think we should give them a chance to 
complete their quest for peaceful negotiation.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party is probably motivated by financial 
considerations, although the motion does not say so. Perhaps we 
could respond to that that current provincial and federal profits on 
the land in question are very substantial. I have seen with my own 
eyes forest harvesting in British Columbia. Natural resources are 
plentiful in B.C., so money is not the issue. It is more a matter of 
knowing where the money is going.
<P>
	Right now, some private interests in British Columbia may be on 
the side of the Reform Party, or have that party on their side, and 
demand that motions like this one be debated in the House. Maybe 
this is the case because the Department of Natural Resources is 
currently racing against the clock-and I know because I saw 
it-to get, as quickly as possible, natural resources out of lands that 
will sooner or later belong to aboriginals. The process is simple: all 
the natural resources are taken out of the land. Once that process is 
completed, the government will tell aboriginal nations: ``We are 
now prepared to negotiate to give you the land and its natural 
resources''. But there will be nothing left.
<P>
	Is this what the Reform Party wants? Why does the Liberal Party 
not go further? Why does the federal Indian affairs minister not call 
the Liberal opposition party in British Columbia and say: ``Look, 
forget about that. It does not make any sense. We have to reach a 
settlement with aboriginal people''.
<P>
	I want to ask the Reform Party-since its members will ask me 
some questions in a minute-when would be a good time for the 
federal to sign an agreement with the province and the First 
Nations. What solutions is the Reform Party contemplating to 
conclude land claim negotiations in British Columbia? What does 
it think of aboriginal land titles that have been recognized by the 
courts?
<P>
	It seems that, as far as the Reform Party is concerned, there will 
never be a good time to sign an agreement. As for us, Bloc 
Quebecois members, we feel that the First Nations should not used 
as a political pawn. The time has come to put an end to the 
injustices. Quebecers have realized that and this is why we set up 
model conventions and agreements on land claims. I ask Reform 
Party members to do the same, and I also ask Liberal members to 
put pressure on their B.C. fellow Liberals, so that they do not get 
involved in a scheme that would prevent peaceful negotiation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech with interest, as we 
both sit on the aboriginal affairs standing committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17396"> 17396 </A></B>
<P>
	The member and other members in the House are misreading 
our motion. We are saying there should be no final agreement in 
the next few months because the next few months is the length 
of time that we expect the provincial government that is currently 
in place to be there. That is all we are asking for. We are not asking 
for everything to be thrown out. We are not building a brick wall.
<P>
	The member talked about 500-year-old grievances. To me that is 
very indicative of how little people not from the western part of 
Canada understand about British Columbia and other parts of 
western Canada. Five hundred years ago was long before contact 
with Europeans and certainly long before any grievance.
<P>
	As for the statements that were made about negotiating 
positions, I concur with the member. That is what negotiating is all 
about. All of us in our life enter into all kinds of negotiations.
<P>
	The B.C. treaty process has been in effect since 1993. It has been 
given a chance to work. The member talked about giving it a 
chance to work. It has been found lacking. We are asking for some 
changes. The public is asking for some changes. This will be 
complementary to the process.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	I do realize the Nisga'a have been negotiating for 20 years with 
the federal government. That is one added rationale why the next 
two or three months should not have all the importance attributed 
to them. I fail to understand that. To me it reinforces the point we 
are trying to make that we should not do a last minute rush on an 
agreement that will set a precedent for the 47 other negotiations 
going on in British Columbia.
<P>
	There was a reference in the member's speech to the royal 
proclamation. Once again British Columbia is different. The 
jurisprudence is that the royal proclamation has no implications or 
ramifications for British Columbia because of the time of the royal 
proclamation and the age of British Columbia, when it came into 
Confederation and so on. It has no ramifications in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	The member talked about British Columbia as a population that 
consists of natives and white people. That is so far from reality. 
British Columbia is probably the most multicultural, pluralistic 
society in North America. I would not be surprised if it was the 
most multicultural and pluralistic of almost anywhere other than 
some parts of South America.
<P>
	There is every hue of colour and every culture on earth 
represented in British Columbia. That is significant because we are 
very used to respecting, working with and living with other 
cultures, which is pluralistic. We are trying to create a pluralistic 
society, not one divided.
<P>
	There was more than a suggestion in the member's speech that 
we are trying to prevent the parties from coming together. What 
nonsense. There was a total misrepresentation of the Calder 
decision. I suggest the member read the Calder decision, not 
somebody's summary that is a misrepresentation of what that 
decision actually was and what it said.
<P>
	As someone who spent 20 years in the resource industry, the 
forest industry in British Columbia, some of the statements made 
about the condition of the forests and the logging in the province I 
find quite distressing. I do not believe the depth of knowledge is-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, you have used up half the time for 
comments and questions. I will give the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean the opportunity to respond.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised several 
points. I can tell him that, yes, he is right about the multi-ethnic 
society. I myself have seen the high numbers of aboriginal people 
in the culturally mixed city of Vancouver.
<P>
	The aboriginal people are a bit fed up with trying to gain 
recognition. They have gained cultural recognition, but when it 
comes to business and finance, to recognition of their right to 
territorial self-government, to total financial autonomy, the path is 
a rougher one.
<P>
	The motion before us is very clear. It asks the government not to 
enter into any binding trilateral agreement. This means that, in the 
negotiations with the Nisga'a where we are in the final stages of 
negotiation right now, if a conclusion is reached they are being told 
not to sign.
<P>
	Why not? Because there will be elections in a year, in order to 
respect the views of British Columbians on this issue as expressed 
by both major provincial opposition parties. Clearly, totally 
political motives.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	As I was just saying, and I will repeat it here, it is not acceptable 
for aboriginal negotiations to be held hostage, whether the 
negotiating process as a whole, or the beginning of the process, or 
the signature stage. Everything must proceed as set out in the 
British Columbia Treaty Commission. It absolutely must continue.
<P>
	This past summer I met with the Chilcotin, the Carrier-Sekani 
and the Nisga'a, and I have seen the destruction of their forests, 
both from the air and on the ground. I feel it is urgent for these 
matters to be settled at the fundamental level, so that agreement 
may be reached once and for all to remedy this injustice.
<P>
	It is my feeling that the process currently in place in B.C. is 
working very well and will lead to a settlement. The motion before 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17397"> 17397 </A></B>
<P>
us is quite simply aimed at slowing  down the entire process, and 
that is why we are opposed to it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time.
<P>
	I rise to express my concern and shock at the motion of the hon. 
member from North Island-Powell River. He asks us to delay the 
land claims process in British Columbia during the final year of the 
mandate of the provincial government.
<P>
	It makes me wonder if he and his colleagues will not be here next 
year with a similar motion asking us to delay it for the first year of 
the mandate of the next government while it gets itself organized. It 
seems to me that in Canada we cannot proceed in that fashion.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has maintained that providing 
justice and equity for aboriginal peoples requires two ingredients, 
self-government and a process for making modern day treaties 
through comprehensive claims. Canadians have been wrestling 
with these issues for years. The Reform Party has used the 
self-government issue to fan the flames of fear and apprehension 
during the debates over the Charlottetown accord. Now it continues 
to stir up controversy in British Columbia through its 
misrepresentations of the treaty process.
<P>
	I heard hon. members opposite make a great deal of the media 
reports of the total First Nations claims adding up to 110 percent of 
the province of British Columbia. The total should not surprise us. 
Why should the claims not overlap one another? The First Nations 
have shared the land and its resources for centuries. They have 
migrated and tapped the resources of different locales at different 
times.
<P>
	They have been asked as a part of the treaty making process to 
describe the geographic area of the First Nation's traditional 
territory of British Columbia. They provide a map of the traditional 
areas of their ancestors. This map depicts the territory of a nation as 
it occupied it historically. These maps are used to provide 
negotiators with a general idea of what area of land is under 
question. This is simply part of stage one of the process which is 
called a statement of intent.
<P>
	A statement of intent is not a settlement. A claim is not a treaty. 
A treaty is the result of negotiations, and those negotiations are just 
beginning. The claims are but the starting bargaining position. No 
First Nation would expect to receive the entire region described in 
its statement of intent. The First Nations do not expect a fee simple 
title to the entire province. When two First Nations have 
overlapping traditional territories, they will settle the matter as the 
negotiations proceed. The federal and provincial governments do 
not participate in negotiating an overlap settlement.
<P>
	Several members from across the floor, members who ought to 
know better, have been using the claims to instil fear among British 
Columbians. They infer that these opening positions will lead to 
lost property for third parties across the province. They ask British 
Columbians: ``What will become of your summer cottages? What 
will happen to jobs in the mining and forestry sectors? What will 
happen to the fisheries?'' They raised these fears without adding 
that the treaty process provides for cottage owners and a broad 
spectrum of the industries of British Columbia to have a voice in 
the process.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	They neglect to tell the people at town hall meetings or on radio 
talk shows the Government of Canada consults with a treaty 
negotiations advisory committee representing many of their 
interests. They do not tell people no negotiations can proceed until 
a regional advisory committee has been created to provide the 
views of British Columbians from that part of the province who are 
not at the negotiating table.
<P>
	This pattern of misinformation and fear mongering is typical of 
the tactics some members on the other side of the House have used 
to score cheap political points. They have often criticized the 
government for its dedication to the inherent right of 
self-government as a cornerstone of the Government of Canada's 
aboriginal policy.
<P>
	We have said since the beginning, since the red book that 
provided our election platform, that we believe the inherent right of 
self-government is an existing right within Canada's Constitution.
<P>
	Hon. members across the floor have often made the case that no 
one has defined what self-government means. That argument has 
been erected as an obstacle to prevent justice from getting through 
to aboriginal communities across the entire country. That argument 
speaks to a kind of mean spirited and narrow minded approach that 
has thwarted efforts to bring justice to aboriginal issues. It speaks 
for the tyranny of the status quo. It speaks for the preservation of 
the paternalism of the Indian Act. Is that what Reform members 
want to uphold? I like to think not. Do they really want to impede 
progress, impede the righting of past wrongs, impede certainty for 
the future, impede economic stability, impede job creation?
<P>
	All Canadians want the claims settled. They want an end to the 
uncertainty, an end to ancient wrongs. The negotiations are about 
how, not whether, the settlements should be resolved.
<P>
	We want to make progress. One way we are doing this is by 
acknowledging that the inherent right to self-government is an 
existing right. We are now negotiating with the First Nations on 
how that right is to be implemented.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17398"> 17398 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of the six stages that a claim 
must go through before a treaty comes into effect. I think hon. 
members will observe this is a very thorough process.
<P>
	In the first step a First Nation files a statement of intent with the 
B.C. Treaty Commission. The commission makes sure the 
statement is complete and forwards it to the federal and provincial 
governments. It is at this stage that the First Nation describes the 
geographic area in British Columbia it considers its traditional 
territory. Forty-seven statements of intent have been filed. These 
represent over 70 per cent of the aboriginal people of British 
Columbia. That is progress.
<P>
	Second, the commission convenes a meeting to prepare for the 
negotiations. All three parties exchange information, consider the 
criteria, discuss the research they will do to prepare for the 
negotiations and identify issues of concern. Each party appoints a 
negotiator with a clear mandate. Each party establishes a 
ratification procedure, and the parties agree on the substantive and 
procedural matters that will be negotiated.
<P>
	This is the stage at which Canada and the British Columbia 
government establish their own mechanisms for consultation with 
non-aboriginal interests. One requirement the B.C. Treaty 
Commission imposes on the two governments is the establishment 
of a regional consultative mechanism to represent thirty party 
interests.
<P>
	When the commission determines that all three parties have met 
the criteria for readiness, it confirms they can proceed to stage 
three. This is where all three parties negotiate a framework 
agreement, a negotiated agenda that identifies the issues to be 
negotiated, the goals of the negotiation process, special procedural 
arrangements and a timetable for the negotiations.
<P>
	So far four framework agreements have been signed and another 
four initialled by the negotiators. Again, this is progress.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	In the fourth stage of the treaty process the parties negotiate an 
agreement in principle. These are substantive negotiations and the 
parties examine the framework in detail.
<P>
	Fifth, the principals negotiate to finalize the treaty. Any 
remaining technical and legal issues are resolved at this stage. 
Then, and only then, the sixth stage is the implementation of the 
treaty. Long term implementation plans need to be tailored to 
specific agreements.
<P>
	All commissions agree that significant progress has been made 
by the treaty process. The B.C. treaty commission process is 
working. It is fair, equitable and open. No one denies that the 
negotiations ahead will be tough. There are some very complex 
issues to be brought to the table. However, it is time that we settled 
these  claims so that all British Columbians, aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal, can get on with the job of building a prosperous 
society in that province, a society where all groups can enjoy the 
wealth of resources the province can offer. It will benefit all British 
Columbians.
<P>
	It is time to get on with the job. It is not a time for 
fearmongering. It is a time for fairness and certainty. It is certainly 
not a time for delaying while we wait for a provincial election 
which would create a precedent and would be very much uncalled 
for.
<P>
	I do not represent aboriginal people who have claims that are 
hundreds of years old. I represent over 2,000 aboriginal people. 
Their treaty was signed in 1923, in modern times. Yesterday I 
attended a funeral in my riding of the first woman Indian chief in 
Canada. She died at the age of 73. In 1953, when she first became a 
chief, she was a young woman and a young mother who was 
concerned about these issues. When she died, only this week, she 
was still concerned about them. Her mother died two years ago at 
the age of 103. Throughout her life she was active in trying to 
resolve the problems of the First Nations in my riding.
<P>
	The native people would like to negotiate. I think all Canadians 
would like to negotiate. Every time we have a standoff all 
Canadians suffer. I am very concerned that the member would 
bring forward such a motion today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it might 
be helpful if the member were to spend a little time in British 
Columbia rather than in Peterborough. Then he might have some 
comprehension of what is the content of the speech from the 
Department of Indian Affairs that he just read to us. He clearly has 
no concept of what is going on in British Columbia.
<P>
	When the member says this is an open process, the people in 
British Columbia, who are concerned about this, which is probably 
the majority of British Columbians, would ask: What open 
process?
<P>
	I am consistently asked: ``Who is negotiating for us? Who are 
they? How were they selected? Where do they meet? When do they 
meet? I do now know who they are''. More important, I am also 
asked: ``What is their mandate? Who gave them the mandate? How 
do we even know what they are negotiating on our behalf?''
<P>
	I am inclined to agree with the member that if we have a 
problem, which we clearly do in this situation or in any situation, 
that it is very helpful to have negotiations with people who are 
sitting down eyeball to eyeball.
<P>
	However, what we have in my constituency in British Columbia 
is 3 per cent of the people that are represented by people who are 
constantly in touch with them, who clearly understand what the 
mandate is and, more important, who go back to their people to 
report regularly. They also know that they are going to be subject to 
a ratification vote at the end of the day. Therefore, they know that 
they have to negotiate in good  faith on behalf of the people they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17399"> 17399 </A></B>
<P>
represent. The same is absolutely not true of the non-aboriginal 
side.
<P>
	I ask the member if he would care to come to British Columbia 
and maybe we could clue him in a little bit.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like to say that I have 
relatives in British Columbia who live in Kamloops and I visit 
frequently. I know the riding of Prince George-Bulkley Valley 
well. I regularly visit the city of Vancouver. I have visited the Peace 
River country. However, I do not pretend to be a resident of British 
Columbia. I am a member of the Parliament of Canada and I am 
concerned about all Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member asked who was negotiating. It is the duty of 
members of Parliament to explain these processes. The B.C. treaty 
commission process is a good one. It is transparent. There has been 
legislation in the House related to it. It is for the Reform members 
to explain those matters in detail to the people of their ridings.
<P>
	I would like to read something and members opposite can guess 
where it comes from. Perhaps this comes from Ontario too. I am 
proud to be a resident of Ontario, but I try to represent all the 
people of Canada. The quotation reads: ``Statements made in the 
House of Commons that native people who live in inadequate 
reserve housing without running water or basic sewage should 
simply move away are naive and racist in nature. Those 
uninformed comments made by Reform aboriginal affairs critic 
Mike Scott show the true character of his party. Reform members

accusations concerning First Nations''. That is by David Neale of

deliberate confusion of separate processes and its shameless

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is my 
understanding that we are not to refer to members by their names, 
even when quoting from a document.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is absolutely correct. I would 
ask the hon. member to wrap up his comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize to members opposite. 
They are absolutely right and I apologize for mentioning the 
Reform member by name.
<P>
	``The Reform Party's campaign to kill comprehensive land 
claims settlements is characterized by its sheer misinformation, its 
deliberate confusion of separate processes and its shameless 
manipulation of media that seem ignorant of history''.
<P>
	That quote is not from someone outside the province of British 
Columbia. It was written by Stephen Hume of the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> 
on April 10, 1995.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> On debate, the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have been 
looking at my watch and I thought we had at least three minutes left 
in the 10-minute question and comment period for the hon. 
member for Peterborough.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I should tell the hon. member it was ten minutes 
and five minutes. The other ten minutes are going to go to the hon. 
member whom I have just recognized.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on this undemocratic 
motion moved by the hon. member for the Reform Party.
<P>
	It would seem that the hon. member does not support economic 
prosperity for British Columbians, as he is suggesting that we delay 
creating treaties that would remove an obstacle which has 
hampered economic growth in B.C. for far too long: the uncertainty 
over ownership of land and resources. That uncertainty has carried 
a very high price.
<P>
	In 1990 a Price Waterhouse study asked forestry and mining 
interests in B.C. about the effects of the uncertainty created by 
unresolved land claims.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The study's findings are eloquent. In these two sectors alone, the 
study notes a loss of one billion dollars worth of investments: 300 
new jobs in jeopardy, 1,500 permanent jobs on hold, and capital 
losses totalling $125 million due to uncertainty about the legal 
status of land and resources.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Since then we continue to pay the price of uncertainty, year after 
year. It is the price we pay for letting the situation deteriorate and 
for refusing to sit down with our aboriginal partners and discuss 
rational solutions to the real problems. That is the price the Reform 
Party would like us to keep paying.
<P>
	We now have a chance to do something, to create jobs and to 
stimulate our economic growth. In September, Marlie Beets of the 
B.C. Council of Forest Industries had this to say: ``Our members 
know that we cannot afford to ignore the issue of treaties. The 
forestry industry fully supports the efforts being made to resolve 
these problems, even if it is concerned about what these treaties 
may contain''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The forestry industry of B.C. understands what is involved. It 
knows that it cannot function efficiently without clear policies. It 
knows aboriginal rights must be defined clearly so that everyone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17400"> 17400 </A></B>
<P>
knows the rules of the game. It knows that the time has come to 
realize the  potential of the province and to extend the opportunity 
for its people. It wants to get on with it.
<P>
	The proposition is simple. Treaties will provide certainty and 
create a better climate for investment and economic growth. This is 
a reality which cannot be denied. A clear signal will be sent: B. C. 
is open for business.
<P>
	Treaties will also provide a land base for aboriginal people and 
with it a foundation on which to build self-sufficient communities. 
It will allow aboriginal people to become involved in a range of 
economic activities which in the absence of a land base have been 
foreclosed to them.
<P>
	Commercial activities like mining, forestry and tourism become 
far more possible to be pursued by First Nations. The growth of 
strong, self-reliant, economically vibrant aboriginal communities 
strengthen us all because it will bring positive economic spinovers 
into non-aboriginal communities.
<P>
	For too long the aboriginal people of B.C. have been denied both 
their legal rights from the past and their hopes for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For too long they have suffered as a result of high rates of 
unemployment, illiteracy, infant mortality and suicide. For too 
long we have refused to acknowledge their potential contribution to 
Canadian society. This is an attitude that cannot be justified, and it 
must stop.
<P>
	Once rights and obligations have been clearly defined in treaties, 
all residents of British Columbia, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, 
will be able to develop the potential of their province and improve 
their own circumstances. That is good news for forestry workers 
and miners.
<P>
	It means a broader tax base, since injecting settlement funds will 
stimulate the economy and job creation. It also means a reduction 
in the social cost of poverty and unemployment in aboriginal 
communities. It means an end to litigation and costly court 
proceedings and the beginning of co-operation and negotiation.
<P>
	These historic problems will not disappear at the wave of a 
magic wand. As long as they remain unresolved, there will be no 
investment, and the jobs that could and should be created will 
remain in limbo.
<P>
	The vicious circle will continue: uncertainty will lead to a 
reduction in the number of jobs which in turn will increase social 
problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The cycle of poverty and dependency will continue. These issues 
simply must be dealt with. We have a choice of how we are going to 
do it. We can litigate at great expense to the Canadian taxpayer 
knowing that at the end of this long, drawn out and often bitter 
process a court is likely to tell us to work out the details ourselves,  
something very similar to the negotiation process we have now.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Or we could negotiate directly from the outset. Surely it makes 
good economic sense to avoid costly court battles, which cast each 
party in the role of antagonist, and approach the issues as partners 
prepared to give and take in a spirit of trust and mutual respect.
<P>
	There are real economic benefits in proceeding with treaties in 
B.C. but at the end of the day the most important benefit will not be 
felt in terms of dollars and cents. It will be felt in the lives of 
individuals as they are given the opportunity to contribute further 
to the greatness of Canada.
<P>
	The benefits of holding a job cannot always be measured by a 
point on a graph. Having a job is really about hope. It means having 
the ability to plan for the future and to realize one's potential as 
well as to advance one's family. It means having the pride of 
contributing to the overall health of one's community. Is it better to 
leave things in a state of confusion or to sit down with our 
aboriginal colleagues and establish certainty?
<P>
	Perhaps it is expecting too much to hope the Reform Party's 
vision of Canada is broad enough to include the first peoples or 
generous enough to expand the circle of opportunity or far sighted 
enough to see the wisdom in finally completing this great 
unfinished business of our history. Surely it is not expecting too 
much to ask the Reform Party to take a hard headed look at the 
economics of treaty negotiations and admit that it makes real sense.
<P>
	Surely even Reformers can see the awful price we are paying for 
uncertainty. Surely even they can see the benefits of negotiation 
over litigation. I hope they do see these benefits when it comes 
time to vote on this motion and that they join us in denouncing this 
short sighted and meanspirited motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, other than the partisan ending to the member's speech 
virtually everything said is something we subscribe to. As long as 
the treaties are done right in terms of content, what the member is 
saying is absolutely correct. We do need to define aboriginal rights 
and we do need to solve the problems of uncertainty.
<P>
	There was an earlier reference to the Charlottetown accord. Of 
any identifiable ethnic or racial group in Canada, once the voting 
was over on the Charlottetown referendum the natives on reserves 
more than any other group resoundingly defeated the 
Charlottetown accord in the referendum. We need to remember that 
because I do not believe that is in the public consciousness. There 
are some important reasons why that happened which I am 
certainly sensitive to. I am not sure everyone in the House is 
sensitive to those reasons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17401"> 17401 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a 31-member treaty negotiation advisory committee. 
One of its members was referred to in the previous member's 
speech, the member from the council of forest industries. Many 
of the members of that treaty negotiation advisory committee and 
also some of the members of the regional advisory committees 
who were referred to by several speakers are the biggest critics 
of the status quo process. It is important to recognize those items.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not hear a question 
per se. I think researchers from the hon. member's office are 
providing some of the things he wants to put on the record.
<P>
	With regard to the Charlottetown accord, the population of 
British Columbia also rejected the Charlottetown accord. The hon. 
member should keep his records straight. I want to make sure there 
is no bias in what is put into the record.
<P>
	I find this motion somewhat petty. I cannot believe that 
everywhere we go, in every committee of the House, Reform Party 
members always take on democracy, democratic rights. Yet they 
are actually saying in this motion that democracy in B.C. is not 
alive and well because there is a government that should be calling 
an election in one year which was not elected in a democratic 
process and cannot assure and assume responsibility for all its 
citizens. That is what the motion is implying, that it does not have 
the mandate and the responsibility and that it was not elected in a 
democracy.
<P>
	I do not know if they read what they wrote in this motion. It is an 
absolute bias. As far as I am concerned it destroys their entire 
argument and excuse which they advocate in the House and in 
every committee to put forward their petty politics.
<P>
	The hon. member who put forth this motion states: ``The aim of 
these changes would be to give aboriginals more responsibility for 
their well-being, the tools to discharge that responsibility and more 
accountability for their result''. That is from a press release on 
Reform policy for aboriginal equality and accountability.
<P>
	I am sorry, but we are dealing here with a motion coming from a 
member who says one thing one day and another thing another day, 
just like his leader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last night 
was an infamous time in Canadian history. The opposition parties 
in the Ontario legislature conducted an illegal occupation and sit-in 
of the Ontario chamber. This was unconscionable and I plead with 
them to consider the example they have set.
<P>
	I can understand their frustration because being an opposition 
member facing a juggernaut of a majority government can be 
disappointing, frustrating and disillusioning.
<P>
	The Reform Party faced that shortsighted stupidity and abuse of 
power exercised by the federal Liberal government when it used a 
pile-driver to ram through the Yukon Indian land claims and 
self-government in June 1994.
<P>
	Believe it or not, we now have government in Canada based on 
race. The federal government has turned over massive sections of 
law making in Yukon to aboriginal people. Let me put this in the 
most transparent terms. Aboriginal persons can make certain laws 
that directly impact non-aboriginal persons, and non-aboriginal 
persons have no democratic recourse.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	In South Africa this was called apartheid when the majority of 
blacks were dictated to by the minority of whites. What do we call 
it in Canada when the majority of non-aboriginals are dictated to by 
the aboriginals?
<P>
	This is going on in Yukon. The stupidity of the government's 
ham fisted legislation is that it has constitutionally removed 
freedoms from aboriginal people in Yukon as well. In part of 
Canada's Constitution the federal government has delegated law 
making to certain Indian nations but in turn those nations do not 
have to construct those laws through a democratic process. Those 
nations may delegate law making to an individual in the Indian 
nation.
<P>
	Both aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents in Yukon can now 
become subject to certain laws with absolutely no recourse, no 
democracy. Dictatorship for Canadians enshrined in the Canadian 
Constitution by the government? It is unbelievable.
<P>
	This is why the Reform Party has raised the issue of the B.C. 
treaty negotiations today. B.C. residents, indeed all Canadian 
citizens, are about to have an agreement in principle that has been 
negotiated behind closed doors which will be rammed down their 
throats. It will be an agreement in principle that will be the starting 
point for a constitutionalized treaty. If there was ever a time to 
protest, to obstruct, to go to the extreme, this is it.
<P>
	Unlike the financially driven issues in Ontario that are very 
serious, the issue of the B.C. treaty process is that the B.C. treaty 
and the Nisga'a agreement in principle will explicitly impact 
Canadians' democratic freedoms. The process and treaty will 
permanently, constitutionally, enshrine some personal rights based 
on race.
<P>
	If we do not respect democratic process and combine our 
protests within the democratic process, we have destroyed 
democracy. I have asked the MPPs who occupied the Ontario 
legislature, what is the difference between the 19 aboriginal 
protesters who occupied a Toronto Revenue Canada office last year 
or the occupiers at Ipperwash? What is the difference between them 
and the occupiers of the Ontario legislature? A lot. If the members 
of the provincial parliament, the law makers, will not respect the 
law how 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17402"> 17402 </A></B>
<P>
can they expect ordinary citizens to respect the law? Without 
respect we have anarchy.
<P>
	However, this is not a one-sided issue. If the government at 
Queen's Park or here in Ottawa is bull headed, provocative, 
uncaring and insensitive to concerns of citizens, as expressed by 
members of the opposition, it shares an important part of the 
responsibility for lawless actions.
<P>
	The Liberals here have such a responsibility. They have a 
responsibility to really listen and respond. How can I describe my 
rage that they used a pile-driver to smash personal rights and 
freedoms of Canadians in Yukon? The Liberals would not entertain 
a Reform Party motion that would have subjected the attack on 
personal rights and freedoms of Yukon residents to the Canadian 
charter of rights.
<P>
	Reform Party members used every parliamentary tactic in June 
1994 available to them to slow the race based, democracy bashing 
Yukon acts. It became a choice: break the law ourselves to stop the 
Liberals' stupidity or work within the system and respect this 
institution in spite of the Liberals' bullheaded stupidity.
<P>
	For Yukon it is too late but for B.C. it is not. I plead with the 
Liberals. Listen, learn and recognize that the Liberal process is not 
only out of touch with reality but, most important, will lead to 
permanent civil disobedience and racial gridlock.
<P>
	In my office in Cranbrook I have been approached by aboriginal 
people. Members of the Ktunaxa nation tell me their negotiators 
are out of touch with them. These Indian people resent and reject 
being left on the outside of the negotiating process.
<P>
	At least these constituents who represent about 3 per cent of the 
population in Kootenay East will have a chance to ratify a 
negotiated agreement. They will get one person, one vote, but what 
about the other 97 per cent? Approximately 70,000 people who will 
have to live with the treaty will get two persons, their MP and 
MLA, with two votes. Their MP with one vote in the House will be 
pitted against members like the member for Peterborough and 
members from Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, 
Ontario: one of 295 votes to represent the interests of my 70,000 
people.
<P>
	Do we have democracy when an aboriginal gets a vote but a 
non-aboriginal does not? I think not.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	I suggest the aboriginal negotiators who may presently be 
considered to be out of touch by their aboriginal constituents are 
negotiating the aboriginal position with popular ratification of the 
final agreement in mind. They clearly understand their negotiations 
will be rejected if they do not reflect the wishes of their 
constituents.
<P>
	It is not just an issue of fairness. It is more than enforcing the 
principle of equality of all Canadians. It is  about a workable 
process that will lead to a real solution to a real problem. If we do 
not get it right, we will end up with civil disobedience, unrest, 
racial friction and a giant, tangled, constitutionalized mess.
<P>
	I am asked constantly as to who is negotiating for the 
non-aboriginal citizen. People come in to my office and want to 
know literally who is negotiating for them. They want to know who 
the negotiators are, how they are selected, where they meet, when 
do they meet and more important, what their mandate is and who 
gave it to them. A constituent asked me: ``How will they know 
what I will accept? Why do I not have the same rights as the 
aboriginal with the ratification vote?'' People tell me: ``If I have 
not been part of the process, if my interests have not been explicitly 
taken into account, I have no interest in the agreement''.
<P>
	Let me clearly explain what this means to the Indian affairs 
minister and the Liberal backbenchers who are forced to support 
him. Let me also explain this to the provincial negotiators. If the 
negotiators knew during the treaty negotiations that their process 
was going to be subject to popular ratification, they would 
negotiate in a substantially different way. They would know that 
their bottom line, that the results of the treaty process negotiations 
would have to be accepted, in my case by 97 per cent of Kootenay 
East residents.
<P>
	Impossible, the Liberals say: ``We would never get an 
agreement''. Well that is precisely the problem. Contrary to the 
Liberals' old party assumptions, Canadians will not have 
government imposed top down solutions. Let me repeat that 
Canadians clearly have shown in everything from the 
Charlottetown accord to the cablevision fee increase kerfuffle last 
year, that they would not accept those increases and they would not 
accept the Charlottetown accord. They will not have their future 
dictated by Ottawa politicians. There we have it.
<P>
	When talking about the B.C. treaty process of the Nisga'a 
agreement the facts are the same. If Canadians are not part of the 
solution, they will be part of the problem and with a vengeance.
<P>
	The difference between the problems today and tomorrow are 
two. First, non-aboriginal residents of B.C. are scared, anxious and 
concerned. They are delaying investment decisions by the 
truckload. Their apprehension is magnified by the unknown. 
Tomorrow they will be resentful, surly and unco-operative, with 
their apprehension replaced by lack of co-operation with the 
government and a bad attitude toward the people who have special 
position and privilege based on their race. Second, today we have 
some flexibility. Tomorrow the decisions will be etched in granite 
because they will be constitutionalized for all time.
<P>
	Do we get the picture? We permanently remove one serious 
problem and immediately replace it with a problem 20 times worse.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17403"> 17403 </A></B>
<P>
	We will use the finance minister's comment from question 
period today. We will use his example of an incapacitated driver 
racing down a hill. The Reform motion we have put forward would 
slow down the driver, bring him to a stop and hopefully sober him 
up. The Liberals will leave the driver racing down the hill until 
he crashes.
<P>
	Will the Liberals listen? Will the B.C. NDP government which is 
on its way out take heed? I doubt it. And more the shame because 
they are putting the same unconscionable pressure on the Reform 
Party that the Ontario government put on its opposition. The 
federal Liberals have a responsibility to be reasonable and they are 
blowing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest and I am sorry that the member did not have 
an opportunity to speak very much with regard to the motion. He 
may have spent a little more time on the partisan aspects of 
political life.
<P>
	The member started off in his debate referring to the situation in 
the Ontario provincial legislature. He chastises the opposition 
members for taking charge of a situation and in fact exercising their 
right to let their views be known in that elected body.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	The member then went on to describe a situation which occurred 
last June in the aboriginal affairs committee. He said that a piece of 
legislation had been rammed through the committee. The hon. 
member will well know that the meeting continued all through the 
night until six o'clock the next morning. I was at the meeting from 
about midnight until 6.00 a.m. filling in for some of my colleagues.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party were conducting a filibuster. The 
filibuster was basically to ask nuisance and nonsense questions on 
virtually every word in the bill. They kept the entire staff 
associated with that committee and members of Parliament, about 
40 people, tied up in a stuffy room while they asked nuisance 
questions. It is precisely the same situation. The Reform Party was 
exercising its democratic right. I do not for one moment believe 
there was anything wrong with what the Reform members did. 
They were doing it because it is part of the democratic process.
<P>
	The hon. member also referred to his frustration. I am sorry the 
member is frustrated with life in a House which has a majority 
government. However, we must respect the democratic process. 
The fact that the government has a majority is a reflection of the 
operation of the democratic process.
<P>
	The hon. member well knows that when a government is elected 
it has a platform which reflects the commitments the party has 
made to the people of Canada. ``If you elect us, these are the things 
we will do''. When the party platform is put into legislation, it is  
incumbent on the members elected to the governing party to follow 
the promises they have made.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not believe that supporting legislation 
which reflects the platform of a party during an election is 
respecting the democratic process?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member. It is 
only logical and rational that a party when it forms a majority 
government would be committed to following through on its 
election platform. We have no disagreement with that.
<P>
	However, we have a very fundamental difference of opinion with 
respect to the fact that the Liberal government has used closure 
more times than the Brian Mulroney government even thought 
about. It is ramming through distinct society. It is ramming through 
veto. It rammed through the Indian land claims. I suggest that a 
majority government not only has a right to do what it wants to do, 
but it has a responsibility to opposition members who are 
expressing the deep, heartfelt concerns of their constituents. Those 
concerns are falling on deaf ears because of the unslakeable thirst 
for power of the government.
<P>
	There is a tremendous amount of fear, anxiety and concern in 
British Columbia that the cabinet has such a weak representation in 
British Columbia. There is a tremendous amount of silence on the 
part of federal Liberals elected in British Columbia. The 
government is running roughshod with its legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to the filibuster in committee. He is 
right; it is legal. I submit to him that the process which the MPPs 
undertook in the Ontario legislature because they were so desperate 
goes far beyond the whole process of a filibuster.
<P>
	What I am saying is that we have reached a point of very acute 
concern about the heavy handedness of the Liberal Party and in 
particular, the NDP government in B.C. which is currently on its 
way out. We are concerned that we are going to have something 
imposed on the people of British Columbia by people who are 
fundamentally out of touch with reality.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will keep an eye on the clock and I hope you will help me 
out because I am not sure how this will go.
<P>
	I rise today to speak in opposition to Bill C-107, an act to 
establish the British Columbia Treaty Commission and to speak in 
favour of our motion to urge the government to not enter into any 
binding trilateral aboriginal treaty or land claim agreements in B.C. 
in the last years of the current provincial government's mandate.
<P>
	In fact, this bill does not establish the treaty commission, it 
continues it and legalizes it. It is just what we need, another legally 
entrenched layer of bureaucracy. It is another group of appointees 
with their own staff to  be paid for by the people of Canada. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17404"> 17404 </A></B>
<P>
oppose the establishment of this treaty commission in British 
Columbia because it is simply not necessary.
<P>
	In British Columbia we have no treaties. We have a reserve 
system. The legal entrenchment of this commission prejudges the 
outcome of the land claims negotiations which are presently taking 
place in British Columbia.
<P>
	I can tell you that the people of British Columbia are very 
concerned about this treaty negotiation process. Just a few days ago 
I hosted in my riding of Mission-Coquitlam an information 
evening on aboriginal issues which was attended by over 200 
people. They are very concerned that fishing rights and lumbering 
rights will be bargained away as part of the settlement process. 
They also believe they should be a part of any settlement process.
<P>
	Mel Smith, the well known, well respected author of <I>Our Home 
or Native Land?</I> attended the meeting. He stated that British 
Columbia has already done its duty to its native people by setting 
up more than 1,600 reserves. He argues that by doing this British 
Columbia has discharged any duty it owed to the aboriginal people. 
As well, the government could compensate the native people with a 
one time cash payment for loss of hunting, trapping and gathering 
rights over the lands.
<P>
	It is our intention to ensure that Canada's native people become 
completely self-reliant. We would like to preside over the 
dismantling of the department of Indian affairs, thus allowing 
aboriginal people to become self-sufficient. This should be the goal 
for all of us in this House. Yet what do we hear? A lot of name 
calling from the other side. To become self-sufficient, the 
aboriginal people do not need a treaty commission.
<P>
	It is our belief that we should get rid of the Indian Act, giving 
aboriginals the same right to property ownership as other citizens. 
Aboriginals should be subject to the same constitutional, federal 
and provincial laws as the rest of Canadians. They should be 
allowed to establish municipal style governments and benefit from 
the same programs as the rest of Canadians.
<P>
	There is no need for this bill, but there is a need to address 
aboriginal issues in a timely fashion. I would like to remind 
members that we are not suggesting we do away with any type of 
negotiation. Having said this, I wish to draw the attention of the 
House to certain shortcomings in the bill.
<P>
	The interpretation section contains a definition of First Nations. 
They are described as aboriginal people within their traditional 
territory in British Columbia. The definition begs the question of 
entitlement to a land base. It can be argued that by the use of the 
definition the aboriginal people are shown to have a prima facie 
case of a land claims settlement.
<P>
	Again, clause 5 does the same thing. It states that the purpose of 
the commission is to facilitate in British Columbia the negotiation 
of treaties. In other words, establish this commission and we are 
bound to have the traditions negotiated, whether there is an 
entitlement or not. The process has been established.
<P>
	Clause 5 obligates the commission to allocate funds to allow 
First Nations to participate in the process. This will be expensive. 
But in addition to it being expensive, it is also exclusionary.
<P>
	Funding is not provided for third parties, only the aboriginal 
people. What about those who oppose the giveaway of British 
Columbia lands? I guess they will have to finance these 
interventions themselves. I hope they are able to. It is my 
understanding that in the borrowing of funds to negotiate there will 
be an 80:20 split. In that case, 80 per cent will be repayable; 20 per 
cent will be contributed by whom, the federal government, the 
provincial government, what part for each one?
<P>
	Clause 7 of the bill establishes how the commission is to be 
appointed. The federal government and the B.C. government each 
get to appoint commissions. I do not see anyone who will simply 
represent the people of Canada. Are they not important? Are the 
members opposite saying they do not count? These appointments, 
all appointments to the Commission, should be subject to the 
approval of this House.
<P>
	Clause 18 allows the commission to make necessary bylaws. We 
are giving the commission power to establish its own rules of 
procedure. At the very least, these bylaws should be tabled in this 
House.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Clause 22, the clause which perhaps bothers me more than any 
other, states that the parties can amend the agreement at any time. 
This is the British Columbia Treaty Commission agreement which 
underlies this act. It is beyond me how the bill can allow 
amendments to the agreement without references to Parliament.
<P>
	In my last householder I asked the following question: ``Do you 
believe that all Canadians should have equal rights and 
responsibilities with no special status based on racial or ethnic 
origin?'' Ninety-one per cent answered yes. However, in addition 
to answering many wrote comments, some of which I should like to 
share. I have so many comments that I cannot share them all, but I 
will share some of them.
<P>
	I have not done anything to the comments. I have not changed 
their wording. I have not corrected grammar. I have not done 
anything to them. These are some of the things the residents of my 
riding in British Columbia are saying: ``Anyone born in Canada 
should have the same rights and be governed by the same laws. 
This is not true now''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17405"> 17405 </A></B>
<P>
	``We all have our own ethnic upbringings but we do not expect 
to be treated differently from others. I believe that everyone 
regardless of race should work and pay for their property''.
<P>
	``Governments should put a stop to all the Indian roadblocks. I 
do not feel the Indian population should have special rights, 
especially Indians who are abusing their position and rights''. 
There might be something there with regard to fishing rights. There 
has been tremendous abuse of fishing rights in British Columbia.
<P>
	``We are all Canadians. We should have the same rights and 
laws. Practices such as giving natives the right to fish any time for 
their food as well as to sell those fish is making racial problems''. 
They are. That is a truth. I do not want to sit in the House and be 
condemned and called names by members opposite for saying the 
truth. I am getting very tired of it.
<P>
	``Natives should not get tax free anything. They should work like 
everyone else. We are suggesting that native people be given a fair 
chance to stand on their own two feet. Wouldn't you suggest that is 
the right thing to do?''
<P>
	Regarding self-government, the Indian Act discriminates against 
aboriginal people by setting them apart from other Canadians. That 
is what Reform believes. I do not see how any member in the 
House could disagree with that. Most native people want the same 
rights, freedoms, responsibilities and protections of other 
Canadians. The Indian Act stifles its subjects from having a 
democratic voice in their own affairs and from having 
accountability in their own officials.
<P>
	The inherent right to self-government is an interesting phrase. 
What does it mean? When Reform MPs rightly ask what is meant 
by self-government, the previous speaker from Peterborough 
attacks Reformers for wanting to know the answer. Can we imagine 
anyone going into negotiations without knowing what all parties 
mean by the terminology that is being discussed? It is absolutely 
ridiculous. Instead of the member for Peterborough admitting the 
common sense of Reform in asking this question, he attacks 
Reform MPs for asking it.
<P>
	I have been watching government members in the House for 
some time now. I wonder what constantly drives them to put down 
other elected members of Parliament. Is it because they have no 
answers? They started this terrible debt that is climbing up and up 
and up. We are trying to deal with it today and they do not have the 
answers. Are they trying to take the pressure off themselves? Is it 
because to attack means one does not have to deal with the issues?
<P>
	The member for Madawaska-Victoria called us meanspirited. 
She said: ``What about democratic rights? Reformers are always on 
about democratic rights''. Yes, we are. We are discussing the 
democratic rights of all British Columbians and of all other 
Canadians. The  treaty process does not involve a few people. It 
involves all Canadians. It is time we started to be honest.
<P>
	The department of Indian affairs has not worked. Can anyone say 
it has worked? This process which has been encouraged by this 
government and by past Liberal governments has created a group 
of Canadians who are dependent on the Canadian government.
<P>
	Past Canadian governments have created an institutionalized 
welfare state for native people. This is not kindness. This is cruelty. 
I wonder how many times we have to say that. It is not the 
Reformers who are being cruel. The Reformers are saying we 
should stop all this now, help people, deal with the issues, deal with 
reality and stop calling names because that does not get anybody 
anywhere. The House is far above that sort of presentation. It really 
distresses me every time I hear it.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I spent many years teaching students. I always taught them that 
in debate, if they do not have something to say, if they cannot back 
it up or say it in a proper manner, they should not bother saying it at 
all.
<P>
	I watch repeatedly in the House people tearing at each other. I 
would rather see facts. I would rather hear arguments that are 
presented properly. I really am discouraged by it.
<P>
	This morning the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development directed most of his remarks to the right of Reform 
MPs to raise this issue in the House. Have I missed something 
here? Are we not all elected equally? How dare anybody question 
the right of Reform MPs to raise this issue in the House? That is 
absolutely disgusting.
<P>
	He proceeded to describe Reformers as aboriginal bashers 
because we were making him uncomfortable; that is all I can 
suggest. I guess it is the old story: the best defence is an offence. I 
have often heard the word racist. It disgusts me too. If members 
take the time to look it up in the dictionary they will see that it 
means giving special priorities to a certain group. Reformers 
repeatedly say that we must all be equal. If we are all equal that is 
not racist. Some members should start telling the truth in the 
House. The House is far above the petty squabbling I witness day 
after day.
<P>
	Native people soundly defeated the Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown accords. What does that say to members of the 
House? It was not suitable to them. Distinct society, as presented, 
was not suitable to them.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to correct a few points.
<P>
	We passed Bill C-107 regarding the B.C. Treaty Commission. 
The B.C. Treaty Commission is formed by five people. One is 
appointed by the governor. One is appointed by the lieutenant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17406"> 17406 </A></B>
<P>
governor. Two are appointed  by the summit. Then the chairperson 
is appointed by the three parties I just mentioned.
<P>
	Truth is always a question of perception. Many times I am very 
disturbed by the truth the Reform Party raises. I suppose we are not 
on the same wave length and that is why we are on opposing sides 
of the House.
<P>
	I agree to some extent with the member. I am quite distraught 
most of the time by what is going on in the House and by the lack of 
kindness we see here.
<P>
	As for the aboriginal people, it is true we should all be equal. 
However aboriginal people have been in distress for too long. They 
are in a situation where they need help. We must start on an equal 
basis in order to be equal. We have to help them first, put them on 
an equal basis, and then we can all be equal.
<P>
	I have two questions for my colleague. She mentioned that in 
reply to her householder 91 per cent of the people said that they 
wanted equality. How many people answered her householder? 
Whenever I ask questions in my householder I always have a very 
low response.
<P>
	Does she feel that the comments of her colleague from Kootenay 
West made on the Liberal caucus of British Columbia were actually 
kind comments? I take exception to what he said. We have been 
working very well in spite of the fact that we are so few. We have 
been able to achieve quite a few things.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am certainly aware that Bill 
C-107 was passed. I did not get a chance to speak on it and I very 
much wanted to. With 52 MPs on the Reform side, many of us do 
not get to speak on the issues we would like to speak on. Since it 
impacts directly on this I certainly wanted an opportunity to do so.
<P>
	No one represents the people. I must insist that all the names the 
hon. member mentioned were appointed, as she said, but who is 
representing the people of British Columbia? Nobody is.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	Aboriginal people have been in distress for too long. Those who 
know their Canadian history will realize that not just the aboriginal 
people were in distress in the history of the country. They should 
know about the Acadians who were torn asunder, who lost family 
members, who lost their lands, who were sent all over the world 
and had nothing. Nobody paid them anything. No one 
re-established them. Nobody did anything. They were good, 
worthwhile people.
<P>
	We also had the Loyalists who were driven out of the United 
States to Canada. They had nothing. They had to leave. What did 
we do when the Loyalists came to Canada? We did not give them 
anything to set up. They had to do it on their own. Today they are 
better off having done that. It makes their lives a lot easier. Too bad 
we did not do that with the native people.
<P>
	What about Japanese Canadians? We just took and took. With 
these examples I am trying to say to the hon. member that we have 
made mistakes. We admit we have made mistakes, but is it not time 
to start on an equal basis for everyone? I strongly suggest we 
should.
<P>
	Regarding my householders, I keep track and I have been 
running at a 2 per cent to 6 per cent return. I have about 58,000 in 
my riding. We do not have them all in at this time because it only 
went out and we are waiting. We have had over 1,500 returned, so it 
is 91 per cent of the 1,500. That is the best I can tell the member 
right now.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt-Department of 
National Defence; the hon. member for Mackenzie-Canadian 
Wheat Board; the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake-Environmental Protection Act-the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra-Vietnam; the hon. member for Saint 
John-National Defence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to respond to the motion by the hon. member for North 
Island-Powell River.
<P>
	At the outset I must say I find the motion puzzling. No doubt the 
hon. member means well, but I do not think he has thought through 
the consequences of the motion. If adopted, parliamentary 
democracy in Canada will slow down to a crawl. The hon. member 
asks us to forgo signing land claim agreements because the people 
of British Columbia may be going to the polls soon. His motion 
refers to the last year of the current provincial government 
mandate.
<P>
	I wonder how he expects any business to get done in a federal 
state, let alone one with ten provinces and two territorial 
governments, and soon to be three. In any given year at least one of 
these governments may be facing an election. On average two and 
one-half of them will be facing an election every year.
<P>
	It would seem the hon. member wants to paralyse the decision 
making process. The convention is that elections are held every 
four or five years. How do we know which it will be? Should we 
begin clamping down on a government's right to sign agreements 
during the third year or the fourth years of its term?
<P>
	What about the case of minority governments? The pattern in 
Canada seems to be that minority governments call an election 
after two years in office. This is not a constitutional principle. It is 
not even a convention. It is simply a reality of minority 
government. If we were apply the hon. member's motion in these 
situations, we would not sign any agreements with a minority 
government that had been in office for more than one year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17407"> 17407 </A></B>
<P>
	We can imagine the results. A new minority government is 
sworn in. The new ministry has a few months to become 
accustomed to power and to learn something about the ropes. Just 
as it is hitting stride and beginning to get some things 
accomplished, other governments in the country say: ``Sorry, we 
can't sign any agreements with you. We have to respect the views 
of your electorate who may be going to the polls soon. They may 
want to change something''.
<P>
	Yet I hear over and over again from the members of the Reform 
Party that government must pay attention to the grassroots. The last 
speaker from Mission-Coquitlam made much of this point. What 
is their idea of paying attention to the grassroots? The member for 
Mission-Coquitlam said that we should read the answers to the 
questions she put in householder and that is it.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	It is sort of like following the opinion polls, setting up hotlines 
so that people can phone in their views. It is town hall meetings and 
radio talk shows. I have nothing against any of these practices. I do 
them myself. I commend any effort to encourage Canadians to 
express their views. We have to understand one thing: taking an 
opinion poll or gauging the views of the people who phone in to a 
hotline or having a show of hands at a town hall meeting is not the 
same as representing the grassroots. The important word is 
representing.
<P>
	This is a representative government. We are all representatives 
of the people of this country. The way I try to do it, and I suggest 
most of us do, is we get involved, to learn, to listen. We go to 
committee meetings, we question witnesses and we study and 
debate those issues which are of particular concern or about which 
we have some particular expertise.
<P>
	When I ran in my riding to represent the people, I told them what 
I stood for, what the party was going to do and what the issues were 
with which the government would deal. We were fortunate enough 
to receive a majority of the votes in this country and represent the 
majority of the seats. Therefore, the Liberal party in this House is, I 
submit, the only truly representative body here. That seems to be 
self-evident. We come from all across the country. We represent 
every ethnic group in the country, including the aboriginal people. 
Therefore, we try to represent what the majority of Canadians think 
and feel about this country.
<P>
	The grassroots is largely made up of people who do not phone in 
to hotline shows. They have little inclination to talk to Raife Mair 
on the radio. They do not go to town hall meetings. They might not 
have a strong opinion one way or another on a particular issue 
because they do not know enough about it, that is until they happen 
to be asked their opinion by a pollster. If the wrong question is 
asked, the wrong answer will be given.
<P>
	Certainly most people believe all Canadians should have the 
same rights. The member for Mission-Coquitlam said that the 
Department of Indian Affairs has not worked. By today's standards 
and what we know now, it was an ill-conceived plan. It was a way 
of integrating another culture and people into ours. We have 
learned a lot since those days. I would agree very much with my 
colleague that we should do all we can over time to get rid of the 
paternalistic attitude of the Indian affairs department.
<P>
	That does not mean that we can then say that all of us should 
have the same rights when we are not starting from the same place. 
If we do not understand that the Indian idea of property is different 
from ours, that it is culturally different and spiritually different, 
then we are never going to solve the problem because they will 
never agree.
<P>
	Let us hear no more of the self-righteousness of the members of 
the Reform Party with their claims that they speak for the people. 
People elected the hon. member from North Island-Powell River 
on October 25, 1993 just as they elected me. They elected him to 
represent them. We both speak for the people in our ridings and 
people will have an opportunity to judge our performance in the 
next federal election.
<P>
	The people of British Columbia elected the government of 
British Columbia and they will have their chance to render their 
verdict on that government in the coming months. In the meantime, 
we will continue with the job of governing the country and we have 
to carry on with the job of negotiating comprehensive claims with 
the First Nations of British Columbia. They have waited for 200 
years to reach these agreements. Most have never had the 
opportunity to sign an agreement outlining their rights.
<P>
	This is an historic anomaly in Canada. First Nations in all other 
provinces and in the territories have treaties, principally because 
most of the land unsettled is owned by the Queen in right of Canada 
in other provinces and territories.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The only treaties signed exclusively in British Columbia were 
concluded before the province joined Confederation in 1871. When 
the province joined Confederation, all the unclaimed land, except 
where the Indians had been pushed into reserves, was held by the 
Queen in right of British Columbia, which is not the same situation 
across the rest of the country.
<P>
	This is where the grassroots beyond the aboriginal community 
can have their say. They are not left out of the process. Neither the 
Government of Canada nor the Government of British Columbia is 
interested, hopefully, in negotiating treaties that would ignore the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17408"> 17408 </A></B>
<P>
interests of non-aboriginal British Columbians, any more than it is  
going to ignore the justifiable interests of the aboriginal people.
<P>
	We do want to get on with the process. We want to remove the 
uncertainty. We cannot let the process become derailed because 
this government or that one nears the end of its mandate.
<P>
	The negotiation of a comprehensive claim is a long and 
painstaking process. That is how it should be. That is how it has 
been. That is how it will be. These are very important negotiations. 
They define how people will function over the long term. They set 
the parameters for how aboriginal people and their institutions will 
relate to the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	The simplistic ideas we have heard so far this afternoon from 
Reform Party members seem to ignore completely that the Indian 
people are a people. They are protected, as we all are, under the 
Constitution. They have inalienable rights to self-government and 
they have inherent rights in this land. Those are the things we have 
to define.
<P>
	After waiting for more than a century, the First Nations of 
British Columbia know the value of patience in making sure that 
the negotiations are done right. Perhaps a little of that patience 
would not hurt the members down the line.
<P>
	At the same time, we should not set up artificial barriers by tying 
the hands of legislators that must pass the legislation to bring the 
treaties into effect. I urge the House to vote against this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this motion has been misread. It depends where you are 
coming from sometimes how you choose to read something. 
Nowhere in this motion does the Reform Party suggest that 
governments cannot sign agreements in the last year of their 
mandate.
<P>
	We are saying that when there is a significant, a major, a costly 
and a divisive issue, in the same way that the Mulroney Tories in 
the dying days of their government, low in the polls, signed the 
EH-101 and the Pearson deals, this is a divisive issue in British 
Columbia. It is precedent setting and worth billions of dollars. It is 
totally inappropriate for the government in the last year of its 
mandate to sign this treaty. In actuality the election is most likely 
only months away. It will be in the spring.
<P>
	I want to make it perfectly clear that this is a basic assumption 
that was promoted by the last speaker and it is incorrect. Nowhere 
are we saying that, nor is that our intent.
<P>
	There was a suggestion by the member that only a Liberal 
government is qualified to govern and only a Liberal government is 
qualified to judge the issues. I find that very difficult, particularly 
in the context of British Columbia. That is a stretch of 
unimaginable proportions.
<P>
	The member made some statements about lands and about 
treaties. The significant thing in British Columbia is that British 
Columbia spent many years after Confederation contributing lands 
to the federal government to reserve for native people. That was a 
commitment made at the time of Confederation under the Act of 
Union. It was an unfulfilled commitment up until 1924. In 1924 the 
federal government, by order in council, agreed that the province of 
British Columbia had fulfilled its obligations.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	British Columbia has two-thirds of all the reserves in Canada. 
About 18 per cent of registered Indian people in Canada live in 
British Columbia. Those reserves contain, within a provincial 
context, 14 per cent of all lands reserved for Indians. This is not 
insignificant. It is the crux of a very large issue. There is no legal 
imperative to negotiate treaties.
<P>
	We are not saying that treaties should not be negotiated. We are 
also interested in removing the uncertainty from the landscape and 
from this whole issue. This is an appropriate way to do it. However, 
right now is not the time to conclude a final agreement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. 
member for North Island-Powell River. I listened to his speech, as 
I have listened to them all. I suppose one might answer a question 
with another question.
<P>
	I suggest, in the scheme of things, that two years is scarcely 
sufficient time for the B.C. treaty commission to prove its worth, as 
the member knows, as he listened as I did to the current head of that 
commission. Two years ago the commission started from scratch to 
set up a service organization to get the board together and write 
some policies. Since it only began in 1993 and we are in 1995, it 
has had scarcely two years which was not to negotiate treaties. It 
was, as my friend knows, to start the business, develop the 
expertise, set up the office and interest the First Nations of B.C. in 
coming forward to negotiate. Since a little more than 70 per cent of 
the natives in B.C. are involved in the process now, it seems to me 
we should give them a little time.
<P>
	I appreciate the member filling me in with respect to the order in 
council in 1924. I am little confused about his numbers because I 
believe he said that B.C. had 17 per cent of all reserves in Canada 
and then went on to use the figure of 14 per cent. I want to ask him 
about that.
<P>
	I also want to ask the member whether the election in B.C. is a 
foregone conclusion. I thought he might bring up the helicopters 
and the Pearson airport deal, but if he casts his mind back he will 
realize that the Pearson airport deal was signed in the midst of an 
election which the government was losing very badly. The 
helicopter deal was a statement in the red book and in the platform  
of the Liberal Party before it was signed. Again, it was within 
months of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17409"> 17409 </A></B>
<P>
the election. I might remind the member that this House had not sat 
effectively for about a year and a half before that election.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I would like to speak to this shortsighted motion moved by 
the hon. member from the Reform Party.
<P>
	This undemocratic motion suggests that the views of British 
Columbians cannot and are not being respected in the treaty 
process. I want to correct this ill-informed impression by providing 
the hon. member and his equally ill-informed colleagues with some 
facts.
<P>
	Before doing that, I would like to take exception to something 
said by my colleague from Mission-Coquitlam. I know Canadian 
history and I strongly believe that the aboriginals, because of their 
culture, had much more difficulty becoming part of our society and 
they still do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Did you write that?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Yes, I wrote that. They have gone some way but 
they have to go further to be equal. Perhaps my choice of words is 
incorrect. My hon. colleagues have received a heap of factual 
information on the treaty process in British Columbia, but they 
seem bent on seeing things that are not there.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	If they are involved in some science fiction movie, we are not in 
Hollywood, and let us get back to reality. We cannot stop all 
negotiations for almost one year. What for? Do we want to fool the 
First Nations once again? What would we accomplish? The treaty 
negotiation process is well under way.
<P>
	Around ten teams are now at the framework step which is the 
fourth step of the process. We are all anxious to see the conclusion 
of these negotiations. It is important for all of us because the 
uncertainty has been too severe for years and has caused real 
hardship in British Columbia.
<P>
	In B.C. the governments have set up structures to hear, discuss 
and solicit the advice of province wide interests. The Reform Party 
seems to ignore that advice is being sought. It wants to perpetuate 
the fear and concern which we all know exists. The Reform Party 
needs to understand that debate and discussion can take place 
without some of the hyperbole and rhetoric easily associated with 
treaty negotiations.
<P>
	Let me talk about the consultations. In mid-1993 the federal and 
provincial governments formally established and advisory 
committee to advise ministers and senior officials on province 
wide treaty issues. The treaty negotiation advisory committee is 
made up of representatives from 31 organizations in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	Among those organizations are four fishing industry 
representatives, five labour union representatives, the B.C. 
Wildlife Federation, guides and outfitters, The B.C. Council of 
Forestry, the B.C. Trappers Association, outdoor recreational 
interests, the B.C. Cattlemen's Association and others.
<P>
	More important, the members come from throughout British 
Columbia. They are not all from Vancouver. They come from 
Smithers, Terrace, Kamloops, Quesnel, Prince Rupert and 
Vancouver Island. Each brings his or her organizational perspective 
but also the sense of how their neighbours and communities are 
reacting to the treaty negotiation process.
<P>
	The objective of the treaty negotiation advisory committee, 
TNAC, is to ensure that the interests of the members' organizations 
are understood and taken into account in the negotiation of modern 
day treaties and to contribute to treaty agreements with aboriginal 
people which are workable and lasting and have the understanding 
and support of British Columbians.
<P>
	Those are high but necessary objectives. Governments are 
committed to not just hearing and understanding their advice but 
taking it into account when negotiating.
<P>
	The federal government not only wants a means by which 
negotiations can be effectively conducted but also must seek 
effective and efficient advice from third parties whose interests 
might be affected by treaty settlement.
<P>
	TNAC is structured to enable all members to know as much 
about the issues that could be negotiated and to notify governments 
of potential problems or concerns.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, has attended three of TNAC's bi-monthly meetings. 
To ensure he maintains a direct relationship to the committee, I 
serve as the minister's representative to the committee. We are as a 
government directly and closely involved in the discussion and 
advice from the TNAC table.
<P>
	We are all working together, trying to come to an agreement we 
can all live with. At times it is difficult but with everybody's 
goodwill we will get there and solve a far too longstanding 
discrimination.
<P>
	Because of TNAC things are changing every time we meet. We 
are listening. It is not an easy process but we are slowly getting 
there and learning to understand each other. Now we all recognize 
that 31 members is a large committee and that some issues require 
more specific discussion. Hence five sectoral committees were 
established. These committees meet monthly and are divided into 
lands and forests, fisheries, wildlife, governance and energy mines 
petroleum resources. Recently the energy mines committee folded 
its work into the governance committee.
<P>
	An important step in building our understanding of third party 
interests was the development of interest  papers by each of the five 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17410"> 17410 </A></B>
<P>
sectoral committees. I say a step because issues will evolve and be 
addressed over the course of negotiations.
<P>
	Knowing the interests of third parties is a gradual approach but it 
has a clear objective. We want treaties that work and address the 
interests and needs of all participants in the economy.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	In the year and a half I have been on TNAC I saw great 
improvement in communication and much better understanding of 
these complicated issues and better co-operation. In addition, the 
Government of British Columbia with which we are co-operating 
very well organizes province wide monthly advisory meetings 
which are reaching all British Columbians. It is a shame that such 
intolerance is being promoted by some people in B.C. who do not 
seem to want to solve the problems.
<P>
	I will identify a few of the interests common to all parties in the 
process. Certainty and economic stability were essential. Effective 
local and regional advisory processes were essential. Access to 
land base for all economic and non-economic interests was 
essential. The continuation of government authority in areas of 
resource management was imperative to successfully concluding 
practical and affordable land claims settlements.
<P>
	Both governments have taken these interest papers seriously. As 
we work through the development of specific negotiating mandates 
the advice TNAC has provided through these papers will be 
considered, assessed and integrated wherever possible. Through 
the consultation process and eventually through Parliament the 
government will be held accountable for how it has used the advice 
of third parties.
<P>
	Now the Reform Party seems obsessed by secrecy even when it 
no longer exists. In September 1994 I presented to TNAC the 
minister's position on the openness of the consultation process. 
The minister accepted the concerns of TNAC members that a 
confidentiality restriction overly limited their ability to seek advice 
and direction from their colleagues and organizations. Now the 
media is invited to all our meetings. That restriction has ended. 
TNAC members can and do fully discuss information provided by 
governments to TNAC members.
<P>
	The B.C. Treaty Commission in its annual reports has talked of 
the need to consult and for people to know what is going on in the 
treaty process. Perception can become reality. It only takes a 
willingness to request some written information because material 
is available.
<P>
	The chief commissioner, Alec Robertson, came to the September 
1995 TNAC meeting to report to members and hear their concerns 
about the treaty process. That is another important link in the treaty 
process. At this time 120 bands representing 79 per cent of First 
Nations are negotiating.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago in Sechelt I met the chief of the Sechelt 
Band who cheerfully told me how well his framework agreement 
negotiations are going. He expects conclusion by next August. The 
Sechelt Band was the fourth to sign a framework agreement, the 
first step of the negotiating process. I was in Sechelt in August for 
the signing of the agreement and there was a real celebration.
<P>
	At the centre is the need to negotiate workable, effective and 
affordable treaties. Unless those treaties are surrounded and 
supported by a strong consultation process which provides for a 
frank and open exchange of information, advice and interest, the 
objective of publicly supported treaties will be difficult to achieve.
<P>
	Consultation is important. The government takes the views of 
Canadians seriously. We want to ensure our policies and their 
implementation are sensitive to the advice and interests of 
communities, people and interests which might be affected.
<P>
	We have to work together, all of us, and through dialogue we can 
eventually give our aboriginal people the tools necessary to 
become self-sufficient. For too long they were deprived of their 
integrity and pride. Their children must be strengthened and the 
people of the new generation must be able to find a place in society 
that makes them proud of themselves.
<P>
	I am pleased to have contributed factual information to the 
debate today. Consultations are essential to ensuring that 
negotiations can be successfully completed. I hope the opposition 
will soon join this consultation exercise. We could all come out as 
winners.
<P>
	I conclude with a comment I made in the House on October 19:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This country can simply not afford to lose another generation of aboriginal 
people able and willing to make a contribution to this country. The young 
aboriginal people of today can be our professionals, our trades people, our 
inventors of tomorrow. They represent our past and our future. If we lose them it 
will be an incredible waste.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I ask hon. members to vote down this unfair motion brought 
forth by the third party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to rise today to speak in favour of 
Reform's motion on the subject of B.C. land claims.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	I have been listening to the preprinted, standard run of the mill, 
say the right thing style of speeches emanating from members 
opposite. Frankly, anyone in touch with the feelings of B.C. can see 
straight through the facade of the Liberal political correctness 
going on.
<P>
	The hon. members for Vancouver Centre and Vancouver East 
spouted exactly the line we would expect from old line politicians 
completely out of touch with  reality. I have no doubt whatsoever 
that the speeches of any other Liberal B.C. members are equally as 
irrelevant. They must have some sort of big sausage machine 
upstairs. They turn the handle and crank out all this meaningless 
stuff.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17411"> 17411 </A></B>
<P>
	Last Tuesday in Vancouver radio talk show host Rafe Mair read 
out the names of the six Liberal MPs from B.C. three times. He 
emphasized the voters of B.C. have to remember the six names. He 
said: ``Remember exactly how out of touch these people are with 
the voters of B.C.''.
<P>
	Even the hon. member for Richmond, who had a meeting in his 
riding last Saturday, supposedly to get the feelings of his 
constituents on the issues, told his voters he would vote against 
their wishes and that he put their interests after the Liberal Party of 
Canada. He insulted his own constituents. This is typical of the 
attitude we hear on issues such as land claims and unity. If it does 
not fit into the Liberal Party agenda, Liberal members are not 
interested in hearing what the people have to say.
<P>
	We can see the same pattern of debate in the motion before us 
today. Instead of coming to the House with meaningful speeches 
about the concerns of British Columbians, government members 
have read from canned speeches prepared by their political masters 
who live and work thousands of kilometres away from the 
problems of the native land claims of B.C.
<P>
	Some government members whose ridings are also thousands of 
kilometres away from B.C. have claimed or implied that Reform 
members are meanspirited or that we have some inappropriate 
motive for bringing this motion before the House. That is 
balderdash.
<P>
	Here is some important news for government members. The 
Reform member for Beaver River taught and lived on an Indian 
reservation before she became an MP. The leader of the Reform 
Party worked for Indian bands as a consultant for a number of years 
before he was elected. The Reform member for Yorkton-Melville 
has taught on an Indian reservation. The Indian affairs critic for the 
Reform Party is married to a status Indian.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, anytime you hear someone say we are not in touch 
with the problems, the injustices or the difficulties with Indian land 
claims, please tell them they are wrong. We probably have more 
experience and knowledge about the problems than the entire 
Liberal caucus, certainly a lot more than the minister.
<P>
	There are large Indian reservations in my riding. I have lived 
there since 1979. I have had plenty of opportunity to listen to and 
understand the concerns of both natives and non-natives in my 
riding.
<P>
	A government member earlier today quoted from Mr. Hume, an 
editorialist with the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>. He quoted Mr. Hume as if he 
were some sort of expert on B.C. opinion. He fell right into a trap. 
The people of B.C. watching today will laugh. Mr. Hume does not 
represent  the ideas of the people of B.C. Mr. Hume has a special 
interest of his own and his rantings have no relevance whatsoever 
to the opinions of B.C. voters. He regularly criticizes Reform, but 
if his rantings had any relevance we would not have 32 Reform 
MPs from B.C. He is completely out of touch, just like the 
government members.
<P>
	It would be much more productive if government members 
would abandon their politically correct position, their canned 
speeches and their closed minds and listened to what we have to 
say as the true representatives of B.C.
<P>
	It is not just us; both opposition parties in B.C. have made it 
clear the whole land claims deal is going off the track as B.C. 
approaches the next provincial election.
<P>
	Government members should stop for a moment to say to 
themselves: ``Maybe these B.C. MPs are trying to tell us something 
important. Maybe I should stop and listen. Maybe I should trust the 
majority from B.C. telling me there is something wrong here''. 
Maybe they would just say that they should support what we are 
trying to do here, which is to prevent a terrible disaster from 
happening if things are rushed through on the eve of a provincial 
election.
<P>
	What a treat it would be if government members would abandon 
their party lines just for one day and help us with a major problem 
in our province. It is a problem which they cannot understand 
because they do not have the unique set of circumstances in their 
province that we are experiencing in B.C.
<P>
	Allow me to repeat the text of the motion before us today so that 
members can hear again our deep concern for the problems we 
have to face. We want the federal government to hold off making 
any treaties in haste on the eve of the provincial election because 
there is so much uncertainty surrounding the B.C. government. 
Everybody has heard of the bingo scandal. The government that is 
there right now might make some very unwise decisions. Our 
motion really does not call for too much. It just says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House urge the government to not enter into any binding trilateral 
aboriginal treaty or land claim agreements in B.C. in the last year of the current 
provincial government mandate in order to respect the views of British 
Columbians on this issue as expressed by both major provincial opposition 
parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is not too much to ask. I urge hon. members to please 
support us this one time.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-337, an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act (warning on 
alcoholic beverage containers) be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, beverage alcohol is the only consumer 
product in Canada known to cause harm if misused that does not 
alert the consumer to this fact.
<P>
	What are the consequences in Canada due to the misuse of 
alcohol? Based on the most recent data  available from Health 
Canada, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse and from the 
Addiction Research Foundation, the facts are as follows: 38,261 
psychiatric and general hospital admissions; 17,080 cases of 
alcohol dependence syndrome; 966 cases of toxic poisoning; 
19,163 deaths directly or indirectly caused by alcohol misuse; 10 
per cent of all neoplasms or tumours; 5 per cent of all diseases of 
the circulatory system; 15 per cent of all diseases of the respiratory 
system; 5 per cent of all fetal defects; 45 per cent of all motor 
vehicle accidents; 48 per cent of all drivers killed in accidents are 
killed as a result of alcohol consumption, which means that 2,000 
have been killed and over 10,000 injured in only one year; 40 per 
cent of all accidental falls; 30 per cent of accidents due to fire; 30 
per cent of all suicides; 60 per cent of all homicides; 50 per cent of 
incidents of family violence and one in six divorces are all caused 
by alcohol consumption.
<P>
	It is indeed tragic that one in ten deaths in Canada, or the deaths 
of about 19,000 Canadians are from alcohol related causes each 
year. All of this is due to the irresponsible use of alcoholic 
beverages. It is costing Canada an estimated $15 billion each year 
in higher health, social, justice and lost productivity costs, not to 
mention the devastating impact on family, friends and society as a 
whole.
<P>
	I know the effect that this can have on a family. My own father 
abused alcohol most of his adult life, but we are not afraid of him 
anymore. Years ago following one of his violent rages, he lost 
touch with reality and is living out the rest of his life in a home. I 
have not seen my father for more than 10 years because he no 
longer could recognize who I was. Today he has a new family: three 
bottles of vodka, one for each meal.
<P>
	Bill C-337 seeks to require that containers of all alcoholic 
beverages sold in Canada display the following message: 
Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs a person's ability to 
operate machinery or an automobile and may cause health 
problems or cause birth defects during pregnancy.
<P>
	There are many reasons that we should have health warning 
labels on alcoholic beverages. The costs and other impacts of the 
irresponsible use of alcohol are far too great to ignore. At a time 
when all governments are seeking to reduce the costs of health, 
social, justice and lost productivity, we need to pursue, and I stress 
preventative, rather than remedial strategies. We need to let the 
consumers know that health experts recognize the hazards of 
alcohol use. We need to inform consumers about the risks of 
alcohol use.
<P>
	Failure to label alcohol when medical drugs, foods, cleaners, 
solvents and other dangerous products all carry health warnings 
falsely assures consumers that alcoholic beverages are safe at all 
times. All levels of governments and the alcoholic beverage 
industry itself have a social, moral and societal responsibility to 
reduce the misuse of  alcohol. Labelling is a reaffirmation in the 
ability of consumers to make responsible decisions. Labelling will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17413"> 17413 </A></B>
<P>
also promote consumer consistency and indeed will lead to changes 
in drinking behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	Labels in themselves are an integral part of any comprehensive 
strategy to promote the responsible use of alcoholic beverages. 
Any prevention program would be incomplete without these health 
warnings. In the words of Denny Boyd, columnist for the 
<I>Vancouver Sun:</I> ``The intended purpose of warning labels on 
alcoholic containers is to act as a consumer lighthouse sending a 
signal of impending danger''.
<P>
	Labels represent an efficient way to continually remind 
consumers of the need to drink responsibly. As one element of our 
overall preventative strategy, it could be implemented quickly and 
efficiently with the potential of reaching all consumers and with a 
repeated effect.
<P>
	I will take a moment to talk about fetal alcohol syndrome. All 
Canadians are well familiar with the problems associated with 
drinking and driving and that is due to the relentless education of 
consumers. But there is another problem virtually unknown yet far 
more tragic. It is called fetal alcohol syndrome, otherwise known 
as FAS.
<P>
	In 1992 there was a study called ``Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, A 
Preventable Tragedy'' produced by the House of Commons 
standing committee on health and welfare. The report states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is no question that maternal alcohol consumption can have devastating 
impacts on the fetus. The basic fact is that when a pregnant woman drinks, her 
unborn child drinks also; that is, the alcohol in the mother's bloodstream 
circulates through the placenta into the bloodstream of the fetus. It is possible 
the blood alcohol level in the fetus will remain at an elevated level for a longer 
period than that of the mother because the immature fetal liver metabolizes the 
alcohol more slowly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Research shows that 5 per cent of all fetal defects are due to 
alcohol consumption during pregnancy. According to Health 
Canada, FAS occurs in about one in 500 live births. Therefore, it is 
in fact more prevalent than Down's Syndrome which occurs in 
about one in 600 live births. FAS children can reflect the following: 
severe neurological disorders, social dysfunction, permanent 
behavioural problems, reduced lifespan, restricted brain 
development, learning disorders, hyperactivity, mental retardation, 
pre and post natal growth retardation, speech and vision 
impairment and physical deformities.
<P>
	In addition to retarded growth, FAS children usually display 
facial distortions, including a small head, small close-set eyes, 
flattened cheekbones, a very thin upper lip and no groove between 
the upper lip and nose.
<P>
	FAS is estimated to cost $1.5 million during the lifetime of an 
FAS child. FAS is estimated to cost Canadians $2.7 billion each 
year in terms of increased health, special education and social 
services costs.
<P>
	There is another aspect to this. Fetal alcohol effects or FAE is 
very similar to FAS, with the same range of problems in a less 
severe form, but without the characteristic facial abnormalities. 
FAE occurs two to three times more frequently than does FAS.
<P>
	With regard to the alcohol industry, there is little dispute in the 
medical profession that alcohol consumption during pregnancy can 
have harmful effects to the fetus. The message they are trying to get 
out is that there is no recommended safe level of alcohol 
consumption during pregnancy and that drinking during pregnancy 
can cause alcohol related birth defects, including FAS and FAE. 
Both these diseases are totally preventable. I want to repeat that, 
both FAS and FAE are totally preventable. In the words of the 
alcohol beverage industry itself, drinking responsibly could mean 
not drinking at all.
<P>
	As part of my research, I took the opportunity to speak with 
representatives of the Association of Canadian Distillers, the 
Brewers Association of Canada and the Canadian Wine Institute. I 
found that their position was very close.
<P>
	They all support and promote responsible use of their products, 
to their credit. Industry representatives also note that alcohol has 
been shown to have health benefits in certain circumstances. I was 
given examples of programs they already fund and which they felt 
had better value in terms of the effectiveness of warning labels. 
They express concern however that warning labels may alarm 
pregnant women who may have consumed some alcohol and that 
the resulting fear or stress would result in consequential and 
negative health problems or even miscarriage.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	They all held the same view that they did not think that warning 
labels would work and that there was no evidence that could prove 
that they would work.
<P>
	Finally, they all specifically stated that they would not 
voluntarily comply with any recommendation to have warning 
labels on the containers of alcoholic beverages. Indeed they said it 
would have to be legislated.
<P>
	The industry's position is clear. It fundamentally rests on the 
argument that health warning labels will not work. I believe this 
argument is fundamentally flawed primarily because the proof of 
effectiveness is indeed in the precedents of Canada, the U.S. and 
the entire world. Warning or caution labels directly on the 
packaging of products have been used for years for virtually every 
potentially harmful product except alcoholic beverages. Research 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17414"> 17414 </A></B>
<P>
and long term monitoring have proven the effectiveness time and 
time again. That is why this  element of every preventative strategy 
continues to be used today. Why? Simply because it works.
<P>
	This is the common sense and practical reasoning. It appears that 
the industry insists on empirical evidence which it says does not 
exist. In fact the evidence does exist.
<P>
	In 1988 the U.S. government passed legislation requiring health 
warning labels to be placed on the containers of alcoholic 
beverages. Implemented in 1989, a series of studies have been 
conducted to detect the impacts on knowledge, attitude and 
behavioural changes. Although early studies showed little effects, 
as the years went by literally dozens of research studies have 
started to show progressively improving results. Here are some 
examples:
<P>
	In December 1993 the <I>Journal of Public Policy and </I><I>Marketing</I> in 
a report on public attitudes toward alcohol control since the 
warning labels were mandated in 1988 said: ``It is concluded that 
the label is serving the goal set out for it, to inform the public of the 
hazards associated with alcohol consumption''.
<P>
	In 1993-94 the <I>International Quarterly of Community Health 
Education</I> in a report on the awareness and knowledge of alcohol 
beverage warning labels among homeless persons stated: ``Age and 
level of alcohol consumption were each associated with label 
awareness and content familiarity suggesting that alcohol beverage 
warning labels may be reaching homeless persons''.
<P>
	The final example comes from the March 1994 International 
Conference on the Reduction of Drug Related Harm. In the 
research paper ``Mandated Container Warnings as an Alcohol 
Related Harm Reduction Policy'' it finds: ``Within the U.S. results 
indicate an association between seeing the label and displaying 
behaviours relevant to limited drunk driving. Limited drinking 
before driving, 68 per cent, was associated with seeing the label in 
the last 12 months; limited driving after drinking was even more 
significantly associated''.
<P>
	The evidence is mounting and very powerful. That is why the 
U.S. started to use warning labels in 1989. That is why indeed in 
Canada, the Yukon and Northwest Territories started to use warning 
labels in 1991. That is why 77.5 per cent of Canadians surveyed by 
the Addiction Research Foundation in 1994 said they would 
support health warning labels on alcohol beverage containers. 
Why? Because Canadians know that warning labels work.
<P>
	This initiative of having health warning labels on the containers 
of alcoholic beverages is not a recent subject in Canada. It was first 
raised in 1976 by the then Minister of Health, the hon. Marc 
Lalonde. In 1992, as I mentioned earlier the House of Commons 
standing committee on health and welfare recommended warning 
labels to the government.
<P>
	How do current legislators feel? On May 23, 1995 the B.C. 
Minister of Health wrote the following to the federal Minister of 
Health: ``I am writing to you in regards to alcohol warning labels. 
This was a topic of our discussion at the provincial, territorial 
ministers of health meeting held in Vancouver April 10 and 11, 
1995. There was unanimous agreement that warning labels should 
be pursued by the federal government''.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	I repeat, the provincial ministers of health unanimously agreed 
that warning labels should be pursued by the federal government. 
In addition, the federal Minister of Health has clearly stated her 
strong support for health warning labels for the containers of 
alcoholic beverages.
<P>
	The alcoholic beverage industry feels the consumer has the 
burden of proof that health warning labels work. I believe the 
burden of proof that they do not work must fall on the industry. If it 
cannot provide that burden of proof, then today I call on the 
industry to discharge its social, moral and business responsibility 
and voluntarily comply with this labelling recommendation.
<P>
	Bill C-337 is the first piece of legislation on warning labels that 
has ever reached this point in our legislative system. The bill no 
longer belongs to me. It now belongs to all the members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	We cannot afford to miss the opportunity to do the right thing. I 
humbly ask for members' support to pass Bill C-337 today at 
second reading so that we may more rigorously pursue the facts 
through public hearings before the Standing Committee on Health. 
In this way, members of Parliament who are not in the cabinet can 
once again demonstrate to Canadians that we can and do make a 
positive contribution to the well-being of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak in this House to Bill C-337, which amends 
the Food and Drugs Act. This bill, tabled by my colleague for 
Mississauga South, is aimed at warning pregnant women and the 
public at large about the health risks involved in the consumption 
of alcohol. It also serves to draw attention to the fact that alcohol 
consumption reduces a person's ability to operate machinery or an 
automobile.
<P>
	We agree with the principle behind this bill. It is now 
recognized, even by the manufacturers of alcoholic beverages, that 
alcohol abuse can lead to a variety of health problems, impair an 
individual's faculties and limit their ability to perform certain tasks 
requiring concentration.
<P>
	In recent years, society has recognized the danger of impaired 
driving. This awareness has caused lawmakers to strengthen 
legislation covering driving while impaired  and to provide harsher 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17415"> 17415 </A></B>
<P>
penalties for offenders. Governments have run public awareness 
campaigns with the participation of the manufacturers and 
distributers of alcoholic beverages.
<P>
	People are also increasingly aware of the risks inherent in the 
operation of machinery or equipment following the consumption of 
alcohol. Excessive alcohol consumption over long periods may 
also cause health problems.
<P>
	According to the Addiction Research Foundation, alcohol is 
involved in 19,000 deaths a year through heart and liver disease, 
certain forms of cancer, suicide and traffic or other types of 
accidents.
<P>
	Excessive alcohol consumption also plays a part in vandalism, 
acts of violence and family problems. The use of alcohol 
consumption as an extenuating circumstance in the courts recently 
led to Parliament's legislating against self-inflicted intoxication as 
an excuse for illegal behaviour.
<P>
	This said, we cannot generalize and say that alcohol is 
responsible for all of society's ills.
<P>
	Most of the members of this House doubtless take a drink in 
moderation from time to time and enjoy it. It is not the 
consumption of alcohol that is dangerous or harmful, it is the abuse 
of it.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	According to recent studies, limited consumption of alcohol may 
even be beneficial to certain individuals, particularly those who 
may be candidates for coronary or circulatory problems. I am not 
trying to say that alcohol consumption is totally beneficial, but I 
would like to point out that the alcohol problems we often hear 
about are primarily the result of abuse and over consumption.
<P>
	The sole exception applies to pregnant women. Recent studies 
on foetal alcohol syndrome have shown that even moderate 
consumption of alcohol may involve risk to the foetus, by altering 
the breathing of the foetus and reducing the flow of blood to its 
brain.
<P>
	Negative effects observed after birth include lower birth weight 
and delays in the child's physical and mental development.
<P>
	We have just listed many reasons for warning the public against 
the various problems that may be caused by or related to alcohol 
consumption. What form should the warning take? Will the bill 
before us be a solution or a step in the right direction? Should other 
ways be developed as well to warn people about the effects of 
alcohol abuse?
<P>
	Currently there are a number of advertising campaigns aimed at 
increasing public awareness. In Quebec, for instance, the campaign 
against drinking and driving has been successful to some extent in 
reducing the number of automobile accidents related to alcohol 
consumption. The Société des alcools du Québec launched a 
campaign  under the now well known slogan ``La modération a 
bien meilleur goût'', a phrase that has become very popular. During 
the holiday season, some companies include in their advertising a 
warning to their customers to drink with moderation.
<P>
	In addition to the examples I just mentioned, many other ways to 
increase public awareness have been suggested by various 
intervenors in the business of selling alcohol. For instance, some 
licensed establishments now stock non-alcoholic beverages and list 
these on the menu. Some municipalities may consider posting 
warnings, in establishments that serve alcohol, against the 
potentially harmful effects on the foetus of consumption of alcohol 
during pregnancy.
<P>
	Recently, there has been a trend towards more emphasis on 
providing information through health professionals. For instance, 
urging physicians who treat pregnant women to stress the harmful 
effects of alcohol during pregnancy. Social workers are also being 
asked to increase the public's awareness of the potential effects of 
drinking alcoholic beverages.
<P>
	Briefly, we must be aware of the important role of prevention, 
education and other forms of social intervention in making the 
public aware of problems that may be related to alcohol 
consumption.
<P>
	We should also consider the practical aspect. First of all, we 
would have to estimate the additional cost to producers and 
distributors and see whether it would penalize smaller producers, 
especially the micro-breweries and brewers of local beers which 
are a recent development.
<P>
	It would also be necessary to find out if this measure would 
make the industry less competitive or violate international free 
trade agreements signed by Canada.
<P>
	Of course the money aspect should not cause us to forget our 
main concern which remains the health of Canadians. However, 
before implementing a labelling directive like the one provided in 
the bill, we must be certain this kind of measure would be effective.
<P>
	Of course, as is often the case, where public health is concerned, 
it is difficult to argue against the merits of virtue, and that is why 
we welcome the bill proposed by the hon. member for Mississauga 
South.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in speaking 
today on Bill C-337, I would like to start by telling a story about 
Johnny. Johnny was a little fellow who was adopted into a family. 
This family had enough resources to take on Johnny's 
responsibilities. They welcomed him with love and care into their 
home. He had come from a family that had some problems, a 
broken family.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17416"> 17416 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	As Johnny grew he was different from the natural children in this 
family. His growth was somewhat stunted. He was smaller than the 
other kids. They thought perhaps it was heredity. When he was old 
enough to start learning things he seemed to fall behind the other 
children in the home. He was a very active boy. He had a very 
strange habit in that he could climb the door frame right to top of 
the door. He got himself into most peculiar spots in the home. He 
would climb up on top of the cupboards.
<P>
	As he got a little older Johnny was hard to control in the sense 
that he would run away from home and the family would have the 
police out looking for him. He could be gone for three or four hours 
and be impossible to find. One day he left home, crawled into a 
camper down the laneway and found some matches. He built a little 
bonfire in the camper and lit the camper on fire. This was a 
neighbour's camper, a most unpopular item.
<P>
	Johnny loved wildlife. When he was outdoors he was extremely 
interested in the frogs, the turtles and the insects. He was really 
happy when he was outdoors.
<P>
	I am going through his life now. As he got older and became a 
young teenager it was quite obvious Johnny did not have the mental 
capabilities of a normal teen. He was stuck somewhere back in 
preschool in terms of his educational capabilities. He became 
somewhat aggressive and difficult to handle. He ended up having to 
become a ward of the government, a ward of the province in which 
he lived. He had to leave the home that had provided him with love 
and attention. He had to be looked after by other individuals.
<P>
	Johnny is now old enough to recognize that he will never hold a 
productive job. He will always be a responsibility of the 
government, a responsibility of the province, a responsibility of the 
individuals who care for him.
<P>
	It turns out that Johnny's natural mom drank heavily. Johnny was 
a victim of fetal alcohol syndrome. His mom had so many 
problems that her life was not complete without alcohol so she 
drank heavily. Johnny has an incurable problem. His life is 
completely affected by that early childhood, the time when he was 
in the womb.
<P>
	Fetal alcohol syndrome is totally preventable. Early 
development with alcohol presents birth defects, retardation, 
hyperactivity, all the things we saw in Johnny. It is totally 
preventable. All we need to do is make certain that young moms 
and even older moms when they are pregnant do not drink heavily.
<P>
	I would like to compare fetal alcohol syndrome to German 
measles, rubella. How do we treat German measles? We inoculate 
all women who will become pregnant or could become pregnant. 
We warn pregnant moms during the first trimester of their 
pregnancy not to come in contact with German measles. We do 
rubella  tests on them to make certain they have immunity to 
rubella. We educate and in the instance of rubella we do not have to 
legislate.
<P>
	Is legislation necessary in this instance? Bill C-337 calls for 
putting a warning label on all alcoholic beverages, a warning label 
that says that consumption of alcoholic beverages can impair a 
person's ability to operate machinery or an automobile and may 
cause health problems or birth defects during pregnancies. When 
should we legislate personal behaviour? When should we legislate 
what an individual may do in society? We should legislate when 
there is a third party who has no choice. In this case, with foetal 
alcohol syndrome, there is a third party with no choice. The infant 
in the womb has no choice. Legislation in this instance has merit.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I compare this issue to smoking in a public place. In an enclosed 
place where others are affected by the smoke of a smoker there is a 
place for legislation.
<P>
	Reformers generally want to have as small a government and the 
least intrusive legislation possible. However, in the case of foetal 
alcohol syndrome legislation may be warranted.
<P>
	Is this label the way to go? If I were thinking how best to warn 
women most likely to be affected by foetal alcohol syndrome I 
would not put a worded label on the bottle, I would put the profile 
of a pregnant woman on the bottle with a big red X across it. I 
would direct my efforts toward those women most likely to drink 
heavily, some of whom are illiterate. In many cases native women 
are affected by this problem. Some of them would not understand a 
worded label.
<P>
	How would I implement such a change? I would first say to the 
alcoholic beverage companies that legislation would not be 
necessary if they would comply voluntarily. There is a strong 
public sentiment for good corporate relationships. I challenge those 
companies to listen carefully to this debate. Legislation would not 
be necessary with the proper labelling for foetal alcohol syndrome 
on bottles. They have shown some willingness to comply by their 
anti-drinking and driving campaigns. It would be profoundly 
reasonable to comply on this campaign.
<P>
	This bill is some evidence that Parliament can co-operate. 
Reform members are quite keen to see health measures of a 
preventive nature promoted in Canada. Consequently we will 
support this bill to the committee stage at this level quite strongly. 
We are supporting it on my behalf because of my wish for little 
Johnny to be happy.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to have the 
opportunity to speak to this problem. I am also pleased that all 
three parties of the House agree on this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17417"> 17417 </A></B>
<P>
	For the last 15 years it has been an issue with which I have been 
involved as a physician, as an advocate for my patients and as a 
member of the British Columbia Medical Association lobbying to 
change public policy.
<P>
	Canadians from all walks of life in every region have been 
concerned over the years about alcohol consumption and especially 
about the abuse of alcohol, not only its effects on society but its 
effects on the health of individuals. Canadians have always looked 
to governments to reduce the risks associated with this drug.
<P>
	These concerns have taken various forms at different times. In 
the 1980s the major concern was drinking and driving. 
Governments have acted at the provincial level and at the federal 
level to take into consideration this issue. The companies that make 
and market alcohol have been fairly responsible with respect to 
drinking and driving. Together we have managed to see in this 
decade that the issue of drinking and driving has begun to take root 
in the minds of the public and in the minds of the young people who 
are the most affected.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	More recently the major alcohol related concern has shifted to 
foetal alcohol syndrome and foetal alcohol effect. A parliamentary 
committee reviewed this topic in great detail and came down with a 
large number of recommendations, not the least of which was 
labelling. This was a stakeholder conference. There were three 
conferences in a row. At the conference were makers and marketers 
of alcohol who basically had a sense of responsibility toward the 
issue, although they did not seem interested in going as far as the 
labelling issue.
<P>
	FAS is foetal alcohol syndrome, a medical diagnosis that refers 
to a set of alcohol related disabilities associated with the use of 
alcohol during pregnancy. It is used to describe a set of physical, 
mental and behavioural changes in young children who have been 
born with this syndrome.
<P>
	Exposure of the foetus to alcohol has a great deal of effect 
specifically on the foetal brain and brain tissue. It is because of this 
that we see foetal alcohol syndrome. Different levels of drinking 
can produce foetal alcohol syndrome. Lower levels of drinking can 
produce foetal alcohol effect, which is not as full blown a 
syndrome in that there are not usually physical disabilities 
associated with it, but the behavioural components are clear.
<P>
	There are some surveys and information now that are leading us 
to believe that a lot of people who exhibit anti-social behaviour, 
who have behavioural problems in school and who fill many of the 
jails in this country have foetal alcohol effect. We can curb this 
problem and stop it. It is preventable. One or three in every one 
thousand children in industrialized countries has foetal alcohol 
syndrome or foetal alcohol effect. This is a terrible issue that we 
must deal with.
<P>
	This is not the only thing I want to talk about because I do not 
want people to believe that here we are again hitting on any 
particular social enjoyment we all have. Alcohol is not, unlike 
tobacco, a dangerous drug if taken according to instructions. We 
now know there is a level of hazardous drinking that results in the 
acute effects we see in terms of drinking and driving or using 
machinery or acts of violence when one is acutely drunk. There is 
also a certain level of hazardous drinking if done over a period of 
time. It can lead to hypertension, cirrhosis of the liver and some 
alcohol induced psychosis in the long term.
<P>
	We are talking about a drug that has an effect on humans and on 
the health status of humans. It is time we did something about it, 
specifically because alcohol is such a socially acceptable drug and 
specifically because it is a substance we can use appropriately and 
enjoy in a way that is not dangerous, except of course with the one 
exception, when one is pregnant. A pregnant woman should not 
have any alcohol whatsoever.
<P>
	What we are talking about is a substance we could make safe. 
How do we make anything safe? When we buy antihistamines 
across the counter there is a warning not to drink alcohol while 
taking them; do not operate machinery. On a bottle of Draino there 
is a warning not to ingest it internally. We know certain things are 
hazardous when used inappropriately.
<P>
	Alcohol lends itself specifically to labelling because it is a way 
we can send a clear message that tells everyone they can use this 
substance in a safe way or in an unsafe way, and these are the 
unsafe ways. Warnings on products lead to their safe use. That is 
what we are talking about.
<P>
	Health Canada spends a great deal of money on programs for 
native people and the Inuit people especially, community based 
programs, to support parents and children who have FAS and FAE.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	We also have lots of programs that deal, as any healthy public 
policy should, with education and awareness because public 
awareness is the key. We cannot say someone is doing something 
wrong when they do not have any knowledge it is wrong. Therefore 
public awareness is the key and this is where labelling comes in.
<P>
	Labelling clearly says do and do not. It gives a clear, defined 
parameter within which to work in a safe way to use a substance as 
in the case of alcohol. While we see that there are a lot of remedial 
services and support programs, and while we are at the moment 
increasing awareness and doing education programs in the schools 
and in communities, working at all levels, federal governments, 
provincial governments and community based groups are all 
working hard to stop the abuse of alcohol and the inappropriate use 
of alcohol.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17418"> 17418 </A></B>
<P>
	We have not used one tool sitting in our little box of tools. Many 
people have said this will be expensive. I do not understand why 
this will be any more expensive because the alcohol industry, in 
order to export alcohol to the United States, must put a label that 
warns of the dangers of alcohol because labelling is mandatory 
in the United States. Yet we have on one side of a room a whole 
lot of bottles sitting there with no labels. People are are busy 
sticking labels on them just to send them across the border.
<P>
	Are the children in the United States any less important than our 
children? I say no. This is not a major burden we will be putting on 
the alcohol industry. It is an industry that has shown to be very 
supportive and very accountable in terms of how it deals with 
alcohol.
<P>
	I am pleased the member brought this to the fore because it is an 
opportunity for us to talk about this issue. Doubters say look at 
what happened with the tobacco industry. The Supreme Court ruled 
we should not ban advertising and sponsorship because we have not 
proven it will make a difference to youth. Whenever members talk 
to manufacturers and to advertising agencies they always say 
package labelling confers a great deal of information about the 
product, and that manufacturers use labels to send us many 
messages about the image of their product.
<P>
	If one wants to buy detergent it has to be the kind of detergent 
that speaks of grandma using it; a nice clean wash with sea breezes 
blowing through it, one that smells good with lemon and lime and 
all these things. We always use images to sell our product. Soup 
labels convey the down home quality. It is always something hearty 
and the sort of thing we were used to in the old days.
<P>
	We talk about cigarette manufacturers. They have brought this to 
a fine art. They are the most expert at turning a product. They talk 
about youth and vigour. They show how many friends one can 
make if one smokes. They show how socially acceptable one will 
be, how great at sport, how wonderful a lifestyle one will gain from 
smoking.
<P>
	What is crucial here is the recognition that in many areas no 
distinction can be drawn between the product as conceived by the 
maker and the packaging. The product and the packaging are 
almost the same. That is why manufacturers are often so very 
resistant to labelling or to putting anything on their product that 
says the product is not as good as it should be.
<P>
	I hope everyone here will support the bill. We support it very 
strongly at Health Canada. We believe if we are ever to prevent the 
preventable diseases that create a great deal of tragedy in our lives, 
this is one sure step. We are already half way there. We do it for the 
United States. Let us do it for Canada.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFNATIONALDEFENCE">DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on October 6, 1995 I asked the Minister of National 
Defence a question pertaining to the week of revelations at the 
Department of National Defence. During the week of revelations it 
had been discovered that senior officials at NDHQ altered docu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17419"> 17419 </A></B>
<P>
ments. The punishment: the department was instructed to 
investigate itself.
<P>
	Further evidence revealed that Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward 
destroyed evidence and obstructed justice. His punishment: he was 
promoted.
<P>
	Yet more evidence showed that Colonel Labbé uttered unlawful 
commands. His punishment: he was put in charge of the army staff 
college to teach leadership.
<P>
	In our parliamentary democracy we have what is called 
ministerial responsibility. It is the minister's responsibility to know 
what is going on in his department and to take responsibility for the 
actions of his subordinates.
<P>
	I pointed this out to the minister. I said that he must have had 
these events on file. I asked him why he waited so long to act.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence 
stood on behalf of the minister. He said that he was disappointed 
that I would dare to ask a question pertaining to ministerial 
responsibility. Then he told the House something that all Canadians 
have known for a long time, that the government was so terribly 
open it was opaque.
<P>
	According to <I>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</I>, seventh edition, 
opaque means not transmitting light, not transparent, obscure, 
obtuse and dull witted. I admire the parliamentary secretary's 
honesty. This is one instance where a member of the government 
was not obscure. I hope the Liberal whip was easy on him. He has 
been unforgiving with other Liberal members of Parliament who 
speak their minds.
<P>
	Being pleased with the parliamentary secretary's openness, I 
asked him if the actions revealed that week were considered 
examples of good leadership. Sadly the parliamentary secretary 
went back to normal Liberal tactics. His answer was obscure. He 
said he did not like the tenor of my question and that he personally 
had called for the Somalia inquiry while in opposition.
<P>
	This was all fine and good but he failed to answer the question 
that Canadians demanded to be answered. I then informed the 
parliamentary secretary that it was the Reform Party that called for 
an open inquiry. The parliamentary secretary would have been 
satisfied with a cloudy internal investigation. He did not protest the 
minister's attempts to make the inquiry opaque.
<P>
	Canadians are extremely dissatisfied with the mismanagement 
of the Minister of National Defence. Whether it is the evidence of 
cover-ups or the procurement of the minister's gold plated pens, 
Canadians are demanding change. Since our parliamentary system 
is based on ministerial responsibility, I asked the minister to resign.
<P>
	At this point the right hon. Prime Minister intervened. He talked 
about his personal support for our soldiers. This was not just 
opaque; it was pure balderdash.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has been in the House for 30 years. Where 
was he during unification? Where was he in 1969 when the budget 
reduced the army from 45,000 to 25,000 and the militia from 
24,000 to 13,500? Where was he during the civilianization of the 
armed forces? Where was he when the regimental system was 
under assault?
<P>
	He was a senior official in the Trudeau government on the 
military dismantlement team.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Regarding Lieutenant-Colonel Kenward and Colonel Labbé, the 
minister had these reports on file with respect to these events. I ask 
the parliamentary secretary again why the minister waited so long 
before he acted. Does the minister consider the actions of these 
senior officials to be examples of good leadership?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is very misguided in his attempts to 
discredit the minister and the government.
<P>
	Certainly members on this side of the House know that the 
platform of the third party has been to use specious and irrelevant 
petty arguments and half truths for partisan gains which really have 
nothing to do with the Canadian forces and the issue at hand.
<P>
	Let us look at the facts. It was a Liberal government that called 
for an inquiry. It was this government that ensured the inquiry 
would be public and open. At least the hon. member gave me credit 
for asking for it two and a half years ago.
<P>
	It was this government that encouraged people to come forward 
with the information and to go forward to the inquiry. It was this 
government that ensured that the Somalia inquiry was provided 
with complete and accurate information and that relevant 
documents were made available to the commission.
<P>
	Not all these actions have been easy. We could have been goaded 
into precipitous action. I will give one example. Where others may 
have been attempted to score political points, we stayed the course 
and waited for the Westray Mine decision so that justice would be 
done and done properly, without the possibility of it being undone 
later because of a technicality.
<P>
	That is one example. These actions point toward good 
leadership, integrity and willingness to get things done. Now is the 
time for the commission to do its work and we look forward to its 
recommendations.
<P>
	The Canadian forces have a long and proud heritage which we 
are not prepared to throw away, despite the antics from the other 
side of the House in the third party. I suggest the third party share 
the sentiment of all members on this side of the House, especially 
at a time when we have just embarked on a new program, the first  
<P>

<P>
in the history of peacekeeping. I hope they will continue to lend 
their support for Canadian forces abroad.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANWHEATBOARD">CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, a week ago, 
on November 30, I rose in the House to question the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food on a recommendation he had received 
from a senior executive officers committee that he had struck 
several months ago. It was looking at some of the ideas concerning 
ownership of hopper cars, the future role of the wheat board in 
allocating cars in the grain handling system in western Canada and 
other similar matters.
<P>
	I tried to make the point with the minister that the 
recommendation coming from that group was that farmers would 
be asked to pay an extra $1 per tonne to raise money to purchase 
between 12,000 and 13,000 hopper cars the federal government 
now owns. They have an assessed value of $400 million, but the 
proposal is that the railways each take half the cars for a sum of 
$100 million which they can raise by imposing an extra fee of a 
dollar per tonne on the farm sector for everything farmers ship. In 
the end, after having collected the extra money from farmers, the 
railways would own the cars.
<P>
	This seems to be the ultimate bad deal for farmers. If they are 
paying for the cars, why do they not end up owning them? This is 
something farmers are arguing. They think the senior executive 
officers have presented a proposal that is self-serving in the 
ultimate. We must remember that at least two of the people on the 
senior executive committee represent the two major railroads.
<P>
	The basic justice of the proposal is something I was arguing. The 
minister in his response said he had not made up his mind yet, but I 
should remember the senior executive officers recommended that 
there be a ceiling placed on freight increases, other than the $1 per 
tonne, for 10 years.
<P>
	I have listened to responses from farmers in western Canada to 
this remark. They are very quick to remember that it was a Liberal 
government approximately 97 years ago that promised the Crow 
rate in perpetuity, and that means forever in anybody's language. It 
lasted for 96 or 97 years.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The question the farmers have is a very good one. They are 
saying if perpetuity lasts 96 and 97 years, how long will 10 years 
last? The answer in coffee row is until the next budget.
<P>
	They will not buy that and I do not see why they should. It is 
incumbent on me as a member from out west to remind the minister 
that his credibility and the government's credibility on promises 
for grain rates and promises into future activities of the government 
or any future government is zero after what they have done to the 
Crow rate and other things considered to be part of  the 
constitution, almost, for Canadian farmers. That is not acceptable.
<P>
	What is acceptable is to put those 13,000 cars under the control 
of the wheat board, even if farmers have to pay for them. At least it 
would let them know they own them afterward and that their 
agency, the board, can control them.
<P>
	The board does an excellent job of distributing rolling stock. As I 
have pointed out, the ownership of rolling stock was thrust on them 
because of the railways' refusal in the 1970s when the current 
minister was assistant to Otto Lang. The railways simply refused to 
buy or rent rolling stock. Farmers and provincial and federal 
governments were forced to buy rolling stock to keep Canadian 
grain rolling.
<P>
	As I have said, the board has done an excellent job of using the 
rolling stock. It has extremely high turnaround times, meaning that 
a car is loaded, delivers its load and is returned to the country 
elevator system faster than any other grain cars in the system. I will 
give an example using comparable grains. Durum wheat makes 17 
turnarounds in a year using wheat board cars, compared to oats 
which are operated by the open market and only make 12 
turnarounds. This gives an idea of how much more efficiency there 
is under the board controlling those cars and of the savings that 
result both to farmers and to railroads from that activity.
<P>
	I recommend the government take very seriously turning these 
cars over to farmers. Yes, we will pay for them if we have to, but 
they should be left in the control of the wheat board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a working group 
of senior executive officers and farmer representatives in the 
western grains industry has arrived at a basic consensus about what 
should be done with respect to government owned hopper cars, car 
allocation procedures and the role of the Canadian Wheat Board in 
transportation.
<P>
	The report will be discussed at various farm organization 
meetings over the winter. Until farmers have had an opportunity to 
understand and comment on the recommendations, it would be 
premature to make a full or final decision with respect to the 
government's response to the report.
<P>
	The consensus achieved by this group is certainly remarkable in 
itself. Only a few years ago many people would have thought it 
would be impossible for such a consensus to be reached by such a 
divergent group. It is a package involving a balance of tough but 
creative compromises and it has to be looked at as a whole, as a 
package.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	The government will respond to this report in early 1996 and 
is proud of its record of consultation with stakeholders. This is 
the way we operate and this issue will be treated the same as all 
the others.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my NDP colleagues and I have been concerned for some 
time that the Liberal government would not do the right thing in 
responding to the fine work of the Standing Committee on 
Environment on the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	Since the release of the committee's report last June there have 
been numerous media reports about how the government would 
respond. There have also been fears expressed that the Minister of 
the Environment, who is said to be a supporter of the 
recommendations of the committee, is being pushed out of the 
decision making picture by the interests of the Minister of Industry 
and the Minister of Natural Resources who are said to oppose the 
same recommendations. In fact, some officials within the industry 
department said openly that the committee's proposals are a threat 
to the country's investment climate, costly to implement and 
grounded on shaky science.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	At the same time the Minister of Natural Resources, speaking in 
the House of Commons on the government's CEPA response in 
relation to concerns raised by the mining industry said: ``At this 
point I am willing to go on record that, working together, we will 
ensure a regulatory regime that supports the mining industry''.
<P>
	When we take those comments into account and add to the mix 
the fact that the government has blatantly ignored the committee's 
request, indeed Parliament's direction, that a response be provided 
within 150 days, it is easy to see why concerns about the 
government's ultimate intentions remain in the minds of all those 
who care about the future of the environmental regulatory process.
<P>
	Members of Parliament will remember that on November 21 I 
criticized the government for failing to table its response. The only 
answer I received was that the response would be coming within 
two weeks. It is 10 days later and we are still waiting.
<P>
	It is possible that the Minister of the Environment is having 
difficulty getting a favourable response through cabinet. This is the 
government's most important environmental decision to date.
<P>
	Few would argue that the 365 page committee report entitled 
``It's About Our Health'' with its 141 recommendations dealing 
with virtually every aspect of the federal government's role in the 
protection of Canada's environment is not significant.
<P>
	May I remind members and the public that is listening that the 
committee made recommendations for amendments in the areas of 
toxic substances assessment and pollution prevention, the 
assessment and regulation of biotechnology products, ocean 
dumping and coastal zone management, the role of First Nations in 
environmental protection, the ecosystem approach to 
environmental protection, environmental management within the 
federal government, public participation in federal environmental 
decision making and federal environmental law enforcement.
<P>
	In a recent article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> Paul Muldoon of the 
Canadian Environmental Law Association and Mark Winfield of 
the Canadian Institute for Environmental Law and Policy said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government's response will be a bell-wether indicator as to 
whether it will take its responsibilities regarding toxic substances and other 
aspects of environmental protection seriously.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Based on the weight of evidence known to date, the standing committee 
recommended that strong action is needed regarding the most toxic substances.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The departments opposing CEPA reform demand absolute proof of harm 
prior to any substantive action.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They are willing to roll the dice with the health of Canadians. The Liberal 
government must now decide whether it is prepared to do the same.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On October 24, concerned about the comments of the industry 
officials mentioned earlier, I asked the Minister of Industry if he 
was going to take the advice of those officials or would he welcome 
the opportunity to turn Canada into an international leader in green 
legislation as detailed in the impressive recommendations of the 
environment committee.
<P>
	I ask that question again tonight, in the hopes that the 
government is prepared to confirm its support and indicate to us 
when its response to the CEPA report can be expected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to thank the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake for his close interest in the CEPA 
review. He worked on the committee during the CEPA review. He 
has shown a continuing interest in it throughout the committee's 
deliberations and after the report was issued. It is very 
commendable that he has brought up this issue so that Canadians 
will be aware of the status of the government's response.
<P>
	I am sorry the response is late. The minister is in Vienna at the 
ozone layer convention, which occasioned a further delay. 
However, the response will be ready extremely soon.
<P>
	I can assure my colleague that the response will reflect, very 
honourably, on the recommendations and the  thrust of the report of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17422"> 17422 </A></B>
<P>
the standing committee and all the principles which have been put 
forward by the committee. The main program of the committee, as 
suggested in the report, will be reflected in the response.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	I can assure the member that the Minister of Industry, whose law 
promotes sustainable development, is very much on side in 
co-operating with the Minister of the Environment to ensure that 
the report reflects what is the preoccupation of Canadians toward 
sustainable development and the integration of the economy and 
the environment, including pollution prevention.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VIETNAM">VIETNAM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on October 4, 1995 I rose in the House to request the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs to use his good offices for the Government of 
Vietnam on behalf of nine religious, academic and cultural leaders 
under imprisonment in Vietnam and waiting retrial.
<P>
	I had this matter brought to my attention by members of our 
Vietnamese Canadian community in Vancouver and also in Ottawa 
and elsewhere. I had followed up with meetings with the 
Vietnamese ambassador in Ottawa, with communications with our 
Canadian ambassador in Hanoi and with written representations 
through our government and others.
<P>
	I was happy to be able to inform the House in a statement made 
on November 22, 1995 that the Vietnamese government had acted 
to release two of the religious and cultural leaders and that they had 
already left Vietnam and were now in North America.
<P>
	Canadian foreign policy in its golden era in the immediate 
post-war period developed and applied the skills of quiet 
diplomacy, involving patient but firm negotiations and never 
resorted to gunboat diplomacy 19th century style, which would 
have been beyond our military logistical capacities anyway.
<P>
	In the contemporary post-cold war era, when trade and 
commerce have replaced political military power as the basis of the 
world public order system, I would ask the minister how he can 
best continue to promote the development of democratic 
constitutionalism and the advancement of basic constitutional 
rights in our new neighbour countries of the Pacific rim.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the Vietnamese 
Canadian community across Canada is very appreciative that the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra raised this issue not only in the 
House of Commons but in other fora.
<P>
	As the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific stated during question 
period, Canada's position and our relationship with Vietnam is one 
of supporting engagement rather than isolation. This is in concert 
with the rest of the  international community. Having a dialogue on 
human rights remains an important part of our relationship.
<P>
	When the Minister of Foreign Affairs was in Hanoi in the middle 
of November, he raised human rights issues with his Vietnamese 
counterpart, Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. The secretary of state 
also raised his concerns about human rights in Vietnam during his 
visit to that country. Furthermore, he had a lengthy discussion 
about human rights with the Vietnam deputy prime minister during 
the latter's visit to Canada last year. We also maintain an ongoing 
dialogue through our embassy in Hanoi and with the Vietnamese 
embassy in Canada.
<P>
	Our policy is to speak honestly and forthrightly in appropriate 
multilateral fora such as the United Nations' third committee, 
which deals with questions of human rights.
<P>
	In his speech on Friday, December 1, Ambassador Bob Fowler 
mentioned Canadian concerns related to religious and political 
prisoners. In our judgment, maintaining a position of quiet 
diplomacy bilaterally while continuing to speak honestly in 
multilateral fora is more effective than a confrontational approach.
<P>
	We are pleased to see that two prisoners have already been 
released. I am certain that the hon. member's interventions at the 
ambassadorial and other levels went a long way toward this release.
<P>
	We hope our current policy and the hon. member's skills of quiet 
diplomacy will continue to have positive results.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALDEFENCE">NATIONAL DEFENCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to address a reply to my question from the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence. It is 
about how the government plans on tendering moving contracts in 
the future.
<P>
	Currently, only the four major Canadian van lines can bid on 
moving projects with DND. The others are given a chance to match 
the lowest bid. The successful bidder receives a volume bonus. 
Work is then farmed out to companies across the country.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	The government proposed to change this system, so that any 
company from any country would be allowed to bid and the lowest 
bidder would get all the work. That meant that DND would move 
toward a one bidder take all system that would create a monopoly 
in the moving business. It would destroy an industry of over 800 
companies across this nation and put thousands of people out of 
work.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17423"> 17423 </A></B>
<P>
	Now the government, thankfully, has changed its mind and is 
proposing another plan, where a moving company with the lowest 
bid will receive 40 per cent of the government's business. The next 
three lowest bidders will  receive proportionately less as long as 
they match the lowest price.
<P>
	The government currently works with something called GLAC, 
the government list of approved carriers. If you are not on that list, 
you are not eligible for government moving contracts. Under the 
new proposal, that list would be scrapped.
<P>
	The hundreds of independently owned and family owned moving 
companies that make up the moving industry provide quality 
service. They are on that GLAC list. They own the warehouses and 
the moving vans. They have invested millions of their own dollars 
in infrastructure.
<P>
	Last week, Randy Hoyt, president of the Hoyt's Group of 
Companies from Atlantic Canada, told the public accounts 
committee that the volume of government business available to 
each of the GLAC carriers has varied according to their track 
record. For poor quality, movers are removed from the list or 
suspended.
<P>
	This system is serving Canadian taxpayers well and is good for 
government employees and independent movers. Because they 
were assured a share of the volume, movers have invested in 
facilities and trained staff at locations in Canada where service 
would otherwise not be available. Atlantic Canada is a case in 
point. There are many towns where these companies have 
operations and so the public gets competitive quotes when they 
move.
<P>
	The government's new proposal will destroy this system and the 
benefits that go with it. It will also result in thousands of job losses.
<P>
	Ontario businessman Pat Baird told the public accounts 
committee that he wants to bid under the proposed new system. Mr. 
Baird has no trucks, no warehouses, no infrastructure. He has two 
to three employees and has no financial investment. He made 
misleading statements to the committee. He told the committee 
that if he wins the bid, he wants to use rail lines to move 
government employees. He forgot that we do not have rail lines in 
many parts of Atlantic Canada. He said that he has a joint venture 
with CN Rail and CN will be building 300 to 400 new 53-foot 
containers made up as moving vans. He also said that CN's 
investment was going to be $26 million.
<P>
	I have spoken to CN and according to CN it has a verbal 
agreement with Mr. Baird. If the bid is successful it is prepared to 
modify, not build new, but modify some old 48-foot containers, not 
build new 53-foot ones, as Mr. Baird said, at a cost of $4,000 to 
$5,000 each. According to CN, its commitment will only be $1.3 
million maximum, not $26 million as Mr. Baird has stated.
<P>
	These inaccuracies in Mr. Baird's testimony should serve as a 
warning. The proposed new tender process should be put on hold. I 
appeal to the parliamentary secretary and the minister to review 
this matter. It is a  serious matter. All I ask is to put it on hold and 
look at it because of these discrepancies and inaccuracies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the interdepartmental committee on household goods 
removal services, which I will call the IDC for short, recently 
conducted a review of the household goods removal service 
process. It had three goals when it did this.
<P>
	The first was to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of an 
admittedly overregulated arrangement with the industry. The 
second was to encourage the entry of new competitors into the 
process. Third was to secure greater savings through the 
application of economies of scale and consolidation of service.
<P>
	The committee reviewed the feasibility of using a single 
supplier, as the hon. member said, for its moving business. The 
committee's evaluation of the concept after meetings with 
parliamentarians and others in the business concluded that there 
was a potential for saving, but insufficient grounds exist at this 
time to introduce a major change in the process. The information 
was too soft and the risks were too high.
<P>
	The committee met with current contractors and other interested 
parties to seek industry feedback and to include their views in order 
to ensure that the process was open and transparent.
<P>
	A new approach to acquiring these services has been developed 
which represents strong potential for savings, addresses the 
concerns of the bureau of competition and moderates the 
implementation risks involved.
<P>
	The basic elements of the changes are: a one year competitive 
tender fully accessible by any interested party; the lowest bidder 
will receive 40 per cent of total government business, while the 
remaining compliant bidders, maximum of three more, would 
receive 25 per cent, 20 per cent and 15 per cent respectively; the 
lowest bidder's rate would be used; contractors would not have the 
right to refuse government moves; contractors rather than the 
government would determine the infrastructure requirements; and 
exclusivity rules would be rescinded whereby any carrier could 
align itself with another carrier, van line or government moves. 
These changes will take effect in April 1996.
<P>
	Finally, I want to assure the hon. member and this House that 
this government is committed to fairness in awarding government 
contracts while at the same time ensuring that the best possible 
value for the Canadian taxpayer exists. I assure her that her 
concerns will be taken into consideration.
<P>
