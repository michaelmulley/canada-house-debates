	Mr. Speaker,  I congratulate Richard B. Wright on his splendid achievement in winning the 2001 Giller Prize for his novel <i>Clara Callan</i>. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Clara Callan</i>, Mr. Wright's ninth novel, is a remarkable depression era story of two sisters from small town Ontario whose lives diverge radically during a period marked by social upheaval and the imminence of war.  As the jury remarked, Wright succeeds in “precisely evoking the Depression...while portraying Clara and her radio-actress sister with grace and wit”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time Richard Wright's work has received recognition.  His first novel, <i>The Age of  Longing</i>, was nominated for both the Giller Prize and the Governor General's Award.  With his recent retirement from a teaching position at Ridley College in St. Catharines we can hope to see more work flow from the pen of this prolific and talented Canadian writer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994 Jack Rabinovitch established this Canadian literary prize to celebrate Canada's best fiction writing and  to honour the memory of his late wife, literary journalist Doris Giller.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Government of Canada I congratulate Richard Wright for this achievement and wish him many productive years to come for the benefit of Canadian literature.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise in the House today in honour of Canada's  veterans. This is Veterans Week and as Canadian soldiers are once again shipping off to war it behooves us to honour and remember the proud tradition that they and our veterans represent. We do this because we cannot afford to ignore the very real and constant threats to our security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week should also serve as reminder to the government that failure to maintain our strong and proud military tradition is to fail not only our veterans but all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I humbly suggest that the best way to honour our veterans is to ensure they are well taken care of as they took care of us and  to respect their noble traditions by making the troops of today a priority.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is National Seniors Safety Week.  Many seniors are injured in their own homes.  Declining vision, hearing, sense of touch and smell are all part of the normal aging process, yet they can increase the risk of injury. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we age our bodies take longer to heal and recover, making injury prevention that much more important.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the news is not all bad.  Many of the injuries occurring in the home can be prevented.   Hazards just have to be recognized and the necessary precautions taken.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Safety Council is encouraging seniors to make their homes safer.  Its campaign “Good Living and Independence—That's the Ticket for Aging Canadians” includes public service announcements and ideas for improvement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All colleagues in the House can get help the message out.  Simple precautions in each of our homes would  help prevent injuries and improve our quality of life.  Indeed there is no place like home and all of us want to be as safe and injury free as possible.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever they were called on to fight oppression and tyranny they answered the call with courage and distinction. In two world wars, in Korea and in countless peacekeeping operations around the world, theirs is a legacy that we pledge never to forget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the world now at war with terrorism and with our servicemen and women once again being sent into harm's way it is more important than ever that we remember those who have stood on guard for us from the turn of the last century to the beginning of this one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year once again we will meet on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.  It is an act of allegiance that knows no limits of time.  It is an act of remembrance that we have pledged to honour.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, everyone but the government seems to know that Canada's border control measures are a farce. Yesterday we found out just how bad they really are when a number of people snuck into Canada through Halifax harbour despite supposedly stepped up and improved security measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ease with which stowaways walk away from ships is a serious concern. The government must drop the pretence and start taking border control and the security of Canadians seriously. The U.S. examines more than three times as many ship bound containers as we do  in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will the government start addressing the root causes of our lax border control policies by reinstating the port police and bringing our inspections of containers up to acceptable standards?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's deployment of 2,000 Canadian forces personnel in Operation Apollo includes the deployment of the naval frigate HMCS <i>Charlottetown</i>. The name Charlottetown holds special significance to all Canadians as it is the birthplace of this nation.

	Mr. Speaker, maritime softwood lumber producers are reeling from the impact the 12.6% anti-dumping duty will  have on the economy and their livelihoods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In situations reflected across this country, workers in the softwood lumber sector, already faced with hardships of an economic downturn, dare I say recession, are further curtailed by this unfair duty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is particularly unfair to Atlantic Canadians because, as Nova Scotia premier, John Hamm, has pointed out, the maritimes have always enjoyed unrestricted access to the U.S. market.  Now that has changed.  Not only are loggers affected, truckers, mill workers and others are all being negatively affected by this unfair duty, and all because of the political decision by this government not to defend Canada's interests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States is dependent on affordable, accessible Canadian softwood lumber for its construction industry.  Lumber companies from British Columbia to Nova Scotia have shown that they are fed up with the government's inaction.  When are Canadians going to see this government stand up for Canada's interests?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, when we ask it to intervene to put a stop to the dropping of fragmentation bombs on Afghanistan, the government simply says that there are always innocent victims in wartime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister heard this response frequently when he was promoting the Ottawa treaty to ban anti-personnel mines, and it has not stopped him from continuing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Prime Minister, an elder statesman, plan to use his influence fully on the international scene, as he did in the case of the Ottawa treaty to convince the coalition to stop using the fragmentation bombs? </p>

	Mr. Speaker, on a number of occasions, the minister of defence has said that these bombs are used against military targets and not against individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely different from anti-personnel mines.  The problem is a very different one and, at the moment, these bombs are permitted under international agreements.</p>

	So were anti-personnel mines, Mr. Speaker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the government says they are for use against military targets, according to the UN, Afghan children have been the victims of them.  I do not understand why the government remains insensitive.  Of course there are innocent victims, but there is no need to make sure there are.   Mustard gas, agent orange and chemical bombs have all been banned.  Fragmentation bombs should meet the same fate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realize that, at times in history, war is unavoidable, but will the Prime Minister not admit that we can always choose our weapons?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that Canada does pay attention to within the United Nations framework is the cleanup of any weaponry that is left. The whole point about anti-personnel landmines is that they are in the ground and they hurt people after the conflict is over.</p>

Then they are released and sent to the welfare office. However, 20% or more of them then disappear without a trace.</p>

	Just the opposite, Mr. Speaker. What I said is that what we wanted for the long term was free trade, precisely so as to avoid managed trade agreements.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, therefore, what we want in the short term, the medium term, and the long term.  We want  free trade in this area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I greatly appreciate the co-operation of the government of Quebec.  Yesterday,  I had the opportunity of holding discussions with their  minister responsible for forestry practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of British Columbia is making a magnificent contribution.  Never in the history of the softwood lumber issue has the Canadian team presented such a united front.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the Middle East last week the minister refused to condemn Hamas or Islamic Jihad for their terrorist activities or their attacks on civilians. Terrorism is a daily reality for the people of Israel. Sadly, last Sunday two students were killed and dozens of others were injured in another terrorist attack.

Terrorism does not speak to anybody.  It speaks only on behalf of the criminals that perpetrate it.  </p>

Last week the minister said that Hamas and Islamic Jihad attacks on non-combatants are equivalent to Israel's attempts to track down terrorists and kill them.  Yet that is exactly what the coalition of which Canada is a part is committed to doing. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every case the use of violence, particularly directed as I said in the Middle East against civilians, is unacceptable to achieve any objective, political or otherwise, and must be denounced and must be stopped.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we seek to have governments do in this region is to stop using those groups as a means of achieving political objectives. If there are political objectives to be attained, then they should be sought through the appropriate means.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning the records of the House.  I regret having to call to the attention of the Chair a very clear difference between the electronic videotapes of yesterday's question period and the version of <i>Hansard</i> now published on the Internet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Mr. Speaker, the accuracy and independence of <i>Hansard</i> is critical to the credibility of the Parliament of Canada. We all know that there can be minor corrections and interpretations to the printed record that is found in <i>Hansard</i> in order to reflect the intent of the person speaking. However, the case that I wish to point out to the Chair goes far beyond that purpose and in fact seeks to materially alter the substance of what was stated in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the hon. member for Halifax was asking a question on softwood lumber, a matter that is creating massive unemployment and economic havoc throughout Canada.  The Prime Minister chose to treat  this as an occasion to avoid the issue and made a joke.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his response to the second question by the hon. member for Halifax, <i>Hansard</i> now states that  the Prime Minister said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Mr. Speaker, some do not have long hair and shake it a lot, as is the case with the leader of the Conservative Party, who will be up soon.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to the electronic tapes of what the Prime Minister clearly said, which was as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Mr. Speaker, you know some don't have long hair and shake a lot, as is the case of the leader of the Conservative Party.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave it to Canadians to judge the appropriateness of the comment.  I would like to focus on what obviously took place in the aftermath as a whitewash of what appears in <i>Hansard</i>. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words attributed to the Prime Minister in <i>Hansard</i> are inaccurate. The Prime Minister chose to make a personal, unfounded and unprovoked attack on the right hon. member for Calgary Centre.  That is not reflected in <i>Hansard</i>.  It was deliberate and intentional action unworthy of the high office held by the right hon. member for Saint-Maurice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, rather than standing and admitting that he committed a tactical error in making a personal attack,  has tried to wiggle out of it by altering the printed record of the House. The Prime Minister had the floor, the cameras were on him and the record is clear; the video record is clear for everyone to see.  The Prime Minister cannot fudge this.  I need not remind the Speaker of the damage that results not only to personal reputations but to the collective reputation by personal attacks.  This is exacerbated by denials and deliberate cover-ups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogance toward the sanctity of the House records sullies this place and heightens cynicism toward parliament. The veracity and reliability of the official records of debate are at stake.  The editor of <i>Debates</i> should not be put in that position by the Prime Minister.  It is an abuse of officials by either the Prime Minister or those who act on his behalf.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House was collectively embarrassed yesterday and the Prime Minister or his office compounded this error by instructing <i>Hansard</i> to alter his own words. When the Prime Minister drops a clanger he should be man enough to admit it, not  try to fudge <i>Hansard</i>. Once again, public servants should not be asked to cover up what were lapses of judgment on the part of the Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I ask you to review both the written record and the electronic tapes that are available to determine if the accuracy reflected in the words of the Prime Minister appears in <i>Hansard</i>. In the meantime I hope the Prime Minister would put an end to this matter by simply standing up in the House himself and giving an apology.  He should not send a delegation to offer his apology, as he has done in the past. The Prime Minister owes an apology to a former prime minister, to the House of Commons, to the editor of <i>Hansard</i> and to the Canadian people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. Speaker for his indulgence in consideration of this matter.</p>

Don Boudria (Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, in fact there are really two points that were raised. I think the House is a little unclear as to what the hon. member is seeking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first of all raises the issue of the official record not being reflective of what was said.  Then he goes on to describe that in his view  the comments of the Prime Minister, which I think are taken out of context somewhat, were inappropriate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</b> It was inappropriate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Don Boudria:</b> I am not  debating that. If someone wants to say that the comments were inappropriate, I suppose that could have been invoked at the appropriate time but that is not the issue before the House.  It is whether the official record is accurate or not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of parliament are issued what is known as the blues, the informal   <i>Hansard</i>, in which they verify the accuracy of what is there. If that has not been  reflected accurately then we  could certainly  correct that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just been handed  a note from officials of the Prime Minister's Office in which I am informed that in fact no corrections of the blues were made yesterday.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have something to add which should be helpful to you when you deal with this issue. I faced this earlier in the week when I was speaking on a private member's bill to do with divorce.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned something about a family who would have been married earlier when I should have said divorced earlier.  The electronic record clearly says I used the word married instead of divorced, but I did not intend to say that and it makes no sense.  I was able to change the word by sending it to <i>Hansard</i> so at least those who would read it in the future could make sense of my intent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is where I want to be helpful.  I feel somewhat guilty about altering a record like that and yet it did not express what I intended to express.  I would like to suggest that the procedures be changed so that an editorial change could be put into <i>Hansard</i> in square brackets, clearly indicating that this is what the member intended to say but in fact did not, as a way of explanation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that way the record would be accurate and we would be able to communicate to future generations what we actually said.</p>

I will certainly look at the blues, at any changes made to them, and I will look at the video transcript of the proceedings, which of course we have heard repeated by the hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough, and   will get back to the House in due course.  I thank  hon. members for their contributions on this point.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to present two petitions from citizens of the Peterborough area who are concerned about kidney disease as a serious problem in Canada. These citizens would like to see the name of the Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes changed. This is our national institute which within the Canadian Institutes of Health Research is responsible for kidney research. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents know that it does fine work, but they believe that it would be better if its name included the word kidney because then  the public would understand what fine work it does. These citizens call upon parliament to encourage the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to explicitly include kidney research as one of the institutes in its system to be named the institute of kidney and urinary tract diseases.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the case in my constituency. One person died and another was seriously injured in a recent auto theft. Citizens feel that there is no deterrent through sentences handed down from the courts and that individuals found guilty of vehicular theft causing permanent bodily harm or ultimately death should receive the utmost penalty offered by the courts. </p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Bloc member for Drummond has moved a further amendment.  She has added the words “while improving the employment insurance system” to the motion and the amendment.  That is what we are dealing with today and I will add a few comments about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a man thing. We do not like to ask for directions.  We will drive around looking for a place. If we happen to find  it that is great and if we do not that is too bad.  I must confess that another  man thing has caught me a couple of times although now that I am in my mature years I am finally over it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a habit of driving my vehicle until the gasoline tank was almost empty.  This happened on several occasions. On probably three or four of these occasions my wife asked why I did not stop for gasoline.  We were going through a town which had service stations and the gauge said the tank was near empty.  I told my wife there was no problem and said we could get to the next town.  On three or four sad and, shall I say, emotional occasions I ended up walking for gasoline. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I say this  is that when we drive through a town where service stations are ready to serve and then get out into the country and run out of gas,  we have missed an important opportunity.  That is what I want to emphasize today.  The government in its budgetary practices of the last seven or eight years has missed a golden opportunity. I mean that in the truest sense of the word.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no better time to pay down debt and get our fiscal house in order than when times are fiscally good. They have been good in   the last four or five years.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister, the Prime Minister  and all other members of the government like to gloat and say they are the ones who were so great at managing the economic  and financial affairs of the country.  They say they have surpluses and have paid down the debt. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However they have dropped the ball big time on this issue, an issue we have heard about in the finance committee over and over again: the need to reduce our debt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important when times are good to get rid of the debt. However the Liberal government, while gloating that it has managed the financial affairs of the country so well, has failed miserably. It has  driven through town when fuel was available and  run out of gas in the country. How did that happen?</p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ask Mr. Average on the street whether we have less debt now than we did when the Liberals were first elected in 1993, most people would say yes, they have paid down a whole bunch of debt. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point something out for Canadians who happen to be listening on CPAC  or in the hope that the people in the press gallery will report it. When the Liberals took power in 1993 our net debt  was $508 billion. Under their watch the debt grew. Four years later in 1997 it reached a peak of $583 billion. In the last couple of years the Liberals have paid down a bit of it so our net debt is now down to $547 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my old teaching career coming out here but I wish I had an overhead so I could show this on a graph. The best I can do is make a picture.  The debt grew  until 1997. It has since come down a bit. However if we compare our situation now with our debt in 1993, we have a net debt which is $39 billion more than it was in 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have almost $40 billion more debt now than in 1993.  It would not have been possible for any government, no matter how well intentioned, to have stopped borrowing immediately on the day of election. I concede that. It would have taken two or three years for even a prudent government to stop borrowing. However the Liberals drove through town without filling up the tank. They failed to pay down the debt when we   had substantial surpluses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am miffed about this. When I look at the numbers, I am upset that the Liberals have paid down so little of the debt. By now it should have been down at least to what it was in 1993. It was achievable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting number threw itself at me when I looked at this. It so happens that our peak debt in 1997 went down by $36 billion to reach the level it is at now. I thank the Liberals. I praise them. I congratulate them for doing at least that. They have reduced the debt by $36 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do members know what number surprises me? During the same interval the amount of money the government took out of EI contributions minus what it  paid in EI happens to be $36 billion. The amount of money the government used to reduce the debt happens to be, to the nearest billion, the same as the amount it took  from employers and employees through excessive contributions to the EI fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy has been rolling. Income tax revenues are way up. Despite its highly effective communication skills the Liberal government has managed to spend all that extra money while taking EI money to apply to the debt. It should have done a great deal more. It should have reduced the debt substantially more than it did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing we ought not to forget. During this term of office the government has taken some $30 billion from the public servants pension fund  which it managed to spend. It did not apply it to the net debt. It managed to spend it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps not all of it belonged to the employees. I argued when the bill was in front of the House that it should have been shared because the employees contributed to it.  The taxpayers also ostensibly contributed via the government. However the government took all $30 billion.  Where is it now?  It is down the tube. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to what my colleague had to say.  I would remind him that in 1993, if I understood the way he couched his remarks, the government inherited a situation which is extraordinary when we think of it now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were taking in about $120 billion and spending $162 billion every year.  Every year a shortfall of $42 billion was stacked on to the debt, as the hon. member stated.  That is almost a billion dollars a week. However the momentum of that enormous debt is something the hon. member mentioned but did not give sufficient emphasis to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to paying down the debt, the member used the pleasant folksy analogy of driving his car.  I have great sympathy with him, particularly because when the price of gas was high I did exactly that.  I once ran out of gas 200 metres from a gas station because I hoped it would be cheaper somewhere else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another analogy of a family which finds itself in a home with an enormous mortgage.  It may be no fault of its own but for whatever reason  the family has an enormous mortgage and must decide what to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would all love to finally pay off our mortgages. I would love to. Perhaps the member has already done it. The family in this home discovers it must fix the roof.  The parents  must feed themselves and their children.  Their kids must go to school.  They need transportation.  They need to do a great variety of things in addition to paying down the mortgage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member says we should have paid down the debt.  What would the member have done?  Would he have starved the children, let the roof leak or given up personal transportation?  What would the hon. member have done to pay down the debt?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-64765"></A><a HREF="#Int-64768"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-64759"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the member's thoughtful question.  We would have done just what our plan suggested. I do not know if the hon. member remembers, but in 1993 our election platform included a plan to get rid of the deficit in three years.  Zero in three was the plan.  That is what the government happened to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our projections were more accurate than those of the finance minister.  At the time the government said it could not be done.  It said it was bad, anti-Canadian and so on.  Our plan was methodical.  We would have continued to meet the needs of Canadians in social areas just as the Liberals did when they adopted our plan and implemented it in three years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election was in the fall of 1993. That parliament started in the fall of 1994   and lasted three years until 1997.  During  that time the government did exactly what we would have done and what the hon. member has now suggested.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we would have done it differently from 1997 until now. That is what I was talking about.  A  great deal of surplus money was available.  All the government did was take money out of EI and pay it against the debt. It managed to spend all the rest. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is like a family with bills that exceed its income.  The budget was finally balanced and the government was earning more than it needed for all the necessities of life.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did it do?  Did it pay down its mortgage as rapidly as it could so it could manage it better when things turned tough?  No, it did not.  It found new ways to spend it.  The kid wants a TV in his room. Another kid wants new hubcaps for his car.  The government wasted the money on a bunch of frivolous things Canadians do not generally support.  As a result the money used to pay down the debt was about half what the government could have used.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have been back down to at least the debt level of 1993. We would not still have to pay, as we are paying this very day, some $40 billion a year on interest. That is a huge drain on government coffers. It prevents us from doing what we should be doing in terms of helping to fund education and health care. It prevents us from looking after the defence of our country, which is such an urgent matter these days.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is indeed  an honour and a privilege to rise in my place on behalf of the people of Renfrew--Nipissing--Pembroke to take part in this take note debate on the budget that will be presented later this year by the Minister of Finance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me say that while we are delighted, we in the official opposition are not surprised that the Minister of Finance has decided to now come forward with a budget document.  It has been very clear that since the opportunistic election call of November 27, 2000  the government has been pursuing a leaderless agenda.  It is obvious to Canadians  the agenda that has been set is the one being driven by the official opposition under the very able leadership of the Canadian Alliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Minister of Finance's party have been saying they are looking for suggestions, not just criticism of the government's lack of leadership.  While that demonstrates an ignorance of the role of the official opposition, I am pleased to make a number of suggestions for the Minister of Finance to follow through on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the government will only say what is necessary to get re-elected.  Remember the broken GST promise?  Let us face it, that is a credibility issue for the government.  Every day  the Liberal PC/DRC GST tax remains in place is a day which the Liberals demonstrate that they are no different from the PC rump that voters said enough is enough to. If the minister had ever truly wanted to demonstrate to the poor beleaguered small business owners who were turned into tax collectors by the government to collect this tax that there is a difference between this government and the last one, he would have cut the GST as promised in 1993.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister and his party campaigned on cutting the GST.  Well, Canadians all know about the campaign promises of that party and honesty in government, particularly when they look  at how the finance minister and his leader have shamelessly embraced the GST, the same tax about which they were so adamant that they would eliminate should they get into government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not ironic that even the Liberal government's big business friends, in this case the banks, are telling the government to cut the GST.  If the past is any indication, usually when the big banks talk, the government listens.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the past we in the official opposition have warned of the sellout of the government to big business at the expense of working Canadians, it will be interesting to see whether or not the minister listens to his big business friends. I am sure they expect something for all those political contributions to the party, and I suspect to his leadership campaign coffers as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicly the Minister of Finance is saying that he would resist any call for an expensive spending package and he is right in taking that position. That does not mean the government should not continue to make stimulative investments in our economy. Nor does it mean that the Minister of Finance should use the events of September 11 and the fact that our economy was already headed into a recession prior to September 11 to continue to avoid paying the federal government's fair share toward health care. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government may now cry that it does not have the money to properly pay for health care, but it is all a question of priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government had not spent $500 million,  $600 million,  $700 million, or whatever the figure is on its hated gun registry, that money could have been available for health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, if the government had not spent the $500 million or $600 million cancelling the PC helicopter contract, only to turn around and purchase the same helicopter for $700 million, that money would have been available for roads, clean water and quality health care with no need to raise taxes the way the finance minister has 63 times since 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to health care, the fact is that the government is spending less as a percentage of actual spending than it did six years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 14% of public health care expenditures, the federal government is a long way off from the 50:50 split that was the original agreement when the provinces and the federal government signed the Canada Health Act.  It remains $2 billion less than the 18% that the premier of Ontario is asking for on behalf of the province of Ontario and all other provinces that face the same crisis in health care funding.</p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding, due to health care funding cuts by the federal government, one of the local hospitals in the city of Pembroke was closed.  Now the remaining hospital, in its effort to provide quality community health care, has embarked on an ambitious expansion program. Is it fair to ask a community of 15,000 people to raise $8 million for health care service that city dwellers take for granted?  Obviously the government thinks its fair by its actions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now raising the funds locally for a CT scan, old technology.   We can only dream about an MRI.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister is well aware of the health care situation in Pembroke as he has two aunts who are locally in our care.  The minister should be able to show some compassion and help us to eliminate the two tier health care situation that we have and which is a reality for too many Canadians in rural Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario has done a reasonable job in tackling the chronic underfunding of health care by the federal government because in Ontario good health is a priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The down side of this is that while Ontario and the other provinces are forced by the federal government to allocate more and more of their revenues to pay for this underfunding, other areas of importance face cuts.  The decision by the federal government to not properly fund health care is having an undesired ripple effect on the people who depend on these services. The Minister of Finance needs to correct this imbalance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mother of four school age children, I know that Ontario's teachers are working hard to provide quality education for students.  Teachers tell me that we need to make more public education investments.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all a question of priorities. While the government always seems to have money for its pet projects of social engineering, the money never seems to be there for things like health care and education. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Renfrew--Nipissing--Pembroke we have a stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway which local residents refer to as the killer highway.  The federal government has sadly neglected infrastructure investments in things such as  highways.  The water tragedies in Walkerton, Ontario and North Battleford, Saskatchewan  mean the provinces need the funds to  make investments in clean water infrastructure and in the environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communities throughout my riding have been waiting on the federal government to make a decision with regard to the federal share of the Canada-Ontario infrastructure program, money that has already been announced.  There is a rumour among Ontario municipalities that since the government has already taken the credit in press announcements for this program, it intends to pull out and not provide any of the promised funding when the program was announced. I hope the Minister of Finance issues a press release with that announcement if that is going to be the case.  If not, get on with it.  Let the cash flow.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had representations from the town of Petawawa for its Trillium Four Seasons Trail project which is an excellent proposal with significant community backing.  The issue is one of safety. As well it provides local economic stimulus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The municipality of Bonnechere Valley is looking for funding to renovate the Eganville and area community arena building.  This building has been the focal point of community sports and cultural activity since 1950. It generally needs upgrades such as the ice-making equipment that dates back to 1968. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all the municipalities in my riding have submitted proposals for water and/or sewage project upgrades, including the towns of Deep River, Renfrew, Petawawa, Arnprior, Laurentian Hills and the city of Pembroke.  The townships of Whitewater Region, Madawaska Valley, Killaloe, Hagarty and Richards, South Algonquin, Admaston/Bromley, Sherwood, Jones and Burns and the municipality of Bonnechere Valley have also submitted proposals that would see upgrades to their water and/or sewage facilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The county of Renfrew and the township of South Algonquin are looking to repair bridges. The township of Brudenell, Lyndoch and Raglan wants to upgrade the fire hall.  The township of North Algona Wilberforce wants to construct a salt spill containment structure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion for  the Minister of Finance is to leave announcements already made in place and start funding the applications in this program.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next suggestion for the Minister of Finance that promises to pay substantial dividends to the Canadian economy now and in the years to come is the construction of the Canadian neutron facility in  Chalk River, Ontario.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents have been told for well over a year now that the project has been approved in principle by cabinet. We are still waiting for the necessary funds that were promised a year ago. This was a campaign promise  the minister's party made in the last election to the voters of Renfrew--Nipissing--Pembroke. The people of my riding are watching very closely to see whether or not the minister intends to keep his promise and provide the necessary funds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear the Minister of Finance will have some tough choices to make in his upcoming budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not spoken about funding the war on terrorism yet, which will require a substantial funding commitment from the federal government. Many of the suggestions being made are things that should have been done regardless of September 11, such as proper staffing and training for employees at all of Canada's border crossings. Maybe now after years and years of underfunding Canada's military, the Minister of Finance will provide--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, her speech last night on the softwood lumber debate was a good representation from the member, and I have one question which also relates to prebudget consultations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quoting from <i>Hansard</i>, page 7067. The member said: “Noted military historian Gwynne Dyer said recently in a speech in Pembroke that the price of free trade has been a loss of Canadian sovereignty”. I am wondering if this is something she agrees with since she quoted it. It seems to be contrary to the Alliance's position on free trade.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that quote was made in my speech last night to give an indication to Canadians what people out there are thinking.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member on the subject of health care. I heard her echoing the thoughts of the Ontario government that this was a problem caused by the federal government. I would like to suggest two facts and see what her answer is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, she may be aware that recently, just before the election, the federal government put an extra $23 billion over five years into health care. This year alone the increase for Ontario was $1.2 billion which was  100%  of the increase in Ontario government spending this year on health care. Effectively the federal government this year covered 100% of the increase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would have thought that governing was a question of choices. The Harris government chose to have major tax cuts long before it was into a surplus, when it still had big deficits. It is choosing to implement a corporate tax cut of $2.2 billion on January 1 next year. Surely it is equally or more the case that the problems it has  in health care are a function of its own rapacious tax cutting long before it got out of deficit.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-64783"></A><a HREF="#Int-64786"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-64780"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Cheryl Gallant: </b>

	Mr. Speaker,  with the accord by the provinces with respect to health care, even with that dedication of money, when the final phase is in place it will still be below the point of funding in 1993. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ontario government has done a fabulous job of putting money back into health care. In fact it has shored it up and put in even more than the amount of the federal shortfall. It did this by cutting taxes. Cutting taxes creates jobs. More jobs for people mean more revenue. More revenue means that there is funding for our necessary health care. It is our hope that the government will follow through with its promises and like the economic engines of Canada, Ontario and Alberta, it will continue to cut taxes to grow the economy.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on my previous question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that tax cuts can lead to stimulating the economy but I would also indicate that free trade can provide a vast number of jobs. It has been a good program, although the Liberals originally were against free trade. It was brought forward by a previous Conservative government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the member again about the comment she made last night. She said it was a voice being added to the debate. Does the member agree with the comment she made last night, that the price of free trade has been a  loss of Canadian sovereignty? Yes or no.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join in the prebudget debate.   I want to talk  not so much on how much money we should spend on science and research but on how we should spend some of the money in the budget on science and research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be splitting my time with the member for Stoney Creek.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the initiative of the hon. member for Bellechasse--Etchemins--Montmagny--L'Islet for the creation of a national science organization known as the Canadian academies of science.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want  to share with the House an overview of that proposal, its potential roles, operations, members and the assessment panel process which it would include.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sciences move to the centre of decision making in all walks of life, consideration must be given as to how Canada as a society keeps abreast of the impacts and implications of advances in those sciences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, national academies play a key role in fulfilling this function.  For some time there have been calls for the creation of a national science organization in Canada mandated to conduct independent assessments of the science underlying pressing issues and to provide a strong Canadian voice for the sciences, both nationally and internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands, Canada is one of only two G-7 countries without a recognized national science organization that fulfills these functions. The Royal Society of Canada has conducted assessments of science issues of public concern on an ad hoc basis but it has found that it is very difficult to conduct such assessments on a contract basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a standing capacity to deal with complex issues, Canada lacks the ability to keep pace with the impacts and implications of advances in the sciences. Furthermore, without an internationally recognized national science organization, it is very difficult for Canada to benefit from the excellent work carried out by foreign academies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2000,  representatives of Canadian science and science related organizations participated in a national round table to consider the creation of a national science organization here.  I was pleased to be part of that event.  It was a fascinating discussion and in the end we arrived at a consensus in principle on the need for an independent, multidisciplinary, national academy for the sciences and humanities to conduct assessments of the science underlying pressing issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February of this year the hon. member for Bellechasse--Etchemins--Montmagny--L'Islet, in his capacity as Secretary of State for Science, Research and Development, established a working group from a cross section of the round table participants.  The goal was to develop a proposal that would address the role, scope and funding of such an organization, and to seek a broad and diverse base of support for the Canadian academies of science within the Canadian stakeholder community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working group carried out extensive consultation with academe, science organizations, learned societies, non-governmental organizations, federal government external advisory committees and individuals. The proposal was posted on public websites and distributed to participants of the October round table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Targeted consultations were also conducted. The proposal was presented during  the  Standing Committee on Finance's prebudget consultations.  Overall the consultations were positive and identified a broad base of support for the establishment of a national science organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academies of science, through its mission, mandate, structure and operating processes, would be an independent, inclusive, impartial and objective organization that would operate in an open and transparent manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian academies of science would provide Canada with a voice on behalf of the full spectrum of the sciences defined to include natural science, engineering, health sciences, social sciences and the humanities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mission would be twofold:  to deliver credible, independent, expert assessments of the sciences underlying pressing issues; and to provide a Canadian voice on behalf of the sciences, both nationally and internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informed decisions in a knowledge based society rest on a foundation of independent, multidisciplinary assessments of the sciences.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a minimum, assessment establishes an extensive picture of complex issues and clarifies the lines of debate.  At its best, the assessment process builds a common base of understanding and establishes a consensus on the questions that remain to be answered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian academies of science would provide a critical public service by ensuring independent, unbiased expert assessments of the science underlying pressing issues.  These will be used to support informed decision making by the public, the government and other stakeholders, and to consider the impact of expanding knowledge on society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to distinguish between advice and assessment.  Advice makes recommendations concerning a course of action, whereas assessment is the step prior to advice that identifies the scientifically sound evidence with the objective of informing the deliberative process.  In a knowledge based economy, informed decisions rest on a foundation of independent, multi-disciplinary assessments of the sciences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National academies around the world have a long tradition of providing high quality, independent assessments.  An excellent example is the recent U.S. national academies’ assessment report on stem cells.  This report did not try to set policy but rather  strives to inform congress and the executive branch. The assessment panel has one goal: to establish the facts about stem cell research based on documented evidence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges and opportunities that arise from advances in science are increasingly international in scope.  Effective responses will increasingly require a collaborative approach that draws on the scientific and technological expertise in a number of countries.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with its member organizations, the Canadian academies of science will participate in joint activities with national academies around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our model uses an umbrella structure as called for during the October round table. The umbrella structure ensures the Canadian academies of science works with its member organizations to fulfill its mission and mandate.  It will synergize and complement the important contributions of its member organizations and other Canadian science organizations. In essence, it parallels the U.S. national research council structure and is similar to the governing structure now employed by Genome Canada.  At the same time, it is uniquely Canadian, as reflected in the inclusive nature of the board of governors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member organizations are, in effect, the shareholders of the Canadian academies of science. Close collaboration, including the ability to call upon the diverse membership and networks of the member organizations, is critical to the delivery of the  academies'  mandate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian academies of science would  be governed by an inclusive, diversified and balanced board of governors of 12 to 20 members.  Member organizations will appoint one half of the board members or two per organization. The balance of the board will be drawn from the general public.  Scientific credentials will not be a prerequisite for these members.  General public board members will be selected on the basis of their leadership within their communities and a demonstrated commitment to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board of governors will approve and direct the Canadian academies of science programs and administrative operations.  It will also actively develop and maintain linkages with equivalent international bodies in partnership with member organizations and other Canadian science organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the budget, it is estimated that the Canadian academies of science would  require an annual operating budget of $3.5 million.  As noted earlier, this is a consultative proposal.  To date we have received excellent feedback and I certainly applaud the efforts so far. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has invested heavily in science and technology.  To gain maximum benefit from those investments, we need to change the way we organize full spectrum science in the country.  The Canadian academies of science would do exactly that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure    to  have the  opportunity today to speak to the  prebudget debate and reflect on what I am hearing in my own constituency with respect to the upcoming budget and what types of things the constituents are looking for in this upcoming budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, constituents are asking the  government to take steps to ensure that our economy remains stable as a basic hypothesis.  However,  along with the funding of a security agenda, which is  a priority for Canadians, constituents are also asking the government to maintain a balance both financially and  in its approach.  This means that along with funding the security agenda, we must also  continue to invest some dollars in the areas of skills training and research and development which, going forward, would help to continue to build our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians  and certainly my constituents are looking to the  government to lay out some short term objectives and some medium term objectives, given the type of environment that we are in today.  It is very clear that the immediate or short term  objective is security,   meeting the security challenge and ensuring the security agenda is funded effectively.  This  means an increased investment in CSIS,  in the communications security establishment dealing with our policing, and in  the RCMP to ensure we  prevent the Canada-U.S. border from being held hostage by  terrorists as a result of the September 11 tragedy.  We must also  work with the international community to  bring terrorists to justice.  All those things involve money but constituents are calling for some increased investment in those areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what constituents want  is to have their confidence  and  hope restored as we move through this tragic time.  We can restore confidence by restoring the free flow of goods and  by pursuing an open and fair free trade with our largest trading partner, the United States of America. We can restore hope by investing in people and by  ensuring  people   have access to education and  to enhanced skills training.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that  stakeholders have an opportunity and a say in what kind of training is required in their particular sector.  We must help  apprentices who need to continue to improve themselves when they are engaged in training.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those types  of investments would send a signal that the government is  investing in Canadians so they can  improve their skills and continue to remain competitive, and improve  productivity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to continue to invest in research and development if Canada and its economy is  to continue to  grow and innovate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  heard directly from a representative of a university in my riding, McMaster University, who made it very clear that a challenge the  universities are facing with respect to research are the indirect costs of research.  I know  the finance committee, in its travels across the country,  heard that message.  We need to respond to that type of request.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care concerns  remain very high for the constituents of Stoney Creek.  We are committed as a government to the over $20 billion transfer to the provinces.  That type of stimulus is what is required as we move forward. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security, the concept of security, being able to protect ourselves from the threat of chaos, from the threat of terrorism, is the underpinning of a strong economy.  Knowing that we have open access to our largest trading partner is critical and  security is the key to ensuring  we have that open and free access.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, what are constituents saying in this period of prebudget consultation?  In my constituency they are saying that the major issue  this budget needs to address is the issue of borders.  It is border, border, border.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country we are dependent on trade: 87% of our trade is with  the United States and 25% of that trade comes back.  It is a two way flow of trade.  It is important that we have access. Not only do we need to do work in terms of the international trade area and  trade agreements such as softwood lumber, we have   a section 201 action on steel. These are issues that we need to resolve and  clearly we have a strong case.  As a government we cannot for one second hesitate in putting forward a strong Canadian position. I think we have done that and we will continue to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to make sure that we have access to the North American economy through a free and open border.  In fact I am told  that Ontario's trade with the United States of America  is equal to or greater than  United States trade with the European Union, just to give members the sense of  the size of  the trade between this province and the United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the border is the number one economic issue as we go forward.  We need more resources allocated along with a co-ordinated plan to co-operate with our largest trading partner.  We need to understand those challenges and respond to them and we need to collectively resolve the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved border infrastructure is required.  Highway infrastructure improvements are needed as we get access to those borders.  I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that you have a number of examples in northern Ontario with respect to highway infrastructure.  Let me give the House one example in southwestern Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told today that between Toronto and Miami there are 15 stoplights.  Thirteen of those stoplights are in Windsor.  As we access the border and emphasize the need to get our products to market in the most efficient way, 13 stoplights is not acceptable.   Along with dealing with the border infrastructure required as we respond to the security challenge and fund the security agenda, we must also ensure, in co-operation with the provinces, that we address the highway infrastructure improvements that are required,  again focusing on the need to improve that trade flow and ensure open access, ensuring that  our companies, those that  create  jobs for Canadians, can get their products to the United States of America as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, what are constituents saying?  They are saying that the government cannot abandon Canadians' hard won progress.  They are saying that the government must balance the budget, as it has,  must pay down the debt, as it has, and must reduce federal tax, as it has.   We cannot jeopardize the hard won progress Canadians have made in meeting those achievements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a government we should not  shy away from reallocating, and we  should be prepared  to reallocate from low priority to higher priority areas where we need to.  We should ensure that those high priority areas are clearly financed and properly financed.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what constituents are saying is this: absolutely no deficit financing.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the last member and in particular to his comments about the need for infrastructure.  He emphasized Ontario but   I have to reflect this  in terms of my own province of British Columbia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments in general have an excise tax on gas.  The Liberal government right now takes in about $1 billion a year in fuel taxes from my province of British Columbia and yet it  spends only about $200 million nationally on this highway infrastructure  the hon. member talked about.  If he thinks there are problems with highway infrastructure in Ontario, imagine the challenge we have in British Columbia with our highly mountainous terrain. B.C., being forestry dependent and having a lot of mining  product that goes south, needs a very good highway infrastructure and it is very expensive to maintain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made a comment about the infrastructure in Ontario,  what does he think about his government's policy of spending $200 million a year on the highway system nationally while extracting $1 billion from British Columbia alone?  B.C.  needs some of its  own money back so it can fix its highway infrastructure.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-64804"></A><a HREF="#Int-64806"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-64802"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Tony Valeri: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I certainly understand the hon. member's comment about the infrastructure in British Columbia. When I made reference to the challenges  in Ontario I did not do so to the exclusion of other parts of Canada. Clearly there are challenges right across the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point  I was making is that we need to ensure  a free and efficient flow of goods to our largest trading partner, and certainly there are border crossings in British Columbia that require improved infrastructure. I would fully support the point that we need to embark upon a much broader program and approach to a highway system or a national highway system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter brought up by the member with respect to the dollars spent versus the dollars  taken in by the federal government in terms of an excise tax, that really speaks to a formula for a directed tax whereby a certain amount of money  is allocated to a particular area of expenditure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a problem with directed taxes.  While I support the need for improvement in infrastructure, the problem   with directed taxes is that if we adopt a position of directing tax dollars  a number of envelopes  are set up right across the bureaucracy and when there is no longer a flow of money we must stop spending in those areas. If we were to find ourselves with a clear need for infrastructure and  excise tax dollars  that need to be directed actually drop for some reason, we would not have the capacity to find other money. I am much more in favour of recognizing that the area is a priority and that  collectively with the provinces we work to resolve it, ensuring that there is federal participation.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our finance critic, the member for  Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot, asked the Minister of Finance questions for weeks on end, even suggesting a plan of action to him, for the very purpose of ensuring that our economy remains stable, that it can get back on track in the wake of the events of September 11 and the recent crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about what his constituents wanted, but we learned very little, except perhaps regarding highway infrastructures.

	Mr. Speaker, certainly I want to respond to the hon. member's comment with respect to the call by the Bloc that the government should now somehow intervene and stimulate the economy in order to get us through this downturn. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also fair to say, and the hon. member should recognize this, that the $100 billion in tax cuts that was announced is now in the pipeline. The tax cuts are now hitting the economy as we move forward. The transfer of over $20 billion  to provinces is now  coming through the pipeline and that will  hit the economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop in interest rates will create an enormous amount of stimulus. A lot of stimulus will hit the economy as we move through this and it will improve the economy. Going forward, what workers in my constituency want is to ensure that they have the opportunity to work and that   their employment is secure.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-64810"></A><a HREF="#Int-64812"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-64808"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in the prebudget debate.  My colleague from Regina--Qu'Appelle spoke eloquently a few days ago in  debate and laid out the general approach on behalf of the New Democratic Party. However, I too want to add my concerns about the state of the economy and what is facing  low income Canadians in particular as we now move into the prebudget and into what  will unfold in a budget that will be before us very quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the member across the way talk  about the need for security. There is no question that the events of September 11 have heightened everybody's awareness about issues of security. I remember reading the headline in the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, “One billion dollars for security”. I guess that is just the early estimate of what these measures will cost us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking in this debate today, I also want to put forward, as many people are doing, the idea and the importance that security is more than border crossings, more than police enforcement and more than protection of our borders or airports. They are important security measures about which Canadians are very concerned, however, security can also mean other things, particularly in the lives of Canadians who are at the bottom of the economic system. We can talk about food security, housing security, income security and services or program security.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel very saddened when I look at previous budgets in the House and see that there has been very little emphasis and very little debate around that part of security and what it means to Canadians. As we approach the budget and  give our responses and concerns to the finance minister and the government, it is very important that  there be a full debate, with  diversity in the debate, so  that it does not just focus on almost a panic that sets in and a mindset that all money has to be funnelled into national security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a very great concern out in the public among various organizations, whether it is the Canadian Labour Congress, the Canadian Council on Social Development, the National Anti-Poverty Organization or the National Housing and Homelessness Network, all of which have done an immense amount of work. They are contributing to this debate by pointing out that after four years of massive surpluses, which  were actually created in large part by cutting back on our social programs,  created on the backs of poor people, we have to be very careful that we do not  move now into an era when low income poor people and disadvantaged people  will again suffer a disproportionate burden as we move into a budget that will possibly have a huge emphasis on national security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mail yesterday I received a very interesting report,  and maybe other members received it too, “The Third Annual Report on the Status of Inequality in Canada”, produced by the CSJ Foundation for Research and Education. The report is titled “When Markets Fail People, Exploring the widening gap between rich and poor in Canada”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin my remarks today by quoting from this report because to me it really sets out one of the fundamental issues  we are facing and yet I believe the government has miserably failed to deal with it. The report states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This report, When Markets Fail People, asserts that growing inequality is fundamentally tied to our market system and that, both in periods of recession and recovery, inequality between rich and poor has continued to grow. This is why income inequality is at its largest spread than at any point in the last generation...Years of neo-liberal policies have promised that the private market is the best solution to inequality and that (somehow) we can simply grow our way out of poverty.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report continues:</p>

	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The study reveals that market income improvements during economic booms are very sticky.  They accumulate at the top, flow somewhat to the top half of income earners, dribble down to the poorer half of the population and completely dry up before they reach the poorest 10% among us.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a stark conclusion and a sharp judgment on the economic policies of the Liberal government for the last decade.  We have seen the Liberal government  pushed from the right by the Reform Party, then the Alliance,  to deal with the deficit and  sink money into tax cuts that have not benefited the people in  society who are most at risk.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those tax cuts  lined the pockets of people who were already affluent and  wealthy.  They meant a few dollars for working people but they were dollars that were sucked out of essential services.  They were dollars that were sucked out of programs that could have established, for example, real accessible national child care programs or a national housing program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at a critical juncture in terms of making a decision and correctly analyzing what the impact has been of the market ideology as it is played out in the federal budget on all Canadians, but particularly Canadians who have  suffered in the last decade.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote further from the report  because it is such an excellent one.  An analysis was done by looking at other countries where different choices were made in terms of budgetary priorities and government spending.  It points out: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Societies with a narrow gap between rich and poor are characterized by increased quality of life, improved health and higher education levels. We must eliminate the undue bias that all our systems afford the wealthy--education, health, criminal and civil justice, immigration and politics.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I respect the work that is embodied in the report because it gives us a  message about what have been the failures  in the last decade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago there was an open letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Canada.  It was signed by about 100 prominent and progressive economists in the country.  I will not read the list of people who signed the letter, but it was co-ordinated by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, an organization  involved annually in developing  the alternative federal budget.  They applaud the Bank of Canada's recent interest rate cuts, but they also point out:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> We also strongly believe that these cuts are not, by themselves, sufficient. We therefore call on the government to enact a mix of appropriate spending and tax measures, with the emphasis on spending, that will produce the greatest fiscal stimulus to employment creation.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea of job creation and stimulating the economy is something that is critically important because  the number of people who have been unemployed has actually risen by about 60,000.  There is no question that  more people will be facing economic insecurity in the coming months and years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that one possible  policy instrument that people see emerging,  if the federal government chooses to make a progressive decision, is public investment in a national housing program.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an op-ed piece in the November 2 Toronto <i>Star</i> by Marcel Lauzière   and Andrew Jackson who are with the Canadian Council on Social Development.  They highlight and zero in on the incredible inequalities in  society in terms of the growing gap between  wealthy and poor.  They state:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent a few weeks  travelling across the country before and during the resumption of parliament.  I visited various urban centres: Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver.  I will be in Montreal tomorrow.  I even went as far as Iqaluit and Nunavut.     I spoke with people who were experiencing housing affordability problems.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number one priority of  every  place  I went to and every  group I met with was that we should try to convince the provincial or territorial government, but most important the federal government, to make an investment in social housing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent plea from both the labour movement and  the Canadian Council on Social Development that a significant federal investment in a national housing strategy would not only produce economic security and create tens of thousands of jobs but  would  deal with what is now characterized as a housing crisis. We are looking at more than two million Canadians who are facing severe housing problems.  This flows from either absolute homelessness and lack of shelter on the street,  in effect destitution, or people who are literally one paycheque away from being homeless, whose rents are so high that they do not have enough money to pay for food.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the government  not turn a blind eye to the idea that a major investment in social housing is something that would be good for our economy.  It  would create  jobs and  meet a real social need. Research that we have done  shows that if there were a one time $2 billion investment in social housing we would be able to produce 46,000 new jobs next year.  That would increase to 94,000 jobs in five years. The National Housing and Homelessness Network  stated that $2 billion could build between 30,000 and 40,000 social housing units.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's own agency, CMHC,  said that in terms of the demand and the needs that exist we need to produce about 30,000 to 40,000 units of affordable housing every year  just to keep pace with demand.  That kind of investment would create good union jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we were debating softwood lumber crisis.  I am from British Columbia.  I know full well  the impact on small communities and even on urban centres has been devastating as a result of the outrageous duties  placed on softwood lumber.  If the Government of Canada made a  decision to invest in housing, we could use our own resource to build affordable housing for Canadians.  There is yet another benefit in terms of the softwood lumber crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to CMHC each new housing unit creates between three and six full time jobs in total over a five year period. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities  argued and put forward some excellent documentation that over the next 10 years we need 20,000 new houses to be built yearly and 10,000 units to be rehabilitated annually. A program such as this would have a very positive effect on our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be introducing in the House of Commons a housing bill of rights.  I believe it is a basic fundamental right that people have security of shelter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's performance to date in this area has been very disappointing.  In the last Liberal red book a promise was made for about $680 million over four years.  There is concern that even that commitment will now drop off the table.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provincial and territorial housing ministers will be meeting  at the end of November.  There will be a lot of interest and examination of whether or not the federal government will at minimum be committed to that program, or whether it will heed the advice of organizations like the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the National Housing and Homelessness Network and look at the provision of an affordable housing strategy as something that can help people and  stimulate our economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  endorse that idea 100% and urge all Liberal members to look at that kind of plan, which would have a very positive effect both provincially and municipally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also  talk about other aspects of the budget the NDP view as very critical. One of those areas is infrastructure. We have a Liberal task force currently working its way across the country and looking at the need for urban infrastructure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am from the city of Vancouver where infrastructure is at risk from years of lack of funding.  It is critical to have a program of sound public investment in infrastructure, whether  it be water filtration upgrading or public transit. There is  strong support from Canadians for these  critical things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have been asked repeatedly in many polls whether they would prefer to have tax cuts or an investment in basic social infrastructure. Time and  again they choose social investment because they understand that the quality of local communities and the quality of life actually improve for all people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  is another significant area which should be a key priority for the government, not just in terms of dealing with  major problems in our urban environment but also as a way of  meeting our international commitments at  Kyoto  by financing and supporting public transit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not even think about the subsidization of private vehicle use and highways. It is not part of the balancing of or equating  how we direct public funds. There is massive subsidization of our highway system and  private automobile. When it comes to public transit, though, we do not see it on the same footing.  Yet the benefit of financing and supporting public transit is something that is far greater.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent a riding that is made up of a very diverse population. It is a working class riding. People put in a lot of time working at part time jobs. There is a great fear that with the new government in British Columbia  there will be a  program of attacks on poor and working people and an assault on various social programs. People will be looking to the federal government for leadership, relief and support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing on the agenda in British Columbia is a two tier minimum wage system, something that is completely outrageous. It is a program which would take money away from people working in minimum wage jobs.  It would make their lives  more difficult and make it  difficult for them to make ends meet every month. Gordon Campbell, the new premier, is considering a two tier minimum wage whereby some people would be making $6 an hour and some would get $8 an hour. I find this incredibly offensive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring that to the attention of the House because it is an example of where leadership is required by the federal government for strong investment in a program that would narrow the inequality gap in Canada. If we focus our sights on that and say that it is the true measure of security in our country, we will  produce a society that is healthier and more productive. I urge the government to consider the words of these organizations and look at the priorities they have put forward.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I  thank the hon. member for his question because I actually did not get a chance to go into other areas.  I am glad  he  raised this aspect of the federal budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he will  know that the New Democratic Party has been a political party that has always stood strong and firm on being part of the international community that meets its obligations in the international community.  While I do not have the figures in front of me, it is very disappointing that over a number of years Canada has  slipped  in its commitment to overseas development aid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the global situation now with the bombing in Afghanistan.  Clearly our party has unequivocally been opposed to that war.  We have said that it is critical that aid be increased for Afghanistan,  but also  for other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This again really gets to the issue of security.  Security is not just about military forces and people dealing with conflict.  Security is dealing with the conditions that create hopelessness, despair and poverty. Canada has had a good track record but that track record is now being tarnished.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the hon. member,   I believe there are members on the other side of the House who have strong support for international development and overseas development aid.  We in the New Democratic Party feel strongly about that too and believe that it should be an area that Canada  strengthens as part of a progressive commitment to the international community.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was leading up to the problems being experienced by our city with the closing of the Fruit of the Loom plant.  This has meant lost jobs for 650 women, on top of the hundreds of workers who lost theirs with the closing of Tripap a few years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, these workers are suffering because  a decision by Human Resources Development Canada, through its minister, was upheld, which is contrary to a unanimous recommendation by the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development relating to older workers and the return of POWA. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask my hon. colleague from Vancouver East what she thinks of the minister's attitude and the potential power of the Minister of Finance to remedy the situation by ensuring that his coming budget contains special allocations for dealing with this dramatic situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well to be concerned about security at our borders, but people are experiencing systematic insecurity.  There is no longer any bridge between employment insurance and social assistance.  There is a very noticeable gap, and workers aged 55 and over are totally overwhelmed and forced to dig into their own financial resources.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would certainly concur with the member.  New immigrants are particularly vulnerable in a marketplace where job loss can be very vague in terms of corporations that pull out of a community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a fairly sizeable garment industry in my  riding of Vancouver East.   It is a very competitive business.  I know  there are new immigrants who work very hard in these industries, yet they can be thrown out of work in an instant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the hon. member that the study done by the committee highlighted the issues facing older workers. There has been no response from the federal government in terms of an infrastructure or support for older workers to make sure they are not the first to be laid off when they still have family responsibilities or mortgage responsibilities.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been noted, the employment insurance system is a joke.  We are talking about older workers who may have paid into that system and have paid their  insurance for decades.  Yet when they become unemployed they may not be able to take advantage of it because the criteria have become so strict. I find that a real tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing in a budget is an opportunity to use public policy and use a budget to  deal with these inequities within our society.  We have to make sure that older workers,  new immigrant workers or people who are trying to get into the workforce  have a fair opportunity.  They have to have the proper kinds of support and programs for their families so that all people can prosper and benefit.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I know of the member's great interest in affordable housing.  I know she represents an inner city riding and she knows that I represent an urban rural riding.  We both have problems, often different problems, but real problems with affordable housing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment in parts of Canada there is already 24 hours of darkness, extreme cold and the people living there do not have affordable housing.  The people  simply lack housing.  I speak of Nunavut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These debates are an opportunity for us to think aloud.   Would the member think aloud for us with her thoughts about what we should do for Nunavut, where they simply lack houses but live in an incredibly severe environment?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish we had more time to speak about this.  I recently had the opportunity to go to Nunavut and visit Iqaluit.  I met with housing activists, as well as one of the government ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is quite correct.  The situation there is quite appalling.  I visited an emergency shelter and a number of public housing units. Every single person  I met  told me that they wanted to see a commitment from the federal government to a national housing strategy that would enable them to make housing a priority. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are willing to put money into it, but they need the support of the federal government.  I would say clearly to the member that he and I, along with other members of the House, should  do all we can to see that the next federal budget  makes housing a priority, so that the people of Nunavut are not out in the cold this winter.  This is something that obviously in that climate they cannot afford to do.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will make one brief comment, since I know I have only one minute left.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully share the hon. member's concerns about affordable  housing, and I agree with her suggestions on infrastructure and public transit in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social housing is, moreover, one of the primary concerns of the government of Quebec, which has just brought down a budget earmarking over $400 million for it.  This was a decision to which there was absolutely no opposition, and the people of Quebec are unanimously in favour.  It seems to me that this example could be followed by all of Canada.  The minister ought to be receptive to such suggestions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member also referred to international aid.  The motion the Bloc Quebecois managed to get passed last week addresses increasing the level of international assistance to a slighter higher percentage of GDP.  When one realizes that close to $12 billion is being spent on the Canadian forces, and not even $1 billion  on international aid, there is something wrong there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, as the hon. member said, that we would be better off intervening on the international level, helping populations out of poverty, than supporting military regimes with bombing attacks that are very much debatable.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to see that the government of Quebec has made a decision to reinvest in social housing.  When I travelled across the country I used to say that I was proud to be from British Columbia because, along with Quebec, those were the only two provinces investing in social housing. Regrettably now I have to say it is only Quebec because in B.C. provincial funds for social housing have been frozen. I applaud the fact that in Quebec there is still a commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the member would agree with me that, if we had a federal commitment as well, we would then have a program, not just in Quebec but in all provinces and in all urban centres in smaller communities.   This would be a significant, positive stimulus to our economy and result in the creation of good jobs, in many cases well paying union jobs.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this prebudget debate today. It is earlier than most of us expected.  We still want to make a point of trying to get some of the issues that matter, certainly to my riding of York West, on the record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of York West, which is the riding  I am proud to represent, clearly have stressed the importance of   living in a safe community. They understand the pressures on our budget and on the finance minister to put the investment into security, as all Canadians want, to ensure we have a safe and secure environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue in my riding clearly is housing.  There is an enormous need for that in part of  my community. Other issues include jobs, good hospitals and efficient transportation.  Seniors need more support such as home care programs and the like.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention  that I will be splitting my time with the member for Mississauga West.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone  with the task force across the country  to some of our large urban regions. The issues that have come forward  from all of them are that the communities are feeling under siege.  Our large urban regions have limited tax ability to continue to raise taxes.  People on the other end just cannot afford immense tax increases on their properties. They are feeling under siege. We look at them as being the jewels of our country; the large urban regions house about 80% of the population.  It is important that they stay competitive and that they do well.  They are very much looking to the federal government for help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that when things get rough, everybody seems to look to the father figure, the federal government, which is how they described it to me.  They are in enormous difficulties. They are looking to us to show some leadership and to help them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competitiveness of these large urban regions is critical to their growth and development.  It is not only locally;  they need to be doing well internationally.  We must stay focused on those issues.  We must look at what  the role is for the federal government, how  we can  best assist them and be a better partner in government.  They feel their quality of life is very much threatened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cities which were once spotlessly clean and very efficient with great transportation and transit systems are now embroiled in gridlock. There are enormous problems. There is the  frustration of being stuck on the road and not being able to get home at night, taking an hour to get home, and  the air quality which all of us are having to experience.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I am hearing from our regions, what is needed is an integrated transportation network much like what the Minister of Transport is currently looking at.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commuter rail is the responsibility of the federal government.  An integrated system within our transportation network would be an enormous help to these large urban regions.  We must keep in mind  that urban transit is a provincial responsibility, not a federal one.  The commuter rail is our role.  We are looking at working with municipalities on trying to enhance that role, whether it be light rail or  subways, enhanced VIA Rail or Go system, whatever happens to be out there that is of assistance to our municipalities to move on the gridlock issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue  that has been raised by one of our colleagues   in our round table discussions is the need for more affordable housing, both rental and home ownership.  There is an enormous need for that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need to attract skilled workers. We are an aging society.  A lot of the people that worked in construction came from other countries.  The need here in Canada is immense with the aging population we have currently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue was climate change and other related initiatives that need to be happening to deal with the Kyoto targets and how we can improve the air quality.  Much of that is  tied into transportation and how we might deal with that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brownfield sites which  in many cases are good sites for redevelopment in a variety of areas will not get redeveloped.  They will continue to stagnate in the state  they are unless they get serious help by changing the liability issues and allowing deductions for some of the cleanup costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise some of these issues so that hopefully, if the Minister of Finance cannot get them into this budget, he will give some consideration to getting them into another budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has a lot of brownfield sites and so do the provinces and municipalities.  If we could figure out how to deal with some of those liability issues, there would  be great opportunities for intensification in some of our neighbourhoods  to prevent some of the urban sprawl that is currently happening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal tools were mentioned a lot in our round table discussions as a way to stop tying the hands of the municipalities behind their backs.  Given the freedom and the responsibility, I am confident  they would not use those fiscal tools in any way that would hamper the opportunity to be competitive and continue to grow in the regions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my experience as a city councillor, before we are going to add on any more taxes, the first thing we do is look at the economic competitiveness of the region and how it will compare.  We look for the alternatives to ensure that our cities stay as competitive as  Montreal and Vancouver.  Of course now  we are dealing  with cities on an international level.  It is important to make sure that the cities stay very competitive.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health and education are very important. We need to have a well educated workforce. Our children need full opportunities to go to university and explore the avenues of tomorrow for themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities, and York University in my riding in particular,  do a fabulous job of opening the doors to a lot of programs for people who maybe would not have had a chance to go to university some years back. That happens  as a result of foundations and other programs that  offer opportunities to many young people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment in research is also an area, especially after  September 11. It shows just how important that is to us, when we deal with the kinds of scares we  have had in the last couple of weeks, that we continue to invest in areas of research that hold a cure for many of the problems in society  today.  A certain amount of investment is needed.  I am proud to say that our government has made it another one of its many high end priorities, to ensure that we get research money  in there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make choices as a government and I think we have made the right choices. The $100 billion tax cut,  which is the biggest tax cut in the history of Canada, is now coming into play at a time when we probably will need it more than ever. It is hoped we will be able to keep that money going into the economy. Our infrastructure programs are kicking into gear as well. That will help create the jobs and the opportunities that will certainly be needed in the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were choices that we made. We could have decided, as some of our colleagues on the other side have asked, to go for  massive tax cuts. Then we would have had to make other decisions. I am  confident  we have made the right decisions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Minister of Finance did  a fine job of putting those things in place prior to September 11, certainly not knowing what was coming. The layout of those programs and those tax cuts has  come at an appropriate time for all of us. We look at those tax cuts and we know that we put the incentives into our programs to continue going. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day our seniors want  confidence in the economy.  They want to know  that the health care system will continue to be funded in a fair and equitable way. As an example, approximately $8 billion in additional health funding is going into the province of Ontario. That is over and above what was previously indicated. The health care money is there in order to ensure that  seniors and other residents in my riding get the health care  they want.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish everyone good luck with the budget and ask that the issues of our urban regions stay front and centre as we deal with the pressures on our budget today.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, leading in to a question for the hon. member, I would like to comment on the previous speech by the member for  Vancouver East. I do not know if she was confused and got her facts backward but she said, and I assume she is referring to British Columbia, her province and mine, that there are subsidies for private motor vehicles and subsidies for the highways but unfortunately no subsidies for  public transportation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the exact opposite. Public transportation in British Columbia, particularly in the lower mainland in the area she is from in Vancouver, is heavily subsidized. On the price of gas alone that the private vehicles buy, there is an extra two cents a litre to help pay for that, so it is the exact opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes to a question I asked a government member earlier and I address it now to the member. We need a good highway infrastructure system  in order to get our economy working to travel  east and west within Canada and north and south across the border. We have a tremendous amount of cross-border traffic. We need a much better highway system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government  spends about $200 million per year on national highway infrastructure. In British Columbia alone it extracts $1 billion out of the province in fuel tax which was put on ostensibly as a highway tax to build and maintain our highway infrastructure. That is just the federal tax. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the hon. member what she thinks would be fair. Perhaps we could come up with some kind of system so that her government puts back some of the money so that we can spend it directly on the very sector it was taken from, the public transportation sector.  Then we could have better infrastructure in order to move the goods to create the wealth that pays the taxes that keeps the government going.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I can say that millions of dollars are currently being directed into British Columbia as they are to the other provinces. That money is on the table through our infrastructure programs for many issues on transportation, whether we are talking roads or rail transportation issues. It does not have to come specifically from a fuel tax as was indicated before. A dedicated tax ties the hands of what we can do with the money at the end of the day. Probably much more is going  back into British Columbia than is being paid in fuel tax.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for York West if she endorses the unanimous recommendation of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development regarding older workers who cannot benefit from a special program under the employment insurance program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the employment insurance fund is getting richer every year. We also know that there is a good reason for this: before the reform, 84% of those who were unemployed could collect EI benefits, compared to only 40% now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One does not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that surpluses in the EI fund are increasing rapidly every year. Therefore, will the hon. member make representations to the Minister of Finance and ask him to improve the situation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we said earlier, it is fine to talk about security, but the government should improve the situation of older workers, including women. As I said before, I have two files relating to this issue. First, there are the 650 women who work for Fruit of the Loom, including 150 who are aged 50 and over and whose situation is dramatic. Then, there is the case of the dozens of  men working for the Tripap company. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the hon. member make representations to the minister and ask him to improve the situation? </p>

	Mr. Speaker, on a recent visit to HRDC I was quite impressed to see the number of programs available  not just for young people  but for older workers as well.  These programs get them  retrained and into other programs.  I am quite happy to see what HRDC is doing. It is probably quite amazing for people who   went to unemployment insurance offices in the past.  Now the HRDC offices have  everything. Counselling officers conduct interviews and  help prepare resumés.  These counsellors  assess the skills of individuals and look at exactly where they can assist the most.  It is certainly very different and I applaud the current  HRDC initiative. </p>

	Mr. Speaker,   I wanted to  ask the member for York West, given her vast experience at the municipal level and a little experience that I have had at that end, how she sees the relationship unfolding between the various levels of government as we all wrestle with our budgets, not  just  post-September 11 but even before that, where we all try to figure out what  the role of government is as we look to providing services to our various constituencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect the member might have told me that clearly there is a role where the federal government, on a large scale basis, is responsible for setting and putting in place national guidelines and policies and for  transferring money directly to the provinces that in turn are  responsible to deliver certain services, such as health care and education, and   in turn they would transfer money down to the municipal level which  would also be responsible for delivering certain services to their constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really happening, in my view of the overall economic situation in government, is that certain governments, because of either political dogma or certain promises that have perhaps been made, disguising it as a common sense revolution in Ontario, have changed the way that governments are forced to do business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that in the province of Ontario the Mike Harris Conservative government was re-elected.  It has had two majority governments.  Obviously the people are voting for the Conservatives and we have to respect the democratic process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  what they have done in that period is fundamentally changed the way governments are able to do business, particularly at the municipal level.  They have downloaded the responsibility and taken away the money for so many programs. They have done it at the provincial level in Ontario and then, when the municipalities complain, they come to the realization that their only option is to go to the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transit is a classic example.   I spent eight years in the Ontario legislature.  In those days and before, the province of Ontario assumed the responsibility to fund 75% of transit expenses at the municipal level.  The other 25% came from the fare box or the tax base in a particular municipality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one had a municipality like mine in Mississauga, where the fare box would not generate enough revenue to cover that 25%, obviously one would come up with a shortfall.  However  when we analyze the nature of that community, one of the reasons that there is a shortfall in the fare box is  the dominance and the predominance of the automobile going into industrial parks built all around Pearson international airport and in the west end of Mississauga, the area  I represent. Those industrial and commercial areas generate substantial tax revenue.  They also generate substantial automobile traffic and very little traffic for a transit system to survive on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of that, it seems reasonable to me that a portion of the industrial commercial tax base in a municipality like mine could in fact be used to make up the shortfall in the 25% of the transit. The municipality was responsible for 25%, the province for 75%.  When the province bailed out, it got to the point, until just the last few weeks, where it was funding zero per cent  of transit costs.  That is a major download to a municipality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, it was funding zero per cent  not only for the Mississauga transits or the TTCs of this world, or the Ottawa transit system, it was funding zero per cent for the GO train system.</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does GO stand for?  It stands for government of Ontario. This  was a transit system, for goodness sakes, that was created by the province of Ontario as a fast rail commuter system to bring people into downtown Toronto and back home from the east and the west in the GTA.  The province bailed out of that entirely.  It is 100% gone so all the GTA municipalities had to get together.  They were not only trying to make up a shortfall in terms of their local transit systems but they were responsible for funding 100% of the Ontario government's transit system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when this occurs?   It has  a ripple effect.  The municipalities get together and say that they do not have anywhere to cut.  There is no level of government below the municipalities that can be cut.  What are they to do?  They have to take it away from other services or increase taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing taxes is not a very popular move, particularly in the last eight to ten years.  There has been tremendous effort and sacrifice made on the part of municipal governments to find ways to pare down their operations so that they can  deliver the kinds of services they need to deliver.   However, the reality is that when one drives  anywhere in the city of Toronto  almost a seamless rush hour exists from the east end to the west end where there is nothing but gridlock.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is there nothing but  gridlock, the gridlock is on roads that are in the worst shape that I can ever remember in my lifetime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highway 401 is a disgrace in the sense of the potholes, ruts and damage that large trucks have caused, in spite of the fact that the 407 was built by the province and  then sold and privatized.  It took that money but did  it put that back into maintenance or highway construction?  No, it did not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province made a choice.  However those government members were re-elected with a majority. This is their choice and their right in this democracy to do what they have done.  They decided to cut taxes, and that is fine.  We have done the same thing but  there is a difference. We cut taxes at the federal level by $100 billion, which comes into affect in this taxation year, after we had balanced the books.  The province of Ontario did not do that.  It actually sent out $200 of borrowed money in rebate cheques to everybody in the province.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people I know sent the money back  telling the provincial government  to use the money  to fix the roads, to deal with the garbage problems in communities, to build affordable housing or to help a single mother on welfare.  Instead, the government cut  welfare costs and have driven people off social assistance, some who perhaps should not have been there but many are winding up homeless and desperate as a result of the policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served with  Mike Harris for eight years, five years on the same side of the Ontario legislature in opposition to Bob Rae.  For five years Mike and I were on the same program.  We pretty much agreed, not necessarily on everything but on a lot of things. I say to Mike that he had a choice.  He should  not cry now when all of a sudden, as a result of a terrible tragedy like September 11, we find ourselves in an economic crisis in the country, and particularly in this province.  He should  not try to say it is all Ottawa's fault.  It does not hold water and it does not make sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We signed a health transfer accord with the province of Ontario  that generated $1.2 billion in increased funds to the province for health care.  How much do members think the province  increased its health care budget?  It increased it by  $1.2 billion this year.  I say good for the province.   It used the money  for health care the way it was intended.  It is the first time I have seen it do that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Ontario cannot have it both ways. Mr. Harris has to realize he had his choice and  he made his choice. He made his bed and, by God, he will  lie in it.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that was a most learned discourse.  It is absolutely unbelievable but I think  the hon. member  forgot in which House he was speaking.  I think he thought he was speaking in the provincial house.   I think   he finally  recognized that he was  in Ottawa and so he got turned around a little bit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member knows or should know that a tremendous amount of trade takes place between Canada and the United States.  In fact 85% of our export market goes across the border and   about 45% of that transfers across the border over three bridges in Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member waxed very eloquently about the condition of the roads but there is a lot more to it than that.  Not long ago I saw a presentation with a computer model showing  how  traffic could be re-routed through some of the border crossings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the hon. member would have the courage to talk to the Minister of Finance to make some provision in the budget that would actually create an opportunity for a re-routing of this transportation and to be sure that in fact this  could happen. That would eventually  result in a more efficient transportation system and actually reduce the amount of money required to do this.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a move on the part of the  member to help the finance minister figure out a way that would work better? That is my  first question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question has to do with the position of cities in our economy today.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I think the idea of whether or not we are able to re-route some traffic across our border  bears looking  into. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for a fact that there is currently a proposal from the private sector to buy the currently closed rail bridge that goes across at Niagara Falls.  The reason they want to buy that is to change it from rail to a road bridge and use it exclusively for trucks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member should believe me when I say that I know what House I am in and of the issues of which I speak.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Ontario has also proposed building a new highway that  would be partly alongside the Niagara escarpment and would be used primarily for trucks.  I think that makes a tremendous amount of sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the kinds of proposals in my view for which the provincial government should be knocking on our door to say that it  needs our help to do those things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need the federal-provincial agreement to be able to put together some new routes for our commercial goods so that we can then free up the opportunity for other flows of traffic like tourists and residents of both Canada and the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be happy to talk to the Minister of Finance.  The member should know that we have already have been talking to the Minister of Transport about many of these ideas.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  I gave the money to  charity instead because I would  be darned if I gave it back to Mike Harris so he could squander it on some other foolish project that might  get him re-elected.  Using taxpayer money to win votes is the most disgusting and despicable play of politics.  Harris is a master at it.

	Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to rise today to speak to the most important budget we have likely seen in a generation. I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Dewdney--Alouette.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 have dramatically transformed our country and the world in which it thrives. The priorities  parliament had set for Canadians and the direction we were to take as a country prior to the attacks have been changed  for the foreseeable future by tragic circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new age our priority has become the safety and security of our citizens in the face of a constant threat from terrorist forces. The budget we will see this December will be unlike any  we have seen since the end of the cold war. It will require a firm commitment to the programs and departments charged with the protection and defence of our nation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity for the government to reassure Canadians and our international allies is now at hand. The upcoming budget must serve as a bold reinforcement of the strong commitments we have made to the war against terrorism. In short, it is time for the government to put its money where its mouth is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have risen in the House on many occasions to condemn the repeated and senseless cuts to our nation's armed forces that have been made in the last decade. My colleagues in the Chamber will know  that when I say the time has come to reinvest in our nation's security it is not a new position brought on by the times but an ideal in which I have always believed and whose time has come.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing easier in times of war than saying  that one supports a strong military. What is far more difficult is making a financial commitment to building that military. I rise today as I have risen many times in the past to call on the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister to make a firm and focused investment in the Canadian armed forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the September 11 attacks those who called for increases in defence spending were called alarmists. It was said that in the post cold war world Canada had no need to maintain the kind of military force it had throughout the seventies and eighties. For this reason the Department of National Defence saw its budget cut from $12 billion in 1993-94 to $9.4 billion in the course of a few years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of the 1990s the government made clear to the nation that defence spending was a luxury which could be reduced as needed to fund other programs or as a means of reducing the deficit. It is only in the aftermath of the attacks on the United States that we are seeing how truly flawed the policy was. It is only now that we are seeing the devastating effects of the dramatic cuts on our military capabilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past several weeks and in the past few months before the summer break the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs has been investigating  the operational readiness of the Canadian forces. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can conclude what our findings were because we tabled them today. We came forward and said that we needed more money in the budget for the military. We need at least $1 billion but in reality we need a whole lot more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of the House will know, I have often spoken of the need to replace our aging Sea King helicopters. Hon. members will  also know that one of the most significant flaws in the government's procurement process is that contracts are awarded on the basis of the lowest price rather than the best value or, more important, the best product for our men and women.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think of this  my thoughts turn to a story related to me by a colleague who sits on the other side. The individual travelled to visit our peacekeepers and was shocked to see that soldiers returning to Canada were forced to give their combat boots to the soldiers arriving in theatre. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is shockingly similar to a story the House heard just under a year ago when a representative of the Royal Canadian Legion wrote of the disheartening conditions he witnessed when visiting our peacekeepers overseas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our government does  not give our men and women in uniform the very uniforms they volunteer to wear we have gone too far. When our military personnel see the government cutting corners and shortchanging them it is only natural that morale is low.</p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our military deserves the best equipment possible. When we make a capital expenditure  we should not do so on the basis of how much money we can save. When we buy combat boots and combat clothing we should order enough for everyone who needs them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly in the wake of the terrorist attacks the government continues to operate with the mindset that we should be cutting costs when it comes to our military. Last week it was confirmed that many of our armed forces reservists will see a 15% cut in their wages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inconceivable  that in a time of war any government, let alone a Canadian government, would give notice of its intention to cut the pay of those whose lives are being placed at risk. When I asked the minister to justify his decision, his answer served only to raise more questions. I would ask that my colleagues in the House notice the strange logic of the Minister of National Defence when he said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There is no approved pay reduction at all. Let me tell the House that the 21,000 reservists over the last three years have had very substantial pay increases, as have those in the regular force. There is a proposal that will involve some readjustment, some realignment. Some will get a reduction. Even more than that will get an increase.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said there was no approved pay reduction and then admitted there was. What is it? If some reservists are getting a reduction does it not mean a reduction has been approved?  If a majority of reservists  will be getting a pay increase, as the minister says, why would the increase require us to cut the pay of others?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than two months after the commitment was made the government repeatedly indicated that in light of the massive changes following September 11 our military would not be left in need of additional funding. Today the defence committee tabled an interim report which calls for increased funding and more resources for the military. It calls on us to help OCPEP and all the others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My remarks  today reflect my deep personal feelings on the issue. Our men and women in uniform cannot come to Parliament Hill, as so many others do, with placards to protest the injustices committed against them. Our Canadian armed forces personnel have never questioned their awesome duty to us. It is time we honoured them. The eyes of the nation will watch over the government when it brings down its December budget.</p>

	moved that Bill C-344, an act to amend the Contraventions Act and the Controlled Drug Substances Act (marijuana), be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  said: Mr. Speaker, I  thank my colleague from Kootenay—Okanagan Boundary for seconding Bill C-344.  Today I am going to give a discourse on how we can decrease and prevent drug use here in Canada, in North America and around the world.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill deals with the decriminalization of simple marijuana possession in contrast to legalization which I am opposed to. It is part of a three pronged approach.  The first is   decriminalization. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is a four point motion that deals with the international drug trade.  I would like to thank the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa for allowing me to accompany him on a very informative trip to Colombia to meet President Pastrana.  Out of that came a motion which  I will discuss later.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last part is  how we prevent drug use.  This involves the head start program. The House chose to pass my private member's motion on that issue in 1998. The program strengthens the parent-child bond and has been profoundly effective in decreasing drug use in children, not to mention   a 60% reduction in youth crime.  I will get back to that later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-344 calls for the decriminalization of simple possession of marijuana.  A person found to be in possession of marijuana would receive a fine of $200, $500 or $1,000 depending on whether it was their first, second or third offence.  They would not go into the court system.  They would not receive a criminal conviction and therefore they would not have a criminal record.  This is different from  the situation today when an individual found in simple possession of marijuana would  have to go through the court system and then receive a fine or could go to jail.  They could receive up to six months in jail for their first offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug laws in the country have been motivated mostly for political expediency rather than to deal with the truth.  Today  we seek to  deal with the truth and deal with the facts. The idea in the bill  has been employed in many European countries, in Italy, the Netherlands, Great Britain as well as in  Australia.  Decriminalization of marijuana did not result in an increase in use, it resulted in a decrease or a static amount.  That is very interesting.  Decriminalization in contrast to legalization of marijuana results in a static amount or a decrease in the amount of drug use.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill enables us to save about $150 million every year.  Since September 11 there has been  an increased demand on our security forces and our police forces. We have to find the money to go after the real criminals: the terrorists, the international drug lords, the people who push drugs and grow elicit drugs.  They are the people our police officers need to go after, not someone who is in possession of a small amount of marijuana.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the bill provide a disincentive?  It provides  a financial disincentive, a fine  of $200, $500 or $1,000.  It saves the taxpayer money, in the order of $150 million. It enables our police forces to  focus on the true criminals: the organized crime gangs and the drug pushers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to look at the bill in the forum of how we look at drug abuse, not from the punitive judicial model that we have used historically, but  a medical model.   I am a physician and I have spent 13 years working in detox units in British Columbia.  I have seen  all manners of drug use.  I saw many dead  people  when I worked in the emergency department.  I have seen people's lives completely ruined by drugs.  I am totally opposed to drug use, including marijuana use.  The bill will actually enable us to decrease drug use here in Canada.  It will also free up resources to enable us to go into the prevention aspect. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head start program that was  passed in my motion in 1998 strengthens the parent-child bond.  It ensures that children have their basic needs met. It  helps provide good parenting skills to  those parents who perhaps have not acquired them.</p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that was employed from Moncton, and the Minister of Labour  worked there has been outstanding, to Ypsilanti, Michigan and Hawaii, it resulted in a 99% reduction in child abuse rates, a 60% reduction in youth crime, a 40% reduction in teen pregnancies and a $7 saving for every dollar that was used.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is looking at ways in which it can build a children's agenda. The head start program would put meat, muscle and flesh on that idea. The House passed it.  The government should adopt it. Find the best models from around the world, work with the provinces and employ a national head start program that ensures our children have their basic needs met. This bill would provide some resources to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the bill, and the secretary of state was kind enough to allow me to attend his meetings in South America in this regard, is that we have a serious problem in the international drug trade.  The so-called war on drugs, where we have tried to decrease the drug trade at source by going to Colombia and waging a war on drugs, has been an abysmal failure and will always be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than trying to decrease production, we need to do is decrease consumption.  If we decreased consumption then we would be able to address the devastating problems that we have witnessed in various parts of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Colombia 70 people are murdered every single day as a direct result of the bloody war that has gone on for more than 20 years fuelled by the drug trade, primarily cocaine. As well, Colombia is branching out into a very pure form of heroin that is coming into Canada as we speak.   That will have a devastating effect on people who are addicts.  How do we deal with this problem?  Let us stop consumption.  If there was no consumption there would not be production.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Colombia it was very exciting. Senator McCain from the United States was also there at the same time. He made some very progressive statements.  He said that  people in North America could not point their fingers at Colombians and tell them to stop production.  He said that we must decrease consumption in North America.  The question is how to do that.  Again this bill will address that problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four things  we also need to do.  First, apart from implementing a decrease in consumption at home, we need to get tough with organized crime.  We need to adopt U.S. RICO like amendments.  These are racketeering influenced and corruption organization amendments that would enable our police forces to go after the money. Cutting the money from organized crime is the most effective way of hobbling  a criminal's ability to function.  It is what criminals fear the most. RICO amendments would enable us to convict them and take away their money supports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what we need is a freer trade agreement in the Americas.  A free trade zone in the Americas is crucial.  If someone is growing cocaine in Colombia, that person would need to export something else.  Right now the greatest barriers to farmers in developing countries are the barriers to trade that we in the west  employ.  Let us remove those barriers to trade and enable the people, who are grinding out an existence in abject poverty, to export  and earn money so they can get away from this crop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is a very interesting one. Earlier this year Canada and the west had their knuckles wrapped for allowing  legal chemicals to go to countries where they were used in the production of cocaine and heroin. The United Nations asked us why we were allowing this to happen and why had we  turned our backs on it.  This is wrong. We can and must have a series of import-export permits on the precursor chemicals that are necessary to the production of cocaine and heroin. If we did  that, we would be able to track where the chemicals went and hit the people who produced the drugs in the first place.  It is eminently doable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the secretary of state and I were in San José, Colombia, I had a chance to speak to the United Nations and OAS drug representatives.  I pitched this idea to them and they thought it was a fantastic. They said the only thing that was holding this up was bureaucracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada should take a leadership role in implementing a series of import-export permits that would enable us to track as well as eliminate those people who produce drugs, by tracking the precursor chemicals and choking off supply.  It is something that is doable, it is cheap and can be very effective.</p>


	<A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1740)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at  and compare those countries that have had a very punitive model for dealing with drug abuse, such as the United States, and those European models where they have had a decriminalization approach, we would see this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and now in Great Britain decriminalization of simple marijuana possession has enabled them to decrease the use of cannabis.  The reason is very interesting.  They reckon that because the forbidden fruit syndrome was not attached to a decriminalized substance like cannabis, they found that use, particularly among youth, declined quite substantially, which is very interesting. When one looks at harder drugs, there is not a shred of evidence to show that cannabis is a gateway drug.  In fact, where drug use had been decriminalized, they found that hard drug use actually was static or had declined.  This is also a very interesting fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When drug use in European countries like the Netherlands was compared to the United States, it was found that the use of harder drugs like cocaine was about 2% in the Netherlands  and  about 11% to 12% in the United States. Therefore the harder, more punitive actions do not work when the objective is to decrease the use of hard drugs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europeans,  Australians and now the Brits have done the same thing.   A pilot project to decriminalize the use of marijuana  was done in Brixton to see what would happen.   They found that drug use declined.  There was a massive saving to their judicial forces. The same thing happened in south Australia where decriminalization was so effective that  it is now looking at  applying it to the entire country. Where it has worked it has been extremely effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back for one moment and talk a bit about the cost factor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in Canada there are about 71,000  convictions for possession every year.  More than half of that is due to marijuana.  Does it make sense that we use our law enforcement forces for this particular process?  Does it make any sense for a 20 year old to be picked up, convicted and receive a criminal record for the simple possession of marijuana?  In getting that criminal record,  this impedes a person's  ability to gain access to a wide variety of professional faculties thereby severely compromising and truncating the individual's ability to be a contributing member of society in the future.  It does not work. If we look at society and see who is supporting it, it is  very interesting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the RCMP, the Council of Churches, elements in the Canadian Medical Association and other groups have said that is time to decriminalize, not legalize, marijuana possession. They have said that it is time drug use was looked at in a more comprehensive fashion.  Those groups look at it not in isolation, quite wisely, but look at the larger picture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we prevent drug use?  The head start program will prevent drug use by working with parents.  This has had a profound effect on children.  We have to work with our youth.  If we start early with our youth, we will have an opportunity to substantially reduce drug abuse here in Canada. This does not work however with adults.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked as a doctor in jails and I was also a jail guard.  The extent to which  drug abuse is found in jails is quite profound.  A study was done of 4,230 inmates and it found that 40% of those inmates used drugs in jail within the last year.  That is shocking.  It does not work.  We have to use other models.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very interesting to look at hard drug use.  Some people have said that punitive action needs to be taken and these people need to be put in jail.  That does not work.  I have done some exploration in Europe with regard to hard drug use.  People were put in methadone programs, needle exchange programs and were even allowed small medicinal use of the drug they were using.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That program was held in conjunction with housing, education, work, being an essential part of the program, and, of course, therapy.  After one year, the combination of that in a defined time period had a 50% to 60% success rate for hard core drug addicts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to what people said about the program. Some said that they had been on the streets.  The program had given them job training and  put them to work.  It provided them the structure in their lives which they had never had before.  Although they had been given the medicinal heroine for a period of time, it was a limited period of time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quid pro quo  to receiving the drug is the patients must engage in the treatment programs.  If they do not engage in therapy, treatment, counselling, work and job skills, then they cannot participate in the program.  They have to have a willing partner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my experience Canada has a revolving door syndrome.  People are thrown in detox and come out dry.  Within 24 hours, I have seen these people  in the emergency ward.  They are drunk or on drugs again after having spent seven to ten days in detox.  That model does not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to obligate the drug addicts or the substance abusers  to engage in these other elements of treatment, work, job skills and counselling to get them off the street. Where that has been done  in Europe, 50% to 60%  of people have been taken off the street.  This is quite extraordinary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost savings are substantial.  True, there is some front end loading of money, but we have to look at this in the long run.  It saves money in the long run.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the greatest scourges and the greatest damage associated with drug use are not the problems of taking the drugs themselves, but the indirect costs; the crime associated with drug abuse.  Many people who take heroin and cocaine have to engage in stealing and prostitution  to raise the money they need for $300 and $400 a day habits in cocaine, crack cocaine, Ts and Rs and heroin.  They do not get that by going to work.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That of course has a profound impact on our society.  The costs associated with drug use in Canada is more than $20 billion.  That is what It costs us directly and indirectly as  result of drug use. Perhaps the most frightening element of all this is the scourge of HIV and other communicable diseases.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we compare the United States with some of the European models and Australia, take Great Britain for example, the incidence of HIV is about is about 1% among IV drug abusers, which is  much higher than IV drug abusers in North America. If we look at people who use heroin, roughly 40% of individuals who have taken heroin intravenously have shared needles.  It is shocking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incumbent upon us to look at a broad range of issues, look at this factually, logically, deal with the facts and employ programs that have worked around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly would be remiss in not thanking Steven Barrett, Kerrie Woods, our British connection, and Jennifer Ratz for their very hard work in putting this together and working with me along this level.  I want to thank the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa for being so kind and generous in allowing me to participate in a couple of very important trips we have taken this year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of the bill I have put forth have widespread support from the public.  Roughly 75% of the public in polling wants decriminalization of marijuana.  Roughly two-third plus of the member of the House want decriminalization.  I hope the government takes the bill, adopts it and send it to committee.  I hope it does not let it languish but adopts it as a much larger program of how we deal with substance abuse issues in Canada today.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at it from a humane fashion.  Let us look at it from a compassionate fashion.  Let us look at it from a medical model, not a punitive model.  Let us do the right thing, the socially appropriate thing, the harm reduction platform. Let us save lives, save money and help Canadians in the future. If we do that, truly Canada will be on the cutting edge and we will be saving many lives.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, following the May 17, 2001 debate on the use of drugs for non-medical purposes, a special House committee was formed to examine the many issues surrounding this important topic.  It will be presenting its conclusions in November 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Health and this government are impatiently awaiting the recommendations of this committee and of the special Senate committee now studying Canada's anti-drug legislation and policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that, through the various departments, which are working together to develop a drug strategy for Canada, the government is actively making its expertise available and providing support for the proceedings of these two committees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of anti-drug legislation and sanctions, and especially marijuana, is now the subject of a broad public debate.  I will go over some of the proposals in the amendment proposed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment would mean that simple possession of small quantities of cannabis or cannabis resin could be dealt with under the provisions of the Contraventions Act.  It would change the procedures and the legal system for offences of possession, possession for trafficking, and trafficking of one gram or less of cannabis resin or 30 grams or less of cannabis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Contraventions Act, which was passed by parliament in 1992, was designed to provide a simplified process for prosecuting violations of statutes  and regulations that would otherwise be prosecuted under the Criminal Code before provincial courts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Contraventions Act,  summary conviction offences may be designated by the governor in council as a contravention. The fact that an offence is designated as a contravention under the act eliminates the stigma normally associated with a  federal conviction offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the objectives of this bill seems to be the elimination of a criminal record for possession of small amounts of cannabis.  Another objective is to re-allocate the savings to the legal system toward the prosecution of dealers and traffickers of illicit drugs. These are obviously laudable goals. However, without an indepth study of the subject, including   a cost benefit analysis, and information on the social and economic benefits, we cannot speculate as to whether or not the amendment would meet its objectives.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments were made to the Contravention Act in May 1996. They were the result of consultations with the provinces and territories. Similar consultations would be vital for the proposed bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments allowed violations of federal statutes to be prosecuted under the various provincial and territorial legal systems. The governor in council was able to make regulations to have a provincial system  apply to the offences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1996 amendments also allow the Minister of Justice to sign agreements with each province or territory regarding the administrative details of the act, implementation procedures for the act, and the prosecution of contraventions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Contraventions Act allows the governor in council to designate summary conviction offences under federal statutes or regulations as contraventions. Indictable offences are specifically excluded from designation as contraventions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals are all good, but we must be careful to ensure that all of these provisions are carefully considered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, we would need to have special consultations with the provinces before considering this approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we have  to hear from the Canadian public on this subject before making any decisions regarding cannabis policies. This work is underway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Senate committee and the special committee of the House, together with the results of their studies, will be a considerable help in examining the questions.  These committees may recommend a cost-benefit analysis and further public consultation before a decision to amend the policies on cannabis according to the Contraventions Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stress the need for broad consultation with representatives of the provinces and territories to obtain their support for this approach and their opinion on its implementation.  A strong consensus among the provinces, the territories and the federal government is the only way to rectify the inconsistency of the current enforcement scheme.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must explain the changes clearly to Canadians.</p>


	<A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also make sure that a new and innovative approach is not unnecessarily complex and that Canadians understand the reason for the change and its application in practice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, processes should probably be established to provide training to police officers in the appropriate enforcement of the provisions of the Contraventions Act to make sure that the result is not a broader or discriminatory enforcement of the law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluation framework would probably be needed.  Mechanisms should be established to obtain the basic data on current trends in substance abuse and arrests and to monitor the social, legal and health related effects of the Contraventions Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the government believes that the time is not right to pass this amendment and that the preliminary work required has not been completed.  In our opinion, the work of the parliamentary committees must be completed before any change is made to current legislation, such as the Contraventions Act, in the case of cannabis.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would first mention that I strongly support the bill before us, which will be votable after the third hour of debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, as a preliminary remark, that the government has been examining these issues for over 20 years.  In the early 1970s, there was, among others, the Le Dain Commission comprising three highly esteemed criminologists, including Andrée Bertrand, a criminologist at the University of Montreal.  I do not think the government can claim insufficient information as a pretext for rejecting the bill</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government may not agree with the essence of the bill and wish to continue to have the use of marijuana dealt with by the criminal justice system, but, please, let it not claim lack of information, because that argument does not hold. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put the bill in the context of its legal ramifications.  This bill does not legalize the possession of marijuana. It decriminalizes it.  That means that a person in possession of a small quantity of marijuana cannot be incarcerated and therefore will not have a criminal record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is interesting, because we must be very clear about this approach, which is to make the possession of marijuana a civil offence.  It is not legalized.  There would be a civil offence subject to a fine.  The first would be $200, and, if I recall correctly, the second would be $500, and in all cases beyond the second offence, the fine would be $1,000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is very relevant to Canadian and Quebec society of today.  I sit on the special committee that will review the whole matter of Canada's antidrug strategy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the committee we were given a document, which my colleague might find worth reading as well, prepared by Diane Riley, a doctor, not in the medical sense of the term, but in the sense of having a university doctorate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has identified all of the studies that have been done on drugs.   Her document is in both official languages and was prepared at the request of Senator Nolin of the other House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share a number of the conclusions.  The document reminds us that 600,000 Canadians have a criminal record simply because they were arrested for possession of marijuana.  This figure of 600,000 Canadians and Quebecers alone is cause for reflection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must people be sentenced for possession of a harmless substance?  The report refers to an article that appeared three years ago in the British medical journal The <i>Lancet</i>, a very serious report which proved that the consumption of marijuana, in the short term certainly, but also in the long term, has no impact on people's health.  It has sedative virtues, relaxing effects, but no effect on people's ability to function.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my colleague, the hon. member for Rosemount—Petite-Patrie, brought forward a motion which was debated here in the House on the legalization of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, certain members, particularly the hon. member for Saint John, to be specific, raised the whole argument, the kind of lecture grandmothers are wont to make, with great affection and most certainly great good intentions, about how marijuana destroys  people's brain cells and can lead to dysfunction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just think about how many of Canada's decision-makers have used marijuana, and would therefore be dysfunctional according to the argument of the hon. member for Saint John.    That argument does not hold water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have proof.   The <i>Lancet</i> article, and the review of the medical literature carried out by the researcher I mentioned, do not allow us to add medical considerations to the argument.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, using marijuana may have great therapeutic value for people infected with  HIV.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member who is sponsoring this bill is asking us, as parliamentarians, to remove from the criminal code the simple possession of marijuana. Our colleague will have to tell us whether this also includes hashish. Usually, when medical definitions refer to cannabis,  it means both marijuana and hashish. We will have to see about the scope of the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument that will have to be considered, and regarding which we have some data, is the fact that, in countries where it is not a crime for a person to have marijuana in his possession, this includes a number of European countries such as the Netherlands, Italy and Spain, it is not true that this has led to an increase in use. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are listening to us will definitely not be surprised to hear that, according to the figures provided in the study conducted by the other place in 1998,  marijuana is used more in prohibitionist countries such as the United States than in countries like the Netherlands, where it has been legalized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Netherlands, legalization has even resulted in government controlled coffee  shops providing marijuana in a legal fashion. In the weeks and months that followed legalization, there was no  increase in marijuana use, because people who use this drug do so for personal motives, for therapeutic reasons and to achieve personal   serenity. There  is absolutely no reason to believe that we will witness a phenomenon of massive and unrestrained use. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third reason we should support this bill presented by the Canadian Alliance member. I am referring of course to the significant resources used by police forces. It is interesting to see that, at the federal level in Canada, and this does not even include the various police forces such as the Montreal urban community police department or the Quebec provincial police, only the RCMP, 1,000 officers are involved on a  permanent basis in the fight against drug trafficking.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our special  committee on illegal drugs also heard officials from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. They tabled a document that my colleague could also look at. We got an idea of the size of drug seizures in recent years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the example of marijuana. These are the latest statistics. In 2000 Canadian customs authorities made 44 seizures of marijuana worth a total of  $17.7 million. Why should this figure interest us? This does not mean that once our colleague's bill is adopted, we will become a country with open borders to marijuana, without any restrictions. That is not the idea. However, we have to understand that this prohibitive reasoning, the reasoning that outlaws the possession of marijuana, leads to and promotes the trafficking of marijuana.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could  free up  police resources considerably. If one thinks that 1,000 officers are assigned to drug control, it is easy to think  how we, as a society, could make a much more rational use of these resources, particularly in a context where true organized crime has developed   considerably, and has   considerable information technologies at its disposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the bill is perfectly reasonable and we do not feel the need to wait for  committee work to be over. The Senate committee will carry on for several more months. We heard from a senator in our committee.   A preliminary report will be presented in August. After that, the Senate will undertake a two year study. Our committee will also study the issue for several months.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that, since the conclusions of the Le Dain report, the House has all of the information it needs to support this bill, which designates a civil offence and meets the wishes of a large majority of Canadians and Quebecers.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I very much support this bill and want to thank the hon. member for Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca for bringing it forward for debate. I am glad it will be a votable bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues we have to examine in deciding whether  we support the bill is  what the real public health risk is that is associated with cannabis use. There has been an enormous amount of evidence, which we could probably stack several feet high, to show that the risk to individual or public health from the use of cannabis is minimal. In fact what really has happened in the country is that the greatest risk to public health when it comes to drug use is from prohibitionist policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic that is the criminalization of drug users, whether it is in regard to  cannabis or other substances, that  has created the greatest harm in our society, whether it involves individual health or safety in our communities  or people who are forced into a criminal lifestyle. To me  that is the heart of the issue. We must  have an honest debate. We must break down the barriers and mythology surrounding Canada's drug policies and our moral attitudes toward drugs and critically examine the fact  that it is prohibition and criminalization that have created harm for and risk to public and individual health, not the drugs themselves, although they can create harm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I was at the special committee on the non-medical use of drugs. We heard from a witness, Dr. Eric Single, professor of public health sciences in the faculty of medicine at the University of Toronto, who has done a lot of research on drug use and substance abuse, particularly in Australia. He pointed out to the committee that in Australia where decriminalization has taken place the use of cannabis did not increase. In fact, not sending people to jail had no counterbalancing effect in terms of increasing use. What it did do was reduce law enforcement costs  significantly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it amusing to hear from the government member that we have to be so careful and cautious, that we have to study it and weigh all the angles. Let us get real here. Let us remember that it was 30 years ago that the Le Dain commission conducted a thorough examination of the issue and came to the conclusion that cannabis or marijuana should be decriminalized. In fact it went further and made many other recommendations, so this is not  progressing at exactly a rapid rate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that the public is far ahead of the politicians on this one. We can go to just about any survey,  national, provincial or regional, and we will see that Canadians are much more realistic about this issue than those of us who are in elected positions. More than anything in this debate and when it comes to a vote, people need to have the courage to be realistic on the issue and break down the mythology that exists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the NDP actually have dealt with the issue.  Indeed, at our national convention in 1999 we passed a resolution stating: “Be it resolved that the NDP support the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in its call for decriminalization of cannabis”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is a private member's bill and I thank the member for bringing it forward, but it is  ironic in that I do not think his party has the nerve to do it. We really have to do a lot of education because it should be more than private members' business. It is something that as a political institution we should be standing up for and taking on. I hope the member will do some work within his own party to get it to adopt a stand for decriminalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is important. I guess my only complaint would be that it does not go far enough. It really is the tip of the iceberg.</p>


	<A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent the riding of Vancouver East. It includes the downtown east side, which is probably  the epicentre  in the western world for  HIV-AIDS and  injection drug users. There is really just an open drug scene now. There are people whose lives are devastated.  There are people who are in pain, who suffer trauma and who have been  marginalized as a result of criminalization due to Canada's drug laws. While we are debating the decriminalization of marijuana, let us really link it to the broader issue, which is  that we absolutely have to look at Canada's drug laws. They have to be reformed, just as the Le Dain commission said 30 years ago. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in Vancouver the special Senate committee is actually holding a hearing and it will be hearing from drug users themselves, people who have actually come together and organized to speak out so that they are no longer marginalized and  their voices are being heard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a letter sent to the hearing today because I could not be there. In outlining the crisis that has faced our community with injection drug use and the lack of action by levels of government, what I asked the committee to look at and to urge the federal government to act swiftly and adopt were the following points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a strategy and a program for user accessible treatment on demand. There are people who are facing addiction and  want to get into treatment but they cannot because it is not available or  not accessible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a realistic and honest drug education program focused on health and well-being. We have so many programs  run by police departments, which  basically tell kids that if they use cannabis or do this or that they will become  drug addicts and  die. Kids know that is not true. We need an honest education program  focused on people's understanding of their own bodies, of their own health and of what is appropriate use, rather than just a message of “say no to drugs” when we know kids are not listening to it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have called for a safe injection site. So have many other people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have called for multicentre heroin trials and for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use as a step toward a more critical discussion on the legalization of marijuana and other substances. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need support and housing programs for injection drug users who have been marginalized and criminalized by current attitudes and laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need testing of on the street drugs to provide critical information to health care providers in order to prevent overdoses. I want to say one thing about this. Because of the barriers we have to dealing with this issue realistically and because we as a society have been so afraid to deal with the issue of drug use, we have created an environment where people are literally living off the street and buying drugs on the illegal market. As a result, they are dying from overdoses in enormous numbers. These deaths are preventable. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for people between 30 and 44, more so than heart attacks, car accidents, strokes or cancers. These are preventable deaths if only we have the courage to provide the kind of harm reducing, realistic policies  necessary, to provide treatment on demand, to provide realistic education and to help people where they are at and not further criminalize them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome this debate today because it is one more step in what has been  a struggle for legislatures in terms of  standing up and taking on this issue. I sincerely hope  that there will be an honest assessment of this issue  in the House and that we will not hide behind our perception of people's morals.   I sincerely hope that we will be honest and realistic and support the bill, that we will   see it as a step toward a more critical debate and discussion about the need to reform Canada's drug laws and the fact that prohibitionist policies have caused the greatest harm in our society, both to  individuals and to communities.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member from British Columbia who brought this matter forward. I commend all members who have taken part in this debate.  It is a very timely and very helpful process  we are engaging in at this moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the substance of Bill C-344 which calls for the decriminalization of marijuana, there is an important distinction that cannot be repeated often enough.  There is a huge difference between decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing marijuana. I think there is often a great deal of confusion over this particular issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private member's bill calls for enactments within the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the Contraventions Act which  would essentially put the possession, trafficking and use of marijuana into the category of a summary offence ticket, that is, a speeding ticket or a motor vehicle type offence, that would result in potential fines and potential incarceration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties are really not the question.  It becomes a much broader debate when we engage in discussing the effects of such a change.  Essentially it  would lead potentially to expanded use of marijuana for very casual social purposes which is occurring now in this country.  There is  a realization behind the bill that  a disproportionate amount of criminal justice machinery  is trying to deal with this problem right now, while at the same time dealing with what  I would fairly call proportionately larger problems in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is one which deserves debate.  It is one that is currently being  debated in  the House of Commons committee that it has been referred to.  It has also been taken up by the Senate and the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin, a Conservative senator in the other place. They are delving into the very pith and substance of what we are discussing here today in this private member's bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca has displayed a great deal of courage and diligence in ensuring that this matter comes forward.  I am quick to acknowledge that other members of the House have a great deal of experience  because of the predominance of this problem in their ridings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a problem on a number of levels.  There is a reliance by many in society on drugs far more damaging and with much higher addictive qualities than marijuana.  My colleague from Quebec raised an important issue,  the distinction between whether it includes marijuana or hash and hash oil.   That to me is not clear in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither legalization nor increased criminal sanctions will fully address some of these complexities.  There has to be a full and public debate. There has to be a great deal of attention placed on the health aspects.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the New Democratic Party has quite correctly pointed out that the evidence is not clear.  There is a fair bit of conflicting medical research that speaks of the addictive qualities of marijuana and hashish, that speaks of the harm that can result from direct inhalation of marijuana.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the real effect that it has on a person's mental capacity, decision making, and physical dexterity in the operation of machinery or a motor vehicle.  These are considerations that have to be brought into the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems require a variety of measures to seek out a solution.  They include education, treatment and rehabilitation and government regulation in areas that may not result in criminal sanctions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is to say that in the context of the debate, it is not a simple one.  It is not just a matter of saying we are going to remove the penalties from the criminal code and put them into the context of something that is deemed less serious with less detrimental effect on a person's future. By that I mean obviously there are those in the past who have been unfairly punished or felt disproportionate results coming from the fact that they may have been arrested for possession of marijuana or have engaged in the use of marijuana.</p>


	<A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a greater openness to acknowledge the medicinal benefits of marijuana in the control of pain, glaucoma and other medical afflictions in recent years.  We have come a long way.  I acknowledge that the legislation in this  area has not changed for many years.   There have been previous studies, but there is an intense and removed attitude  to re-examine the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative coalition, the right hon. member for Calgary Centre, has openly supported  the spirit and intent behind the legislation.  In May of this year  he called upon the government to decriminalize marijuana.  He stated that it was not fair for a young person to face a lifelong criminal record for possession of the drug.  He made the distinction  between criminalization and legalization.  He also noted, as I will note, that it was a personal opinion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am obliged to say that within the coalition we will be having a free vote on this issue.  There is a difference of opinion in our coalition and in other parties.  That is healthy.  Canadians openly embrace the reality that people have very different backgrounds, experiences and  strongly held beliefs about the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Saint John  who was referred to in the debate holds very personal strong beliefs about this.  I understand and respect the position of my leader.  Yet, even the Minister of Justice   signalled that she would be open to a debate on the decriminalization of marijuana.  Many Canadians are still uncomfortable with the amount of evidence that is before them, particularly on the health aspects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey last May suggested Canadians were almost evenly split on the issue of legalization: 47% in  support compared to 26% in 1975.  There is an apparent shift in public attitudes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly support further study.  I  support and commend the effort being put forward by members of parliament and the Senate.  I must be honest, however.  I am not there yet.  I do not feel comfortable with going down the road of decriminalization at this point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are engaged in a healthy debate. The issue has been before the country.  There was reference to the Le Dain commission.   The medical community is more engaged in bringing forward hard facts about the effects of marijuana use.  The mover of this  bill is a medical practitioner and  that  further legitimizes and crystallizes his commitment to this issue. Changing attitudes toward the medical use of marijuana, combined with increasing demands on the law enforcement community, have also necessitated this closer examination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was reference earlier that the law enforcement community is stretched to the extreme in trying to enforce all sorts of laws that proportionately require greater attention.  I do not want to draw too close an analogy, but  having law enforcement officers engaged in the enforcement of a gun registry, for example,  highlights the ludicrous nature  of giving  officers too much to do without enough financial resources or enough person power to commit the task that is before them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  bill calls for changing the way in which we set up the fine structure.  There is a great deal of concern on my part for people who suffer the inability to travel or  to gain full employment in an area for which  they are qualified for the reason they may have a criminal record for simple possession.  That can change by having a criminal record expunged.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not go as far as to legalize the use of marijuana. I commend the hon. member for bringing this matter to the House for debate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred to the debate  within the policing community.  The chiefs of police seem to support the hon. member's initiative and yet frontline police officers feel that this is not the road to go at this time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there is a danger that those who are under the influence of marijuana suffer from a decreased drive and initiative.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still a mind-altering substance, something that can affect in a criminal way the operation of a motor vehicle or at times the intent that may be involved in a criminal act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again this issue is something that will be with us, I hope not for the same amount of time since the last time it came before the House. I look forward to the outcome of the Senate report and the  House of Commons committee report and the further debate that will take place on the floor of the House of Commons.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, over the course of the last decade cannabis use has been the subject of discussion in several fora. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are being asked to examine a proposed amendment to the Contraventions Act and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act regarding cannabis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering a legislative amendment, we must take into account our international obligations as a country and consider international experiences with regard to cannabis possession. As well we must also consider the need for further information in areas where our current knowledge does not suffice. While we may believe that the basis of information exists, we must not make a premature decision on this issue. Together we must  identify where further data is needed and must consider the important work already in progress.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special committee of the Senate is currently studying Canada's drug legislation and policies, particularly with respect to marijuana. The committee is already hearing from some very informed witnesses on the subject. As well a Canadian Alliance motion debated on May 17 in the House of Commons dealt with the non-medical use of drugs. As a result a special committee of the House has been set up to  consider factors underlying or relating to the non-medical use of drugs. It will be tabling its report in November 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I find it odd that the House is now debating Bill C-344 when it is clearly within the scope of the special committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making a decision on Canada's policy, whether it is to introduce changes to the legislation or to maintain the status quo, we should do it in an informed manner and in a way that does not duplicate the valuable work of these committees. We believe that the work of these committees will bring important current views of Canadians to the fore for consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important issue. We will all  await the results of the Senate committee and the House committee before we move forward to make any further changes.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have risen numerous times in the House to ask questions, make speeches, take part in question period, make comments, and speak during adjournment debate. I can see that the parliamentary secretary is preparing to respond.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adjournment debate is on a question that I raised in the House on May 30. I will not repeat the preamble, but I ended my question by asking the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Why is the Minister of Industry not acting on the report entitled “Breaking Through”, which proposed effective and innovative policies instead of subsidies to support the shipbuilding industry?</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that this report, which was made public in late March, was written by a committee that the minister struck himself following a commitment that he made as industry minister two days before the election was called. He made this promise in St. John's , Newfoundland. I was there myself and I heard his promise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, on June 19, after the House had risen, the minister responded to the recommendations made by the committee's report. He did respond to the recommendations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been waiting ever since,  not just me but all those interested in shipbuilding   in Canada are waiting for an actual shipbuilding policy. We are still waiting for a shipbuilding program or programs with actual amounts attached.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the same day the minister said in a press release that $150 million, mainly in the form of loan insurance, would be spent over five years for shipbuilding. I checked with various shipyards in Canada and with a third party I had asked to get information directly from Department of Industry officials.  Apart from having set up a shipbuilding division, most of the employees of which used to work for the department but now work in  a new structure, nothing specific had been done and not one cent had been spent on shipbuilding in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is a very simple one.  I would like to know more, and if I am mistaken, I would like the parliamentary secretary to the minister to say so today, about what exactly has been spent to help shipbuilding in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, I would remind the House, Davie Industries has gone bankrupt.  Right now various committees  are trying to help the industry get back on its feet in my riding.  I am naturally concerned but, at the same time, I know that the shipyard in Saint John, New Brunswick, has not reopened. It has been closed for a year and a half, as has Marystown, and the list goes on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing has been done.  It has been a year and some weeks since the formal commitment by the new Minister of Industry with respect to shipbuilding.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-64880"></A><a HREF="#Int-64882"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-64878"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Claude Drouin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has said, this is a very important matter, one that affects his riding and mine, and a number of others across Canada.  I am pleased to respond to the hon. member.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. member has said,  on June 19 the hon. Minister of Industry announced the launching of the new policy framework on shipbuilding and industrial marine industries.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culmination of a lengthy process of consultation with Canadians, this new policy framework focuses on opportunity, growth and innovation in niche markets where Canada can compete.  This policy is designed expressly to help the industry capture domestic opportunities, look globally, use innovation as a key to competitiveness, find  financing and build stronger partnerships. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new policy framework includes  24 measures to support new works with a value of between $200 million and $300 million, which is double the current production.  The structured financing facility now in operation is a key element of this framework.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this facility is to stimulate  the demand for new Canadian ships in existing Canadian shipyards, by offering financial benefits to Canadian and foreign buyers and  lessees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This facility includes two main elements: the first one is the interest rate, which can provide a reduction of up to 10% of the purchase price of a Canadian built vessel, while the second one is a credit insurance  that insures  part of a loan or lease to buy ships built in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structured  financing facility will help the Canadian shipbuilding and industrial marine industry to seize new opportunities by allowing for the setting of competitive prices for buyers and  lessees of high quality ships built in Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the House that this initiative is well underway and that we are currently receiving applications for assistance under the structured financing facility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before the program was introduced, however, the federal government already provided assistance to the industry in the following forms:  accelerated capital cost allowance for Canadian-built ships; a 25% tariff on most non-NAFTA  ship imports;  domestic procurement by the federal government; Export Development Corporation financing for commercially viable transactions; and a very favourable research and development tax credit system. These important elements of the federal policy continue to help the shipbuilding industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality of the private sector means that all companies have their share of troubles.  The shipbuilding and industrial marine industry, and a company such as Davie in particular, are no exception.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government is continuing to monitor the situation closely and the Minister of Industry met with representatives of Davie on September 20 to discuss the current financial situation.  He also met with Mrs. Marois, Quebec's minister of finance, to discuss Davie's request for financial assistance.  Although the government of Quebec indicated that it could not support the projects proposed at the time because it found them unrealistic, the federal government remains prepared to work with the government of Quebec and all other stakeholders to help them find a solution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new policy  framework represents a serious commitment on the part of the federal government to continue to help the industry.  The policy benefits from the support of a new organization, within Industry Canada, responsible for the energy and marine sectors.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the answer of the parliamentary secretary, and I recognize his  honest concern for the industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I have only a minute, but I would ask him to tell me, if the program exists, whether he has accepted applications?  If so, how many and for how much?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not make a secret of this, I informed him of my question this afternoon, so I expect he was able to get the information. If no projects have yet been accepted with respect to future    project applications, what might the deadline be for such an application?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Davie is a matter of some urgency, because a creditors' meeting is scheduled for November 23.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I simply wanted to mention, as I said earlier, that there are   applications which are currently being considered, but it is too early to be able to quantify or assess their value. However, the program is functioning. It is being examined and we hope to make an announcement as soon as possible and that Davie Industries will be able to benefit from it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen that workers from Davie Industries have taken things into their own hands, and are talking about forming a co-operative. This is an effective way to find solutions to resume activities at the Lévis shipyard. People can be sure that the Government of Canada  will be there.</p>
