	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
the House today to speak on a very important issue, DNA data 
banking.
<P>
	Recently I had the pleasure of meeting with members of the 
Canadian Police Association who expressed the importance of a 
national DNA data bank. The purpose of a DNA data bank is 
fundamental to investigations and prosecutions of the most serious 
crimes in Canada. A DNA data bank would act as a national 
information system for law enforcement.
<P>
	I fully support the concept of DNA data banking and ask that my 
colleagues also defend its significance to society. I feel that 
bringing this legislation to the forefront is long overdue. Perhaps 
we should consider the motto that the Canadian Police Association 
so adamantly believes in: Register criminals before firearms. After 
all, it is our responsibility to ensure public safety.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the people of Alberta spoke and here is what they told us.
<P>
	Their first and loudest message was that Albertans respect 
politicians who say what they mean and mean what they say. 
Albertans recognize that Ralph Klein kept his election promise to 
eliminate Alberta's deficit, and they rewarded him with 63 seats 
out of 83.
<P>
	The people of Alberta told us that they expect politicians to be 
responsive and listen to their voters. Albertans appreciate that the 
Klein government listened to the people on such issues as health 
needs and budget surpluses.
<P>
	Finally, the people of Alberta told us they will never again let the 
banks and the bond traders control the province's destiny. By an 
overwhelming majority, they rejected deficit spending in favour of 
fiscal stability and accountability.
<P>
	I salute Ralph Klein and the people of Alberta for their 
courageous efforts of the past four years. Our reward? The lowest 
tax rates and the highest job creation of any province in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Conservative leader, who dared solicit the support of the Quebec 
Liberal delegates assembled at last weekend's convention by 
slipping provocative literature under their doors, was roundly 
condemned by both the Minister of Labour and the Minister of 
Immigration.
<P>
	According to the Minister of Labour, the Conservative leader has 
gone too far. As for the Minister of Immigration, she said it was 
totally inappropriate.
<P>
	Liberals are really not very thick-skinned. How would they have 
described the stealthy crusade of the own leader, a backstage 
skulker, during the night of the long knives in an Ottawa hotel in 
1982?
<P>
	These one-way democratic ministers hid their hats in their 
pockets at the time of their leader's incredibly despicable act 
during that night dedicated to quashing Quebec's legitimate 
demands.

which the government official from  the railway safety directorate 
says that

he is quite interested in the possibility of the railway's contracting 
out the entire crossing improvement project.
<P>
	``We would be very interested in hearing the railway's views on 
this and will be contacting you shortly to set up a meeting to 
discuss the above''.
<P>
	Many of the people in my riding and other ridings across the 
country who work for the signals department of the CPR and the 
CNR are very concerned that the government is encouraging the 
railways to contract out this kind of work.
<P>
	It is bad enough that the companies they work for should be 
considering contracting out their work, but when the Liberal 
government is actively encouraging major private corporations to 
contract out work, to bust unions, to look for cheaper wages for 
people doing the same job, it ought to be absolutely ashamed of 
itself.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, Hungary will be celebrating its national day on March 15, 
marking the Hungarian revolution of 1848-1849. Being the longest 
and most heroic fight against feudalism in the 1848 ``Spring of 
Peoples'' movement in Europe, the Hungarian revolution became 
the symbol of the fight for freedom and human rights all over the 
world. Second, Hungary is becoming more important to Canadians 
because it is expected to be invited to join NATO in July of this 
year. We, the members of the House of Commons, will be asked to 
express our opinion on the enlargement of NATO membership for 
Hungary and its political and security alliances with Canada.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This year's theme ``Talking to One Another'' is closely linked to 
modern day technology as we celebrate the countless ways we now

<P>
	This high technology enables Commonwealth citizens to 
exchange ideas in various ways, including distance education and 
exchange programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, having more ways of communicating does not 
automatically bring improvements. Talking to one another is not a 
one way process. We can explain our own points of view but we 
must also listen to the views of others, something that all 
parliamentarians should do, including myself.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
week Canadians have witnessed one of the sorriest episodes in the 
judicial history of Canada. Clifford Olson taunts the victims of 
crime, mocks the justice system, but the responsible minister 
dismisses any protest as just playing politics.
<P>
	Shame on the minister for trying to dismiss attempts to give 
victims and their families a platform. The pain and suffering of 
innocent victims deserves a voice. It is about time the rights of 
victims take precedence over the rights of criminals. It is about 
time this country had a victims' bill of rights. This would give 
victims the right to much more information, the right to 
notification of significant events in the judicial process, the right to 
compensation from the offender and the right not to be harassed or 
intimidated by the perpetrator of a crime.
<P>
	Why does the Liberal government continue to ignore the rights 
of victims of crime?

	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex-Windsor, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 27, 1997, the legislature of the province of Ontario passed 
a resolution introduced by Sandra Pupatello, the provincial 
member for Windsor Sandwich. The resolution calls on the 
provincial government to ``stop cutting base funding of hospitals 
and to allow communities to determine how to restructure their 
hospital services and find efficiency savings based on their needs''.
<P>
	Our local communities and hardworking doctors and nurses 
know the best way to reduce health care costs. Their expertise and 
priorities should be recognized. The federal government's 
priorities were clearly stated in the 1997 budget announcement that 
it would be reinvesting $300 million in health care over the next 
three years by investing in a health transition fund, a Canada health 
information system and increasing support for children's health 
under two programs, the community action program for children 
and the Canada prenatal nutrition program.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the premier of Ontario and others have claimed 
the federal government cut transfers to Ontario by 40 per cent. This 
is not the case. The reductions in transfers was $1.2 billion or11.4 per cent. Next year Ontario will receive a total of $9.1 billion 
in transfers.

federalist member of Parliament from Quebec that I rise in the 
House today to denounce the strategy of the Conservative Party and 
its leader, the member of Parliament for Sherbrooke.
<P>
	For some weeks now the leader of the Conservative Party has 
been travelling through the anglophone provinces promising that a 
Conservative government would resolve the issue of national unity 
and put an end to the separatist threat in Quebec.
<P>
	In Quebec however, and again last Monday in his own riding of 
Sherbrooke, the Conservative leader has relentlessly attacked 
Quebec federalists and said almost nothing against the Bloc 
Quebecois and their separatist allies.
<P>
	Canadians have not been fooled by this double talk in the past. 
The Conservative leader had better realize it soon, if he does not 
want to lose the two seats he has in the next election. He had better 
start talking the talk.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we sometimes see strange coincidences. At a time when 
the federal government is asking the Supreme Court to rule on 
Quebec's democratic right to achieve sovereignty, without the prior 
consent of Prince Edward Island, France is about to print a stamp 
commemorating General de Gaulle's visit to Montreal, in 1967, 
and particularly his famous ``Vive le Québec libre''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, who is a long-time stamp collector, 
hurriedly made a few suggestions to the French postal service, 
asking them, above all, not to show the general, the Quebec flags, 
or the city hall balcony. In other words, according to the Prime 
Minister, the best stamp to commemorate this page in history 
would be ``no stamp at all''.
<P>
	Could it be that this knee-jerk reaction is dictated by a noble 
intention to protect young Quebecers' health?

	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, concerns 
have been expressed over the last number of months regarding the 
harmonized sales tax about to go in place in Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Newfoundland. It has been a major topic at my 
town hall meetings and my visits to businesses where consumers 
and businesses have expressed concerns.
<P>
	Because of concerns expressed by both small business and 
consumers, tax included pricing is being delayed until provinces 
representing 51 per cent of the Canadian people agree to blend their 
sales taxes with the federal goods and services tax. This is a victory 
for us in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	There are major benefits to a harmonized sales tax with the 
elimination of $700 million in hidden provincial sales taxes in the 
Atlantic, $280 million of this in Nova Scotia alone, one sales tax 
regime, a reduction in tax from almost 19 per cent to 15 per cent on 
most items, and in Nova Scotia a lowering of the personal income 
tax rate by 3.4 points.
<P>
	With the changes recently announced I am confident that we can 
now move forward on April 1 with the new harmonized sales tax 
which will benefit Atlantic Canada-

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say it is not easy to take aim at the government in 
this situation. In fact, they pulled a fast one on me.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I will have to attack the Minister of Finance again 
today. Three weeks ago, the Minister of Finance made a budget 
speech in which his estimate of a $19 billion deficit seemed rather 
high, considering the real figures he had at the time, figures which 
we now have and which will probably put the deficit at around $10 
or $12 million at the most. In fact, he was quite content to give us a 
forecast that was twice as high, a forecast that was off by 40 or50 per cent.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. In the private sector, and 
we often refer to the private sector, what would they do with an 
accountant who, three weeks before the end of the financial year, 
was out 50 per cent in his forecast? He would be fired. I want to ask 
the Prime Minister what he intends to do with his Minister of 
Finance who is incapable of forecasting a deficit more or less 
accurately?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before going any further, I may say that when 
shareholders have their meeting and the board announces a bigger 
profit than had been expected, generally the board is given a bonus.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	We hope and in fact we believe, since we are ahead of the game 
with our forecast, that voters will give us a bonus.
<P>
	Since this is the hon. member's last chance to ask me questions 
as Leader of the Opposition, I would like to take this opportunity to 
express our thanks. His departure will be no great loss for us but it 
will be a great loss for his party. Not for us. Because, although he 
can be aggressive, I must say I never felt I was being attacked 
personally. We can disagree on ideas, but he is not one to make 
personal attacks.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> We are almost neighbours, 
because when he goes home, he takes the road to La Tuque via 
Shawinigan.
<P>
	I think he will be missed by his party and by the House as Leader 
of the Opposition. Fortunately, we stand to gain. I want to thank 
him for the work he has done and I wish him the best of luck.
<P>
	Now he can come back again with a supplementary, and I can 
repeat that we are very proud of doing better than we expected, and 
I will certainly not scold the Minister of Finance for this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister was always as friendly as he is 
today, question period would not be the same. Too bad this does not 
happen more often.
<P>
	There is something dangerous in what the Prime Minister said, 
but seriously, I would like to get back to the substance of the 
question. The Minister of Finance made a mistake in his forecast, 
in other words, badly misinterpreted the indicators available to him 
at the Department of Finance, and the fact that the actual figures 
are far better, is of course wonderful, and of course everybody is 
pleased, but we must be careful. This same inability to interpret 
data could have produced the opposite result, unless the Minister of 
Finance knew what he was talking about and did so on purpose.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Please be patient 
with me, Mr. Speaker, this is my last question. Please bear with me.
<P>
	Is this not a government strategy to put artificial pressure on 
provincial governments which were forced to go along with more 
than $4 billion in cutbacks over the past two years?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the excellent results we now see followed decisions that 
were made very early on when we formed the government.
<P>
	At the time we did not know exactly what the outcome would be 
so we developed a plan. The plan is working better than we 
thought, and everyone should be very pleased about this.
<P>
	We should also consider the fact that when we formed the 
government, the Minister of Finance and I realized that the 
previous government's budget forecasts were always more 
optimistic by as much as 8, 9, 10 or 11 billion dollars than was 
actually the case.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance decided to be more rigorous and is to be 
commended on the results we obtained. And the provinces,Mr. Leader of the Opposition, are much better off, because they pay 
far less interest on servicing their provincial debt thanks to this 
government's good management.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am convinced that the Minister of Finance had these 
figures when he drafted his latest budget. What bothers us on this 
side of the House is the minister's interpretation of those figures.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister today refers to good management that 
has helped free up billions of dollars, is he not a little embarrassed 
when he sees the unemployed workers in the maritimes and Quebec 
who protested  vehemently against the cuts in unemployment 
insurance? Does he not think it is somewhat immoral that a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8948"> 8948 </A></B>
<P>
government that collects $12 billion more than expected cut about 
$1 billion annually in benefits for the unemployed, the poorest in 
our society? Is that not immoral?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, as the Leader of the Opposition knows perfectly well, 
when we made structural changes in programs like the employment 
insurance program, the main objective was not to reduce the deficit 
but to provide some impetus for job creation. The changes were 
necessary to update these programs.
<P>
	Second, I will give you an example of what the Prime Minister 
just said. The previous government forecast a deficit of $32 billion 
for 1993, and when we came to power, we found it was $42 billion. 
As for the $6 billion change last month, changes are always made 
at the end of the financial year. We have worked very hard to 
rebuild the government's credibility and that is why we did this.
<P>
	Something else now. In his first question to the Prime Minister, 
the Leader of the Opposition hinted to the Prime Minister that he 
should give me a raise, and if he wants to make a habit of this, I 
wish he would stay.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, he certainly does not deserve a bonus for coming up with 
$12 billion extra on the backs of the unemployed and the least 
fortunate members of our society. The unemployed are not getting 
any bonuses.
<P>
	Let us talk about Canadian solidarity and equity, because that 
seems to be the new slogan of the Liberal propaganda machine on 
the eve of the election campaign, a slogan paid for with taxpayers' 
money and appearing in ads in several dailies this morning.
<P>
	This is what my question to the Prime Minister is about. Is the 
Prime Minister going to put his own propaganda slogan ``Canadian 
solidarity and equity'' into practice by handing over the $2 billion 
he owes the Quebec government for harmonizing the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on 
the one hand, as the member is well aware, when I set the forecasts 
for this year, there were three months to go, the last quarter. At that 
time, I said that this year's budget would not exceed $19 billion. 
There is a possibility that it will be less than $19 billion, as I 
pointed out. Where does the figure of $12 billion come from? I do 
not know. I think it was plucked out of thin air.
<P>
	As far as Quebec's claim is concerned, the member knows very 
well that Quebec has not lost any money.  Under the formula, 
provinces that lost more than 5 per cent of their revenues were 
entitled to compensation. Quebec did not lose more than 5 per cent. 
Quebec is in exactly the same position as Ontario, British 
Columbia and Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our forecasts are based on figures from his own 
department, nowhere else. It is disgusting to hide the true size of 
the deficit in order to conceal one's failure to do anything about 
unemployment and the rise in poverty. That is the plain truth of it.
<P>
	As for the GST, the Minister of Finance is the only one giving 
out this version. The reaction throughout Canada, and from the 
Premier of British Columbia in particular, whom I quote, is that: 
``The federal government must treat all provinces equally. If it 
compensates three Atlantic provinces, it must also compensate 
Quebec''.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is in an apparently indefensible political 
position. What is he waiting for to admit his error and pay Quebec 
$2 billion so as to compensate it fairly and equitably as it is 
requesting?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
have a little trouble understanding how the member can tell me I 
am hiding figures, when he says his own figures come from my 
department.
<P>
	That having been said, I do not know where he has come up with 
the amount of $12 billion. He may have done some calculations, 
but unfortunately, as with other calculations, they were erroneous.
<P>
	When we look at how Confederation is functioning, when we 
look, for example, at technological partnership, Quebec has 
received over 60 to 70 percent of the spinoffs to date. Quebec is 
now receiving 31 per cent of transfer payments, with only 24 per 
cent of the population, so we can see that Quebec is certainly 
receiving its fair share, if not more. It would be very detrimental to 
Quebec if the member were to continue in this vein. It is very clear 
that Quebec has made money by harmonizing, while the other 
provinces have lost more than 5 per cent.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last month while the government was trotting out its 
budget, 38,000 full time jobs disappeared, 44,000 women lost 
either part time or full time employment, and our young people 
were dropping out of the workforce at a record not seen since the 
1960s.
<P>
	The so-called federal jobs strategy is an unmitigated disaster 
with 1.5 million people unemployed, 2 to 3 million underem-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8949"> 8949 </A></B>
<P>
ployed, 800,000 people working at two  jobs to make ends meet, 
and 1 out of 4 workers afraid of losing their jobs.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not simply admit that the federal 
jobs strategy has been a disaster and start taking a new tack based 
on tax relief?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have had occasions to talk a lot about the economic 
policies of the government. We have been accused by the Bloc 
Quebecois of being too successful in our fight against the deficit.
<P>
	As a result of our policies, a situation has been created where at 
this moment we have the lowest interest rates in 35 years in 
Canada.
<P>
	Anyone who reads the newspaper will realize that sales of 
durable goods are increasing very fast and housing sales are 
improving very fast. It is moving so fast that, I read in the Toronto 
Star yesterday, some people in Toronto are selling their homes for 
more money than the asking price.
<P>
	This is a sign that the market is developing and the policy of low 
interest reduction of deficit is the best way to create jobs. This is 
why we have managed over the last three and a half years to create 
more jobs than Italy, Germany, France and Great Britain together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Prime Minister lists off the jobs that have been 
created in Canada by the private sector, he only tells half the story. 
He never tells about the jobs that have been killed by high 
government taxes.
<P>
	The government has never said how many jobs it has killed 
through the $2 billion increase in GST. How many jobs have been 
killed by the $15 billion increase in personal income taxes? How 
many jobs will be killed by the $10 billion increase in payroll taxes 
proposed by the government?
<P>
	The 1.5 million unemployed Canadians would like to hear the 
other side of the story. If the Prime Minister wants to tell the whole 
story, will he tell the House how many jobs have been killed in 
Canada by his high tax policies?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have not increased any taxes since we formed the 
government. However, because growth has come back into the 
economy we have received more revenue.
<P>
	It is very fascinating that the leader of the third party does not 
distinguish between tax levels and revenues. If we gained more 
revenue it is because people are working more. There is more 
economic activity which is bringing in revenues to the government. 
This is why the deficit is lower than predicted.
<P>
	This is also why short term interest rates in Canada are 2.5 per 
cent below short term interest rates in the United States. This is 
why interest rates in Canada have dropped by more 4 per cent in the 
last two years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I lay before the House two irrefutable facts. First, the 
Liberal government is taxing Canadians more heavily than any 
federal government in history.
<P>
	Second, we have the worst string of unemployment numbers 
since the depression, 77 consecutive months with the 
unemployment rate over 9 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	There is a connection between these two facts. We are 
demanding, in the name of 1.5 million unemployed Canadians, that 
the government acknowledges the connection.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister finally acknowledge that taxes, taxes, 
taxes kill jobs, jobs, jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, the leader of the Reform Party ought to know that when the 
Prime Minister refers to job creation he is referring to net job 
creation. Those are additional jobs in the economy.
<P>
	Second, we should also be very clear that the debate is not over 
whether there should be tax cuts. The debate is what kind of tax 
cuts should we bring in. In the last budget we brought in over a 
three-year period more than $2 billion in tax cuts for the physically 
disabled, students and low income Canadians.
<P>
	If we want to understand the kind of tax cuts the Reform Party is 
talking about, under its program a single parent earning $30,000 
with two children will get a tax cut of $175. Under the same 
program a one-earner couple earning $250,000 with two children 
will get a tax cut of $6,700.
<P>
	This is not about giving Canadians a tax cut. It is about 
rewarding Reform's rich friends.

provincial and federal charters of rights, but these charters were not 
created to protect the likes of the Rock Machine and the Hell's

<P>
	Can the Prime Minister make a personal commitment, on behalf

that will ban the Rock Machine and the Hell's Angels in Canada, as 
acknowledged groups of criminals and law-breakers?

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone knows that the administration of justice within 
a province falls under the jurisdiction of the provincial 
government. I would like to tell the hon. member that the Quebec 
Minister of Public Security, Robert Perrault, has said that a bill 
such as the hon. member is calling for is not a magical solution.
<P>
	In November 1995, former Quebec Minister of Public Security 
Serge Ménard made the following comment: ``I remain convinced 
that what we lack to fight organized crime is not legislation but 
sustained law enforcement, and we have just taken a giant step in 
that direction''. On September 26, the same minister said the 
following: ``Quebec police authorities have all the means available 
to them to control the explosion of violence between rival 
motorcycle gangs. They do not need an anti-gang law to do so''.
<P>
	When the Quebec police authorities say they have all the 
legislation they need, and when this is something that falls under 
their jurisdiction, it surprises me that the person who may be leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois next week is already starting to meddle in 
provincial affairs, whereas I respect the autonomy of Minister 
Perreault and his predecessor, Mr. Ménard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I imagine the Prime Minister is aware that the Criminal 
Code is a federal matter. I would imagine that, after 33 years, he 
must at least know that. I imagine he does. And I did not make any 
reference to an anti-gang law.
<P>
	The Prime Minister tells us that the police forces have 
everything they need when, in fact, those who have everything they 
need to sit back and laugh in our faces are groups such as the Rock 
Machine and the Hell's Angels.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	I again ask the Prime Minister: Because the Criminal Code is 
under federal jurisdiction, is he going to use the notwithstanding 
clause in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to outlaw the Rock 
Machine and the Hell's Angels? The choice is clear. Is the Prime 
Minister going to protect the public, or the Rock Machine and 
Hell's Angels?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my response to the hon. member is that I myself have 
been Minister of Justice, and I am very proud to have been the one 
responsible for giving all Canadians a charter of rights and 
freedoms.
<P>
	I take great pride in saying that, before making any changes to 
the Criminal Code, any good federal minister of justice consults 
and listens to those with the responsibility, such as the provincial 
attorneys-general and ministers responsible for police forces.
<P>
	Even though the Quebec authorities are saying that they do not 
need an anti-gang law to deal with the problem, that what is 
required is proper co-ordination between the various levels of 
government, the various jurisdictions, the would-be leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois is now asking me, a respecter of the Constitution, 
to become a big bad centralizer.

allowing one and a half million men and women to remain 
unemployed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have now been in this House for a little over three years. We 
have heard Reform members stand up time and time again talking 
about the problems of the day.
<P>
	After the first budget we said that we would have a balanced 
approach, that we would cut spending and deal with jobs. The 
Reform Party said do not deal with jobs, cut the deficit further. In 
the second and third budgets we said exactly the same thing.
<P>
	What we have is a picture of the Reform Party swallowing itself 
whole. Reformers stand up and try to defend health care after 
attacking health care for three years. They stand up and attack the 
government's economic policy when they said they did not care 
about jobs.
<P>
	The hon. member has a chance in his preamble. His leader said 
in Penticton that jobs were not a priority for the Reform Party. He 
said that if he brought in his program there would be fewer jobs 
today than there were three years ago. Does he deny it? Will he 
stand up in the House and deny what his leader said in Penticton? If

he  is not prepared to say that his leader said that, then he should sit 
down and let the country get on with the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
completely false and the finance minister knows it. The Reform 
Party is the only party that has offered a real alternative to the 
government's failed job creation policies in this country. Only the 
finance minister would call 1.5 million people unemployed a 
balanced approach to job creation. It is absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	This week in the Senate committee studying the BST the 
minister confessed that lower taxes would create jobs in Atlantic 
Canada. By extension, obviously if we had lower taxes across the 
country we would have lower unemployment across the country.
<P>
	Why then is the finance minister continuously trotting out 
rinky-dink programs like his infrastructure programs and his 
recycled training programs when he admits that lower taxes are the 
best way to create jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
rinky-dink, rinky-dink, the infrastructure program, tell that to 
every mayor and municipality in this country.

	Let us keep going. Rinky-dink, the R and D program for every 
university and every teaching hospital. Tell that to the teaching 
hospitals. Tell it to the universities.

	Rinky-dink, helping students go back to school, helping workers 
return to the job market. That is rinky-dink. I will tell you,Mr. Speaker, that is value and we will put our values against 
Reform values any time.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	On Monday, in response to a question on the adjustments the 
minister had to make just two months after his bill's 
implementation, he said, and I quote: ``Where unemployment is at 
10 per cent, there is less likelihood of finding work that would give 
people longer weeks. The aim of our system is precisely to 
encourage people to accept as much work as possible''.
<P>
	If that was really the minister's objective, how can he justify the 
fact that the regions where unemployment is above 10 per cent for 
unemployment insurance purposes, like the Montérégie and Hull, 
and those that will exceed this figure are not included in the 
adjustments? How does he explain that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as you know, we were 
committed to monitoring the transition of  employment insurance 
very closely, and that is what we did.
<P>
	The adjustments we made in the second month after its 
implementation were made precisely because we are an attentive 
government and do our work carefully.
<P>
	We wanted to cover the 29 regions with unemployment above10 per cent, because we felt the problem was greater there, as work 
is harder to find. So, where unemployment is at 10 per cent, we will 
have two solutions. One will enable workers to combine weeks or 
ignore weeks so that, at the end of 18 months, we can compare one 
system with another or evaluate the fact that we did not touch the 
system. We will be able to compare three elements.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should understand that, from the time the provisions were 
on the table, we and others said that people would be discouraged 
from working, because they are penalized for working short weeks.

measures were designed not to solve the real problem with his bill,

political cynicism. From the moment we fix a problem, what we 
should do in the weeks and months that follow, what it is our duty 
to do, is continue to listen to the people of Canada, to the Atlantic 
provinces and to Quebec, which asked us to resolve this problem.

amendments demanded by the Bloc Quebecois to seal off the

however, got all upset about the modifications, despite the fact that 
they were justified.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a split 
decision today in the Federal Court of Appeal, Justices Linden and 
Henry decided that the Canadian standard for the issuance of a 
search of warrant was required to be satisfied before the justice 
minister submitted the letter of request to the Swiss authorities to 
search and seize Karlheinz Schrieber's bank documents and 
records.
<P>
	In laymen's terms, the Department of Justice was on a fishing 
expedition without a legal base to do so. This has resulted in an 
expenditure of millions of dollars of taxpayer money defending 
unjustified actions.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister going to waste more taxpayer dollars to 
appeal this case to the Supreme Court in an attempt to carry on the 
pretence that he and his government have a legal leg to stand on?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I just heard of this judgment. I think that one would want to have it 
carefully reviewed by the law officers of the crown. The principles 
involved in my view are rather important and one should not reject 
categorically the possibility that this case should be appealed to the 
Supreme Court of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	In December 1995, the Canadian government unilaterally 
eliminated customs duties on car parts manufactured outside the 
country, but assembled here. The companies that benefitted from 
this measure would now like the Liberal government to eliminate 
customs duties on finished vehicles.
<P>
	Given that Canada has a substantial automobile industry 
employing over 500,000 people and generating billions of dollars 
in the economies of Quebec and Canada, will the minister commit 
today to not reduce or eliminate customs duties on imported 
vehicles?
<P>

will respond for the three of us. The matter is under consideration. 
We will make an announcement as soon as we are ready.

spend a lot of money to give the Parks Canada mascot a new image. 
At the same time people who work at the national parks and our

<P>

when the quality of service at our parks and national historic sites is 
deteriorating?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

his question from the article I read in the paper, it spoke about a 
beaver upgrade that was to modernize the symbol of the beaver.
<P>
	It cost about $30,000 over a period of about two and a half years. 
It predated my arrival in the department, but I can say that if the 
department is looking for a symbol Canadians will recognize from 
coast to coast to coast, without having to pay a penny, we have that 
symbol. That symbol is right over there. It is called the Canadian 
flag.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a matter of grave 
injustice that occurred yesterday in the public gallery of this place.
<P>
	As you have pointed out, Mr. Speaker, a young Micmac woman, 
Melissa Labrador, who was visiting us as a participant in the Forum 
for Young Canadians, was refused entry to the public gallery while 
carrying a sacred eagle feather.
<P>
	Traditionally an eagle feather represents courage, strength, 
wisdom, vision, and is sacred. It is the closest connection to the 
Creator. The presentation of an eagle feather is the highest honour a 
person can receive. The eagle flies highest and sees the farthest.
<P>
	This morning I had the opportunity to offer my personal regret to 
Melissa Labrador for this unfortunate moment. However the hurt 
goes deeper. Melissa has asked for a public apology from the 
government and I  am prepared today, on behalf of the government, 
to extend an apology to all aboriginal people.
<P>
	I am pleased that you, as Speaker of the House, as keeper of the 
conscience of the House, are ensuring that no such incident every 
occurs again in this place.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> On a statement by ministers, if representatives of 
the two official parties wish to make a statement they have the 
same amount of time as the minister.
<P>
	I put a question to the member for Lethbridge. Are you rising on 
the statement by this minister?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> And, you will respond for the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the Reform Party of Canada I would certainly like to support the 
action you have taken as Speaker of this assembly and the Minister 
for Aboriginal Affairs for the recognition and the apology extended 
to the young lady who was deterred from coming into our gallery. 
We certainly want to support that apology and recognize that quick 
action was taken.
<P>
	It is very difficult for the security people under the variety of 
circumstances they face when different people come to the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	I recall a somewhat similar situation in the Alberta legislature. A 
security person was asked to take very aggressive action and to be 
careful that no one arrived in the galleries who may do something 
that could harm someone sitting on the floor of the legislature.
<P>
	In this case it was the House of Commons. I hope consideration 
will be given to the actions of the security person as well. I am sure 
the person applied the law as he thought fit at the moment. Maybe a 
misjudgement was made. We have rectified that at this time, but 
some concern should also be expressed from the House to the 
security personnel that have done an exceptional job under many 
circumstances for us as members of Parliament.

	The Bloc Quebecois and the people of Quebec have always had 
great respect for aboriginal people, as demonstrated time and time 
again in our long-standing relations with these people. We regret 
such an incident occurred. That is why, today, we want to make it

people is always there.

which we deserve to be congratulated. It is time that we, on this 
side of the House, take stock and condemn the government which is 
blissfully moving toward an election, as if things were going well, 
when in fact Quebec and Canada are in a deep slump.
<P>
	The motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government which, because of its policies, is 
in large measure responsible for increasing poverty in the regions of Quebec, 
especially the loss of 10,000 jobs at Canada Post; the offloading of regional airports 
and ports without adequate financial compensation; the tightening of employment 
insurance eligibility criteria that has adversely affected seasonal workers, among 
others; the setting of fees for coast guard services; the significant reductions in 
fishing quotas in Quebec; the refusal to extend the framework agreement on regional 
economic development with the Quebec government; and, finally, increasing 
unilateral intervention in regional development matters without consideration of 
Quebec's areas of jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will deal with certain issues mentioned in the motion, and leave 
it to my colleagues to discuss other ones. I should point out from 
the outset that, as regards regional development, a frame of 
reference called the Economic and Regional Development 
Agreement, the ERDA, has been in place since 1974, between the 
Quebec and federal governments, as the secretary of state probably 
knows.
<P>
	The Liberal government opposite is increasingly circumventing 
this agreement, which has been in existence for over 20 years and 
which led to the harmonization of relations between the two levels 
of government with respect to regional development, which  is 
recognized as a primarily provincial, Quebec in this case, area of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	One needs to know that, in 1993, when the members across the 
way came to power, 62 per cent of funding for regional 
development came by way of the ERDA, while today, in 1996, we 
are receiving only 33 per cent in this manner. In other words, two 
thirds of these public funds are being used as the federal 
government sees fit, sometimes arbitrarily, supposedly in an 
attempt to promote regional development.
<P>
	Why? So that the federal government can be more visible, score 
political points. So that the Secretary of State for the Federal Office 
of Regional Development for Quebec can visit the 53 CFDCs and 
score political points on behalf of his government, cut ribbons, 
smile nicely, hold press conferences and pretend that there is 
harmony between the Government of Quebec and the federal 
government and that there is a genuine intervention and consensus 
strategy, when in fact there is not.
<P>
	What there really is, in the case of CFDCs, is competition with 
regional economic development corporations, which have been 
there for a long time and which were created by the Government of 
Quebec and come under its jurisdiction, coming under the 
department of industry and commerce for example.
<P>
	In addition to this hit and miss approach, there is also the fact 
that it is being done through the federal office of regional 
development. They do this by circumventing and duplicating what 
is being done or what was already being done in Quebec. Recently 
they changed the mandate of FORD-Q. It was supposed to analyze 
submissions from small businesses seeking grants, and evaluate 
their projects. Funding was cut, so the mandate was changed. 
Instead of getting rid of this agency, they changed its mandate and 
turned its employees into advisers to small business, a role that was 
already being played by the Department of Industry and Trade.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	They set up the Idée-PME program which is directly targeted to 
small businesses in Quebec and is in a way competing, at 
taxpayers' expense, with other public sector resources for small 
businesses, which tends to make the whole process of seeking 
financial assistance from the government unnecessarily complex.
<P>
	Things are also changing at the Federal Business Development 
Bank. The name has been changed. It is now called, rather 
pretentiously, in my opinion, the Business Development Bank of 
Canada. The legislation authorizes the federal government to 
approach local and regional stakeholders under the jurisdiction of 
the Government of Quebec. Arbitrarily, without prior consultation, 
the government decides to intervene in a jurisdiction that belongs 
to the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	We can hardly call this co-operation. We can hardly call this 
strategy. Certainly not when we are talking about  the so-called 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8959"> 8959 </A></B>
<P>
co-operation between the Government of Quebec and the 
Government of Canada, with taxpayers' money, not hand-outs as 
the Secretary of State for Regional Development sometimes seems 
to imply, as though it was federal money, not money paid by 
Quebecers through their taxes. We should not forget this.
<P>
	On a macro-economic level, I think we should compare 
FORD-Q with its Canadian equivalents. There are two. In Eastern 
Canada we have ACOA, for the development of the maritime 
provinces and in Western Canada, the Western Economic 
Diversification Agency.
<P>
	Suppose we stick to ACOA. Compared with what Quebec 
receives through FORD-Q, if we consider the number of 
unemployed workers concerned in Quebec and compare this with 
the number of unemployed workers in the maritimes, the latter 
receive four times as much for an equivalent number of 
unemployed, if we look at it on that basis. If we look at it on a per 
capita basis, it is five times as much. So this is the profitable 
federalism the secretary of state was talking about last week when I 
asked him a question about regional development.
<P>
	Remember also that not only do the maritimes receive far more 
proportionally, but altogether, in terms of regional development, 
the maritimes receive five times as much money from Ottawa as 
Quebec does.
<P>
	Furthermore, we have this very controversial decision, and 
Quebecers are becoming increasingly upset about this, the decision 
by the Government of Canada to give the maritimes $1 billion in 
compensation for harmonizing the GST. Of this $1 billion, part of 
which goes to New Brunswick, $250 million comes from Quebec, 
and part of that will go to New Brunswick. Thanks to this money, 
the engaging Premier of New Brunswick will be able to use 
Quebec's tax money to recruit Quebec industrialists and bring them 
to New Brunswick, thus competing with the Government of 
Quebec and the Quebec economy. This is appalling. In fact, there is 
evidence that this was going on during the recent trip to China by 
Team Canada.
<P>
	It also needs to be known that, where the GST is concerned, not 
only did the maritimes get $1 billion but, as was pointed out during 
question period, using a cooked-up formula the Minister of Finance 
finds ever so pleasing, the Government of Canada is refusing to 
provide Quebec with the same amount, proportionally, which 
would be in the order of $2 billion, compared to their $1 billion. 
This offers a clear illustration of the cost-effective federalism the 
Secretary of State referred to last week.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Where a number of activities are concerned, the concept of 
regional development can be broad and vague on occasion. One of 
those activities is the coast guard, which was also referred to in the 
motion. The coast guard  was inherited by Fisheries and Oceans 
from Transport Canada, with a mandate to manage the ports of 
Canada, including those along the St. Lawrence, and it was decided 
to charge users of the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	This three-tier fee system involves charges for navigational aids, 
that is buoys, lighthouses and so forth, as well as charges for 
dredging the river and the waterways leading to the St. Lawrence 
ports and for icebreaking. The latter is the most significant, and 
would be the most painful, if ever the federal government sticks 
with its decision to set fees which would net the federal 
government $160 million over the next three years leading up to 
the year 2000. All of this totally ignores any possible impact 
studies available. The actions taken in this area were the product of 
an amateurish approach by those concerned only about the costs of 
the coast guard, apparently without any concern for the major 
negative impacts that might result if this new fee scale is 
implemented as the government plans.
<P>
	Seventy-five per cent of the witnesses, who knew what they were 
talking about, who knew how to do a case-by-case impact study, 
begged the federal government to reconsider, because of the threat 
this represented to the competitiveness of the St. Lawrence ports 
compared to their competitors on the U.S. east coast, the Canadian 
east coast, and even the Mississippi.
<P>
	Since you are indicating to me that my time is up, I will conclude 
by saying that the way the federal government is going about this 
illustrates the ever more pressing necessity for Quebec to attain 
sovereignty so it can finally be in charge, and for the federal 
government to stop being involved, not in regional development, 
but in regional anti-development.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will have 
the opportunity in a while to talk at length on the Canadian 
government's intervention strategy with respect to regional 
development and specifically in the Province of Quebec, my area 
of responsibility.
<P>
	I would like to say right off that the government's strategy 
applies to the country as a whole and is aimed at bringing the 
government and the people closer together to enable the 
government to be sensitive to the needs of the people and to give 
the public the full benefit of its services.
<P>
	I listened to the previous speaker, my colleague from 
Trois-Rivières, talking about the rural development agreement. In 
the light of what he was saying, I have a hard time understanding 
the fact that my colleague does not seem to realize that the regional 
development agreement has expired. My colleague seems not to 
understand either that the renewal of the regional development 
agreement was in doubt and that discussions were held between the 
Province of Quebec and the Government of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8960"> 8960 </A></B>
<P>
	I would ask him if he is aware of these discussions.
<P>
	In closing, my colleague said that I spent my time giving press 
conferences and cutting ribbons. I have the impression that the 
ribbons I cut must be 24 carat gold because the official opposition 
is focusing on them on a day set aside for regional development. 
However, I can understand that it might hurt them too, because our 
government is particularly effective in the area of regional 
development.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	In my colleague's riding of Trois-Rivières, for example, we have 
invested over $7 million since 1993. If he asks the people there if 
they think we should leave, he will see what they have to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to these agreements, I 
will answer that we know, and the secretary of state is well aware, 
that this kind of agreement has been around since 1974. We are also 
very well aware that the last one was not renewed.
<P>
	We know that it was not renewed because the federal 
government wants to have an increasingly large say in the 
management of these agreements. It wants to put pressure on the 
Government of Quebec, which is a constitutionally legitimate 
body, to call the shots on regional development. Either the federal 
government wants to circumvent the Government of Quebec, or it 
wants to get along with it. Increasing power is needed if regional 
development is to be carried out on the pan- Canadian scale he 
mentioned.
<P>
	We, however, claim that we have our own way of doing things. 
In this regard, it would perhaps be a good opportunity for the 
secretary of state to give some meaning to the empty notions of 
distinct society the Prime Minister is so proud of saying he 
introduced, or tried to introduce, into the Constitution, when we 
know it is an empty shell. Perhaps the member for Outremont could 
make an effort to recognize that the people to which he belongs 
have a different way of doing things, instead of trying to get us to 
swallow a Canadian vision and logic, which is causing Quebec to 
lose out on regional development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments 
of the minister, and particularly of the member for Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	Given that Quebec is receiving $11 billion more than it 
contributes to the Canadian federation, given the importance of the 
role of governments in regional development, could the member 
explain to us where SDI stands? Where does Innovatech stand? 
Where do Quebec's provincial organizations stand in relation to 
regional development?
<P>
	The federal government is investing, but a number of regional 
development projects are on hold because of the footdragging of 
the opposition and especially of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, this illustrates perfectly the 
contempt these people have for the Government of Quebec and for 
Quebecers.
<P>
	When we talk about a surplus of $11 billion, it is because we are 
pleased to be receiving unemployment insurance, we are pleased to 
be poor. We are pleased to have no real economic development. We 
are pleased to have no strategy. We are pleased to be poor.
<P>
	This is a Quebecer telling us this. It is hard to believe. When we 
talk about the SDI, the Caisse de dépôt, these are organizations 
that, with the Quebec Department of Industry and Commerce, are 
working daily to try to improve the situation as much as they can 
within a constitutional context that gives the Government of 
Quebec barely half the powers to try to organize its development 
year in and year out.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great interest that I rise today to speak to the motion of my 
colleague, the member for Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	This motion condemns the federal government which, because 
of its disastrous policies, is in large measure responsible for 
increasing poverty in the regions of Quebec. My riding of 
Laurentides covers a large part of the Laurentides region, which is 
subdivided into the Hautes and the Basses-Laurentides. The 
Basses-Laurentides, closer to the Montreal area, have more heavy 
industry, while the Hautes-Laurentides further north, rely more on 
small business and tourism in particular.
<P>
	My riding, which begins in the St-Jérôme area and ends over 100 
kilometres further north, therefore depends for its livelihood on 
small business and tourism.
<P>
	I will start off by looking at the tightening of employment 
insurance eligibility criteria, which will have a major impact on my 
riding, given the heavy reliance on tourism. Tourism is seasonal 
and implies seasonal workers.
<P>
	The new criteria will mean that fewer workers will receive 
benefits and that the benefits for those who qualify will be reduced. 
For a riding like mine, where the unemployment rate is already 
higher than the average for Quebec, this means even less money for 
workers, even more workers forced to go on welfare. This shortfall 
in workers' income therefore means more poverty.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In regional economies with high unemployment and poverty, UI 
reform will make matters worse. The Liberal government is 
certainly not going to help the regions survive and develop by 
driving people into poverty. Let us not forget that the Liberals are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8961"> 8961 </A></B>
<P>
drawing money  directly out of the UI fund, which consists of 
money paid by workers and by employers, over $5 billion this year, 
in order to reduce its deficit. It is utterly shocking.
<P>
	Another area that is of particular interest to regions in Quebec is 
that of highway transport. Everyone knows that our highway 
system in Quebec has deteriorated and is now in need of major 
investments to keep it in good condition.
<P>
	Let us look at what the federal government is spending in this 
area, and what it has set aside for Quebec. Between 1952 and 1986, 
although Quebecers were paying the same federal gasoline taxes as 
other Canadians, Quebec received a measly 16.5 per cent of federal 
spending on roads. Between 1986 and 1988, this fell to 13 per cent. 
In 1991-92, Quebec received only 4.2 per cent of federal transfer 
payments to the provinces to help build, repair and upgrade roads. 
Yet federal fuel taxes in Quebec are close to $1 billion. In return, 
the Quebec road system receives on average only $30 million 
annually. Thirty million out of one billion: a windfall for the 
federal government but grossly unfair to Quebec.
<P>
	This shortfall in revenue has a serious impact on regional 
development, since the highway system is an essential tool for 
development. People from the Outaouais and Ontario who go 
skiing at Mont-Tremblant in my riding know that the highway 
system is not good if they take the road north at Montebello. But 
they do not know that the federal government is not providing its 
share of funding for Quebec's highway system.
<P>
	Another issue that directly concerns the people of Laurentides, 
one that has been in the headlines for several months, is Mirabel 
airport, a perfect example of the inefficiency and devastating 
impact of federal intervention in Quebec territory with respect to 
air transportation.
<P>
	In 1969, without any consultation, the federal government 
unilaterally decided to proceed with the most extensive 
expropriation exercise ever seen in this country, involving 80,000 
acres of farm land, to be used to build Mirabel international airport. 
Twenty-seven years later, we know that 5,000 acres would have 
been ample for the airport's needs.
<P>
	The federal government estimated that 30 million passengers 
would be going through Mirabel by 1990. Today, Mirabel and 
Dorval together get only 8.3 million passengers annually. When 
Mirabel was under construction, the federal government said it 
wanted to make greater Montreal the port of entry for air traffic in 
eastern North America. A few years later, it awarded the seven 
largest European carriers the right to land in Toronto. This federal 
decision was to be the main reason why Montreal never became the 
port of entry for European traffic in eastern North America.
<P>
	Add to this the federal government's refusal to proceed with 
phase II of the Mirabel master plan under  which domestic traffic 
would gradually be transferred from Dorval to Mirabel. We now 
see the disastrous effects of having two airports side-by-side, with 
all the communications problems that entails. Twenty years ago, 
Montreal airport attracted almost as many passengers as Toronto, 
but in 1995, Montreal dropped to third place, with 8.3 million 
passengers annually, after Toronto with 20.9 million and 
Vancouver with 11.1 million.
<P>
	Out of 53 countries which had access rights to Montreal, only 17 
exercised those rights.
<P>
	Always without public consultation, Aéroports de Montréal, 
ADM, created by the federal government to manage Mirabel and 
Dorval, announced in February 1996 that international flights 
would be transferred from Mirabel to Dorval. This decision is the 
latest in a series of ill-conceived decisions and mistakes by the 
federal government, as former Liberal minister André Ouellet was 
to comment.
<P>
	During this time, irreparable damage has been done to the 
volume of air transportation in Montreal, hundreds of millions of 
taxpayer money has been wasted and more than 10,000 
expropriated landowners have suffered.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The federal government's bungling, its lack of vision, and its 
contradictory decisions in particular, will have accomplished 
nothing more than to deprive Montreal of its role as air traffic hub, 
in favour of Toronto.
<P>
	Other subjects concern the people of the Laurentians, a matter 
linked directly to the federal government: the federal wish to 
introduce measures to register, and set fees for, sailboats, rowboats, 
pedal boats, canoes, kayaks and so on. Ottawa would like to 
register all pleasure boats, to make their owners purchase licences 
which would cost from $5 to $35 yearly, to require minimum skill 
and knowledge levels of all persons operating these boats, and to 
set up a system of fines similar to those for motor vehicles. For the 
Laurentians, with their numerous lakes, such a measure would be a 
total catastrophe. This tax in disguise would be unacceptable, and 
the proposed monitoring measures unenforceable.
<P>
	An idea like the one proposed by the Liberals is quite simply 
buffoonery. There are, I believe, more important things to be doing 
than going around putting licence stickers on pedal boats and 
making sure that those using them are pedalling forward, 
backward, or whatever.
<P>
	Another thing: the federal decision to require Canada Post to 
withdraw from delivering ad mail, with the loss of 10,000 jobs. 
That is surely the biggest single job loss in the country. The 
government claims that the private sector can easily take over, but 
that is far from reality for regions with low population density. The 
costs of private distribution are far higher in these regions. Thus, 
the federal government's decision means the virtual disappearance 
of ad mail in many regions, and considerable job losses in those 
same regions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8962"> 8962 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, for the farmers in my riding, the federal government 
keep on cutting back the budgets and services affecting them. In 
the latest budget, the federal government announced the total 
elimination of dairy subsidies. This will translate into a $107 
million loss for Quebec.
<P>
	Since you are indicating that I have just one minute left, I will 
move on to my conclusion immediately.
<P>
	The various matters I have addressed demonstrate clearly that 
the Liberals bear a large share of the responsibility for the 
impoverishment of the various regions of Quebec. Their decisions 
are unfair to Quebec, and they have the effect of pushing it even 
closer to the edge. The coming election will show the Liberals what 
their strategy to isolate and crush Quebec has really done. 
Quebecers are not blind; they are capable of judging the actions of 
the little guy from Shawinigan and his gang.
<P>
	All of this shows Quebecers even more clearly that their future 
path is the one that leads to sovereignty. Not even Chrétien, Martin, 
Dion or Pettigrew can deter us from that path, which for us is a 
natural and a rational one.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
other side of this House, they are talking about the federal 
government's bungling of regional development. I can tell you that, 
if the federal government bungled regional development, we would 
not be having an opposition day today. However, I will take the few 
minutes I have to talk to some of the issues raised by my colleague. 
First is the matter of unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I was one of the Quebec spokespersons on this reform. I 
believed, I believe and I will always believe in this reform. This 
government had the backbone to carry out a reform that everyone 
wanted, that was indicated by all of the international organizations, 
starting with the OECD. The employment insurance reform will 
make the system fairer, will make more seasonal workers eligible 
for benefits, and will ensure greater stability of contributions.
<P>
	We will recall that, in 1993, the Conservatives had predicted 
higher contributions. With our reform, we not only lowered them, 
but ensured their stability.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	In addition, the program now has active measures to enable 
workers to be trained in order to quickly return to the labour 
market. This is what we have done.
<P>
	Inappropriate remarks are also being made about the 
employment insurance surplus. Yes, there is a surplus at the 
moment. However, people always neglect to mention that, during 
the recession at the end of the 1980s and at the start of the 1990s, 
the unemployment insurance-now  the employment 
insurance-fund was at least $5 billion in the hole.
<P>
	Who looked after fixing the deficit? Who looked after paying the 
interest? The Government of Canada, which guaranteed Canadians 
continued benefits. That is what profitable Canadian federalism 
with a vision of security is all about.
<P>
	Finally, I find it a bit odd, and I want to link up with my 
colleague for industry, that these people are becoming much more, 
in fact, overly centralizing. Now they are asking the Government of 
Canada to become involved in roads and highways, which are 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin by replying to the hon. 
member for Outremont.
<P>
	The reason there is an opposition day on regional development is 
because there is a lot of bungling that we wanted to draw attention 
to.
<P>
	When we speak about employment, or unemployment, 
insurance, I do not know whether the minister is very aware, and 
we see here the pressure brought to bear, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was already forced to make changes to his 
bill because it does not work. Worse yet, with this bill, people are 
going to pay premiums and never be able to draw benefits.
<P>
	Seasonal workers in an area of my riding where up to 75 per cent 
of workers are seasonal are going to pay premiums and never be 
able to draw UI because it is based on the number of hours now and 
because the system was not designed with them in mind. So he has 
nothing to teach us, because we are the ones who see these people 
in our riding offices and we are the ones who have to work with 
them.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the minister, who is responsible for 
regional development, that it is very important that he pay more 
attention to the Mirabel situation, that he speak to his colleague in 
transport and bring pressure to bear to get things moving, so that 
my region no longer has to pay the price because of an error made 
by this government that he is perpetuating.
<P>
	So make a decision and do something for the people of our areas 
who have been suffering for years because of a decision made by 
this government.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity today to speak to the motion 
presented by the official opposition. This will give me a chance to 
expand on the role played by the Canadian government in regional 
development and also to set the record straight.
<P>
	Before I start my speech, I would like to make the following 
points.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian government plays a fundamental role in regional 
development, not only in Quebec but throughout Canada. And if 
the official opposition wants to try and get the Canadian 
government out of its regional development role, I simply want to 
point out that as long as I have my current responsibilities, I will 
ensure that the interests of all Quebecers are served-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> We saw that with Bill C-71. We saw that with 
the Montreal Grand Prix.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> -and ensure that people wherever they happen 
to be in the province of Quebec have access to the services of the 
Canadian government.
<P>
	Listen to them shouting. They are shouting because this goes 
against their purely partisan dogma.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, let us consider the motion for a moment. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn federal government which, because of its policies, is in 
large measure responsible for increasing poverty in the regions of Quebec-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will not qualify the motion as far-fetched, because this would 
be unparliamentary, but I certainly do not agree with it.
<P>
	Let us recall the fundamental role played by this government 
since 1993. We took over a government that was in trouble. The 
Prime Minister asked for a number of reforms, which were judged 
and considered major reforms. Today, these reforms have started to 
bear fruit to the benefit of all Canadians, which means that in the 
regions people are already enjoying the obvious benefits of these 
reforms.
<P>
	Consider for instance the issue of public finance. Thanks to the 
work done by my colleague, the Minister  of Finance and by all 
Canadians-because everyone did his share so that we can all turn 
the situation around-thanks to all this, today we have the lowest 
interest rates we have had in 35 years.
<P>
	Members opposite refuse to point out the positive effects, the 
positive results that the government has achieved. Take for instance 
a small business in one of the regions, which wants to borrow $1 
million over ten years. The annual savings due to lower interest 
rates amount to $33,400. That is tremendous.
<P>
	And take a private citizen anywhere in Canada who wants to 
borrow $15,000 to buy a car. In terms of the interest he would 
otherwise have to pay he will save about $483 annually.
<P>
	From the outset, the reform of our public finances has produced 
incredible results for all Canadians, so that today we can look to the 
future with optimism. And we also see the economy is picking up.
<P>
	Another reform I would like to mention briefly is of course 
program review, a fundamental reform that allows us to better 
target our programs and rethink the way we do things. This reform 
has also produced tremendous results for the regions.
<P>
	As far as the Federal Office of Regional Development is 
concerned, there used to be some 45 programs, but now there is just 
the one, called IDEE-PME, a sensible and accessible program. This 
program is based on the enhanced contribution potential of the 
Canadian government. It is well focussed, essentially on small and 
medium businesses in the regions, and thus impacts on the driving 
force of economic development. It is a program with a number of 
focal points: R &amp; D innovation, market development, exports in 
particular, all focussed on enhancement. This involves fostering 
entrepreneurship. That, essentially, is the basis of the program
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The other side says that the Canadian government has no reason 
to exist. Just look at the IDEE-PME program. Who can deny that 
the Canadian government has competency, knowledge, expertise, 
where international market development is concerned? What about 
Team Canada and its success, what about the embassies and 
consulates throughout the world?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Who can deny the competency, knowledge and 
expertise of the Canadian government where research and 
development are concerned? The more I have to say, the clearer 
and more striking the truth becomes, and the more they 
holler-which is perfectly normal.
<P>
	Who can deny that the Canadian government knows what it is 
doing when it speaks of the new economy? We are heading toward 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8964"> 8964 </A></B>
<P>
a knowledge-based economy. We  have to create centres of 
knowledge, something the Canadian government has had a hand in 
for some years already. We have been able to create a network of 
institutes or research centres in Quebec that are the envy of many in 
other parts of the world. To mention but a few: the IRB or 
biotechnology research institute, the INO or national optics 
institute, the Institut national de recherche scientifique, the 
National Research Council.
<P>
	I imagine it does not suit my colleague to admit this, but in the 
riding of Trois-Rivières there is an institute that owes its existence 
to the Canadian government: the hydrogen research institute. This 
is our vision within the context of the new economy: to work in 
partnership to create tools that will enable all regions to structure 
themselves and to develop economies which will enable them to be 
competitive nationally and internationally.
<P>
	In terms of innovation, not only are we undeniably competent, 
but, in the last budget, we announced the creation of the Canadian 
foundation for innovation with a budget of $850 million. This 
foundation is based on a partnership. It could have a future budget 
of $2 billion. This initial investment should be followed by 
investments by the private sector or various interested provincial 
governments. The foundation will enable us to intervene in areas 
like health, the environment, the sciences and engineering.
<P>
	The federal government aims to support the public through these 
various development activities and ensure that we can act where we 
really have the skills and the know-how.
<P>
	We can talk now more specifically about our projects in the 
Province of Quebec. Let us look at some examples. In terms of 
market development, and the export market in particular, we have 
set up with the Business Development Bank of Canada and the 
Departments of Industry and Foreign Affairs a program called 
NEXPRO designed to help new exporters. It is providing 1,000 
future exporters with information now through the NEXPRO 
program that will ensure they have the tools they need to penetrate 
markets and face the competition when they reach the point where 
they want to or are able to export.
<P>
	We provided some 30 sessions in Quebec under this program and 
invested over $3 million. In this area as well, we can talk of an 
investment of $150,000 in Estrie international 2007, an export 
commission, already producing interesting results for the region.
<P>
	There is also Chaudière Appalaches, an international marketing 
plan for the tourist industry. This project is supported by over 50 
companies. I could also mention the $50 million in the last budget 
allocated to the Business Development Bank of Canada to help out 
companies in the tourist business.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As for the other area of activity, namely innovation, research and 
development, I could give you the example of the regions of Laval, 
Laurentides and Lanaudière, where $300,000 was provided to the 
Conseil des bio-industries du Québec. This goes to show that we 
are focusing on biotechnology and providing assistance in that 
area. In Abitibi-Témiscamingue, we have helped the Société de 
technologie de l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue.
<P>
	In fact, in every region of Quebec, the FORD has made 
representations to five financial institutions to make nearly $150 
million available to help businesses adapt to the new economy, all 
that in Quebec alone. All this was done through the Federal Office 
for Regional Development to make loans available, while letting 
the banking industry develop a new culture, a new philosophy.
<P>
	On entrepreneurship, we have focused on young people. We 
have worked both together with my colleague, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, and through partnerships, helping 
set up student clubs in colleges and universities and supporting 
these young people so that they can develop the entrepreneurial 
spirit and fibre we will need at the turn of the next century.
<P>
	These investments, and I mentioned only a few, represent only a 
small portion of what we are doing for the public in terms of 
providing a simple yet remarkable structure for regional 
development. There are 13 regional offices across Quebec, 55 
CDICs and 8 CDECs on the island of Montreal. This is a very 
simple and very flexible structure easy to understand for everyone.
<P>
	We want to ensure that our services are readily available and that 
we, the Government of Canada, can keep in touch with the people's 
needs and reality. That is how we were able to act in the 
Gaspé-Lower St. Lawrence-Magdalen Islands region with the 
coastal Quebec program for the North Shore, a $13.5 million 
program. That is how we were able to develop the Montreal 
strategy and help the people in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region.
<P>
	In fact, apart from all this, there is our vision as well as our 
ability and desire to act through various agencies, first the FORD-Q 
but also the CDICs. In addition to all this, we also provide quality 
service. We provide very competent advisers to the public. I have 
worked with the federal office staff for over a year now, and I can 
tell you these people are doing a remarkable job. They are 
dedicated, they care about regional development, and they want 
entrepreneurs to succeed in the regions. This is why the Canadian 
government is proud to be involved and to work with people to 
promote regional development.
<P>
	Members opposite often complain about government 
interference and unilateral action. However, the examples  I just 
mentioned 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8965"> 8965 </A></B>
<P>
are unequivocally based on a consultation of the communities 
concerned, and on a partnership.
<P>
	When the opposition claims that we go over the head of the 
Quebec government to consult directly with the organizations and 
the people who are familiar with regional development, it is not 
insulting my government but, rather, Quebecers who are involved 
in economic development.
<P>
	It is like indirectly telling these people that they are not very 
responsible and that they should be monitored by the Quebec 
government. Let me tell you that the people with whom I work in 
Quebec to promote economic development are very competent. 
They have a vision and the federal government will continue to 
work with them.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The Canada-Quebec agreement was also mentioned. I find it 
really extraordinary to hear the hon. member saying that we 
refused to renew the agreement, that we do not want to proceed 
with an agreement.
<P>
	First of all, the agreement on regional economic development 
with the Quebec government had expired. However, the population 
of Quebec must know that my colleague, the finance minister, who 
was my predecessor as minister responsible for the federal office, 
did approach the Quebec government several times to renew the 
expired agreement. Of course, they do not mention this, but people 
should know about it.
<P>
	In 1995, my colleague approached the Quebec government not 
once, not twice, but four times. We have approached the Quebec 
government four times to sign a harmonization agreement, first on 
January 12, 1995, and then on April 5, July 5 and August 11, 1995.
<P>
	Of course, Quebecers will have understood that that request from 
the Canadian government was refused, even turned down, and they 
will have understood why. A referendum was coming, and since 
those people do not have the best interests of the population at heart 
but only their political interests, there was no way they would help 
show that federalism was working.
<P>
	Therefore, as a responsible government wanting to provide good 
services to the population, we went ahead and reshaped our 
programs. Today, our programs are centred around elements based 
on our services and skills. But I would add that I do think a 
harmonization agreement is not really necessary, since we are 
acting in partnership and this is under our own jurisdiction 
according to the new programming.
<P>
	However, a meeting was organized. Maybe my friends do not 
know it yet because, in view of the motion, I am under the 
impression that they do not know what is happening at their head 
office, but a meeting was held on February 19, 1997, with the 
representatives of the  Federal Office of Regional Development, 
and there are some discussions and exchanges concerning a 
possible agreement. But it is much too soon to say what we think of 
it, since we do not even know what the Quebec government wants.
<P>
	When we do know what they want as a government, we will be 
able to make a decision. Actually, we do not really know with 
whom we should be dealing in that government. Should it beMr. Chevrette, Mrs. Harel or Mr. Trudel? Perhaps my colleague, 
who is familiar with the workings of the head office, could try 
knocking on their doors to find a solution or somebody we could 
deal with.
<P>
	This is essentially what directs our action, and I think it is 
important that we as the Canadian government be dedicated to help 
the regions. Our action is based on the effectiveness of our 
services. It is also based on a deep respect for what the local 
population wants and needs, and for what the situation is locally.
<P>
	To conclude, I think we should first ask my colleague on the 
other side to consult with the head office and ask it to clean up its 
own act as far as regional development is concerned. In fact, a 
white paper will be published soon.
<P>
	What saddens me is this: what the Bloc Quebecois wants to do 
today is not so much to criticize the Canadian government for its 
regional development policies as to try to prevent it from taking 
further action in this area, because what action it is taking is right 
on target. The federal government's action does respond to the 
population's expectations and does serve the population well. It 
will stay the course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find 
it hard to listen to the Secretary of State talk about the involvement 
of the Quebec government with such snobbishness.
<P>
	You have to realize that the Government of Quebec has to deal 
with the entire problem. It has to deal with the whole issue of 
regional development. That is why there can be some tension and 
adjustment problems between Minister Chevrette and Mrs. Harel.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The government of Quebec is not just playing around with the 
issue of regional development. It is not pretending to deal with it. It 
does not interfere with the CFDC, the 55 CFDC. The main 
objective of the federal government is to go strut its stuff in the 
regions and get chummy with some of the local elite to get them on 
side.
<P>
	The Province of Quebec is concerned about economic 
development, technological development and exports. It is the 
Canadian government's responsibility to deal with foreign affairs. 
Once we become sovereign, we too will be concerned about 
international trade, just as the Government of Canada is today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8966"> 8966 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us stop the cuts to transfer payments to the provinces, and 
especially to the Province of Quebec. The Government of Quebec 
has some good technological development programs, which it will 
be able to improve.
<P>
	I have a simple question for the Secretary of State. Where does 
the anti-sponsorship policy of the Minister of Health fit into the 
regional development strategy? There is some concern about that, 
as we saw in the media. Where was the Secretary of State when we 
addressed the sponsorship issue that affects every region in 
Quebec, as well as the Montreal Grand Prix, the Trois-Rivières 
Grand Prix and the Jazz Festival? We know he was not comfortable 
with this issue, just like the President of the Treasury Board and 
even the Prime Minister and the two hot shots from the Montreal 
area. Where does this fit in with their willingness to really-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before turning the floor over to the hon. member, 
I would ask my colleagues to address their remarks to the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, you see the approach they are taking 
with the people of Quebec. When Quebecers do business with the 
Canadian government, suddenly they are no longer Quebecers, they 
are now local elites because they are doing business with the 
Canadian government. Let me tell you that what you are calling a 
local elite is far-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Please address the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> I would be pleased to do so. When they speak of 
these local elites, allow me to tell you that these people they are 
busy looking down on today are trying to serve the public well. 
They have established a partnership with the Canadian government 
because we have set up programs that meet their expectations, their 
interests, and their needs and that allow them to structure their 
region's economic development in terms of the realities of the 21st 
century.
<P>
	As far as the tobacco bill is concerned-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> We would like to hear you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> I would not call my colleague's remarks 
irresponsible, for that would be unparliamentary. The health 
minister's bill was what the public wanted and called for. It was a 
bill that people wanted. It is a question of public health. My 
colleague managed to strike a balance between going ahead with 
the bill and the various interests in the Montreal region-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Why did you disappear, Martin?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> -by extending the deadline until 1998. Sponsors 
realize they now have two summers to make the adjustment. I must 
also point out that this bill does not ban sponsorships; it regulates 
them. Obviously, the opposition has been going around saying all 
kinds of things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Tell the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Strictly speaking, it will have no impact on 
economic development. When we talk about the economic 
development of Montreal, the one government that has been 
present, that had a vision, was the Canadian government.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> I split question period between the 
parties. I did not see the other colleague. The hon. member for 
Prince George-Peace River.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to draw to the attention of the junior minister 
responsible for regional development in Quebec, FORD-Q, a 
contradiction that appears to be in the funding for regional 
development.
<P>
	In the 1995 budget speech, to great fanfare, the finance minister 
announced a refocusing of regional development programs and 
agencies in Canada. He bragged about how streamlining would 
save taxpayers millions of dollars. The 1995 budget estimated the 
expenditures would be cut by about half over a period of time and 
would save taxpayers over $500 million.
<P>
	In the 1997 budget we noticed that regional development was 
conspicuously absent from the budget speech.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. junior minister would explain the 
contradiction. It now appears that the funds being spent on regional 
development, including FORD-Q, will actually increase.
<P>
	The latest numbers that we were able to discern is that 
FORD-Q's budget is going to increase by about 11 per cent to over 
$400 million in fiscal year 1997-98. How can that contradiction 
exist with the cuts that were announced in the 1995 budget?
<P>
	I know he is going to try to say it is because of the extension of 
the infrastructure program. However, clearly the 1995 budget was 
supposed to allocate funds for the extension of the infrastructure 
program. It was supposed to be factored in.
<P>
	I wonder if the junior minister could explain how the taxpayers 
are supposed to be experiencing cuts and savings in dollars being 
expended on regional development, not only in Quebec but across 
Canada, when now we are seeing an actual increase in funding? I 
wonder if he could tell us what the actual numbers are that the 
government intends to spend over the next fiscal year on regional 
development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting. Through that 
question we can see the philosophy of Reformers. They talk on that 
side of the House about spending. They see regional development 
as an expenditure. On the government side we see regional 
development as an investment. It is a very important investment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8967"> 8967 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party would like to see a free market without any 
government intervention. Reformers would like us to be in a 
society where there are only rich people. But it appears that in 
our society there are some regions which have to be helped out 
by the Canadian government.
<P>
	A major role is played by regional agencies across Canada. We 
are playing a major role not only with the offices of FORD-Q but 
with Industry Canada and the community futures program.
<P>
	When they talk about the contradiction in the budget, it appears 
they may be quite weak on the other side of the House. It seems that 
the budget has been affected a bit because we will manage, as we 
have in the past, the infrastructure program. It was included in this 
year's budget and last year's budget. If they need any further 
details they can go to public accounts and they will see that the 
budget is a public matter.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the Bloc motion.
<P>
	While I agree with the opening of the motion, I cannot agree 
with much else. Unfortunately I cannot support the motion. The 
motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the federal government which, because of its policies, is 
in large measure responsible for increasing poverty in the regions-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The motion goes on to talk about Quebec. As a matter of fact the 
motion mentions Quebec four times. As the Bloc is the official 
opposition I would have hoped, as all Canadians would hope, that 
its members would have taken a Canada-wide view of the 
government's incompetence and what it has done to address 
poverty in the country.
<P>
	Before I get into my remarks I have to make reference to the 
secretary of state's reference to low interest rates. I have heard 
more about low interest rates in the House as if they are the answer 
to job creation and to our future. Low interest rates cut two ways. 
Not everybody benefits. There are retired Canadians who count on 
decent interest rates. To say that low interest rates are the solution 
to Canada's problems is not true. It is certainly not going to get the 
economy moving or create the jobs I keep hearing about from the 
other side.
<P>
	A survey was done by the Chamber of Commerce in my 
community on what the federal government needs to do to 
encourage, expand and create jobs. Ten items are listed in the 
survey: the elimination of the deficit; elimination of the debt; 
reducing business regulatory burden; making tax levels 
competitive; fixing workmen's compensation; fixing labour 
relations; reforming education; abolishing interprovincial trade 
barriers; improving the infrastructure program, and promotion of 
environmental sustainability.
<P>
	Of the 10 items listed I do not see any mention of lower interest 
rates. Lower interest rates appeal to those who know about 
borrowing. We should not be encouraging borrowing, we should be 
encouraging businesses and, indeed Canadians, to pay their way. 
The cart is before the horse. Businesses are not looking to borrow 
more so they can put off their bankruptcy. To suggest that lower 
interest rates is the answer in a period of record bankruptcies is not 
going to work. Members can continue to talk about low interest 
rates but the unemployment figures continue to show that low 
interest rates are not creating employment.
<P>
	The Bloc member for Laurentides talked about the mess the 
Liberal government has made of Mirabel. It brought to mind the 
mess the Liberal government has made of Pearson airport. Mixing 
Liberals and aviation is like mixing alcohol and gasoline, it is a bad 
combination for the taxpayers of Canada. Mirabel has cost 
Canadian taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars and Pearson 
airport will cost Canadian taxpayers hundreds of millions of 
dollars.
<P>
	When the government talks about regional development, how 
concerned it is and how important it is, just think about Pearson 
airport. That airport means jobs and regional development all 
across Canada and the government decided to cancel it on the basis 
of a quickie 30 day report. Pearson airport continues to deteriorate, 
costing jobs not just in rebuilding that airport but in development 
all across Canada.
<P>
	The motion before us is a little like a garage sale. Everything is 
in there except the kitchen sink. I am not too sure, it might be in 
there too, and of course it would be sink from Quebec.
<P>
	The problem is that all of Canada is hurting. It is not just poverty 
in Quebec. Poverty certainly is there, unemployment is there but it 
applies from coast to coast. It is the result of the failed policies and 
the lack of vision of this Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Speaking about vision, I saw in the media last week the Prime 
Minister has now realized that vision is important. He was talking 
about the fact that going from day to day or week to week is not the 
answer, that governments have to have a vision for the future. It is 
encouraging to hear after three and a half years that the government 
has discovered the need to have a vision, to have a plan that is 
longer than two years if the country is to be successful.
<P>
	The Liberal government's failure to address the most serious 
problem of the country is the reason for such high levels of 
unemployment, the reason for the poverty, the reason for the 
crushing tax burden that we are all under and the reason for the 
deteriorating social programs. The government has failed to deal 
with the deficit and the debt. It has failed to deal with it quickly and 
decisively.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8968"> 8968 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has the deficit turned around and it is coming 
down, but it is coming down far too slowly. It is not fast enough 
to stimulate the economy and it is slow enough that it is increasing 
the debt and the payments that are made on that debt.
<P>
	The government has been in power for three and half years and 
the unemployment numbers are almost the same today as they were 
when it was elected. There are 1.4 million Canadians unemployed, 
two million to three million Canadians under employed and one in 
four Canadians worried about their jobs. They have no confidence.
<P>
	The debt is $600 billion, or will be shortly, and $50 billion in 
interest payments on that debt. One-third of every tax dollar goes to 
pay the interest costs on that debt. It does not create one job. It does 
not do anything for poverty. It does not do anything for our social 
programs but it certainly is the reason our taxes are so high.
<P>
	The answer to the motion that the Bloc has put forward today is 
to reduce the size of government and be able to offer tax relief, put 
more dollars in the hands of consumers and get off the backs and 
out of the pockets of industries, the entrepreneurs who really create 
the jobs.
<P>
	Unfortunately the Bloc motion suggests that more government 
spending is the answer. Reformers disagree with that. You cannot 
buy your way to prosperity. That just cannot be done. It cannot be 
done in our home, it cannot be done in business.
<P>
	Reformers are saying we have to reduce and rescue. We have to 
reduce spending and rescue those programs, rescue our social 
programs, rescue the initiative and the drive that our entrepreneurs 
have. Or we have to pare and preserve: cut back so that we can save 
those jobs and save our social programs, versus what we have been 
doing for the last 25 years which is tax and terminate. We have 
been going down that same road now for 25 to 30 years, ever 
increasing taxes, never doing anything about unemployment and 
the threatened social programs.
<P>
	It never ceases to amaze me that someone does not stop and say: 
``What we have been doing is not working. There has to be a better 
way. We have got to look at an alternative''. Even Mr. Bouchard, 
now that he is the leader in Quebec, realizes the importance of 
tackling the deficit. He wants to get the finances of Quebec in order 
because he knows that is important to the economic strength and 
job creation in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Look at what two cost cutting premiers have done. I am thinking 
of Premiers Klein and Harris. Premier Klein has eliminated the 
deficit and is creating jobs. He has just been rewarded for the job he 
has done with a resounding endorsement by the people of the 
province of Alberta. He has been true to his word. He has 
eliminated the  deficit and Alberta is creating jobs. The debate that 
they are going to have in Alberta now is about what to do about the 
surplus. Should they be spending it on social programs, health and 
education. What a pleasant debate that would be to have.
<P>
	Premier Harris is doing the same thing in the province of 
Ontario. He is doing what he said he would do and he is going to 
create jobs. He is going to get the economy moving again. The best 
social program people can have is a job.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	I will quickly review the Bloc motion which includes Canada 
Post, regional ports and airports, the coast guard, fishing quotas 
and the EI changes. I will comment first on the 10,000 jobs lost at 
Canada Post. It was part time employees whose jobs were lost 
because of the elimination of unaddressed ad mail being delivered 
by Canada Post. The private sector will probably pick up those 
jobs. A lot of people objected to the fact that Canada Post delivered 
some of that unaddressed ad mail, to which some of them took 
exception.
<P>
	The federal government had to do something about ports and 
airports because they were not viable. They have been losing 
money for years and have only been able to carry on because of 
huge subsidies from the federal government. The federal 
government cannot continue that. The reality is if they cannot be 
profitable then they should not be subsidized and supported by the 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Coast guard fees are now set for each region. There are different 
costs in different parts of the country so the government has taken 
the position that those costs should be reflected. Where there is 
ice-breaking in one port but not in another, the fees should reflect 
that additional cost. One region should not be supporting another.
<P>
	Concerning the fishing quotas, fish are like tax dollars. There is 
not an unlimited supply. Former governments overspent which has 
put us into the problem we are in today with the $600 billion debt. 
Fishermen were doing the same thing. They were overfishing with 
the belief that there was no bottom, that they could keep doing it. 
Unfortunately the reality is that there was a bottom, they could not 
continue to fish.
<P>
	Reformers believe politics should be removed from the 
determination of quotas, that quotas must be established if this 
valuable resource is to be rebuilt. The government should remove 
the politics from the setting of quotas and hopefully that will see 
the fishing industry survive and grow again.
<P>
	As a party we have always been very clear on what to do with 
employment insurance. We would like to see it returned to what it 
was originally intended to be, an insurance program to help those 
who through no fault of their own find themselves unemployed. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8969"> 8969 </A></B>
<P>
should be a  temporary bridge until people are able to find work 
again.
<P>
	We do not believe that regional eligibility is the way to go. We 
believe that eligibility should be determined on a national basis 
rather than on a regional basis in order to be fair to all Canadians.
<P>
	I have touched briefly on some of the things that are mentioned 
in the motion. We agree with the Bloc that the government is the 
problem but we disagree with the Bloc on the solution to the 
problem. We can fix the problem.
<P>
	I would like to look at the record of the government that has put 
us in the position we are in today. It is a record that has 
disappointed all Canadians, particularly the 1.4 million who are 
currently unemployed.
<P>
	We have had 77 months of unemployment at a rate above the9 per cent level. This is on the record of the government and former 
governments. Two to three million Canadians are underemployed 
and one in four Canadians are worried about holding their jobs. The 
federal debt is increasing to over $600 billion with interest 
payments approaching $50 billion which is more than is spent on 
old age security or the seniors' benefit, employment insurance and 
health care combined.
<P>
	Because of the government's go slow approach to reducing the 
deficit, which should have been addressed far more quickly, it has 
added to the debt and it has added about $10 billion to the servicing 
the cost of the debt.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec and right across Canada the income of the average 
Canadian family has been reduced by some $3,000. There is less 
income because of fixed wages over those years. At the same time 
the government has brought in some 36 indirect tax increases. 
Therefore Canadians have seen their disposable income eliminated. 
The last tax increase will be the increase in CPP premiums which 
will represent about a $10 billion tax grab.
<P>
	That is a killer of jobs. Earlier the finance minister 
acknowledged that payroll taxes were a killer of jobs. At a time 
when we need jobs the government introduces a plan that will hurt 
job creation.
<P>
	The finance minister said the CPP premium increase was not a 
payroll tax, that it was an investment. I would like him to convince 
hard working Canadians who are deeper in debt than they have ever 
been and are having difficult times making ends meet that this is an 
investment. Canadians are not looking for investments. They are 
looking for tax relief so they can start meeting the bills that come 
due weekly.
<P>
	We have record debt and record bankruptcies, and the Liberals 
are talking about lower interest rates. The savings of Canadians 
have been diminished. A report  from an economist stated that the 
real problem in Canada today, aside from the fact that 1.5 million 
Canadians are unemployed, is that 13 million Canadians have lost 
their purchasing power. They have no ability to buy and get our 
internal economy moving. They are struggling under a tax load. 
They are not looking for investment. They are looking for tax 
relief, which is the answer to job creation.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said he would run in the upcoming election 
on his job creation performance. We as a party look forward to that 
because in the 3.5 years he has been in power those jobs have not 
been created. The reliance on low interest rates will not create the 
jobs Canadians are looking for.
<P>
	The latest numbers on unemployment are still 9.6 per cent and 
9.7 per cent. The finance minister admitted his frustration but he 
certainly did not think there was any real problem. He continues to 
hope that somewhere down the road it will turn around.
<P>
	He did not blame business, but the problem is that the finance 
minister and the government are not listening to business. This is 
not the route businesses have been asking the government to take. 
The Chamber of Commerce and the CFIB have been saying that the 
best thing the government could do to create jobs is to reduce the 
deficit and get the books in balance as quickly as possible. The 
business community is saying that is the way to create jobs in 
Canada. A letter from the president of the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce said very clearly that eliminating the deficit quickly 
was critical to job creation.
<P>
	Unbelievably in the budget the government talked about another 
infrastructure program. The government's $6 billion infrastructure 
program created about 10,000 jobs. That is a pretty expensive job 
creation program. It was one that was criticized by the auditor 
general. If that $6 billion had been given to Canadians in the form 
of tax cuts, by the year 2000 it would have resulted in the creation 
of the 162,000 jobs. The auditor general indicated that many 
infrastructure programs would have gone ahead without that $6 
billion of borrowed money. It was not money the government had.
<P>
	Unbelievably the Liberals have another infrastructure program, 
although they are being a little cautious this time. I do not think 
they are talking about canoe museums, boccie courts or hockey 
arenas. This time they will stick to what they said in the red book 
about sewers and roads, which can really be described as 
infrastructure.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The finance minister spoke about how great the infrastructure 
program was and how it was supported. The infrastructure program 
is a shell game. It is a two for one deal with our own dollars. There 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8970"> 8970 </A></B>
<P>
is one taxpayer in the country and that infrastructure program was 
buying  their votes with their own tax dollars. The answer is to pay 
our way, not to go deeper and deeper into debt.
<P>
	I talked about Pearson airport because it was mentioned by the 
Bloc member for Laurentides. What greater piece of infrastructure 
did we have in Canada than Pearson airport, and it continues to 
decline.
<P>
	The government has failed to deal with interprovincial trade 
barriers which affect jobs across Canada. Those barriers are costing 
hundreds of thousands of job. The Canadian Manufacturers 
Association said they were costing Canadian taxpayers $6 billion. 
Yet government members travel all around the world talking about 
exports but not doing anything about enhancing trade in Canada, 
which would do something about creating jobs in Canada.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportuntiy to speak to the motion today. I 
suggest to members of the Bloc who introduced the motion that the 
best thing they could do for poverty and job creation in Canada is to 
get off their separatist agenda and go after the government to do 
something about its out of control spending.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, I would like to make a few comments to my colleague from 
the Reform Party on the general plan he outlined earlier. I would 
tend to agree with the Liberal Party on this. We are still talking 
about federalism.
<P>
	And speaking of federalism, I have to make a few comments to 
the member across the way, the member for Outremont, who spoke 
earlier. He said: ``We contributed; we did this, and we did that''. I 
would like to remind my colleague across the way that when he 
talks about this money, we pay for that, it is our money. So, when 
Quebec becomes sovereign, we will have the same power to do 
these things, except that we will be far more competent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> With less money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
across the way is saying that we will have less money. I regret, but 
we pay our taxes and we will be able to do directly what we want 
with that money.
<P>
	I find always it fascinating to see that federalists want to hang on 
to their jurisdiction. When I hear them say that they have the 
expertise, I wonder what kind of expertise they are talking about. 
This reminds me a national conference that was held last fall and at 
which young people and older people came from all over Canada to 
talk about problems facing young people. Whether it is about 
young people or something else, we are always told, to my 
astonishment, that Quebec is always asking for something. Let me 
remind you that Quebec is not the only province demanding some 
kind of decentralization. Everybody wants it.
<P>
	We were told from coast to coast that the problems are at the 
regional level, and problems vary from region to region. Why, 
then, should we keep a whole bunch of public servants in Ottawa to 
develop programs to solve regional problems, when those 
problems are so utterly different.
<P>
	What I am saying, really, is that regions are in a much better 
position to come up with programs that will solve regional 
problems. That is the real answer. When Quebec is sovereign, we 
will know our problems better, and federalism will not stand in our 
way.
<P>
	I have to admit I am discouraged, but I will roll up my sleeves. 
My region of the Saguenay and Lac Saint-Jean has a very high 
unemployment rate. Now that I am a member of Parliament, I 
might be tempted to expect something from the federal system. I 
have given up on federalism, and that is why I will roll up my 
sleeves.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, people are starting to 
undertake regional initiatives. Mention has been made of the 
networking operation under way in the Lac-Saint-Jean region, and 
when I say networking, I am referring to a regional initiative that 
meets a regional need.
<P>
	I think the Bloc Quebecois agrees that most jobs being created 
today are certainly not being created by the federal government but 
by small businesses. We know that to start up a small business 
often takes people who have business sense, a bright idea, a person 
with the entrepreneurial potential to develop that idea and in fact 
there are not many people in the community who have that 
potential. Of course it also takes money.
<P>
	Often people are looking for partners to start a business, and that 
is what led me to set up the networking operation in my riding, 
which serves to seek out people with different skills that might be 
combined for the purpose of setting up the joint project.
<P>
	Let me explain. If a person has an idea but not necessarily the 
entrepreneurial potential to put it into practice, there might be 
someone else who feels like starting a project but does not really 
have either an idea or the money. If money is the problem, then we 
look for someone else who has money.
<P>
	This local initiative has yet to produce results, but it is well on its 
way, I can assure you. Local initiatives like these will help us deal 
with employment problems. This example is one of many.
<P>
	Canadian federalism is certainly not the answer to our problems. 
When I hear my Reform Party colleague or the hon. member 
opposite say that federalism is there to save us and create jobs, I am 
very sceptical indeed.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel I was left out 
of that exchange but I am pleased to have an opportunity to 
respond.
<P>
	The member touched on the plight of young people when we talk 
about the unemployed. The rate for young people is much higher 
than the 9.7 per cent. It is probably closer to 15 per cent and 16 per 
cent. Unfortunately in times like these employers will sometimes 
go for experience rather than enthusiasm, and young people are 
hurting.
<P>
	The member also alluded to the fact that small businesses are 
creating jobs. He is absolutely right, but we need to help those 
small businesses create the jobs.
<P>
	When I spoke earlier I referred to the results of a survey of small 
business in my riding. The member might be interested in doing a 
survey of the small businesses in his riding. The results showed 
that businesses were looking for tax relief. They are looking for the 
government to act in a fiscally responsible way. They are looking 
for the government to get its books in balance. They are looking for 
the government to get out of their pockets and off their backs and 
then they will create jobs.
<P>
	Nowhere in my survey were they talking about low interest rates 
being the answer to job creation, which is what the government 
keeps talking about. The government is not listening to business. It 
is not listening to the real creators of jobs in Quebec, Ontario or 
right across Canada.
<P>
	The government has to put the fiscal house in order, get the 
books in balance and then offer tax relief. That will create the jobs 
Canadians are looking for and will certainly go a long way to 
saving the social programs the people of Quebec are as concerned 
about as all other Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we have been following this debate with 
great interest and I can see that the Reform Party is almost as much 
in the dark as the Bloc Quebecois is about what regional economic 
development is all about.
<P>
	It is even surprising to hear them say that and dare put federalism 
on trial. I listened to the hon. member for 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean denigrate the benefits of federalism, 
when we know that the federal government has spent $800 million 
to help his own region get back on its feet.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I remember that, last summer, when even members of the 
opposition, people from the West were welcomed with open arms 
by the people in Lac-Saint-Jean; when families from other 
provinces sent food to the people of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, 
when the Canadian  government sent its experts, the Canadian 
Armed Forces and the Canadian Coast Guard, the people in that 
region could not thank me enough.
<P>
	We can easily see that the 80 per cent paid by the federal 
government, by all Canadians, is a source of embarrassment for the 
opposition because this is a benefit of federalism. In a way, this is 
the true spirit of federalism, because we are well aware that we can 
count on all Canadians to invest in the regions, not when times are 
easy, but especially when times are tough.
<P>
	We could also put the Bloc on trial, because the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois do nothing in the area of regional economic 
development.
<P>
	Have the Bloc members ever come up with an economic 
development program for Quebec's regions? Never. I had to come 
up with an additional $5 million to help out the Gaspé fishers. I had 
to act on behalf of those who are not properly represented.
<P>
	The next campaign will not be on a motion by the Bloc, it will be 
the trial of the Bloc. We will explain to Quebecers that federalism 
works for Quebecers, particularly those in the regions.

	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, in 20 seconds I 
just want to say that the government is on trial and its day is 
coming. It is just weeks away. I look forward to the trial and I look 
forward to the government's standing up and defending its record 
on jobs, jobs, jobs, the elimination of the GST, the crushing taxes 
that we are under and deteriorating social programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in Quebec, there is an expression which goes something 
like this: Since we are in a mess anyway, why not go all the way. 
This is unbelievable.
<P>
	During the debate on the issue before us today, I heard the 
member for Outremont sing the praises of regional development as 
if there had been no regional development until he came along. I 
would like to remind him of three very important facts.
<P>
	First, the Quebec government has been concerned with regional 
development for more than 30 years. The Quebec government has 
long demanded of the Government of Canada that it be the only one 
involved in its own regional development.
<P>
	Let us not forget that when we came here in 1993, the Office of 
Federal Economic Development and the Business Development 
Bank of Canada already existed in Quebec and the economic 
development agreements had already been in existence for two 
decades.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8972"> 8972 </A></B>
<P>
	The Office of Federal Economic Development was merely a 
division of the Department of Industry. There was no parent 
legislation governing it, as is the case for western economic 
diversification and ACOA in the maritimes, or even for FedNor 
in northern Ontario.
<P>
	What did we do when we got here? In 1993, we immediately 
tried to determine who was responsible for regional development. 
It was a certain minister of Finance. In this House, even if we asked 
the government about its regional development activities, there 
was absolutely no decision making, no dialogue with Quebec and 
no answers to Quebec's very simple requests concerning regional 
development.
<P>
	Quebec has always said to the federal government: ``Just transfer 
the money and tax points, because regional development is our 
concern''.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Having been asked for a while, but to no avail, who was 
responsible for regional development, the federal government was 
suddenly inspired and decided to change the focus of the industry 
legislation. I remember. It was Bill C-46.
<P>
	This change of focus also changed all of FORD's objectives, 
which became directly related to the Department of Industry. For 
the first time, we had a real minister in charge of development. 
Who was it? None other than the Minister of Industry, who comes 
from Ontario. This confirmed that Ontario had been made 
responsible for regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	We were slightly embarrassed by that situation naturally, so at 
the next cabinet shuffle, our colleague, the member for Outremont, 
was called upon to help the Liberals save face. Our colleague from 
Outremont could be seen in the windows of the 13 regional 
development offices, handing out Canadian flags along with the 
cheques attesting to the federal government's involvement in 
regional development. But all this was very much out of line with 
Quebec's traditional demands.
<P>
	On this point, I would like to bring back to your attention one 
provision of Bill C-46. When the Department of Industry was 
restructured, they said it would have the authority to design, 
recommend, co-ordinate, manage, promote and implement 
programs and activities associated with regional economic 
development in Quebec. The Ontario minister was given the power 
to interfere directly in Quebec's regional development. Not only 
could he do so directly, but bills like those concerning the 
Department of Industry, the Federal Office of Regional 
Development and the Federal Bank contained provisions giving 
him the right to bypass Quebec and deal directly with stakeholders, 
even at the level of school boards and municipalities.
<P>
	I would like to know where our colleague, the member for 
Bonaventure-îles-de-la-Madeleine, was when Quebec underwent 
a major decentralization as the result  of a political choice. Let me 
remind him of the extensive consultations undertaken so that all the 
regions could participate in the development of strategic plans. In 
Quebec, each region has prepared strategic plans for its regional 
development, that way we can be certain that all regions actually do 
develop.
<P>
	Why? Because traditionally the regional development coming 
from Ottawa had a tendency to be focused on the central regions. In 
the last decade of the ERDA, over 40 per cent of the money was 
invested in the Montreal and Quebec City areas, that is to say in the 
central regions, the reasoning being that if these regions developed, 
the others would benefit also. But the reverse happened. 
Development left the regions for the central areas.
<P>
	It was always that way, because in the minds of regional 
development officials in Ottawa, a province is a region, it is as 
simple as that. In Quebec, however, we know full well, in the area 
of regional development, that we have five administrative regions 
and 95 regional county municipalities working together to channel 
development according to social, economic and cultural priorities. 
This government has always refused to acknowledge the expertise 
that Quebec acquired in the area of regional development.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	How can the government say it has a regional development 
strategy when it refuses to even consider the strategies developed 
by the various regions of Quebec in their strategic plans.
<P>
	It is not we who pushed the idea all the way to the regional 
secretariat, it was Minister Picotte himself, then in the Liberal 
Bourassa government, who said: ``The regional partnership 
structure will extend to strategic plans, to ensure that all 
government departments that inject money into the regions do so in 
accordance with regional development plans''. That is what 
development partnership is all about, but the federal government 
refused to listen.
<P>
	As evidence of this, I just want to point out something, because I 
heard my colleague from Outremont, who deals with regional 
development, say that Quebec refused to sign some agreements. 
Speaking of agreements, I would like to remind him-I just want to 
relate this little anecdote because it is priceless-that we signed a 
regional development agreement in the summer of 1994, but that 
the federal government refused to sign it, using the political 
context as an excuse and arguing that it had just signed during that 
same week an agreement in another area of jurisdiction. It said that 
two agreements were too much.
<P>
	When my colleague from Outremont says that Quebec did not 
want to sign, it did so according to some very clear directions. I 
recall very clearly that Minister Chevrette, who was responsible for 
regional development, and his colleague, Louise Beaudoin, of  
Intergovernmental Affairs, had told the government that they 
wanted to sign the agreement providing its implementation were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8973"> 8973 </A></B>
<P>
deferred by one year. They wanted all regional development 
policies in this agreement to fit in with regional development, 
regional secretariats and regional development agreements.
<P>
	At that time, the finance minister and his officials rejected the 
agreement. If it is not signed today, it is simply because the federal 
government does not want to recognize Quebec's jurisdiction and 
continues to clearly demonstrate its determination to centralize and 
to subject Quebec's regional development to national standards as 
part of a national blueprint that does not take into account Quebec's 
strategic plans and the prime objectives of regional development.
<P>
	That is what this government is doing in terms of regional 
development. All federal legislation uses this wording that gives 
the minister the right to bypass the regions and the Quebec 
government and deal directly with stakeholders.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is: the hon. 
member for Frontenac-food inspection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
a comment and then I will ask a question of the hon. Bloc member 
with respect to the motion before us today as presented by the Bloc.
<P>
	I take exception to the first sentence which condemns the federal 
government because of its reprehensible policies which in large 
measure are responsible for increasing poverty in the province of 
Quebec. What increases poverty in any province? What increases 
the lack of opportunity and the lack of growth in any province? It 
always starts with the people who live there. It starts with the 
municipal level of government, then the provincial and then the 
federal government comes into play.
<P>
	With the exception of the Canada health and social transfer, the 
CHST, which the federal government has reduced and which Bloc 
members could argue is the reason there has been less money going 
to Quebec in that program, other than that everything else that is 
happening in the province of Quebec that is going downhill is the 
responsibility of two parties, the PQ and the BQ.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	When I came here three years ago the PQ was running a deficit 
of about $4 billion. Within a 5 per cent margin, even under 
Bouchard it is still running a deficit of $4 billion. When every other 
province and every other level of government are reducing deficits, 
that provincial  government did not make substantial reductions in 
its deficit. It was not in the billions of dollars. Maybe it was in the 
hundreds of millions.
<P>
	Now the premier has to negotiate with the unions to get them to 
agree that there will be a balanced budget by the year 2000. It is all 
to come. It is all promises. Nothing is actual. Nothing is factual. He 
is in real trouble.
<P>
	The BQ has done nothing in the House to admit that fact. It said 
it was coming here for one term and not running again. Now it is 
running again. It came here to say let's separate. The majority of 
people in Quebec voted no to separation. They voted no to getting 
out of the union. They want to stay in Canada, yet there will be a 
third referendum.
<P>
	The BQ is responsible for the poverty in the province of Quebec. 
Because of the uncertainty, because of the unstable economic 
climate, a number of companies have moved from the city of 
Montreal which used to be a great city.
<P>
	I grew up just outside Ottawa. I used to be proud to visit the big 
city of Montreal. I thought at that time that it was so much bigger 
than Ottawa, so much more beautiful than Ottawa. It is still a 
beautiful city but unfortunately when I go down streets now I see 
barricades in front of office buildings. I see graffiti written on the 
walls of office buildings in downtown Montreal off rue 
Sainte-Catherine. It is embarrassing.
<P>
	I am a proud Canadian. I love the province of Quebec. I saw it 
every day of my life when I was growing up by looking across the 
river. Here we have a party that will not admit the fight is over. It 
came here. It had its shot and lost.
<P>
	Bloc members say they believe in democracy. They say they 
believe in the will of the people. Why do they not accept the will of 
Quebecers who say they want to stay in Canada?
<P>
	That uncertainty is creating instability. That political blindness 
is hurting a province that could do a lot better by getting its 
economic house in order and not crying for regional development 
funds that only go more or less into high risk ventures, which 
would mean subsidizing failure. I say to the hon. member across 
the way in the Liberal Party that is why I do not believe in regional 
development programs. They do not go into infrastructure. They go 
into failed high risk ventures.
<P>
	It is the member's party and the PQ that are responsible for the 
poverty in Quebec.

distance.
<P>
	I think that, by coming to Ottawa, the Bloc Quebecois has been 
able to make all English Canadians from the other provinces aware 
of what is really going on in Quebec. The democratic will of the 
people was expressed in the last referendum, and might I remind 
you 49.4 per cent voted yes. That is not insignificant. It is almost a 
tie. I think, therefore, that many Quebecers have exercised their 
democratic right to express their opinion.

would like to ask the consent of the House to go to 5.25 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the 
debate on regional development during this opposition day, 
because I represent a region which has been a testing ground for the 
ineffectiveness of Canadian federalism.
<P>
	In eastern Quebec, people are sovereignist because they are 
francophone and they believe in the future of Quebec's 
francophone population, but they are also sovereignist because 
they believe that, to ensure our development, we must have control 
over our future.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	We had a taste of every possible federalist recipe. We went from 
the eastern plan, to the Quebec planning bBureau, to the 
Department of Regional Economic Expansion, to ad hoc activities, 
and now to the Federal Office of Regional Development, whose 
officials are doing their best. Under the Conservatives, the FORD 
was used, to some extent, to divert activities from the Department 
of Industry.
<P>
	Once the Liberals came to office, they kept the FORD, but they 
did not give it any money. And then they came up with IDÉE-PME. 
It is a bit like a telephone booth: it gives an opportunity to access 
other federal departments. People working in the regions do their 
best with what they have. Every public servant does his best.
<P>
	The problem with regional development is not related to 
individuals, but to the architecture. Regional development is one 
area where Canada's architectural problems are truly noticeable, 
and we are not talking minor problems. Since we, Bloc members, 
arrived here in Ottawa, we have also noticed that there are some 
very important sectors related to regional development, including 
the transportation sector.
<P>
	For a long time, it was believed in Quebec that the transportation 
sector only dealt with highways. People were not very familiar with 
air, marine and railway transportation. For a long time, people 
thought of railways as rather quaint. Since we, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, have been here, we have told Quebecers how important 
these areas are, how we should have control over them in order to 
ensure appropriate regional development.
<P>
	When you go over all the areas where Quebecers were let down 
in terms of regional development, you think about the 10,000 
Canada Post jobs that were lost and the dumping of some regional 
harbours and airports. Quebecers have been saying for at least 20 
years that if the federal does not want to maintain the harbours it 
should transfer them to us. It took one year to develop a policy and 
for the last year the department has been trying to revise it in order 
to give something to someone.
<P>
	We have yet to reach an agreement. However, regional 
authorities have not remained idle. For instance, the Cacouna port 
authorities have made some strong representations and they have 
kept at it. They want results, but the federal government is too 
slow. With the economic situation changing ever so quickly, we 
cannot have governments unable to react rapidly.
<P>
	Since we are part of NAFTA, we have to ensure that our regions 
can quickly export their goods and that we have the appropriate 
transportation means to do so. We cannot wait 10 or 15 years, these 
things must be done very quickly. Will someone on the government 
side address the issue of regional development, since they have 
undertaken the most harmful reform for the regions we have ever 
seen, the employment-insurance reform?
<P>
	We know that this reform required two years of consultation and 
that, two months after its implementation on January 1, 1997, the 
government has already made changes because it realized that the 
arguments invoked by the opposition throughout the reform period 
were valid.
<P>
	It was true that people who had accumulated five or six hours in 
a week would be penalized if no way could be found to ensure that 
this did not reduce the number of weeks of benefits. There will be 
other such changes in the months and years to come. For example, 
asking young workers to accumulate 910 hours adversely affects 
regional development because those who cannot do so will simply 
move elsewhere. And once they settle elsewhere, it is unlikely they 
will move back home, which is not good for regional development.
<P>
	The people in government are not worse than their predecessors. 
The problem with regional development in Canada is not caused by 
individuals. All governments try to do their best. But they try to be 
good plumbers when architects are what is really needed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8975"> 8975 </A></B>
<P>
	If there is a sector that will help us to convince people that 
sovereignty is the solution for Quebec, it is regional development. 
I challenge any of the government members in the next election 
to try and convince us that the actions of the federal government 
helped in any way to reduce the gap between the unemployment 
rates in Quebec and those in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	You can rest assured, especially in eastern Quebec, where we lost 
a seat because of the inaction of the member for Bonaventure-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Exactly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> -that they will learn their lesson next time, when 
there will be only four ridings in eastern Quebec, but these four 
ridings will vote for the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being5.25 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put 
forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the business of 
supply.

<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is it the

on Monday, March 3.
<P>
	In 1968, the House adopted the McGrath report on procedural

give all members an opportunity to examine the main estimates 
thoroughly so that they would be well informed when they voted.

	We will be voting tonight on $33 billion for interim supply 
which we have had only eight sitting days to examine. 
Supplementary estimates (B) contain $806 million worth of 
expenditures which we have only had six days to examine.

motions when the opposition could have at least until March 30,

<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, notwithstanding the order that

<P>

out that we will have an amendment to Motion M-31 and that we 
agree that the vote be deferred to April 7.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak the motion by my colleague from Red Deer 
which would allow all proposed peacekeeping or peace 
enforcement commitments involving more than 100 Canadian 
personnel to be put to a free vote in the House for approval or for 
rejection. I believe that is a very reasonable request in a democratic 
fashion, something that this party over here has a difficult time 
understanding. We certainly saw an example of it a few minutes 
ago.
<P>
	Peacekeeping has become one of the most important aspects of 
our foreign policy. It has allowed Parliament some influence on 
foreign conflicts. The problem over the years is that modern day 
peacekeeping has become both dangerous and extremely costly. 
Therefore it is important for Parliament to chose wisely which 
missions it will participate in. The risks and the costs should be 
evaluated. The mandate and the rules of engagement should be 
known and the chances of success should be examined.
<P>
	Motion No. 31 would allow these points to be raised in 
parliamentary debate followed by a vote when all members could 
represent their constituents and let their vote count.
<P>
	When the soldiers from Wild Rose are ordered to put their lives 
on the line, I would like to think that I would be able to say to them 
Parliament looked at all the facts and made the best decision in 
their interest.
<P>
	The problem with this Liberal government is that there is always 
too little too late with decisions being made in a rush behind closed 
doors. Currently troops are already on a plane on their way to a 
mission before we are even asked if they should be sent. Then they 
question whether we have the resources in place for this mission.
<P>
	This was seen most recently in February when the Canadian 
government again decided to keep our  peacemakers in Haiti for 
another five years. Canadian taxpayers had already paid over $430 
million for this mission and now we find there is no end in sight. 
However, the government did not consult with Parliament before 
making this expensive and irresponsible decision; nor has it offered 
any long term solutions or plans.
<P>
	If ever there was a need for elected representatives to have a 
voice, it is in these situations. The Canadian people expect 
Parliament to face up to the responsibility of sending our troops on 
these missions. When our soldiers go it should be a Canadian 
decision endorsed by the House of Commons. We have to be 
accountable to the people and give them concrete reasons why 
Canadian soldiers have gone on peacekeeping missions with their 
tax dollars.
<P>
	Canadians want accountability for a change, which only a full 
parliamentary debate and a free vote can provide.
<P>
	It has recently been reported that the Canadian people are 
starting to question why the Canadian government is always quick 
to volunteer our troops for every mission. The repercussions of this 
are being felt by our troops both physically and emotionally. Some 
Canadian soldiers served four tours of duty in the former 
Yugoslavia in a three year time period. This created tremendous 
hardship and family stress for them.
<P>
	As reported in Monday's Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: ``Peacekeeping has 
produced hundreds of psychological casualties. At least six soldiers 
have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, the result 
of witnessing the horrors of war on a daily basis. They live in 
almost constant depression. Hundreds of others, as many as 20 per 
cent of all peacekeepers, could be suffering from various forms of 
stress according to defence officials''.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The problem is the average Canadian does not know what a 
peacekeeper must endure today. Since 1994 there have been about 
2,000 Canadian soldiers overseas every year. So far 16 Canadians 
have died during these missions, 3 from battle wounds and the 
other 13 from accidents or disease. More than 115 Canadians have 
been wounded, most in the wars that have raged in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	To commit our forces to the atrocities going on in today's world 
is not a decision to be taken lightly. Peacekeepers today are 
plunged into the middle of civil wars. This is why a full debate of 
the matter is imperative. We have an obligation to stand up for our 
troops at every turn, to discuss the lives of our young people and 
the place our country has in the world.
<P>
	Parliament should develop criteria in order for the decision to be 
made in a thorough manner. In other words, we must know every 
aspect, from the cost of the mission to the exact mandate to how 
long we are going to  stay. It clear that Canadians are willing to aid 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8981"> 8981 </A></B>
<P>
the international community for humanitarian and security tasks, 
but we can no longer be the world's 911 number.
<P>
	To date Canada's approach to peacekeeping has placed serious 
strains on the armed forces. Problems with equipment such as 
shortages of helmets, communications equipment and obsolete 
armoured personnel carriers have plagued operations. Fewer 
soldiers with fewer resources have been required to participate in 
more missions. Tension and burnout have been evident from too 
many tours too often.
<P>
	These factors have to be considered for every mission. As well, 
we have to learn from the experience of past peacekeeping 
missions. The events in Rwanda and Bosnia are evidence of this.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence was kind enough to provide 
each member of Parliament with a chart outlining peacekeeping 
and humanitarian operation cost estimates. This chart clearly 
shows four missions that will be ending throughout 1997. With 
these dates clearly outlined there should be more than enough time 
to debate and vote on whether these operations should be 
continued.
<P>
	This is why Motion No. 31 is so timely. It would allow each 
member of Parliament an opportunity to raise any issue related to 
these missions on behalf of their constituents and make their vote 
count as such. I would encourage all members to vote in favour of 
Motion No. 31 in order to empower Parliament to stand up for our 
troops.
<P>
	There have been too many times that decisions are made behind 
closed doors. Then we use party politics and the power of we will 
punish you if you do not vote the way we tell you to vote. Decisions 
are made behind closed doors even before a debate begins. When 
that happens that makes this place a farce. To start a debate on a 
Monday when a decision has already been made on the past 
Thursday behind closed doors, with government members being 
told how to vote and that they must vote that way or be punished, is 
a sham, a shame and a disgrace to democracy.
<P>
	I have made these kinds of statements before in the House and 
recently on the Internet someone made a comment regarding my 
comments about backroom decisions, closed door decisions. I 
would like to read it. It is from an individual who is a political hack 
from the old days and from the old way of doing things. Let me 
quote, showing the attitude and the way they look at how we should 
operate. This person has been in politics for years: ``As for 
backroom deals, that is the nature of politics. That is how you get 
things done. If the government was truly above politics then things 
would never work right. For example, without the heavily attacked 
patronage system, important positions would go to people of 
questionable loyalty who may work to subvert the government and 
to undermine its efforts. Again, having  no experience with 
government, Reform would have little or no understanding of this 
principle. Politics is a dirty business. No, you would want the best 
politicians in there who could cut those backroom deals, make 
those backroom decisions and keep things running well''.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	A person who has been in politics in this land for a number of 
years told me that was the way to run the country. In other words, 
the Canadian public or the Canadian taxpayer should not be 
involved in all these decisions. We should simply go behind closed 
doors because the average Canadian and the normal taxpayer are 
too stupid to make good decisions. I am sick and tired of that kind 
of democracy. It must end and this is a good chance to demonstrate 
that we can do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I have a question for the 
hon. member. Accepting the thrust of his speech, would he not 
recollect the debate on several occasions in the House on Canadian 
contributions to UN peacekeeping missions and the consensus that 
developed in which the minister of defence at the time indicated 
that wherever possible issues of this sort would be referred back to 
Parliament?
<P>
	Would he not consider-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It seems the 
hon. member is asking a question or making a comment and this is 
not the time for that. This is the time for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this is an 
important motion and this is an important issue. All members of 
the House are concerned about the handling of information about 
the way our peacekeepers are deployed and the way authorization 
is given for that deployment. Above all, we want to ensure that it is 
a transparent process so that all may know the consequences of 
what we are doing.
<P>
	The motion proposes very little in the way of changes to make 
Canada's peacekeeping policy process more transparent. The 
simple reason is that the process is already extremely open.
<P>
	The suggestions that unilateral decisions are being made behind 
closed doors have ignored the facts. Such assertions have no basis 
whatsoever in reality. The process, as it now exists, is one of the 
most open in the world. How many other countries have 
established Internet sites and conducted surveys to determine 
public support for involvement in peacekeeping missions?
<P>
	I argue that such countries are few in number, yet our hon. 
colleagues insist the existing Canadian system is opaque and in 
need of reform. These statements are difficult to accept.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, the principle underlying such a motion supports 
the thrust of government policy. It has been and  will always be our 
policy to put to this House directly or through its Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade all issues 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8982"> 8982 </A></B>
<P>
involving peacekeeping. When it has been possible and necessary 
to do so, that is what the government did.
<P>
	We recognize the importance of thoroughly and freely debating 
all proposals to deploy Canadian forces personnel and we attach 
considerable importance to the opinion expressed in this House. 
For these reasons, the government is working to ensure that 
Canada's peacekeeping commitments are debated each time the 
occasion arises.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister and the government have indicated a 
willingness to adopt new and interesting procedures to enable this 
to take place.
<P>
	The mover of the motion, the hon. member for Red Deer, knows 
very well that we have had the occasion in the foreign affairs and 
international trade committee to examine the deployment of troops 
in Haiti. On an extensive basis we were able to hear witnesses. We 
were able to have a frank, open debate in circumstances which 
were, I would submit, preferable to an exchange of views in the 
House which often tends to be adversarial in nature. We should be 
looking at that way of dealing with it. That is how we will deal with 
issues raised by the member for Wild Rose. He said that these were 
very costly and dangerous and must be evaluated. We are able to do 
that in committee in many ways far better than we are able to do it 
in the House.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	I urge members of the House who are concerned about this 
matter and about the way Canadians feel about peacekeeping to 
examine some simple figures. In 1995, in spite of what the member 
for Wild Rose said, the results of a study documenting Canadian 
opinions on foreign and defence policies found that 79 per cent of 
those polled considered peacekeeping important for Canada.
<P>
	A February 1996 study showed that 75 per cent of Canadians 
wanted our current commitment to peacekeeping to be maintained 
or increased. A similar percentage of respondents indicated that 
they believed peacekeeping to be a very positive source of 
Canada's international reputation. It is obvious the Canadian public 
recognizes the importance of peacekeeping to Canada 
internationally. Furthermore, Canadians firmly support our 
involvement in peacekeeping.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The high level of support shown leads us to wonder about the 
real value of this motion. The argument that the issue must be put 
to a parliamentary vote so electors may have their say simply does 
not hold water. They have already had it, in a much more 
significant way than they have for years. The same is true for the 
members of this  House. Cabinet has not acted unilaterally behind 
closed doors in considering peacekeeping commitments. This 
House has had many opportunities to debate the issue, and the 
government has considered members' opinions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What is quite concerning about the motion is the possible 
detrimental affect it could have on Canada's ability to effectively 
participate in international peacekeeping efforts.
<P>
	For the last 40 years Canada has been an open international 
leader in peacekeeping. Our unparalleled reputation has resulted 
from our willingness to act in difficult circumstances and on short 
notice. These characteristics have become even more important in 
recent years. Gone are the days when peacekeeping was turned to 
only after a superpower had brokered a ceasefire between two 
states. Now the international community finds itself having to 
respond to internal conflicts causing humanitarian disasters of 
unprecedented magnitude.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Given the nature of those crises the international community is 
often confronted with, it has become obvious that the UN and its 
members do not have sufficient capability to react quickly. Canada 
has been a leader, making suggestions and looking for ways to 
develop mechanisms to increase the capability of the international 
community to react quickly to complex emergency situations.
<P>
	A Canadian report entitled ``Towards a Rapid Reaction 
Capability for the United Nations'' has been an important 
contribution in this exercise. The UN has implemented a number of 
recommendations in this report, including the establishment of 
permanent headquarters for the rapid deployment of peace 
missions that will give the UN a whole new capability.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nationally the Canadian Armed Forces has developed the 
disaster assistance response team or DART to respond quickly to 
international humanitarian disasters. Canada has also come 
forward in actual times of crisis showing the leadership for which 
we are renown. During the recent crisis in eastern Zaire, Canada 
stepped forward to lead the international community to action.
<P>
	What a terrible irony it would be for Canada, one of the most 
ardent international supporters of rapid reaction, to take measures 
to make its own system cumbersome, in fact in some cases 
virtually useless.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That will be the likely outcome of this motion. Making Canada's 
peacekeeping commitments dependent on a vote in Parliament 
would be detrimental to Canada's leadership and effective 
contribution to international security.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8983"> 8983 </A></B>
<P>
	The amended motion demanding that all proposals for 
peacekeeping or peace enforcement  commitments be put to a vote 
in Parliament would considerably reduce our ability to make a 
timely contribution to international efforts. Whether it is the 
commitment of a unit the size of a battalion or just a couple of 
military observers, the difficulty would be the same. Obviously, we 
could not keep the leading role we now have in international 
peacekeeping if our participation were subject to such constraints.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore the motion has implications not only for our 
international reputation but also for the lives of those people we are 
seeking to assist. It has become increasingly clear in recent years 
that without a rapid response from the international community 
countless lives which might have been saved will indeed be lost.
<P>
	Canadians such as generals Dallaire and Baril know this all too 
well. The imposition of additional constraints on our ability to act 
nationally would fly in the face of all that we have tried so hard to 
achieve in the international arena.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In moving this motion, the hon. member neglected several 
highly significant realities about the world of today. First and 
foremost, it must be realized that events develop quickly, often 
with tragic outcomes. To insist that Canadian peacekeepers be 
reduced to doing nothing until the House can meet and debate the 
issue, while innocent people are suffering as the result of a conflict 
or a humanitarian disaster, is foreign to the interests and values 
Canadians hold dear.
<P>
	The international community has learned one thing from the 
tragic events of recent years: we must act promptly when we are 
called upon. The motion in question could totally prevent us from 
doing what we have demanded of other members of the 
international community: providing a rapid response.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member also seems to ignore an even more immediate 
reality. As I have said, the government has consistently 
endeavoured to bring matters related to Canadian peacekeeping 
commitments before the House or before the appropriate 
committee for debate and informed discussion.
<P>
	Furthermore, it has provided the Canadian people with a direct 
means to express their views concerning their country's 
peacekeeping policy. The Canadian public has expressed its 
opinion. It firmly believes in and supports Canada's role in 
international peacekeeping.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian government and the Canadian public are proud of 
the lead peacekeeping role Canada has assumed in the world. Our 
role in this area is important for Canadians, for Canada, and for the 
world.
<P>
	We cannot support this rather unwise motion, which can only 
serve to diminish Canada's role in the noble enterprise of 
peacekeeping.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to conclude the debate on my Motion No. 31.
<P>
	The motion is designed to try to allow Parliament to have more 
control, more discussion and more open debate on the sending of 
our troops on peacekeeping missions. It is not intended to be 
against peacekeepers, to say that we do not do a good job, or to say 
that Canadians are not behind it. This is a motion simply to provide 
accountability for decisions that are made.
<P>
	Even though peacekeeping is one of the most important aspects 
of our foreign policy, the Prime Minister and the other elites in the 
government do not want Parliament to truly participate in the 
making of decisions. They want to have sham debates or no debate 
at all. They refuse to allow parliamentarians access to crucial 
mission information until the dye is cast. They refuse to allow 
members a vote on whether the peacekeeping mission is in the 
interest of our country or the interest of our troops.
<P>
	A perfect example of this disregard for Parliament occurred just 
a few weeks ago when the government leaked to the press the fact 
that we would be staying in Haiti for the next five years. There was 
no consultation. There was no mention of cost. There was no 
mention of the best interest of our troops.
<P>
	It was just another unilateral decision by the government. Even 
though the Minister of Foreign Affairs promised to consult he 
broke his promise. Even though the minister assured Canadians 
``when Haitian President Préval was here, he indicated a very 
strong interest in having the international presence of the UN force 
and the Canadian force end as soon as possible'', guess what. He 
did not mean that either. Even though Canadian taxpayers have 
already paid over $430 million for this mission, we now find out 
there is no end in sight. No wonder the federal debt is $600 billion.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	It is not true that committee has the opportunity make the 
decisions and debate the issues. I use as an example the mission to 
Zaire which was decided on a weekend. In fact, the member for 
Rosedale and I heard from a news reporter that the decision had 
been made for the Zaire mission. We were not consulted. There was 
no opportunity for Parliament to make a decision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8984"> 8984 </A></B>
<P>
	To say that we need 24 hour decision making, I again use the 
example of Bosnia. The situation there has gone on for hundreds 
of years. There was no panic to make a decision.
<P>
	The situation in Haiti of the dictatorship has gone on forever. I 
was in Rwanda in 1985 and I knew there was a problem. There was 
lots of time for Parliament to debate it, two years to make a 
decision. I mentioned Zaire. That problem did not just pop up 
overnight. Very seldom will that argument hold any water. If it did 
there would be ways to deal with it by way of an amendment to the 
motion.
<P>
	The issue of peacekeeping goes far beyond the issue of money. It 
goes to the lives of our Canadian troops, their parents and the lives 
which could be lost or shattered by crippling injuries. When we 
send our soldiers abroad we are asking young men and women to 
take a serious risk for the country. They could be shot, taken 
hostage, blown up by land mines. There are numerous examples of 
this.
<P>
	For the sake of these soldiers, we in Parliament must ensure that 
the government is not being irresponsible in its decisions to 
participate in these missions. It cannot be because the Prime 
Minister watched CNN and made a decision on a weekend. We 
must not let the government rubber stamp missions where lives 
will be lost. We must accept responsibility as legislators and 
demand a full debate will all the information on the table.
<P>
	Only after the debate, when we know the risks, the mandate, the 
rules of engagement, the duration and the cost, can we decide if the 
mission should go forward.
<P>
	Then we must hold a free vote. A free vote is critical because it 
forces individual members to assume responsibility for the safety 
of our soldiers. When young men and women from our ridings are 
going to a war zone or a country where government has broken 
down, we owe it to them to find out the facts for ourselves. The 
lives of Canadians are more important than pride, the party or the 
government.
<P>
	In conclusion, when we vote on the motion each of us will make 
a choice for which we should be held accountable. Our choices will 
show Canadians what we think is most important, the lives of our 
soldiers or what the party brass says.
<P>
	I will end here and let the vote speak for itself so that Canadians 
from coast to coast can see where their members stand when it 
comes to the lives of our soldiers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we have had in 
this particular area of United Nations peacekeeping missions and 
Canadian contributions to them a very high level of debate in 
recent years. It is a debate to which members on both sides of the 
House have contributed significantly.
<P>
	As the member for Rosedale rightly reminded us, Canadians 
have a special interest in UN peacekeeping. The concept is a 
Canadian creation. It was the brain child of our then foreign 
minister and later Prime Minister Lester Pearson. He recognized 
that there is a period in a conflict in which in a certain sense the 
parties have exhausted themselves emotionally and physically and 
where the interposition of a third force may allow them to retreat 
without intolerable loss of face. It is in this context thatMr. Pearson proposed a UN peacekeeping force for the resolution 
of the Suez crisis.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	It worked perfectly and it has become known as the special 
Canadian contribution to the United Nations international 
organization. He was later recognized for his work with the award 
of the Nobel peace prize.
<P>
	This was an area, if one considers the participants in this 
particular difference-Great Britain, France, Israel and Egypt-in 
which there was special Canadian interests apart from the idea of a 
foreign minister who was a UN man par excellence.
<P>
	Similarly, I would have said with the Congo in 1960, which was 
the next big exercise in a UN peacekeeping operation to which 
Canadians contributed, there is a special Canadian interest in every 
issue where the presence of a French speaking force is crucial and 
one with openings to the English speaking world and recognizing 
the American interest in all these things. The Canadian mission 
becomes logical, sensible and almost inevitable.
<P>
	The lesson from our debates in the House in recent years and in 
the present Parliament has been that we need to redefine our roles 
in missions, that we have to be more selective in the allocation of 
our energies, our forces, our contributions to missions and that we 
should, as far as possible, husband our scarce resources and apply 
those to situations where there is a Canadian special interest.
<P>
	I would have thought, and I would agree with people on both 
sides of the House on this, as to some of the more recent missions, 
the Somalia mission, I would have thought by most tests, it was not 
a good case for Canadian involvement at the very beginning. There 
is something to be said for the thought echoed by the hon. member 
opposite that when the telephone rings at five in the morning and 
somebody says that they need our help, maybe the correct response 
is to say: ``George, why do you not go back to sleep and call at 
regular hours?''
<P>
	Somalia was a case where the special expertise in terms of the 
language, in terms of the significant Canadian ethnic community 
with links to the territory, in terms of knowledge of the culture of 
the region, the special problems of language and religion, and also 
the historical divisions within the country was absent. These were 
outside our knowledge. In some senses it was a tragedy  waiting to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8985"> 8985 </A></B>
<P>
happen when we sent over, in essence, a regiment trained more or 
less for anti-terrorist activities.
<P>
	I would have said that Bosnia was possibly an issue of which we 
should have been more cautious although there were special 
pressures on us by members of Canadian communities with roots in 
the homelands of the former Yugoslavia. On that we can leave the 
question open.
<P>
	However, the main issue is that the pragmatic consensus which 
has developed in the debates in the House over the past several 
years is that Parliament should be involved. I remember the 
Minister of National Defence making this view known to the House 
during the course of the debate. Sensibly any administration, 
recognizing the political aspects of these operations and the 
dangers of misconception or misconstruction of a mission, should 
be very sensitive to parliamentary opinion. I believe these 
undertakings were given sufficiently at that time.
<P>
	The problem we have with this motion is that we recognize the 
spirit. We believe the spirit has essentially been accepted on both 
sides of the House, but it does introduce, with its too narrow limits, 
too specific limits, a limitation that frankly could be extremely 
troublesome in a period of international crisis solving where urgent 
action is required.
<P>
	On that basis, I believe we could say to the party opposite 
moving this issue that the spirit is there. I think the spirit is 
accepted and understood on both sides of the House in a 
responsible way. However, our suggestion to the members opposite 
is that the tethering limits of the motion create serious impediments 
to situations in which Canadian interests and Canadian special 
knowledge and competence suggest an intervention.
<P>
	Looking at the situation in Somalia, the United States was 
involved.
<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	The U.S. admiral advising the United Nations in that situation 
simply did not understand that American federal conditions could 
not be replicated in a country that was more similar in its social 
political organization to, for example, Great Britain in the 13th 
century. I am speaking in terms of the confrontational situation of 
feuding feudal barons. In Bosnia largely the exercise in policy 
making had been made in a few key European foreign ministries 
and not necessarily along lines that were sufficiently broad in their 
conception to yield a lasting solution.
<P>
	On that basis I thank members of the third party for their 
contribution. It adds to the thoughtful contributions of earlier 
debates made in particular by the member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands and the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan. These 
sentiments are understood and appreciated on this side of the 
House.
<P>
	It is in this spirit I repeat the thoughts of the member for 
Rosedale. We think the limitation is too tethering. We think it could 
be a serious impediment in a crisis situation. In any case the 
pragmatic understanding on both sides of the House is enough to 
achieve the spirit of what has been contributed to this thoughtful 
debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is the House 
ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The question 
is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those 
opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> In my opinion 
the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FOODINSPECTION">FOOD INSPECTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, QB):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
urge you to keep an eye on the government. It is about to pull 
another fast one on us. This time, it is food inspection.
<P>
	This is the problem. I asked the Minister of Agriculture last 
week about his plan to withdraw from the inspection of processed 
meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables.
<P>
	When you go grocery shopping, you buy pâté made by La Belle 
Fermière or cretons or tête fromagée made with pig's heads, fruit 
juice, fruit cocktail or other processed food, and now the federal 
government wants to withdraw from inspecting this type of 
processed food.
<P>
	There would be implications for recipes and labelling. When you 
buy pâté, there are certain ingredients in this  product, and at the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8986"> 8986 </A></B>
<P>
present time, federal inspectors go to small processing plants to 
check whether the labelling reflects exactly what is in the product. 
Now the government wants to withdraw from this type of 
inspection.
<P>
	These inspections have been done in Canada since 1959-almost 
40 years-and done very well. The industry is happy and takes 
them in its stride. Industries have in fact asked the federal 
government to continue to provide the inspection service, for 
which they would be prepared to pay a fair price. The federal 
government asked its officials to do a study, which shows that the 
quality could drop in this sort of product. The health of our fellow 
Canadians could ultimately be affected.
<P>
	Last week, I was listening to the Prime Minister talk about 
tobacco as he eliminated cigarette sponsorship of sports and 
cultural events; he said it was bad for the health of our children.
<P>
	In this case, although the industry is prepared to pay a fair price, 
the government is considering withdrawing from this sector.
<P>
	I think the department of agriculture should ask cabinet and the 
minister to take a step backward, give the people what they already 
have today and continue to provide the same service.
<P>
	In order to save a few million dollars, the government would run 
the risk of imperiling a significant element in the processing of 
meats, poultry, fruits and vegetables-industries, as usual, found 
primarily in Quebec. It would seem that every time things go well 
in Quebec the government tries to throw a wrench in the works to 
show that things are not going so well.
<P>
	I see that the parliamentary secretary will be responding, as the 
minister is in Japan at the moment. I hope he takes that into 
consideration and encourages his minister to go back on this 
decision to stop food processing inspections.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, current 
regulations require mandatory prior approval and registration of 
labels, processes and formulations for domestically produced and 
processed vegetables, fruit and products as well as domestic and 
imported processed meat products.
<P>
	All other food products regulated by Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada are marked without a mandatory review and industry is 
solely responsible for label compliance. While the service provides 
some value from an inspection point of view, the service could be 
provided by the same private sector that currently supports 
non-mandatory areas.
<P>
	During the business alignment plan discussions relating to 
possible areas of cost reduction some industry  representatives 
indicated that the service was neither necessary nor wanted. 
However there was not consensus among the various industry 
organizations. With the government's desire to provide more 
uniform treatment of food products and to encourage industry to be 
more self-reliant, the existing program was reviewed.
<P>
	Several options including termination of the service have been 
developed. A working group involving industry and consumer 
organizations and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada staff has been 
formed to produce a consensus report by late April 1997.
<P>
	The goal is to implement this consensus during the second half 
of the 1997-98 fiscal year. In the interim delivery of the present 
service will be continued. The final result of these consultations 
will reflect the fact that the health and safety of Canadians 
continues to be the major priority of our department.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to be adopted. The House 
therefore stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.04 p.m.)
