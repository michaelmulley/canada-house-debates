</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut possesses a fast growing population and a very young

of Canada, the new territory is aiming to do just that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care forum held in Iqaluit in September 2000 was 
attended by child care workers from all over Nunavut and was very 
productive.  Nunavut AHRDA holders are currently entering the 
implementation phase of the Nunavut child care planning project 
and I extend to them wishes for every success.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Canadian

on the move again.  This year they will notice not only the 
horrendous price of gas compared to the same time last year but 
the condition of their highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highway infrastructure in the country is falling apart.  The 
present government has a pitiful record on the upkeep of Canada's 
roads.  Last year in British Columbia the government collected 
some $750 million in gasoline excise taxes yet spent only 
$400,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently $60 million was announced for highway improvements in 
British Columbia, a pittance that ignores the real problems we 
are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in my neighbourhood a residential street serves as 
a major highway connecting the Fraser Surrey docks and other 
major transportation hubs and routes, yet there is no federal 
money to alleviate the problem.  Over 2,000 trucks a day pass 
through a residential neighbourhood, trucks carrying Lord knows 
what, yet the Liberal government continues to collect our money 
and ignore the problem.

Mr. Speaker, on April 10, the Canadian Minister of Finance took 
part in the inauguration of a fine initiative, the launch of a

created by two members of the Institute of Applied Economics at

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
incorporation of information and communications technologies into 
the operation of government is believed by many to be the 
greatest challenge facing democratic institutions during the next 
decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every industrialized democracy around the world has set 
aggressive deadlines for the completion of their transition to 
e-government.  All are struggling, in large part due to the 
unanticipated consequences of embracing a technology that changes 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are huge benefits to be realized by those countries that 
are able to overcome these challenges.  I am pleased to point out 
that in a recent international study of progress to date, Canada 
has been recognized as first in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our successes are built upon the efforts of literally thousands 
of public servants at all three levels of government throughout 
Canada, public servants who get it and who are not afraid to 
accept the challenge and search for the value that exists in the 
proper use of these new tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time change needs a champion.  In that regard, I 
wish to congratulate the President of the Treasury Board and her 
staff for their leadership in this important initiative.

world junior men's curling championship in Ogden, Utah, on March

Ryan and Dennis Langdon, represented Newfoundland and Labrador at 
this year's senior men's brier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labrador west and the Carol Curling Club have always been hot

Speaker, the month of May usually means tulip season in Ottawa,

adults today.  Each day three more Canadians are diagnosed with 
this unpredictable and often debilitating disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The causes of MS are still not known but research is getting 
closer to finding some answers.  For those who suffer with MS, 
treatments are available to modify the course of the disease and 
promising new therapies are being developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MS Society of Canada is in the middle of its spring 
fundraising campaign and across the country thousands of 
Canadians will be participating in MS carnation campaigns as well 
as walks for MS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members of parliament and all Canadians to 
participate and to give generously to this important cause, 
because together we can find the answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, May 7 to 13 
marks the celebration of National Nursing Week 2001.  This 
year's theme, “Nurses, Champions for Health”, is significant on 
two fronts. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nurses of Canada truly have acted as champions, standing by, 
supporting and leading Canadians in a collective effort to 
maintain and improve health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their efforts in a very difficult situation have not gone 
unnoticed.  Once again the people of Canada have said that they 
place more of their trust in nurses than in any other group of 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as important as speaking up for patients, nurses have 
consistently voiced their concerns about the health of our 
cherished health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During times of significant restructuring and upheaval, nurses 
in Canada have stood by both patients and the system.  They have 
spoken loudly in defence of the system, especially in support of 
its public funding.  This is at a time when the very same system 
appears to be extracting a cost from their own health and 
well-being. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite my colleagues to join me in acknowledging National 
Nursing Week 2001 and saying a warm thank you to the nurses of 
Canada, our champions for health.

the editor of that journal, Dr. John Hoey, was quoted as saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada...does a remarkable job in getting warnings out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

his problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Health said that Health Canada had 
some things in place and that it would put up some warnings on

of Canadians still do not enjoy Internet service and certainly 
most seniors do not.  What are those seniors supposed to do? They 
do not have a website to go to. They are worried about this. What 
is the minister's proposal there?  Why is he leaving them without 
the proper warning?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if this keeps up we will need to put health warnings on the 
Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to access to information by consumers, naturally, whether 
they are seniors or others, we are talking about prescription 
drugs.  The access to information is in the hands of the 
physicians who are doing the prescribing and in the hands of the 
pharmacists.  That is the important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that Health Canada wants to make sure 
Canadians have access to safe drugs and as much information as 
they or their doctors need, which has been the focus of our work. 
According to the Canadian Medical Association, we are doing a 
pretty darn good job.

and second, that this drug could cause arrhythmia and possibly 
death.

will work toward making the health care system and the warning 
system safer and even better.  We are starting from a pretty good

Speaker, when I practised medicine I trusted Health Canada to 
provide me with the best warnings, as did my colleagues and my

inferior to those in the U.S.?  The sad thing is that Vanessa

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the federal government collected $750 million from

only 4% of that across Canada on roads and highways.  It is 
called highway robbery.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent information provided by the recipient provinces shows the 
reinstatement of the cap will cause them great harm.  Given the

the Prime Minister or the Minister of Finance now lift the

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne, the government pledged to tackle 
the most pressing problems facing aboriginal people.  We made a 
firm commitment to support first nations initiatives, and that 
means strengthening their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than 90 days later, we are making a significant step toward 
meeting that commitment.  As I announced at Siksika on Monday, we 
are moving forward with first nations on the governance 
initiative.  The first phase has begun already, the consultation 
phase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my visits to more than 100 first nations communities over the 
past year, people have told me repeatedly what they consider are 
their top priorities to strengthen how their communities are run. 
The people had a lot to say.  They talked about women's rights, 
they talked about voting rights and they talked about practices 
that connect band members to their own governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also heard that if we are going to make this work, band 
governments and even other first nations agencies have to be 
strengthened.  First nations needs stronger tools to govern. They 
need clear legal powers and they need stability and long term 
sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the reason I wanted to speak to the House for a few 
moments this afternoon is that it is just as important for the 
House to understand what this initiative will not contain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  It is not to alter the inherent right to 
self-government.  It is not to affect the federal government's 
treaty relationship with first nations nor first nations treaty 
rights.  It will not address band status and membership 
entitlements or aboriginal rights and title.  Nor will the powers 
of first nations in relation to lands and resources be the focus 
of attention.  Finally, it is not a replacement for the Indian 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue our work, as we have in the past, in each of 
these areas.  This initiative is about addressing the governance 
issues facing first nations communities, issues the 130 year old 
Indian Act did not envision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative will build an interim step toward 
self-government.  It will provide the authority for first nations 
to have control over their day to day administration and 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move toward self-government, the question we all must ask 
ourselves is this:  will the status quo be acceptable until 
self-government for all first nations is achieved?  I suggest the 
answer to that question is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we build that interim step?  I can tell the House what I 
have been told by first nations.  We do it in consultation with 
first nations.  Parliament will provide the vehicle for change, 
but first nations citizens will provide the content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming months the government will consult with first 
nations like never before.  Within the next few weeks we will 
begin holding community level consultations across the country to 
assess the scope, options and interests to be dealt with in the 
legislation.  These consultations will take place during the 
spring and summer of this year, with the active participation of 
representatives from first nations and aboriginal organizations, 
from the leadership and the communities.  Results from these 
consultations will lead into the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we also have other innovative new ways to consult more 
thoroughly with first nations people and their leadership, I want 
to spend a couple of minutes talking about them, because these 
tools are part of a unique and different process that the 
department and the minister would like to use to consult with 
first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time we will extensively use videos, TV and print 
media to raise awareness of what is being proposed.  We have set 
up a 1-800 line with the Bella Bella call centre at the Heiltsuk 
First Nation in British Columbia to hear what individual band 
members have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am most excited about communicating through our 
website.  For the first time people will be able to access 
information on the web, write their comments via e-mail or chat 
with first nations members from across the country to exchange 
ideas and put forward suggestions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will consult with first nations to consider 
changes to the Indian Act, which has not been changed 
significantly since 1867.  I hope that my opposition colleagues 
will not take issue with this change to one of Canada's oldest 
pieces of legislation, which they may be attached to.  There may 
be a temptation to focus on the obstacles and challenges, but I 
would warn the opposition that is not the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often some of the opposition in the House has focused the 
blame on the failures of a few instead of looking for inspiration 
to the successes found among many first nations.  This 
consultation process will look for what works and build on those 
successes.  I hope the opposition will change its approach and 
credit those successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this initiative I hope to strip away the powers of the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development as they 
relate to the day to day governance of first nations and put them 
where they belong, in the hands of first nations, in an interim 
step to self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope also that the opposition will not confuse this 
initiative with its motion on financial accountability.  This 
initiative is about listening to first nations people, councils 
and chiefs who will provide best practices on governance systems. 
It is not about a few examples of the mistakes made in the past. 
It is about people, not politics, and it is about hearing the 
views of first nations people, not telling them about the 
opinions, informed or otherwise, of politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about weakening first nations, as the Alliance would 
have us do.  Instead, this is about strengthening first nations, 
about building strong, vibrant and successful first nations 
leaders and communities for the generations which follow us.

of first nations people as we enter into this consultation.

Northern Development.  I do so on behalf of my Canadian Alliance 
colleagues and as the chairman of the leader's advisory committee 
on Indian and Northern Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My role in that position is to listen to band members, ranchers, 
the tourism industry, businesses and other Canadians affected by 
this act.  I would be pleased to share my findings with the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has long advocated for and on behalf of 
aboriginal people, the people who make up the bands themselves, 
the people who are all too often living in squalid conditions, 
with poor or limited health care.  They suffer from exceptionally 
high rates of diabetes, alcohol and drug abuse, infant mortality, 
fetal alcohol syndrome and high rates of suicide, particularly 
among their youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance upholds the principle of accountability, 
fiscal and electoral accountability.  The privilege of being 
elected to a position of leadership means that we will accurately 
reflect the needs of all of constituents, not just those who 
agree with us.  The privilege of being elected to a position of 
leadership means that we must use and distribute funds and 
resources wisely among all of those who need them.  The privilege 
of being elected to a position of leadership means that we must 
bear the burden of making hard but fair decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has long stated that the Indian Act does 
not work.  The act is repressive and has long been in need of a 
major overhaul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to hear that the minister has acted accordingly and 
is willing to make serious changes to the way in which our 
aboriginal people are governed.  His announcement early this week 
regarding the first nations governance act and his comments today 
are a welcome first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the consultation process 
announced in this proposed bill.  I do, however, wish to comment 
that the consultation process must be taken seriously.  It must 
be transparent and real.  It must truly listen to the people, not 
just the aboriginal leadership.  It is easy to consult with 
organized groups such as the AFN and chiefs.  It is not easy to 
truly listen to the rank and file members.  The Canadian Alliance 
will ensure that those voices and concerns, both native and 
non-native, are heard and listened to during this process.

carefully to provincial and municipal governments throughout the 
process.  These levels of government will, as the minister has 
indicated, be engaged at the appropriate level.  The term 
self-government can be interpreted in a variety of ways and 
requires clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of B.C., the majority of land claims are 
still pending.  As the settlement process moves along it is 
imperative that all stakeholders play an active role in the 
process as we move toward native self-governance.  Furthermore, 
we must together ensure that the proper human, logistical and 
financial resources are available to aboriginal people as they 
move toward self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our past failings has been to quickly pass responsibility 
to native bands without the proper analysis and without assisting 
them through the transition period to ensure they do not fall 
between the cracks.  Taking responsibility for a service such as 
health care is important.  However if the resources are not in 
place to manage it then a disservice is done to the people who 
need the health care.  We must proceed down this path cautiously 
but with the aim of effecting real change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has heard correctly from aboriginal people and the 
Canadian Alliance that the status quo is not acceptable.  The 
system is not working.  If it were, aboriginal people would not 
be facing the dire conditions seen on so many reserves today. The 
status quo is not acceptable, but I would caution the minister 
not to rush the process.  Broad based consultation is appropriate 
and right.  I ask the minister to find ways to ensure that all 
aboriginal people can provide feedback.  Chat rooms are a viable 
method, but let us remember that many aboriginal people do not 
have access to computers.  The consultation process must gather 
information from all stakeholders using a wide variety of 
methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the minister would have Canadians believe, the 
Canadian Alliance is about strengthening all people, including 
aboriginal people.  Unfortunately the Indian Act and the 
government have done a good job of eroding the strength of most 
Canadians.  We are not here to create division.  We must instead 
work to create harmony and better understanding among all people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance cautiously looks forward to the first 
phase of the government's act.  I urge all aboriginal people to 
ensure that the minister hears their voice.  This is their 
opportunity to take control of their own future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too am pleased to discuss the important announcement 
by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, the Bloc Quebecois supports any measure aimed at 
modernizing the archaic political system that has been imposed 
for over 100 years on aboriginal communities by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's initiative announced today is laudable, but one 
wonders about the government's real intentions. We must deplore, 
among other things, the quick and expeditious shelving of the 
voluminous report of the Erasmus-Dussault commission. 
That was a serious mistake and the Bloc Quebecois has always 
been very sensitive to the implementation of the commission's 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also deplore the fact that, since 1999, the minister has not 
kept his promises on the reform of the Indian Act, including the 
sensitive issue of the matrimonial regime of women on reserves. 
Aboriginal women do not all enjoy the same rights. Those living 
off reserve enjoy the right to a fair splitting of the conjugal 
assets when their marriage fails. Unfortunately, that is not the 
case for women living on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's initiative and his reassuring words must not have 
the effect of putting off indefinitely what first nations have 
been seeking for so long, such as the inherent right to 
self-government, aboriginal and treaty rights, and management 
powers over, among other things, land and natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation process proposed by the minister also raises 
many major issues.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strikes me as a desire to reinvent the wheel.  Why launch 
this consultation process when it is scarcely five years since 
the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples tabled its report? 
This, hon. members will recall, was a commission that did a very 
thorough job and cost the Canadian taxpayer close to $50 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister took the trouble to read that report with care, 
he would certainly find it to be a major source of inspiration, 
and time, energy and money would be saved.  Also, there are many 
questions, and nebulous questions at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the aboriginal right to vote be addressed properly if 
the vital matter of the inherent right to self-government is not 
touched upon at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will this consultation process impact upon the negotiations 
currently under way?  Do they need to be suspended in order to 
avoid any type of interference?  How long will this famous 
interim step, as the minister called it, last?  Is the minister 
really assured of the support of the first nations for the 
consultation process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the conclusions the minister wishes to reach 
consist in imposing the federal government's vision on the 
aboriginal people, as it has tended to do for a century, and on 
the provinces, as it has for several decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, by transferring its powers relating to day to day 
administration to the first nations, is the central government 
not seeking to quietly dump onto those same first nations its 
fiduciary obligation, without providing them with the necessary 
resources indispensable to their viability, and particularly to 
their prosperity?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the minister coming before the House today to explain 
the government's latest initiative to improve relations with 
first nations people specifically as it pertains to governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I speak for most Canadians when I say we were heartened 
and encouraged that the Speech from the Throne made reference to 
issues facing aboriginal people.  In doing so it signalled a 
growing recognition that the current relationship between the 
government and first nations people is not sustainable.  It must 
be revisited, reworked and renewed, and hopefully without delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act can best be described as 130 years of social 
tragedy.  Canada's treatment of aboriginal people is its greatest 
shame.  Actions to date in dealing with aboriginal people have 
had the effect, either by action or omission, of creating a 
permanent underclass in our society.  No government to date has 
had the courage or the conviction to take pro-active steps to 
aggressively reverse this monumental injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of a new century there is cautious optimism 
that we are within reach of a breakthrough in our relationship 
with aboriginal people.  In that sense we are living in historic 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my proudest moments as a member of parliament was having 
the opportunity to rise in support of the historic Nisga'a 
treaty.  Well-meaning people throughout Canada celebrated with 
the Nisga'a as they took the courageous steps necessary to 
realize their inherent right to self-governance.  In the House of 
Commons only the Canadian Alliance voted against the Nisga'a 
right to self-governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time to begin putting in place the necessary 
legislative framework to enable all first nations communities to 
exercise their right to self-determination and to achieve the 
dignity, pride and self-worth that results when oppressed people 
fight for and achieve that basic freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the minister that the current Indian Act is 
outdated and obsolete.  It was created for a different era, an 
era that never contemplated there would come a time when 
aboriginal people would fight for and win recognition of their 
inherent right to self-governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with cautious optimism that we receive the minister's 
information today.  We recognize the need for careful and 
meaningful consultation prior to such a fundamental departure 
from the status quo.  We accept that there is a need to build 
consensus.  We appreciate what seems to be a sincere effort to 
consult far and wide by whatever technology is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we caution the minister that bold reforms often breed 
apprehension and mistrust.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some aboriginal leaders have already indicated that they will 
boycott the process.  Some say there might be a hidden agenda. 
Others express frustration that they have been consulted to 
death.  Many point out that the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples was the most comprehensive and exhaustive consultation in 
recent history.  Yet six years later its five volumes sit on 
shelves.  They say the progress report “Gathering Strength” 
should have been named gathering dust because that has been the 
sum total of its experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal leadership does not agree on everything but it is 
unanimous in one regard.  It is united in calling for the 
implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples.  Over the course of five years and $50 
million positions were developed, presented, recorded and drafted 
into meaningful recommendations.  However, rather than implement 
the recommendations, we are about to embark on yet another round 
of comprehensive consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants the initiative to be seen as an interim 
step toward self-government.  It hopes it will ultimately provide 
first nations some authority and control over their day to day 
administration.  It also hopes broad consultations will lead to a 
sharing of practices and that communities with strong 
administrative skills are encouraged to provide guidance and 
leadership to those with weaker skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Built into this aspect of the initiative is the recognition that 
most first nations communities already manage their affairs in a 
professional manner.  It is hoped that they will share their 
experience with other communities and ultimately develop national 
standards of excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the minister that all too often the official 
opposition has focused on the failures of a few rather than the 
successes of the vast majority.  The Canadian Alliance Party has 
been intellectually dishonest in pointing to isolated incidents 
of financial mismanagement and arguing that all aboriginal 
leadership is corrupt or incompetent.  I resent that position. 
Its continual attacks are nothing more than a thinly veiled 
attempt to undermine aboriginal self-governance which it clearly 
opposes vigorously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged to hear the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development say it is his intention to strip away his 
power over the day to day governance of first nations and put it 
back where it belongs: in the hands of first nations.  I view 
that as an interim step toward self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister's announcement moves us one step closer to 
self-governance and self-determination for aboriginal people then 
he can count on the support of the NDP caucus. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, no 
public policy issues facing the government and the people of 
Canada are more complex than those concerning first nations 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party endorsed the inherent right 
to self-government of Canada's first nations when drafting the 
1992 Charlottetown accord.  It was a Conservative government that 
established the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and gave 
it a broad mandate to study and report on all issues affecting 
the lives of Canada's aboriginal peoples.  Progress on all such 
issues has been slow.  The Nisga'a land settlement was only 
recently approved after having taken years to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no one size fits all solution to the problems facing 
Canada's first nations.  Self-government as set out in the 
Charlottetown accord and implemented by the Nisga'a agreement is 
only one of many possible forms of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter which structure is desired, however, governments must 
move in that direction.  It is only through self-government that 
first nations people can begin to recover the dignity and power 
taken from them since the early settlement of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other issues face aboriginal people as well. 
These include determining a sound economic basis for first 
nations to grow, flourish and benefit from being a part of the 
country.  The legal and cultural role of first nations women 
needs to be addressed especially in the movement to 
self-government.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the most pressing concerns to be addressed are the complex 
issues facing first nations youth and first nations individuals 
living in cities without land base.  More than half the first 
nations population of Canada is under the age of 25 and living in 
cities.  Most often they are experiencing poverty and functioning 
alone, without direction.   Without significant steps being taken 
by governments in partnership with the first nations, these young 
people will become a generation lost to Canada and their own 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party feels that the minister needs to look no further than 
at the royal commission created by the former Progressive 
Conservative government for ideas and changes made to the Indian 
Act.  It has been mentioned on a number of occasions by previous 
speakers that it took years and millions of dollars to put the 
royal commission together.  I have seen the volumes.  There are 
recommendations in there that could have been implemented 
yesterday be implemented now 
or in the very near future without having to go through a make 
work project that the minister seems to be embracing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party believes that the ineffective paternalistic and 
colonial approaches of the Indian Act must give way to greater 
self-reliance and self-esteem through effective education, 
economic development, social justice and local control.  It must 
also lead eventually to the elimination of both the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development as well as the Indian 
Act, which would lead to self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party does not support the establishment of a third level 
of government.  Instead self-government is best achieved within 
the current system of our government.  The current government 
with this minister could make major progress, but it seems to be 
choosing what on the surface may be a delay tactic.  Progress 
delayed is progress denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface this initiative has the appearance of a make work 
project from a government that seems to be void of ideas.  It has 
the opportunity to look at the royal commission and to implement 
some of those ideas now.  However the process that the minister 
has chosen looks like another stalling tactic. I hope it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister could convince me and the first nations 
people that he wishes to consult.  I hope the process in place 
now will come to fruition and will not be another report sitting 
on a shelf gathering dust.  The policy issue is far too 
important, not only to the first nations but to the people of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the minister good luck and Godspeed.  I also wish he will 
be able to implement some of the things he is putting forward to 
his government and to the House in the not too distant future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1992 it was available in concentrated form.  Since 1992 
Health Canada has restricted this sale to a pre-mixed form with 
the concentration of 0.4%.  That has had the resulting effect of 
this particular ground squirrel destroying crops and hay land 
causing severe damage.  It is very costly to farmers in lost 
productivity, equipment repairs and injury to livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are petitioning parliament to amend the relevant 
regulations so as to permit the sale of concentrated liquid 
strychnine to registered farmers until such time as an effective 
alternative can be found.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the 
government's immigration targets and with reference to the 
document entitled “Not Just Numbers, A Canadian Framework for 
Future Immigration”, could the government indicate: (<I>a</I>) why an 
annual immigration target of 1% of Canada's population was 
chosen and what research material supports the selection of that 
percentage instead of a higher or lower percentage; (<I>b</I>) what 
research the government has drawn upon in determining the 
proportion of immigration which should be entrepreneurial class, 
family reunification class or other class; (<I>c</I>) what research 
the government has conducted or referred to in assessing the 
impact on Canada's medical system and social programs from the 
existing and proposed levels of family reunification class 
immigration; (<I>d</I>) what research the government has conducted to 
determine whether the economic contribution to Canada from 
immigration has been rising or falling over the past 30 years, 
and whether such a rise or fall in economic contribution is a 
result of the changes in target levels for specific class of 
immigrants; and (<I>e</I>) why the government no longer considers it 
an important requirement that prospective immigrants be 
proficient in one of Canada's official languages, and what 
studies it has drawn upon to conclude that relaxation of the 
language requirement will not cause serious social stresses and 
problems for new entrants?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B> Citizenship and Immigration Canada, CIC, is recognized as 
a leader in the area of policy research and for having advanced 
information relative to many other countries undertaking 
immigration policy research. This volume of work is available for 
review, as is extensive additional information relevant to many 
of the issues raised in your written request, on CIC's strategic 
research and review website located at 
http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/srr. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the government's immigration targets: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) Immigration provides numerous benefits to Canada including a 
larger domestic market of consumers, an increased supply of 
skilled workers and inflows of financial and human capital. As 
well, immigration continues to be an increasingly important 
component of population growth and for addressing the shrinking 
labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming fertility rates remain at present levels, continued 
immigration is the only means of forestalling an eventual decline 
in the population and resultant decline in the labour force. A 
study by McDonald and Kippen entitled “Ageing: The Social and 
Demographic Dimensions”, presented at the Association of the Americas 
2000 annual meeting in Los Angeles, March 23-25, 2000, confirms 
that the future labour supply of Canada is migration dependent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Canada's aging population, the recent United 
Nations report, “Replacement Migration: Is it a Solution to 
Declining and Ageing Population?”, concludes that population 
rejuvenation requires comparatively high levels of migration. 
Likewise, only higher levels of immigration will address the 
issues of population and labour force growth over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the benefits of immigration, and in particular the 
positive influences it can have on the demographic problems facing 
the country, the Government of Canada has created a vision and a 
strategy for the long term growth and sustainability of the 
nation. Immigration targets of approximately 1% of the population 
are fundamental underpinnings of this vision for the future of a 
prosperous Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In support of this vision, Citizenship and Immigration Canada is 
in the process of developing a multiyear planning process that 
strengthens the educated setting of annual levels targets by 
constantly assessing the needs of Canada, its provinces, cities, 
citizens and newcomers alike. The process will be informed not 
only through research but also through consultations with 
partners, including the provinces, and analysis of domestic and 
global trends. It will constantly weigh the benefits and costs of 
immigration, allowing for conscientious planning and managed 
progress toward the vision of a sustained and prosperous Canada 
through increased immigration levels. As flexibility is 
fundamental to multiyear planning, the process will continue to 
be refined and expanded in the years to come in order to meet the 
demands raised by rapid changes in the global and domestic 
environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Each category of immigrant brings unique benefits to Canada. 
A good balance for the nation is one that optimizes the benefits 
of both economic immigrants and family class immigrants. Economic 
immigrants support trade, industry and the economic growth of the 
country. Family class immigrants help build strong families, one 
of the foundations on which this nation and its communities is 
built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proportions of the economic and family class categories 
continue to be monitored by the department in consultation with 
provincial and territorial partners to ensure Canada's best 
interests are served. While the current balance benefits Canada 
in many ways, the best balance of immigrants for the country may 
change as shifts in demographics and economics occur. Canada, 
like many other countries, is undergoing changes at an 
increasingly rapid rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to competition for immigrants in the global marketplace and 
shifts in the movement of people, the number of applications 
received in the various categories and the final balance of 
landings are not entirely within the control of CIC. Therefore 
the department must monitor what is happening with respect to this 
balance and respond accordingly to position itself to attract the 
right mix of immigrants that will help build strong families and 
a strong economy. Through the multiyear planning process, ongoing 
analysis to ascertain the optimal balance of economic and family 
class immigrants and strategies to achieve this balance continue 
to be developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) In 2000 there were 60,426 immigrants landed under the family 
class. The proposed target range for 2001 family class landings 
is 57,000 to 61,000. The proposed target range for 2002, which 
is subject to change with the tabling of the 2002-03 immigration 
plan, is 59,800 to 63,700. Assuming the middle of these ranges 
were to be met, the changes in family class landings would amount 
to -2.4% and 2.2% respectively. The impact on Canada's medical system and 
social programs from these marginally different proposed levels 
is not expected to be of significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) Numerous studies have been undertaken to assess the economic 
benefits to Canada through the economic contributions of 
immigrants. However, experts argue that while an understanding of these 
contributions is important, the issue is extremely complex and 
difficult to measure reliably for the whole of the immigrant 
movement, let alone by individual immigrant categories. Much of 
this research activity is summarized and presented on the 
website I have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most well developed research in relation to immigrants and 
economics is in the area of the economic performance of immigrants 
themselves. By and large, immigrants are found to do well. 
Additional information on research initiatives in this area can 
be accessed at the Metropolis project's website at 
http://canada.metropolis.net. This site also includes relevant 
links to other immigration policy research initiatives and 
organizations that may be of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Language requirements for immigrants are presently being 
strengthened, not relaxed, through immigration policy and 
proposed legislation and regulations. Research indicates that 
proficiency in one of Canada's official languages is key to 
successful integration for immigrants. As such, the government 
considers it of primary importance that prospective immigrants be 
able to speak one of Canada's official languages and is proposing 
both measuring this proficiency more precisely and giving 
increased weight to this component of a prospective immigrant's 
application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 27—<B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the creation 
of a national weapons enforcement support team, NWEST: (<I>a</I>) will NWEST 
only support local law enforcement in anti-trafficking and 
anti-smuggling efforts, or will there be occasions where NWEST 
will act as the lead law enforcement unit while enforcing 
firearms related laws; (<I>b</I>) what will be the projected cost for 
the setting up and enactment of NWEST; (<I>c</I>) why was this funding 
not given to the RCMP so that our national police force could 
form a special unit similar to NWEST; (<I>d</I>) will the commencement 
of NWEST's operations result in the diminishment of Canada's 
existing law enforcement community; (<I>e</I>) have the new members of 
NWEST been sent to the United States to be trained for the NWEST 
by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, BATF, and if 
so; (i) how many people were sent for training; (ii) what are 
the backgrounds of the people who were trained; and (iii) what 
was the cost involved for the training and the travel? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> (a) NWEST will 
provide training to local law enforcement in all jurisdictions. 
It will work in a support role with local law enforcement to 
assist in anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling efforts. The team 
will also help the police community in dealing with issues of 
violence with firearms. NWEST will not take a lead law 
enforcement role in enforcing firearms related laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Consultations are known currently underway with the policing 
community across Canada and once these consultations are 
completed and the results know, an overall budget for NWEST will 
be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) As a result of consultations that took place over a two year 
period, the overwhelming recommendation from the policing 
community was to establish the unit initially with those directly 
responsible for the administration of the Canadian firearms 
program. Discussions with the RCMP are ongoing. NWEST provides 
training support to all police agencies across Canada. The RCMP 
provides lead investigative services and lead investigative 
support services for all police services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) NWEST will actually augment and provide expertise and 
training to local law enforcement officials in all jurisdictions. 
NWEST will support frontline police agencies in the gathering of 
evidence in order to assist them in successfully prosecuting 
persons involved in the illegal movement and criminal use of 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) No member of NWEST has been sent to the United States to be 
trained by the BATF. The purpose of NWEST is to support front- 
line police agencies in the gathering of evidence in order to 
assist them in successfully prosecuting persons involved in the 
illegal movement and criminal use of firearms.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA NATIONAL MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK177">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.) </B>moved 
that Bill C-10, an act respecting the national marine 
conservation areas of Canada, be read the second time and sent 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for over 100 years, 
Canadians and their governments have built up a network of 
national parks of world renown.  This parliament now has the 
opportunity to prepare the way for the establishment of a 
network of national marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, future generations of Canadians will be able to 
appreciate the diversity of our magnificent marine environments 
and benefit from them as they already do in the case of the 
exceptional natural spaces of our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term objective we are promoting is to have each of the 
29 marine regions in Canada represented in the national network 
of marine conservation areas.  We will similarly establish a 
national park in each of the 39 natural land regions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of the marine conservation areas, like each national park, 
should illustrate the region it represents exceptionally. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who believe that national marine conservation 
areas will be just watery national parks.  That is not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the national parks, the first priority is preservation of 
ecological integrity where park zoning and visitor use are 
concerned.  In other words, parks are administered so as to keep 
them basically unchanged by human activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, marine conservation areas are designed to be models of 
sustainable use.  They are administered so as to balance 
protection and use.  That is why we need legislation that is 
specifically adapted to the national marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take advantage of this opportunity to provide a brief 
overview of the legislation, indicating how it is designed to 
manage protected areas in our complex marine environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill establishes the legal and regulatory framework for 
creating and managing national marine conservation areas.  It 
does not by itself create any specific area.  Instead, it 
provides the mechanism for formally establishing national marine 
conservation areas under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national marine conservation area is formally established when 
its land description is added to a schedule of the act.  This 
brings those lands under the formal protection of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in a recently proclaimed Canada National Parks Act, Bill C-10 
sets out an order in council process for the establishment in law 
of national marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the order in council process will speed up the scheduling 
of new areas, I want to assure the House that the supremacy of 
parliament remains.  The bill requiring the proposals to 
establish new national marine conservation areas must be tabled 
in both Houses and referred to the appropriate standing 
committees for their consideration.  Should either House reject 
the establishment of the new areas, the order in council would 
not proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress, however, that the order in council 
process would not be used for any proposal to remove lands from a 
national marine conservation area.  Like national parks, these 
areas are established in perpetuity and thus the bill requires an 
act of parliament to reduce the size of any existing site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case for our national parks, Bill C-10 requires 
federal ownership of all lands to be included in a national 
marine conservation area, both above and below the water.  This 
ensures that the Minister of Canadian Heritage will have 
administration and control of these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a province owns all or part of the seabed in an area where 
Parks Canada proposes to establish a national marine conservation 
area, the province would have to agree to the use of those lands 
for a marine conservation area and a federal-provincial agreement 
would be required to transfer ownership to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, without such an agreement the proposed national marine 
conservation area cannot proceed, and for greater certainty, this 
requirement is specified in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In marine areas where there is contested federal-provincial 
jurisdiction, I would like to assure the House that the federal 
government has no intention of acting unilaterally.  There will 
always be consultations with the province concerned with a view 
to finding a mutually satisfactory resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address the role of consultation.  There is 
a very clear requirement for public consultation in the 
establishment of any national marine conservation area, with 
particular emphasis given to affected coastal communities.  The 
nature of these consultations is set out in Parks Canada 
policies.  The steps required by these policies can take years to 
complete.  The national marine conservation area feasibility 
studies, which have already been launched by Parks Canada, 
illustrate that this policy is already in action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to emphasize again, if there is no public support for the 
creation of a national marine conservation area in a given 
location, then the proposal would not be brought forward to 
parliament.  Parks Canada will look to another area with which to 
represent the marine region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government decides to take the final step and formally 
establish a national marine conservation area, parliament will 
have an opportunity to examine the proposal in detail and satisfy 
itself that there is indeed community support. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 also calls for active stakeholder participation in the 
formulation, review and implementation of management plans. 
Again, the legislation provides for accountability to parliament 
through the tabling of management plans for each marine 
conservation area.  In addition, the minister must table a report 
in parliament every two years on the state of national marine 
conservation areas and on progress toward completion of the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coastal communities need certainty before an area is 
established.  Therefore, when a new proposal comes before 
parliament, along with the report on the consultations held and 
any agreements reached with the provinces and other departments, 
there will also be an interim management plan.  Management 
advisory committees will be created for each marine conservation 
area to ensure that consultation with local stakeholders 
continues on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The management plans for each area must be reviewed at least 
every five years.  Thus the government will take a learn by doing 
approach for every national marine conservation area.  Ongoing 
consultations within each marine conservation area will allow 
Parks Canada staff to learn from local people, drawing on the 
traditional ecological knowledge of coastal communities and also 
aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada has taken a partnership approach in the management 
of the program and this is clearly reflected in the bill.  Other 
ministers have statutory responsibilities that will affect the 
management of national marine conservation areas.  Bill C-10 has 
been carefully drafted to take that fact into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address how Bill C-10 reflects the 
government's commitment to working with aboriginal peoples.  The 
legislation includes provisions to establish reserves for 
national marine conservation areas.  These are established when 
an area or a portion of an area is subject to a claim by 
aboriginal peoples that has been accepted for negotiation by the 
Government of Canada as a comprehensive land claim.  Reserves are 
managed as if they were national marine conservation areas, but 
without prejudice to the settlement of the claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A non-derogation clause has been added regarding aboriginal and 
treaty rights.  No provisions of the act will derogate the right 
guaranteed to aboriginal people under the constitution.  There is 
also a specific requirement in the legislation to consult with 
aboriginal organizations and bodies established under land claim 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the legislation explicitly recognizes traditional 
aboriginal ecological knowledge in carrying out research and 
monitoring studies in national marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain activities are indeed prohibited throughout all national 
marine conservation areas.  The most important of these 
prohibitions concerns non-renewable resources, specifically 
mineral, oil and gas.  Marine conservation areas are managed for 
sustainable use and by definition extraction of non-renewable 
resources is not sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other activities would also be regulated through zoning.  I 
would like to emphasize to the House the importance of zoning as 
a powerful and flexible tool for managing use within a marine 
conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each national marine conservation area there will be multiple 
use zones where ecologically sustainable uses are encouraged, 
including fishing.  There will also be zones where special 
protection is afforded.  For example, critical spawning grounds, 
cultural sites, whale calving areas and scientific research 
sites would be protection zones where resource use is not 
permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each marine conservation area will contain these two types of 
zones.  At the same time enough flexibility is left in the bill 
to ensure that each area can have a zoning plan that is 
appropriate to its individual situation.  Parks Canada will 
identify the location of protection zones and surrounding 
multiple use zones for each proposed marine conservation area 
during the feasibility study for that area in full consultation 
again with local stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal legislation, such as the Fisheries Act and the Canada 
Shipping Act, is already being used to manage activities in the 
marine environment.  These statutes were not intended to cover 
the special requirements of national marine conservation areas. 
Thus, Bill C-10 includes a number of regulation making 
authorities which would be used to fill in the gaps in these 
other statutes.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the bill includes authorities to make regulations 
for the protection of cultural resources, for visitor safety, for 
the establishment of zones and the control of activities within 
those zones, and finally, for the control of overflights by 
aircraft that pose a threat to wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides checks and balances on the substance of 
the regulations that may be made under the act.  Specifically, 
any regulations that impact on the jurisdictions of the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans or the Minister of Transport must be made 
on the recommendation of both the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
and the affected minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation also includes penalties for offences 
against the Canada national marine conservation areas act or its 
regulations, which would be exactly the same as those that are in 
fact under part II of the Oceans Act.  Fines of up to $500,000 
may be levied for offences under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reiterate that Bill C-10 is framework 
legislation.  It provides the tools needed to create national 
marine conservation areas and to manage each one in a way that is 
appropriate to its unique characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we have indeed struck an appropriate balance 
between protection and sustainable use.  Very few activities are 
completely prohibited, but tools are available to regulate 
activities to ensure that the structure and function of each 
area's ecosystems are not compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to consult affected communities during 
feasibility studies, in the management planning process, and in 
preparing the applicable regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each area will be unique, unique in its characteristics and also 
uniquely managed.  A national marine conservation area in 
Georgian Bay will be distinct from one in the Beaufort Sea or in 
the Strait of Georgia or in the Bay of Fundy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs this legislation so that outstanding examples of 
our country's natural and cultural marine heritage can be 
provided with long term protection and so that all Canadians can 
learn more about and experience this shared heritage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to speak as the 
official opposition critic for Canadian heritage on this bill, 
Bill C-10, an act respecting the national marine conservation 
areas of Canada, at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have before us today is the third attempt to pass this 
legislation.  This bill was Bill C-48, then Bill C-8 in the last 
parliament, and now returns as Bill C-10 in this parliament. What 
does this tell us about the commitment of the government to this 
legislation?  It tells us that the commitment is not very great 
and it is very evident why.  Even after three tries this 
legislation remains seriously flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us not be fooled by the language that was originally 
used to introduce this legislation.  I certainly would not 
disagree with a proposal that would require marine conservation 
areas to be established for the protection and conservation of 
“representative marine areas of Canadian significance” and 
would be “for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people 
of Canada and the world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, upon closer inspection the bill does far more than the 
government is prepared to admit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first area of concern I wish to draw attention to is one 
involving the consultation process and where these 29 
representative marine conservation areas are to be established. 
As with the first two bills, in this current bill the schedule is 
blank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government afraid of?  The government is afraid that 
the same thing will happen as what occurred in the Bonavista and 
Notre Dame Bays area in Newfoundland, when political pressure 
from the local Liberal member, and I suspect from the current 
industry minister and former premier, stopped a marine 
conservation area from going forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not criticizing the former member for 
Bonavista—Trinity—Conception for representing his constituents 
and their well founded fears that unemployment and economic 
hardship would follow the good intentions of a federal bureaucrat 
over 2,000 kilometres away in a comfy office, drawing a salary of 
$100,000 a year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about those ridings that have upheld the democratic process 
and elected a member of the loyal opposition or, worse, have an 
elected or weak or too compliant member of the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have real fears when we read the literature from the 
minister's department that talks about replacing the checks, 
balances and safeguards of parliament for, in the words of her 
department, the “simple, cost-effective procedure” of order in 
council to establish or enlarge marine conservation areas. 
Previous debates have pointed out this very serious flaw and yet 
here it is a third time and still this flaw remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to my colleague, the member for Dauphin—Swan 
River, for his input when this bill was Bill C-48.  He very 
clearly pointed out the Henry VIII clauses in the bill.  I 
encourage recently elected members of the House to read the hon. 
member's speech.  Henry VIII believed in the divine right to rule 
and was always looking for ways to sidestep parliament and its 
ultimate authority as an elected body.  It seems some things 
never change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current process, where the act has to be opened up and 
amended when a new national park is contemplated or changes to an 
existing park are considered, may not be as efficient as the 
government would like but it is consistent with our democratic 
heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government is now beginning to realize, democracy can be 
messy.  It is this style of legislation, the Bill C-10s, that 
will span more Quebec City types of demonstrations.  As this 
government seeks new and creative ways to exclude people from the 
democratic process, unfortunately we will all pay the price with 
a fractured nation.  Separatism feeds on these sorts of 
government dictates.  If the minister were truly interested in 
freedom of speech, she would not be proposing government by order 
in council legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada have much to fear from the consultation 
process of the Department of Canadian Heritage.  The process is 
so flawed that not only does it ignore the advice of the people, 
it will not follow the advice of its own studies.  Nowhere is 
this more evident today than in the example of Parks Canada and 
its reaction to a health and safety issue regarding park wardens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should know that there have been three separate 
reports since 1993 that have identified unsafe working conditions 
for park wardens, particularly with the significant increase in 
fines for poaching in our national parks.  Park wardens are being 
put at greater and greater risk in the performance of their 
duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a ruling from the HRDC labour program inspector to force 
the department to respond.  Did the department and the minister 
do the right thing and accept the recommendations of three 
separate reports, recommendations, I might add, that are 
supported by the Public Service Alliance of Canada and the Animal 
Alliance of Canada?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister chose to ignore the best advice given and is 
blundering forward with an ill conceived and costly measure that 
makes no sense at all.  It is very clear that the minister has a 
very poor record when it comes to taking good advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason we in the official opposition can see for the 
government to ignore its own advice would be because of some 
hidden agenda.  The reported plan to replace park wardens with 
RCMP officers, with a detachment in every national park in 
Canada, is absolutely sinister.  What better way for a federal 
government to enforce unpopular laws, laws that the provincial 
governments want no part of, than to do it with its own police 
force?

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the federal government enacts more unpopular laws on an 
unwilling rural population, how convenient that the federal 
police officers are there for the Liberal government to call 
upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This labour dispute that Parks Canada is having with its park 
wardens will impact upon this legislation in a very significant 
manner.  Clauses 18 to 23 of Bill C-10, the enforcement section 
of the act, in the current labour dispute means the act would not 
be enforced.  It is one thing to require RCMP officers on land to 
go after poachers.  Has the minister, in her $37 million request 
to the treasury board for the money to replace park wardens with 
RCMP officers, also put in a request for boats? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is beginning to sound like the gun registry boondoggle, 
where an $85 million cost has skyrocketed to $600 million and 
counting.  The people of the city of Pembroke in my riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke are currently in the process of 
raising the money locally to buy a CAT scanner, thanks to the 
federal government's two tier health care policy.  That $637 
million would save a lot of lives in the community of Pembroke 
and a lot in other parts of rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and members of the official opposition are very concerned 
about the consultative process, based on the concerns expressed 
to our members over the bias of this government against rural 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I understand that the letter from the Mayor of Kitimat was 
made available to the members on the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage when this legislation was called Bill C-48, I 
would like to quote from his letter as I believe it to be a fair 
reflection of the thoughts and feelings of rural Canadians: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, urban Canadians and senior levels of government seldom 
grasp the values associated with rural life, whether it be 
fishing, farming or forestry.  All too often, regulation and 
legislation occurs that impacts rural Canada and rural Canadians 
significantly, while having little or no impact on urban life 
and, therefore, is supported wholeheartedly by the non-rural 
vote.  In the best case scenario governments end up conceding 
ignorance.  At other times a blatant disregard for rural 
Canadians occurs and is only rectified once social or economic 
crisis occurs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a misunderstood rural population, we often wish the same 
commitment and daily practice toward our environment would be 
evident in urban centres.  Often it appears that those who push 
for environmental and conservation laws do not enact the same 
values with their own regions...We understand our rural and 
remote populations are small, however...we chose to live in rural 
locations.  At best, it is our hope that Canada be governed based 
on assessed needs and values of all Canadians...Further, we hope 
that persistent inaccuracies and ignorance of rural and remote 
lifestyles can be overcome. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter is quite a bit longer.  However, I hope the essence 
of what the mayor was trying to convey about the legislation is 
apparent.  The majority of Canadians, especially those of us in 
rural Canada, do not trust the federal bureaucracy to represent 
our interests fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when we get good people who as public servants are trying 
to do the best job possible, they are overruled by their 
political masters, as is the case with the park wardens.  Too 
often our interests have been sacrificed to political expediency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are too many votes for the Liberals in the city of Toronto 
to require it to deal with its own garbage.  It is so much easier 
to dump it in someone else's backyard, in this case the backyard 
of the people in the riding of Timiskaming—Cochrane, near the 
pretty town of Kirkland Lake.  Better to lose one seat than to 
jeopardize that big urban vote, and this government wonders why 
rural people should fear Ottawa when cynical calculations such as 
this are made by a troika of political manipulators.  Actions 
speak louder than words. 
Where was the Minister of the Environment?  For a government that 
is constantly looking for ways to intrude into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, it suddenly became remarkably silent on 
the issue of Toronto's garbage.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am optimistic that maybe this time, the third time the 
legislation has come forward, the government might surprise 
Canadians and address some of these concerns.  For this I look 
beyond the minister and her cabinet cohorts to her caucus 
colleagues, in particular those MPs who represent rural 
constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those Ontario MPs whose ridings border the Great Lakes should be 
very concerned about how the legislation will adversely impact 
farmers, fishing enthusiasts, resort operators and other small 
business people who are the backbone of our nation.  They should 
not be fooled by the soothing words of the minister and her 
bureaucrats when they tell them not to worry, be happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the farmer who sprays his or her crops with herbicide? 
Once the marine parks act is in place the regulators will move 
into the watersheds.  The legislation will finish off those 
farmers who have not already been pushed out of business by 
foreign subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland got off lucky when the marine 
conservation area in their backyard was stopped.  Will others be 
so lucky when the legislation is passed?  It was lucky for them 
when they raised their objections that it was not yet law.  Do 
rural constituents favour letting the bill drop the way it was 
the first two times? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the minister's own riding borders Lake 
Ontario.  It has been pointed out previously that her own 
legislation could be used to shut down her constituents' largest 
employer.  Cootes Paradise is certainly a unique waterfront, so 
unique in fact that several years ago the answer to the pollution 
in Hamilton harbour was to pave the bay.  I am very surprised 
that the minister is proceeding with the legislation that has the 
real possibility of doing great harm to her constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the department of heritage's own admission there is already 
enough federal and provincial legislation in place to protect and 
conserve heritage resources.  Federal-provincial agreements are 
in place for marine conservation areas in Ontario and British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently federal legislation is in place for the Saguenay 
region of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec.  The federal 
legislation for St. Lawrence park was accompanied by 
complementary provincial legislation.  Obviously the Quebec 
government saw the threat of federal intrusion and reacted 
accordingly.  Why is there a need for the legislation other than 
the usual power grab by the Liberals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the Liberal government is being pressured 
by NAFTA and the United States to allow bulk water sales.  The 
trial balloon floated by the member for Toronto—Danforth before 
the summit of the Americas was no coincidence.  Some Canadians 
are concerned that Bill C-10 is a Trojan horse for bulk water 
sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation clearly impacts on provincial jurisdiction and 
would give the Liberal government the wedge it needs to start 
negotiations for bulk water export from the Great Lakes to the 
United States.  These people are concerned that the government 
operates on the basis of multiple hidden agendas, except this 
agenda for water sales is being exposed for what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a coincidence that at the same time as Bill C-10 shows up 
on the parliamentary agenda a sister bill, Bill C-6, shows up. 
Surprise, surprise, it is all about licences for those people who 
want to engage in bulk water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it should be the Minister of Foreign Affairs who is 
identified as the sponsor of the bill.  The legislation is a 
clear encroachment into an area of provincial jurisdiction.  Once 
the bill is in place, the minister has arranged for any changes 
to be by order in council and thus avoid public debate in the 
House of Commons and in the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario is on record as opposing bulk water 
exports from the Great Lakes, and the federal government is 
currently unable to act without provincial agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is conceived in such a way as to avoid that 
scrutiny.  I challenge the federal government to accept 
amendments to the legislation that would expressly prohibit the 
bulk export of water from the Great Lakes and a clearer 
definition of sustainable use in national marine conservation 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision about whether Canada should or should not allow for 
the bulk export of water should be done in open and in public. 
The Toronto <I>Star</I>, as the in house organ of the Liberal 
Party, is opposed to bulk water sales.  We know the government is 
deathly afraid of doing anything to disturb that Toronto vote and 
recriminations that would be heaped upon it by the <I>Star</I> in 
any debate regarding water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is government by stealth.  Unlike the Liberals we 
in the official opposition want open debate regarding any issue 
that impacts the public.  Barring that and other changes we in 
the official opposition intend to propose, we are willing to tell 
the government to let the bill drop once again until, and only 
until, the concerns of all Canadians are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the third time out the government is timid 
about Bill C-10 in public.  I have had the privilege of meeting 
some parliamentarians on the government side who feel the same 
way the rest of us do who represent rural constituencies and must 
share the same fears I have expressed about this type of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation, even if it were needed, is too flawed to go 
forth in its current form.  We in the Canadian Alliance affirm 
the role of the federal government in the preservation of 
Canada's natural and historic heritage such as national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also affirm the right of Canada as a sovereign nation to 
govern itself in a way that benefits all its people.  We do not 
recognize the inevitable loss of sovereignty every time the Prime 
Minister goes off and makes a commitment before an international 
body, in this case the IUCN World Conservation Congress in 
October 1996, without first consulting the people who will be 
most severely affected by such an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, we require the input of parliament before the 
people of Canada are put on the hook for something they may be 
very unwilling to support.  The pretext for the legislation was 
that it was an international agreement.  I do not believe the 
framers of that agreement at the UN intended the Government of 
Canada to use it in any other way to erode democracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an issue for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. This 
is legislation, albeit in a greatly changed form, that more 
properly should be in the name of the Minister of the 
Environment.  This point was made previously in debate on Bill 
C-48 and Bill C-8.  The point needs to be emphasized here again: 
the issues before us and our international commitments concerning 
the environment should remain with that ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Canadian Alliance I would like to be able to 
support legislation to create national marine conservation areas. 
However as the legislation is presented it is not justified in 
its current form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to respond to those individuals who might be 
tempted to say that we should not throw the baby out with the 
bathwater because there are some worthwhile aspects of the bill 
that we surely can support.  To those individuals I say there is 
nothing in the bill the government could not accomplish if it 
would just sit down and take the time to talk to the provinces, 
which in turn would require the federal government to talk to 
those communities that would be affected by the creation of a 
marine park.  As proposed, the shortcut the bill is all about is 
not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I call upon the minister to send the bill back to 
the drawing board.  Maybe the fourth time out the government can 
get it right.

multiple sclerosis, a disease that primarily hits young people, 
including my daughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today was introduced in the House by the 
Liberal government for the third time, after dying on the order 
paper during each of the two sessions of the last parliament, as 
Bill C-48 and Bill C-8 respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, which is short on ideas, is coming back with 
the same bill, except for one thing: it has a different number. 
As for the rest, it is all the same as before. One would have 
thought that after listening to a large number of witnesses in 
committee during the last parliament, after hearing the concerns 
of parliamentarians in this House and after seeking a new 
mandate from the public, the Minister of Canadian Heritage would 
have changed her approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought the minister would have gone back to the 
drawing board to come up with a bill that was a bit more 
sensitive to the concerns raised by witnesses before the 
committee and by members in the House.  Nothing was done.  We 
are therefore very disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By introducing a bill which is a carbon copy of the previous 
version, the Minister of Canadian Heritage and her government 
have once again ignored anyone who did not share their views. 
That is why the bill is no more acceptable today than it was 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-10, an act respecting the national marine 
conservation areas of Canada, is to provide a legal framework 
for the establishment of 28 marine conservation areas, 
representative of each of the Canadian ecosystems. 
The Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park is the 29th marine 
conservation area. It will not be governed by this legislation 
since it already has its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that this bill follows a commitment 
made by the present Prime Minister at the 1996 convention of the 
World Conservation Union, held in Montreal. On this occasion, as 
in 1994, the World Conservation Union, which represents 74 
governments, 105 government agencies and more than 700 NGOs, 
passed resolutions calling on all coastal nations to put marine 
conservation measures in place quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I wish to say that the Bloc Quebecois has always been in 
favour of measures to protect our environment. 
I remind those listening that the Bloc Quebecois supported the 
government when it introduced its legislation to create the 
Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Bloc Quebecois opposed to this bill?  Despite the 
fact that we support the establishment of environmental 
protection measures, the Bloc Quebecois opposes it because, 
instead of focusing on working together, as it did in the case 
of the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park or phase III of the St. 
Lawrence action plan, the federal government is introducing 
marine conservation areas with no regard for Quebec's 
jurisdiction over its territory and environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heritage Canada is planning to introduce a new structure, marine 
conservation areas, which will duplicate the marine protection 
zones of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the 
protected marine areas of Environment Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heritage Canada wants to have marine conservation areas, while 
it has shown itself incapable of protecting the ecosystems in 
existing national parks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the conditions essential to the establishment of a marine 
conservation area is federal ownership of the land where the 
area is to be established.  Moreover, clause 5(2) of the bill 
provides that the minister cannot establish a marine 
conservation area, unless, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the Governor in Council is satisfied that Her Majesty in 
right of Canada has clear title to or an unencumbered right of 
ownership in the lands to be included in the marine conservation 
area, other than such lands situated within the exclusive 
economic zone of Canada; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fairly significant legal problem here, because 
subsection 92(5) of the Constitution Act, 1867, recognizes that 
the management and sale of crown land are matters of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction.  There is therefore no federal title in 
this context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Quebec legislation on crown lands, passed by the 
Quebec national assembly, applies to all crown lands in Quebec, 
including the beds of waterways and lakes and the bed of the St. 
Lawrence river, estuary and gulf, which belong to Quebec by 
sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this legislation provides that Quebec cannot 
transfer its lands to the federal government. 
The only thing it can do is to authorize the federal government 
to use them only in connection with matters under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the notes provided us by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage with regard to the bill before us, marine conservation 
areas are planned for the St. Lawrence, the St. Lawrence estuary 
and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. These are three areas in which the 
ocean floor is under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This almost sick propensity for the federal government to 
interfere where it has no business being is quite simply 
unacceptable.  Fortunately, the Bloc Quebecois is here to remind 
it of this, and to condemn its actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach is even more incomprehensible because co-operative 
mechanisms already exist to protect ecosystems in the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park, and in the St. Lawrence River 
under the agreement entitled "St. Lawrence action plan, phase 
III" which was signed by all federal departments and Quebec 
departments concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two examples that should be followed: the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence Marine Park and phase III of the St. Lawrence action 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977, the governments of Quebec and Canada passed identical 
acts to create the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park. This 
resulted in the creation of Canada's first marine conservation 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main features of that legislation is that the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park is the first Marine Park to be 
created jointly by the federal and Quebec governments, without 
any transfer of territory. The two governments will continue to 
fulfil their respective responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This park includes only marine areas.  Its boundaries may be 
changed only through an agreement between the two governments, 
provided there is joint public consultation in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ought to have served as a model for the federal government 
in the creation of other marine conservation areas, but no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another model that the Minister of Canadian Heritage could have 
followed is phase III of the St. Lawrence action plan. That 
phase, which was announced on June 8, 1998, represented a total 
investment of $230 million that was shared equally by both 
levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the heritage minister not follow these two successful 
initiatives and why is she now claiming exclusive ownership of 
the seabed to set up marine conservation areas, when 
partnerships in the area of the environment have so far been 
successful? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder about the true intentions of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. 
Will the federal government respect Quebec's constitutional 
territorial rights in that regard, or will it again ignore it to 
create marine areas where it believes such areas are necessary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is a shared jurisdiction. Let us never forget 
that, under the Constitution Act, 1867, the governments of 
Canada and Quebec share responsibility for the environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 92(1)(<I>a</I>) of the Constitution Act, 1867, Quebec 
passed an act respecting the conservation and development of 
wildlife that specifies, in section 2, the role to be played by 
the Quebec minister of the environment and wildlife. It is the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment and Fauna ensures the 
conservation and development of wildlife and wildlife habitats. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Quebec's legislation, the minister also has the authority 
to appoint conservation officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to use the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park Act as a 
model and by making title to the territory an essential 
condition for the establishment of marine conservation areas, 
the federal government would be able to establish marine 
conservation areas on submerged lands to which it claims to have 
title and thus bypass Quebec's environmental jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is important to be on the lookout and to reject 
any form of regulation or action which would undermine the 
national assembly of Quebec in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will not let the federal government have its 
way on this issue nor let it fulfil its insatiable desire to 
trivialize our institutions, our rights and our laws, just as it 
is not giving in on social policy in the young offenders 
legislation saga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Respect for the integrity of Quebec's territory alone justifies 
the fight the Bloc Quebecois is waging against this bill, but 
there are other reasons we must oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government intends to create marine conservation 
areas under the responsibility of Heritage Canada, so there is a 
lot of overlap within the federal government.  On the one hand, 
there is Heritage Canada and, on the other, there are marine 
protection areas under the responsibility of Fisheries and 
Oceans and marine wildlife areas under the responsibility of 
Environment Canada.  A lot of people are involved here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One question immediately comes to mind.  What are Heritage 
Canada's reasons for establishing marine conservation areas? 
They can be found in the preamble to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is establishing marine conservation areas “to protect 
natural, self-regulating marine ecosystems for the maintenance of 
biological diversity"; second, “to establish a representative 
system of marine conservation areas"; third, “to ensure that 
Canada contributes to international efforts for the 
establishment of a worldwide network of representative marine 
areas"; fourth, “to provide opportunities for the people of 
Canada and of the world to appreciate Canada's natural and 
cultural marine heritage"; and, fifth, “to provide opportunities 
within marine conservation areas for the ecologically 
sustainable use of marine resources for the lasting benefit of 
coastal communities". 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, it proposed the 
establishment of marine protected areas. 
However, in a discussion paper released by Fisheries and Oceans 
in January 1997 and entitled “An Approach to the establishment 
and Management of Marine Protected Areas under the Oceans Act", 
the purpose of marine conservation areas is also described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, we are told that local people will have a 
significant involvement in the establishment of marine protected 
areas. I wonder how many information or organization meetings 
local people will be invited to in order to satisfy its 
bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Environment Canada is proposing, so as not to be left 
behind, to establish marine and wildlife reserves, expanding the 
notion of the national wildlife sanctuary beyond the territorial 
sea to the 200 mile limit within the exclusive economic zone 
under the Canadian Oceans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These areas are also subject to the Canadian Wildlife Act, but 
require a different set of regulations, as the Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada discussion paper states on page 49. It is quite 
the pandemonium from what I can see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the hearings in February 1999, almost all coastal groups who 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to 
speak out against this bill emphasized their lack of 
understanding of the federal government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They argued that the Canadian heritage initiative would 
duplicate what is already being done by the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans and create a great deal of confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from some of the testimony given.  According to 
Patrick McGuinness, vice-president of the Fisheries Council of 
Canada: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the challenge for Canadian industry in the milieu of 
globalization is to be streamlined and efficient, we should be 
able to demand government structures that are also focused and 
streamlined. Regardless of the merits of MCAs, of this 
initiative, the manner in which it is brought forward will lead 
to confusion, duplication and conflicts in its implementation

Newfoundland, Aquaculture Industry Association: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To empower the Minister of Canadian Heritage for the MCA 
initiative effectively undermines the authority and mandate of 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans as provided for under the 
provisions of the Oceans Act. This should not be permitted to 
occur. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another excerpt, from the testimony by John Melindy, 
project co-ordinator, NMCA feasibility study advisory committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, through the Oceans Act, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans is empowered to declare marine protected areas to 
conserve species under threat. In view of this fact, we are 
mystified as to why Canadian Heritage is attempting to run a 
parallel conservation initiative under a separate piece of 
legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, then, call witnesses and then not pay any attention to 
their concerns?  Why not look into the areas we were directed to 
by the various witnesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear.  The government would have been better 
advised to have a single department oversee the protection of 
ecosystems and the departments concerned conclude a framework 
agreement delegating their responsibilities to the one chosen to 
be accountable in this matter, but the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage refuses to listen to reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of witnesses emphasized the duplications within the 
bill, but that is not all.  Is there even more confusion in this bill? 
If you answer yes, you hit the jackpot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As unbelievable as it may seem, the bill provides that each 
federal department will retain its own jurisdiction over the 
marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the Department of Canadian Heritage deems it 
appropriate, it may, in co-operation with the department 
concerned, adopt regulations regarding a marine conservation 
area that differ from the existing provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this might seem normal in other circumstances, the 
difficulties can only increase when Heritage Canada regulations 
are enforced in marine protected areas, marine wildlife reserves 
and marine conservation areas, each with their own regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another good reason for opposing this bill:  Heritage 
Canada is incapable of protecting the ecosystems in existing 
national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the Auditor General of Canada published chapter 31 on 
the management of national parks by Parks Canada.  In this 
chapter, the auditor general made some, to say the least, 
embarrassing observations, some of which follow: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monitoring the ecological condition of the ecosystems in 
national parks is a high priority, according to Parks Canada 
policies and guidelines. However, in many national parks, the 
ecological conditions are not monitored on a regular, continuing 
basis. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On average, the management plans for the 18 national parks were 
12 years old, when they should have been reviewed every five 
years. The park management plans provide strategic direction for 
the protection of park ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delays in preparing management plans and ecosystem conservation 
plans reduce Parks Canada's ability to preserve the ecological 
integrity of national parks. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot do their own homework regarding the follow up on 
national parks. How will they be able to do it for marine areas? 
The auditor general went even further when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that Parks Canada's ability to preserve 
ecological integrity in national parks and ensure sustainable 
park use will be seriously challenged. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before duplicating what is basically being done elsewhere, 
including with marine wildlife reserves by Fisheries and Oceans, 
would it not be logical for the Minister of Canadian Heritage to 
ensure that national parks ecosystems are protected for future 
generations, as stated in the National Parks Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a means that the Liberal government wants to have 
to impose its centralizing vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that is anxious to intrude in provincial 
jurisdictions. With this bill, we are seeing the exact opposite 
of the “flexible federalism" that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs boasts about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank goodness the Bloc Quebecois is there to condemn what the 
federal government is planning on doing, namely to duplicate and 
totally lack any consistency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House to speak to 
Bill C-10, an act respecting the national—they have now become 
national—marine conservation areas of Canada. 
They were only marine conservation areas before. Now they have 
become national marine conservation areas. It is a huge change 
that occurred between the 36th and the 37th parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the people who are watching us, I would like 
to remind the House that, in the first session of the 36th 
parliament, the government introduced Bill C-48, which dealt with 
this issue but left out the word national and just talked about 
marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill died on the order paper, because the Prime Minister 
decided to prorogue the House and start a new session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a new throne speech, in which the Prime Minister told 
us that his government had realized that it was time to put an 
end to federal-provincial overlap. That was quite a major 
announcement. We looked forward to see how it would come about. 
It was a disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon after, Bill C-8 was introduced. It came earlier in the 
session, as we can tell from the number it was given. It was 
introduced at the beginning of the second session of the 36th 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the first session, the bill had gone through first and 
second reading. Witnesses had appeared before the committee, a 
report had been tabled in the House and recommendations had been 
made. 
At the time, we thought that Bill C-8 would include 
improvements since the government had taken its time and had 
let public officials, lawyers, parliamentarians and witnesses 
spend time on it. We thought “All this money will not go to 
waste; the government will improve Bill C-8". 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No such luck. Bill C-8 was a carbon copy of Bill C-48. The bill 
went through first reading, second reading, and was referred to 
a committee, which heard witnesses and reported back to the 
House and made recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My former colleague, the hon. member for Portneuf who made the 
wise decision of going back to teaching, would be very 
disappointed to see Bill C-10, because after spending so much 
time on Bill C-8, he would feel that it was a waste of his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in all fairness to the government, I must say that Bill 
C-10 does include a few changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some changes were made in the preamble. For example, the French 
version of the old bill provided that marine areas had to be 
“représentatives et protégées", whereas in the new bill, they 
must be “protégées et représentatives". It goes without saying 
that this change, which is found in the preamble, adds a lot to 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also seeks to "recognize that the marine 
environment is fundamental to the social, cultural and economic 
well-being of people living in coastal communities". If the 
marine environment is essential to the development of coastal 
communities, from a social, cultural and economic point of view, 
why should we have marine areas where people will have to pay, 
as is the case with every national park? We have beautiful 
national parks, but we must pay to visit them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea was to protect ecosystems. The idea was to make sure 
that future generations would see the splendours of this vast 
country, but those who do not have money can no longer see this 
natural beauty, because they have to pay to do so.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to see how the government behaves. I will use an example 
with which I am very familiar. I see my colleague from 
Charlevoix. We both live in a coastal area, an area where there 
are problems in the lumber industry. What is being done to help 
our loggers? Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of problems with fishers. What is being done? 
Sure, there are all kinds of problems. Quotas are being given to 
other provinces, but the government is even unable to honour 
Quebec's historic fishing quotas. We are demanding our fair 
share, but it is being denied. Quotas are being given to people 
who never had any before, when the policy has always been to 
honour Quebec's historic quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have problems with loggers, with fishers, with seasonal 
workers. We were promised a reform of the employment insurance 
plan, which is not forthcoming. How do you think our coastal 
communities will react when the government tries to take their 
lands to create national marine conservation areas? I think we 
will be able to occupy our lands to fight expropriation. We will 
take action in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's arrogant attitude in forging ties with the 
communities will not serve it well when it tries to take their 
marine property, ignoring all social, cultural and economic 
considerations. A marine area will not put food on the table for 
people in our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else. The government wants to promote an 
understanding of the marine environment and provide 
opportunities for research and monitoring. 
If being ridiculous were fatal, the people in the government 
over there would all have been dead long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to return to some of the statements referred to by my 
colleague, which I find extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1996 report of the auditor general, chapter 31, on the 
management of national parks by Parks Canada, the auditor 
general makes the following statement “In the six national parks 
we reviewed, Parks Canada's biophysical information was 
out-of-date or incomplete except for La Mauricie". 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that everything is fine in La Mauricie National Park. 
Curiously it is in the Prime Minister's riding.  In five 
national parks out of six that were studied, there were problems 
with biophysical information. 
What are we going to do to promote knowledge of the marine 
environment and encourage research and monitoring activities? 
How can the minister do so when the parks have been in existence 
for some time and are incapable of doing this at present? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The text continues "Monitoring the ecological condition of the 
ecosystems in national parks is a high priority, according to 
Parks Canada policies and guidelines. However, in many national 
parks—he looked at six—the ecological conditions are not 
monitored on a regular, continuing basis."  What will be done in 
the marine parks if this is not even being done in the major 
parks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The text also states that management plans for 18 national parks 
were an average of 12 years old, even though they ought to be 
reviewed every five years.  A fine business:  the plans are to 
be reviewed every five years, but 18 parks had an outdated plan. 
This is the best that can be said in order to be elegant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plans set out strategic guidelines to protect the parks' 
ecosystems.  If the plan is out of date after five years, what 
state can the ecosystems of the park be in when the business 
plan is 12 years out of date?  That makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general added “Delays in preparing management plans 
and ecosystem conservation plans reduce Parks Canada's ability 
to preserve the ecological integrity of national parks".

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's findings on the state of our national 
parks were pitiful.  He said that in almost the majority of the 
parks visited there was no link between business plans and 
management plans.  That is pretty terrific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why officials are asked to do them if there is no link 
between the two.  The auditor general also expressed concern 
about the fact that, in some instances, park management plans 
focus mainly on economic and social factors and little on 
ecological factors.  This is what they are setting up in the 
parks to protect the ecosystems, and this is the department's 
last concern. 
The least of Parks Canada's concerns is looking after ecological 
factors, the very reason for its existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government says it is going to do this in marine areas, 
how can we be expected to believe what is written in black and 
white?  The government's intent, its political desire, is not 
worth even the cost of the paper these things are written on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is also concerned about the impact of the 
marketing plan on the preservation of ecosystems.  Thanks to its 
marketing strategy, Parks Canada expects to draw an increasing 
number of Canadians and foreign visitors, who will stay longer. 
This is about making more money, not protecting our ecosystems. 
This strategy should increase visits in off seasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that Parks Canada's ability to preserve 
ecological integrity in national parks and ensure sustainable 
park use will be seriously challenged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the legislation to be updated through Bill C-10, which 
includes good intentions, but already the government is not 
capable of doing what it is supposed to do with the parks, and I 
am not at all convinced that it will be able to do it with 
marine areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change is the provision to involve federal and 
provincial ministers and agencies, affected aboriginal 
organizations and coastal communities and other persons and 
bodies, including bodies established under land claims 
agreements, in the effort to establish and maintain the 
representative system of marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I see a good intention. 
However, when we look at how the government proceeded with the 
consultations on its own bill, we cannot give any credibility to 
that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the original bill, Bill C-48 was introduced, we told the 
government “Show us the results of the consultations that took 
place". We talked about these consultations in committee. 
Officials came to meet us and said that consultations were held 
and that this or that came out. However, when we wanted to get 
the real results of the consultation process, we had to apply 
under the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know what happens when you make an access to information 
request, Mr. Speaker, because you were once an opposition member. 
What it boils down to is that we have access to nothing, 
because what we receive are eight and a half by eleven sheets, 
usually with so many lines blacked out that it is impossible to 
read the text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was young, we did exercises where we filled in the 
blanks.  It would seem that access to information officials have 
retained memories of this experience and are supplying us with 
all sorts of blanks by blacking out the important bits that 
would allow us to understand the text.  Since the text is full 
of blanks, it takes quite a bit of imagination to be able to 
make any sense of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultation produced absolutely nothing.  We received 300 
sheets of paper. 
Only 73 of them resembled a sort of little reply coupon, which 
was attached to the consultation document.  Even then, we were 
unable to see the real results of the consultation.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the department tells us that the purpose of its bill is 
to respond to the concerns of those consulted, I say that that 
is false.  There is no evidence of this in the bill.  In any 
case, we are unable to obtain the evidence.  When someone is 
unable to prove what he is telling me when questioned, it is 
because there is no proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were, we would be handed the results of a real 
consultation, without a fuss, and told “Here are the questions 
we asked, here are the answers we received, and here is what we 
did with those answers".  Instead, we are kept in the dark 
and told “Yes, we consulted". 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to be increasingly more democratic in this 
country. The government just had 34 heads of state sign a 
declaration to the effect that democracy is the most important 
value. The government should apply democracy here, in our own 
country, before asking others to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also expands on this. This is an addition to the bill. 
After all, I can be fair. Clause 2(2) reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater certainty, nothing in this Act shall be construed so 
as to abrogate or derogate from the protection provided for 
existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples 
of Canada by the recognition and affirmation of those rights in 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was added in response to a request that they made or a 
concern they had expressed. 
I can see that the government responded positively to that 
concern, and this is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2(3) provides the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of a marine conservation area within the 
exclusive economic zone of Canada does not constitute a claim to 
any rights, jurisdiction or duties beyond those set out in 
section 14 of the Oceans Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, my colleague pointed out the interesting points in this 
bill. When the government decided to end the overlap in 
federal-provincial jurisdictions, it forgot to look at itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will find itself with all sorts of marine areas. 
We will no longer know how to distinguish among them, what to 
call them, or who is responsible for what. I assume that at some 
point, if something happens, everyone will pass the buck and 
people will be left asking what is happening and who is 
responsible for what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Canadian Heritage wants to create national 
marine conservation areas. Under the Oceans Act, Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada may create marine protection zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, how can one tell the difference between a marine 
protection zone and a national marine conservation area? The 
government is playing with words, with concepts, trying to take 
over as much territory as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian Wildlife Act, the federal government, through 
Environment Canada, can create national wildlife areas and 
marine wildlife areas. 
Under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, it can create 
migratory bird sanctuaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking about the beautiful area I come from and about my 
colleague in whose riding the beautiful Saguenay-St.Lawrence 
park is located. The government might want to create not far 
from there a national marine conservation area, a marine 
protection zone or a national wildlife area because they might 
be useful to have in this area of the country. This would bring 
in more tourism, since this seems to be the goal. Moreover, a 
marine wildlife area could be created there, as well as a 
migratory bird sanctuary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would mean five things in the same spot because it is a 
beautiful area and the federal government will say “It is so 
beautiful, we are taking it over".

say “So many witnesses were brought before the committee that 
there is nothing more to add".  On the contrary, they would 
say “You did not understand a thing about what we said before".

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our party to indicate that, 
with some significant reservations, we intend to support the bill 
at second reading stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as happened in the last House, after committee and the 
refusal on the part of the government to make the necessary 
amendments to make the bill more meaningful, if we do not get 
those amendments then we will be opposing it at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background, I will reflect on the need for the 
legislation.  Canada is behind the times on having this type of 
legislation.  We have this huge, magnificent country, surrounded 
on three sides by water.  Unlike a number of our other allies, we 
do not have this type of legislation to protect our marine areas. 
Specifically, the United States has had legislation since, I 
believe, the mid-seventies.  Australia and New Zealand both have had 
legislation for some period of time which goes a long way to 
protect their marine environment by creating these types of parks 
or conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the environmental issues that confront us, Canada 
has been slow in preparing and advancing this type of 
legislation.  It is high time that we have it. The proposed bill 
that is before the House today and which will eventually go to 
committee would empower the government to move into this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to mention some of the areas that 
environmental groups in particular, and local communities, 
including, in some cases, provincial governments, first nations, 
individual local municipal governments and environmental groups, 
have been working on.  There is a good number of these around 
the country and they are becoming very frustrated with the lack 
of involvement by the federal government in providing assistance 
to develop and protect these marine areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Nova Scotia raised the issue earlier this week or 
at the end of last week of the gully that is off Nova Scotia.  It 
is a gully that is larger than the Grand Canyon but it is 
underwater and it is at serious risk.  The oil and gas leases, 
which are not being exploited at this time, would create very 
serious damage and/or danger to the marine life and the ecosystem 
if they were to proceed.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal of work has been done on a very large park that is 
being proposed called Gwaii Hanaas off the coast of British 
Columbia on the Queen Charlotte Islands.  Some of the briefing 
background I have indicates that environmental groups worked very 
hard and for a great length of time on the particular marine 
park.  They have done it in co-operation with and with a great 
deal of assistance from the oil industry that has oil and gas 
leases in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To its credit, the industry has given up its right to those 
leases.  Everything is ready for the area to be designated.  I 
believe all the work was completed by 1997.  They have now been 
waiting for over four years for the designation.  Obviously it 
will still be some time before we get the legislation 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an area in the north off Baffin Island where a 
significant amount of background work has been done to prepare 
the area to be designated and hence protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been work done in Lake Superior, in the northern part 
of my home province, to designate an underwater park, which would 
enhance some of the other work done by the provincial government 
to preserve underwater parks for the enjoyment of the population. 
All these projects are at significant risk, so the importance of 
moving ahead cannot be overstated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP will be supporting the legislation.  Hopefully it can be 
moved to committee where there will be amendments to strengthen 
it.  The importance of the legislation is that it rounds out 
other legislation, to which we have had some reference today by 
other speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the Fisheries Act provides some mechanism for the 
government to protect marine species and ecosystems, but it is 
not enough.  We have the terrestrial land in the form of the work 
Parks Canada does in its empowering legislation, but this 
legislation fills a gap in the jurisprudence required to cover 
off the need to protect these areas.  I emphasize it is our 
responsibility to act as good stewards of the marine territory in 
a country the size of Canada.  The legislation is lacking in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cover some of the strengths and weaknesses in 
the specific legislation.  There is provision in the bill to 
provide for public consultation.  That would require consultation 
specifically with the provinces and the first nation communities 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some serious reservations.  We heard concern expressed by 
the previous speaker from the Bloc on whether the consultation 
process was broad enough, extensive enough and meaningful enough 
to satisfy the provinces and the first nation communities.  We 
share that concern.  In fact we feel it does not go far enough in 
that the bill needs to be amended and strengthened in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal specifically with a number of other issues now.  One 
is with regard to the lack of prohibition in the legislation in 
terms of bottom trawling.  It would be very detrimental to the 
ecosystem in the canyon off Nova Scotia.  It is deep water 
trawling.  It would be very damaging to fish species if it were a 
permitted use of that area. 
The legislation does not deal with that, and we will seek an 
amendment to prohibit such commercial activity in designated 
marine parks.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a similar concern with regard to dredging and the impact 
it has on fauna, currents and the general ecosystem.  The 
legislation does not prohibit dredging, deep sea or otherwise, in 
marine parks.  We will seek to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is also lacking in the whole area of aquaculture.  The 
royal society's report on genetically modified organisms warned 
in very strong language that genetically modified fish must 
absolutely not be allowed into the general fish population.  The 
bill does nothing to address that concern.  It is a serious issue 
because we know of instances around the world where whole fish 
stocks have been wiped out.  One can only imagine the impact on 
our marine parks if genetically modified species escaped and ran 
wild.  The bill must be amended to address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that the bill does not make ecological 
integrity the primary consideration when drafting management 
plans.  The bill's emphasis on ecosystem management is reasonably 
strong.  It applies the precautionary principle and I applaud it 
in that regard.  It may be the first piece of legislation in 
Canada to do so.  That is the good part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, however, the bill does not recognize that ecological 
integrity must be the primary consideration.  It is a glaring 
omission, and the preamble and other sections must be amended 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other concerns which our colleagues in the Bloc have 
expressed.  The Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park is a model for 
co-operation among all three levels of government.  The 
arrangement is not perfect but it has worked reasonably well.  It 
is a model that should be incorporated into Bill C-10 and we will 
be pressing for that when it goes to committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final point with regard to the bill is that it does not take 
into account terrestrial sources of pollution or other impacts 
that terrestrial activity could have on marine parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has implications at the national, provincial and 
international levels.  Activities may be carried on in the United 
States, for instance, that have a negative impact on marine parks 
in Canada.  The legislation does not contemplate that but it 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will often be land based pollution that impacts on marine 
parks.  There are all sorts of examples where this has occurred. 
Forestry and farming in British Columbia have affected coastal 
rivers and streams and led to problems with salmon stocks.  The 
bill does not take into account that risk or the need to deal 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all the points I will make.  We will be supporting the 
bill at second reading with the reservations already mentioned. 
We hope the government will adopt the amendments.  They would 
make the legislation more meaningful and help it achieve its aim 
of preserving marine parks for the Canadian population and for 
global use.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-10, an 
act respecting the national marine conservation areas of Canada, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank the member for Windsor—St. Clair for a very enjoyable 
speech.  I certainly learned a lot, as I am sure all of us did, 
about what is good and bad in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting and kind of shocking to learn more about 
what is not in the bill than what is in it.  The hon. member 
itemized some things he thought were glaringly absent.  One was 
the bill's complete silence on aquaculture, a booming new 
industry which is regulated but is nonetheless a source of 
apprehension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would expand a little on the 
growing industry of aquaculture and how it could affect the 
ecological integrity of marine parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Madam Speaker, there have been several 
instances where fish that were modified, either through breeding 
or genetic means, have escaped from pens into the general 
environment.  I believe there have been three such instances 
around the globe.  In each instance the modified fish have been 
more aggressive and more capable of dominating the ecosystem than 
naturally occurring species. 
The modified fish tend to reproduce very quickly and are 
aggressive toward other species.  The end result is that they 
wipe out other species.  This has occurred.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine what would happen if a modified species got into a 
marine park.  Destroying or damaging part of an ecosystem has a 
cumulative impact on the rest of the ecosystem.  More than just 
one species of fish would be affected.  A cumulative effect could 
spread through the ecological chain and devastate the entire 
park.  This is a glaring omission in the bill that must be 
addressed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for his comments.  I hope we can continue to work with 
his party and get its support at final reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member expressed concerns about consultations with provinces 
and aboriginal peoples.  We assure Canadians and all members in 
the House that without a federal-provincial agreement we will not 
proceed.  The Saguenay—St. Lawrence is a special exception 
because the sea bed is clearly within provincial jurisdiction. 
Of Canada's 29 designated marine conservation areas 11 have 
uncontested federal title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not see the benefit of the federal government 
having clear title?  We will not proceed unless everyone is in 
accord.  A non-derogation clause has been included in the 
legislation with respect to aboriginal rights.  Does the member 
not see the benefit of uniformity?  Does he not feel it would 
ensure accountability and preserve something for all Canadians in 
the years to come?  Does the hon. member not see the benefit of 
proceeding only where we have clear title? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Madam Speaker, five first nations 
communities addressed the environment committee over the last two 
days.  They expressed grave concern that they had not been 
consulted about the species at risk legislation.  To focus only 
on federal title is simplistic and ignores the reality of where 
these marine parks are.  Fishing goes on in a number of these 
parks, by both first nations and commercial fishermen, which 
impacts on provincial economies.  That must be taken into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be consultation.  Oil and gas leases need to be 
negotiated with private owners.  There is interest at the 
provincial government level in those areas.  Given the size of 
marine parks, the importance of preserving them and their 
importance to the adjoining land mass, it is impossible not to 
consult with provincial governments and first nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would also like to come back to some of the things that are not 
in the bill, which were itemized in the original speech by the 
member for Windsor—St. Clair.  He had quite a list of things 
that he thought would have to go into the bill through amendment 
and I hope the government will be amenable to those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that the bill is completely silent on the issue of 
deep water bottom trawling.  This is a practice that is heavily 
criticized by environmentalists wherever it occurs.  Surely in a 
marine park or in a marine preserve, we are going to have to take 
active steps with strong language in this bill to preclude that 
from ever happening.  The same goes with dredging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member perhaps outline what sort of amendment he 
would contemplate to ensure that neither of these practices are 
tolerated in a marine park? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to deal with 
dredging first.  One of the first cases I was involved in as a 
lawyer involved the dredging of sand off Point Pelee National 
Park, just near my riding.  I remember fighting that case along 
with a half a dozen other lawyers and law students representing 
various groups.  Fishers were involved and local cottagers were 
being impacted by the dredging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always have a particular interest whenever we talk about 
dredging because I have a very real sense and knowledge of the 
impact it can have on the ecosystem, and that was relatively 
modest dredging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance I want to raise about dredging is, that I am aware, 
especially in my province, that we are becoming more and more in 
need of aggregate.  We are losing some of our traditional sources 
because of the environmental movement and conservation of 
terrestrial lands.  There is more and more pressure to look to 
the oceans for dredging.  There is some risk coming further down 
the road and that is a potential problem for us.  That is a bit 
of a personal concern for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On trawling, I do not think there is any environmental group 
that is not opposed.  The answer to it is that it would have to 
be banned.  There is just no way deep sea trawling should be 
permitted in a marine park.  It is devastating to a fish stock. 
Literally it goes in and wipes it out.  It is a reflection of the 
quality of the technology we have at this time of just how 
effective deep sea trawling is, but it literally goes in and 
wipes out all species of fish in the area.  The ships are so 
large, the nets are so powerful, the technology is so developed, 
it just simply would have to be banned.  It could not be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to allow it, we might as well forget about 
designating the marine park. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
also want to express concerns about the bill, perhaps not the 
same concerns expressed by my colleague on the right, who is 
probably not on my right but on my left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have a number of concerns.  In order to get them on 
the record clearly, it will be necessary to read and comment 
directly on pertinent parts of the bill.  Before I do I want to 
mention a couple of things that my hon. colleague referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about dredging and dragging.  I agree to the extent 
that there are areas which can be damaged by boat practices. 
However I would hope that if we are going to establish a marine 
conservation area we are certainly not going to do it in 
areas where fishers try to make a living through procedures that 
would include dragging.  That would drive a nail into the coffin 
right off the bat. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to dredging, when one lives in the marine 
environment, one realizes that there is a constant flow of 
material due to waves and sometimes river mouth action.  Many of 
the harbours in which fishermen live and constantly fish 
occasionally start to fill up with silt, sand and the beach 
moving back and forward because of tide action or river action. 
The only way that these people can get into their own home ports 
and the wharves where they tie up their boats is to occasionally 
have that area dredged so that they do not go aground on the 
material that consistently moves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I hope this will be taken into consideration before any 
marine conservation area is designated.  I do not think I can 
give the government that much credit to think that it would be 
that far-reaching in its looking ahead process.  Consequently, I 
would be concerned about these two processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the purpose of the bill as outlined, says that the 
proposed legislation requires that national marine conservation 
areas be established for two reasons: first, for the protection 
and conservation of representative marine areas, and second, for the 
benefit, education and enjoyment of the people of Canada and the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty hard to argue against either one of those because 
they are both laudable ideals.  However, if we follow through on 
the process, the question we have to ask is in order to achieve 
what the bill wants to do, who is going to be rewarded and who is 
going to suffer because of the way that the suggested 
conservation areas will be implemented? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been provided with basically a map of Canada.  On this 
list are national marine conservation areas, the natural regions. 
There are 29 natural regions.  Collectively they take in 
practically every inch of coastland around Canada.   We have the 
Pacific, the Atlantic, the Arctic Ocean, the Great Lakes and also 
the Bay of Fundy as part of the Atlantic Ocean.  If all these 
areas are considered, it means there are intentions to perhaps 
set up sample national marine conservation areas in every nook 
and cranny of the Canadian marine environment.  Again, that may 
not be an impractical or impossible thing to do provided it is 
done properly and with full consultation and involvement of all 
agencies, particularly the people who live in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will throw out a word that we have used fairly often when 
talking about the fishery and the word adjacency.  The prime 
concern of the government should be the people in the adjacent 
areas.  The government should consult with those people to make 
sure that they fully understand what is proposed and that they 
are in full agreement with it before any such marine conservation 
area is established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have major concerns with perhaps not what is in the 
legislation but how it could be interpreted and the omissions. An 
area that bothers me is where it says that “subject to section 7 
for the purpose of establishing or enlarging” a reserve, et 
cetera, that within Canada, the Government of Canada may by order 
in council amend the schedule. 
That is if we wanted to increase the size of the reserve.  Then 
it goes on to say in another subsection: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except as provided by subsection (2), no amendment may be made by 
the Governor in Council to Schedule 2 for the purpose of removing 
any portion of a reserve. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that says to me, and maybe I will be educated otherwise, is 
that the government can at its own whim change, enlarge or add 
to the reserve at any time by order in council but it cannot take 
away.  If for some reason the people in the affected area, 
whether it be for fishing rights, exploratory rights or whatever, 
had good reason to reduce the size of the reserve, it could not 
be done by order in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another clause that bothers me states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister is responsible for the administration, management 
and control of marine conservation areas in relation to matters 
not assigned by law to any other Minister of the Crown. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister referred to is the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think that in selective marine environments the prime 
minister would be the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  By prime 
minister, I mean the minister in charge and not the Prime 
Minister.  However, if we are to expect either the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans or the Minister of Canadian Heritage to be 
responsible for the management and enforcement of these zones, I 
have major concerns with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just mention a few areas where these people are already 
involved.  Let me talk about the management of the fisheries and 
the protection of the people who procure the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about the coast guard.  Just a while ago in this 
honourable House, I expressed concerns about cutbacks in the 
coast guard.  Instead of being there to solidly look after the 
concerns and the needs of the people who ply the oceans around 
the coasts of our country, particularly Atlantic Canada, instead 
of enhancing the infrastructure that is needed to ensure safety 
and also to ensure proper environment and harvesting standards, 
the coast guard, under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, is 
being cut back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is taking boats out of the fleet, cutting the 
helicopter fleet in half and automating 11 lighthouses.  More 
lighthouses were automated in the past.  Now 11 more are being 
automated, taking the manned operation away and using strict 
automation in lighthouses that are located in unique and barren 
areas of the province of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case of the remote areas, boats plying the area and 
fishermen fishing from the surrounding communities rely strictly 
on the lighthouse, the lighthouse keeper and his or her family to 
provide the type of information, assurance and safety precautions 
that they want as they venture to sea.  They rely on the 
lighthouse operation more so than they do on the weatherman, or 
the coast guard or anybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can list dozens of examples where the lighthouse and the 
lighthouse keeper and family members prevented wrecks from 
occurring, prevented other types of marine disasters, effected 
rescues, helped people who had been wrecked by keeping them at 
the lighthouse location until they could be picked up, et cetera. 
I can go on and on.  There are numerous daily occasions when they 
relate to marine travellers, particularly fishermen, the weather 
conditions, ice conditions and ice flows, which have stranded 
many people fishing in rural areas, and other concerns that these 
people would have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Lighthouses are also a major part of our culture and heritage. 
Many of them have been designated national historical sites.  What 
are we doing?  We are downplaying them to save money.  We do not 
seem to concern ourselves with saving lives.  We are more 
concerned with saving money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are those the types of protective services that we would see in 
relation to marine conservation areas?  Would we be creating all 
of them as if the coastline of Canada were something that we 
could put in a front room and monitor from our chesterfield?  It 
is not that easy.  Canada is a big and wild country.  To dream is 
tremendous but to dream the impossible dream is something else. 
This is perhaps what the minister is doing.  He does not know 
what he is getting into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a couple of other examples.  What about fisheries 
management generally?  Fisheries would now get involved in 
managing marine conservation areas.  It cannot even manage its 
present job.  If there ever were a completely and more poorly 
managed industry it is the fishery in every respect.  We are 
asking for trouble if we add anything to the duties of the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me zero in on the Minister of Canadian Heritage and talk 
about wildlife protection.  The first people the committee should 
talk to are the wildlife enforcement officers, as they used to be 
called.  They do not know what to be called now because they have 
a mixture of wildlife and forestry officials who have been given 
the same duties.  They now look after our forests and wildlife. 
They do not have a clue what they are doing or what they are 
being ordered to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is the extremely poor management of our parks and 
wildlife areas.  With the legislation today, we would create a 
whole new environment by bringing in people to manage in a marine 
environment.  Perhaps we should talk to the park wardens who have 
expressed concern about how well the department understands their 
duties and responsibilities and how well they are supported by 
the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The track record of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is not one that we would like to 
use as an example of how to properly manage marine conservation 
areas.  They do not seem to give the necessary assurance to 
people in the conservation areas, particularly the people in 
rural parts of Canada and Atlantic Canada where the fishery is so 
important.  They are telling them not to worry about the marine 
conservation areas as they will not affect them.  The legislation 
says otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other issues.  I talked about the 
minister's administrative capabilities.  Subclause 9(1) of the bill 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall, within five years after a marine conservation 
area is established, in consultation with relevant federal and 
provincial ministers and agencies and affected coastal 
communities, aboriginal organizations and bodies established 
under land claims agreements, and with any other persons and 
bodies that the Minister considers appropriate, prepare a 
management plan for the marine conservation area including 
provision for ecosystem protection, human use and zoning, which 
shall be tabled in each House of Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be done in consultation with everyone who should be 
consulted, but the operable words are “five years after the 
establishment”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether that makes sense to anybody else but it 
certainly does not make any sense to me.  My hon. colleague says 
it is a postdated cheque, which is exactly what it is. Subclause 
9(2) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall review the management plan of a marine 
conservation area at least every five years— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it is saying is that if a mistake is made we should not 
worry because every five years the minister would review it. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and any amendments to the plan shall be tabled with the plan in 
each House of Parliament. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who decides what changes and amendments would be made?  Subclause 
9(4) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions of a management plan respecting fishing, aquaculture, 
fisheries management, marine navigation and marine safety are 
subject to agreement between the Minister and the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who would decide how the affected people in the rural 
communities would live through all this are the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the examples that I gave earlier, I do not think too many 
fisherpersons in Port de Grave, St. Barbe or St. Mary's are 
wondering tonight when those ministers will go there and 
establish a marine conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, attempts were made to establish a marine 
conservation area in Newfoundland a few years ago but the people 
and the agencies involved were not convinced that it would be a 
good thing for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have absolutely no problem with the word conservation.  If we 
had been conscious of conservation years ago we would have been 
better off today, and Newfoundland certainly would have been a 
lot better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no problems with management.  In fact, we wish the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans would manage the fishery much 
better than he does.  Let me give an example.  People watching 
CPAC tonight may be thinking that the government probably would 
not interfere.  When the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans walks 
into the House, snaps his fingers and gives quotas for shrimp, 
crab or anything else—and I am thinking particularly of last 
year's shrimp—to anybody without any consultation with the 
players involved, what does it say about the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, along with the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage who is responsible for the management of our 
parks and wildlife, are the two people who would secure our 
heritage, our culture, our fisheries and our marine environment, 
then I am extremely concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes on to state a number of other things of concern to 
individuals, especially in marine environments.  Clause 13 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall explore for or exploit hydrocarbons, minerals, 
aggregates or any other inorganic matter within a marine 
conservation area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with the marine conservation areas being 
established beforehand with an agreement, but in many of our 
coastal environments we are only now beginning to understand the 
potential that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that my time is up because there are still a 
number of issues that I would like to talk about, but perhaps on 
another day.

indeed a world class tourist attraction, but it has its 
problems. Now that the park will be established, it is important 
that the government allocate adequate resources.

monitoring of fish species and all marine species. The need to 
ensure a balance is also true for this type of environment.

dropped.  It should be sent back to the drawing board for proper 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very conscious about marine conservation and our 
heritage.  I have no problem with that.  We also have to remember 
that the money generated in the country that pays for everything 
else that we need to do and the money that pays our social costs 
comes from the development of our resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do that in harmony with the environment.  We cannot do 
it despite it.  Half the bill talks about enforcement, offences

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved that Bill C-272, an act to amend the Income 
Tax Act (child adoption expenses), be read the second time and 
referred to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, as I understand the process, it being 
deemed a non-votable bill I have 15 minutes at the outset of the 
debate tonight and then a 5 minute wrap-up at the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by thanking my hon. colleague from Calgary 
Southwest for seconding my bill tonight.  I am grateful for the 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-272, an act to amend the Income 
Tax Act with respect to child adoption expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately one of the sad realities of the Income Tax Act, 
aside from the fact that it has become a tool of oppression in 
the country and should be reformed, is the fact that the act in 
its present form does not contain any provisions relating to 
child adoption expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have presented the bill in an attempt to correct this 
injustice and with the hope of making the Income Tax Act more 
equitable to all parents, in this case to those who have adopted 
a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adoptive parents have unique challenges when they adopt 
children, all of which are not experienced by families that are 
fortunate enough to conceive their own children.  These 
challenges and the expenses associated with them arise from the 
arduous steeplechase that has become the adoption process in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are involved in the administration of the adoption 
process would likely argue that the process exists for the 
protection of the children and is necessary to ensure that 
children are placed in the best possible homes.  I cannot 
disagree.  I concur with that wholeheartedly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT49"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT49"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that we have a duty to ensure that all children 
are placed with responsible and caring adults who will raise them 
in a loving family environment.  While I agree that we need to 
conduct evaluations and studies to ensure that the adoptive 
parents are suitable, I do not agree with placing the financial 
burden for this process solely on the backs of the adoptive 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the addition of each new adoption requirement or 
assessment, we increase the overall cost of the adoption and, as 
a consequence, decrease the number of families who can seriously 
consider adoption.  These requirements have compounded in recent 
years to the point where, in the case of a private or 
international adoption, couples may face costs in the thousands 
of dollars for legal fees, travel expenses, home studies and a 
number of other assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the letters I have received in recent months say that 
these expenses can exceed $20,000.  The magnitude of such upfront 
costs often results in discouraging couples from even thinking of 
adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government and as a society we should be searching for ways 
to reward those couples who make the courageous decision to adopt 
a child.  That is the inspiration behind Bill C-272. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would amend the Income Tax Act to allow adoptive 
parents to deduct expenses arising from the adoption of a child, 
subject to a maximum of $7,000.  The deduction is on a per child 
basis and the expenses must have been incurred in that taxation 
year or in the previous two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of the bill follows consultation with a number 
of adoption agencies as well as individuals who have personally 
adopted children.  Statistics Canada's national longitudinal 
survey of children and youth has clearly shown us, in empirical 
terms, that an environment where there is a mother and a father 
is an environment in which children thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence the bill is very straightforward but we all know from 
experience that nothing relating to the Income Tax Act is ever 
straightforward, especially if any Canadian might actually derive 
some benefit from it.  For the amendment to have any success it 
must therefore follow the format of all other approved deductions 
and clearly set out who may benefit and to what extent.  The bill 
was drafted to do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those who are following the broadcast of the 
debate tonight, I would like to take a moment to highlight the 
exact provisions of the bill.  First, the bill would apply to 
Canadian and international adoption expenses.  Second, the 
maximum deductions, as I have already said, per eligible child 
shall not exceed $7,000.  Third, it defines a child as any person 
under the age of 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with all income tax deductions, the claim for the deduction 
must be substantiated by filing the following with the minister: 
receipts issued by the payee and containing the appropriate 
reference information and, second, a Canadian adoption order or a 
recognition order with respect to a foreign adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Acceptable adoption expenses under the legislation would 
include:  legal fees; home study or psychological study expenses; 
expenses related to the child's immigration to Canada; travel 
expenses related to the adoption of the child; and agency fees. 
Expenses that would not be eligible are any expenses incurred 
during the adoption in contravention of any law and any expenses 
incurred in carrying out any surrogate parenting arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one considers how well structured the bill is, one can 
appreciate how I felt so confident when I submitted the bill to 
the private members committee for consideration.  The bill met 
all of the criteria to make the bill votable.  In addition, since 
its introduction I have been receiving letters of support, which 
continue today, from all across the country.  The letters of 
support were from parents who have adopted, from couples who are 
wading through the adoption process and from the adoption 
agencies themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read to the hon. members present each of these 
letters so that they could appreciate the impact the legislation 
would have on future Canadian families, but in the interests of 
time, I have selected but a few of the responses received which I 
feel reflect the sentiments of all of those I received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing in support of the adoption tax credit.  My husband 
and myself are in the process of an adoption from Vietnam.  The 
fees are over $21,000.  Both of us work in social services and 
needless to say, do not have a sufficient collective income to 
support such a process.  We are doing our best to provide a home 
for an orphaned child and would greatly appreciate the support of 
a tax credit to increase the feasibility of this endeavour.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband and I recently adopted from Russia a 9 month old 
little girl and the overall costs were $40,000 so any amount of a 
deduction would certainly go a long way to encourage others to 
adopt since there are so many children that need homes and we are 
trying to increase immigration and what better way than this. 
Thank you for introducing this bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband and I adopted a little boy from Russia 1.5 years ago 
and have recently noticed in our local paper an article on the 
needs in a Russian Orphanage and how we here in Canada can be 
more aware of the needs to adopt.  I think more people would help 
these children who are in desperate need if the government would 
be more encouraging to those who wish to adopt.  Thank you for 
introducing this bill.  The need is definitely there. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband and I after 7 years of trying to have our own family 
are embarking on international adoption.  This will take an 
additional 2 or 3 years because of the substantial cost involved. 
A tax deduction would shave a year off the start of our family. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adoption, for some people, is the only way that they can achieve 
their dream of creating a family.  Adoption, however, is also a 
very costly way.  The passage of a bill, such as the one you are 
proposing, would assist couples like ourselves in making our 
dream come true.  We wish you much success in establishing this 
bill as law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I are presently adopting a child in Ontario and we 
are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with the 
seemingly endless expenses.  We know that other families who 
adopt privately must be facing considerably larger costs than us, 
so we wish to offer you our support for this excellent piece of 
legislation that you are presenting. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians would like to be able to adopt from overseas, but 
due to the prohibitive cost (up to $20,000 to $30,000), many are 
unable to consider this option.  Child poverty is a huge problem 
of immense proportions around the world.  Adoption is one way 
Canadians can make a direct personal contribution by giving a 
child from a poorer country a head start within a Canadian home, 
while enriching their own lives with the blessing of a child. 
Canadians have a reputation for being humanitarians...your bill 
is one very practical, inexpensive way the Canadian Government 
can make this a possibility for more Canadian families. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parent who had adopted a child in 1999 I understand the 
financial burden that is endured by the expense of the adoption 
process.  Our son's adoption was a very simple and 
straightforward adoption; local, Canadian, birth parents (and 
their families) in agreement and supportive, and no legal, 
medical or procedural problems, but still the final cost of the 
adoption was $9,400 by the time the adoption was finalized by a 
judge.  In B.C. the fee schedule for adoption has risen since we 
adopted our son.  It has now gone up by approximately $3,000, 
therefore I am expecting that the adoption of a second child will 
cost approximately $13,000 in adoption agency fees, legal fees, 
court costs, medical exams, background checks and government form 
processing.  I cannot speak for all adopting parents, but I know 
that we will have to borrow the money to finance the adoption of 
a second child.  I have talked to a couple through our adoption 
experience that could not afford the expense of adoption and 
therefore will not have a family. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on indefinitely but I think I have made the point. 
Better yet, in writing to me the people themselves have made the 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a soundly drafted bill aimed at benefiting children and 
adoptive parents and it had national support.  Who would not have 
felt confident?  I certainly did and perhaps that was my mistake. 
Members can imagine my disappointment when I learned that the 
private members; busines subcommittee did not share my confidence in the bill 
and it was not deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those watching the broadcast tonight, they 
should understand how the process works for all private members 
of all five parties on both sides of the House.  First there has 
to be an idea.  In this case it was tax deductions for adoption 
expenses.  Members get help from legal counsel at the House of 
Commons to draft the bill.  It is then introduced in the House. 
After that the member has to be lucky enough to have his or her 
name drawn in a lottery.  There are 300 members and 15 bills are 
drawn so the odds are not that great.  When it is drawn the 
member has to go before an all party subcommittee and try to 
persuade the members to make the item votable.  Up to 5 of the 15 
can be made votable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of hurdles, no matter well intentioned the bill, 
no matter how great the cause.  Unfortunately this bill did not 
make that hurdle to become votable so that all members could vote 
on it.  Hopefully it would have gone to the finance committee to 
at some time in the future become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are only a few months into this session and this is the 
second time that I have tried to bring forward legislation to 
benefit families in this country.  This is the second time the 
private members committee has voted not to make my bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing concern, 
on the part of all members.  I am appreciative of the 
fact that the government House leader struck a committee to look 
at changes that might include making votable all private members' 
bills fortunate enough to be drawn.  I certainly support that and 
I hope we go on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say tonight, not just in regard to the two 
bills of mine that we have debated, that I speak for myself and 
other members who have had their bills drawn but not made 
votable.  If we do make a change in this parliament, I hope we 
will make it soon and make it retroactive so that every bill that 
was drawn in this parliament would go to a vote, including this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well past time that instead of making adoption a very 
difficult alternative we provide encouragement to families who 
have the desire to adopt children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the private member's bill 
proposed by the member for Prince George—Peace River proposes to 
allow taxpayers to deduct expenses related to the adoption of a 
child, to a maximum of $7,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first explain that a basic principle of our income tax 
system is that tax relief is not generally provided for personal 
expenses such as adoption costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is aware that parents adopting a child incur 
relatively high costs, but these and other personal expenses do 
not qualify for tax assistance because they are incurred at an 
individual's discretion in widely varying amounts and types 
depending on the individual's tastes, lifestyle and economic 
status. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the better a taxpayer's socioeconomic situation, the 
more likely he is to incur greater and more varied personal 
expenses.  If these expenses were deductible, a fraction of the 
personal expenses incurred by certain taxpayers would be paid 
for by all taxpayers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where tax relief is provided for personal expenses, it applies 
either to expenses incurred to earn income, such as child care 
expenses, union dues and moving expenses incurred to take 
employment at a new location, or to largely non-discretionary 
expenses such as above average medical expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of child care expenses.  As hon. members 
know, eligible child care expenses are deductible in computing 
income.  The purpose of the child care expense deduction is to 
recognize that taxpayers who need to incur child care expenses to 
earn employment or business income, to attend a recognized 
educational institution or to take an eligible vocational 
training course have a lower ability to pay taxes than taxpayers 
with the same income who do not need to incur such expenses. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to $7,000 annually can be deducted for expenses incurred for 
the care of a child under the age of seven, and $4,000 for a 
child between the ages of seven and fifteen.  The ceiling for 
children who qualify for the disability deduction is $10,000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it would be very difficult to separate the personal and 
non-discretionary elements of the costs associated to children, 
tax assistance is provided to families with children through a 
predetermined benefit rather than through tax credits or 
deductions for specific expenses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government provides considerable financial support to 
families with children through the Canada child tax benefit, the 
CCTB.  More specifically, the Canada child tax benefit has two 
components:  the base benefit for low and middle income families 
and a national child benefit supplement for low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of July 1, 2001, families will receive up to $1,117 per child 
under the base benefit.  In addition, supplements of $221 for 
each child under the age of seven where no child care expenses 
are claimed and of $78 for the third and each subsequent child 
are added to the base benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum national child benefit supplement as of July 2001 
will be $1,255 for the first child, $1,055 for the second and 
$980 for the third and each subsequent child.  Therefore, the 
maximum Canada child tax benefit will be $2,372 for the first 
child, $2,172 for the second child and $2,097 for each subsequent 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has proven that it is committed to investing in 
the future of our children.  In fact, even before the budget was 
balanced the government committed $850 million to the Canada 
child tax benefit to start building the NCB in 1997.  In the 1998 
budget, the federal government enriched the national child 
benefit by an additional $850 million.  The design of this 
enrichment was set out in the 1999 budget, which also proposed an 
additional investment of $300 million to extend benefit 
enhancements to modest and middle income families.  The 2000 
budget and the 2000 economic statement and budget update enriched 
benefits by an additional $2.6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these actions, maximum Canada child tax benefits 
will rise to more than $2,500 for the first child by the year 
2004.  By 2004 this will bring the federal government's 
commitment to the Canada child tax benefit to $9 billion per 
year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, improvements to the CCTB were an important part 
of the general tax cuts for individuals proposed in the 2000 
budget and in the economic statement and budget update for 2000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families will also benefit from the following measures:  the 
reduction in tax rates for all income levels; the elimination of 
the deficit reduction surtax; the increases in the amount they 
can earn tax free and the amounts at which higher tax rates 
apply; the restoration of the full indexation of the personal 
income tax system, which will protect families against automatic 
tax increases and the erosion of benefits, including the Canada 
child tax benefit, caused by inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total the 2000 budget and the 2000 economic statement and 
budget update will provide $100 billion in cumulative tax relief 
for Canadians by the year 2004-05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize that these cuts were especially 
beneficial to families with children.  By the year 2004-05 these 
measures will translate into a 27% reduction in the tax burden 
for families with children, compared to 21% on average for all 
taxpayers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I would like to add that measures were 
announced in the 2000 budget to improve the parental leave 
provisions under the EI plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget proposed to increase the number of weeks of parental 
leave from 10 to 35.  It also proposed changes to make benefits 
more flexible and accessible.  These improved benefits are also 
available to parents who adopt a child effective December 31, 2000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government recognizes that parents should 
receive financial assistance to help ensure that their children's 
needs are met.  I believe I have clearly demonstrated that the 
government places a very high priority on investing in children 
and is providing the assistance they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it would not be appropriate to ask taxpayers at large 
to subsidize adoption expenses through the tax system because of 
the largely discretionary nature of these personal expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I would ask hon. members not to support the 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak on Bill C-272, a private 
member's bill from my colleague from Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses a very important issue and a very personal 
issue, that of adoption, and the inordinately high costs 
associated with it for Canadian families and parents who choose 
to adopt children.  A tax deduction of up to $7,000 for expenses 
would go a long way in helping Canadians to deal with costs that 
can run as high as or even greater than $20,000 per child in the 
adoption process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly in an egalitarian society and a society where we speak 
of the importance of equality of opportunity, the choice for 
families to adopt children should not be available only to the 
rich.  Effectively under the current system the only people who 
can make this decision are higher income individuals or those 
Canadians who can make the tremendous financial sacrifice to make 
this important choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a choice on behalf of their own families, on 
behalf of these couples.  There is a societal benefit to 
augmenting the ability of Canadian families and parents to adopt 
children.  Society benefits by children living in supportive 
environments, whether they be their biological families or 
adoptive families.  It should not make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance, which obviously represent the views of the government, 
clearly miss the point being made in this bill by the hon. member 
for Prince George—Peace River.  The fact is that all society 
would benefit if we were to somehow ease the lives of families 
that choose to adopt children, in this case through financial 
means through the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically the Liberals have no difficulty in using the tax 
system for all kinds of Pavlovian policies to encourage one sort 
of behaviour and to discourage another kind of behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Typically I am opposed to measures that complicate the tax code 
further in order to encourage one type of behaviour or discourage 
another.  However, I believe that in this case the fundamental 
benefit to society outweighs the negative of complicating the tax 
code a little bit to implement this measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in our party are supportive of this measure.  It is terribly 
unfortunate that this has not been deemed votable.  If Liberal 
members opposite had the opportunity to vote individually on this 
measure, I think we would find that there would be a strong level 
of support among private members opposite for this forward 
thinking and important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate, as the hon. member for Prince George—Peace 
River said earlier, that this piece of legislation was not deemed 
votable.  In fact the process by which private member's 
legislation in the House becomes votable or non-votable is 
Byzantine and circuitous and certainly not constructive or 
encouraging to private members who are trying to make a 
difference.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be encouraging private members' business as a 
legitimate vehicle through which members of the House can express 
not only the views of their constituents but also the types of 
forward thinking public policy measures that can change the lives 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the government has not been more open to 
the rights of private members in this regard.  As parliamentary 
reform gains some steam we are still optimistic we will see some 
significant changes in the future.  One of those very important 
changes is to make mechanisms available to private members to 
present legislation and have it deemed votable without having to 
jump through the hoops and go through the current discouraging 
process in that it does not provide private members with the 
ability to have their legislation deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River mentioned 
that this was his second piece of legislation recently that was 
not deemed votable.  That is discouraging for private members who 
are trying to advance important issues and policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we are supportive of the legislation.  We wish we 
could express our support quantitatively through a vote.  However 
we have once again been denied that opportunity through the 
government's closed door process.  It is not an open door 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  It is an all party committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  The hon. member opposite just said that 
it is an all party committee.  All of our committees are all 
party, but the fact is that one party has the majority on those 
committees.  Quite frequently it is difficult, if not impossible, 
for an opposition member to effect change in the committee 
process.  It is unfortunate that case exists.  It discourages 
forward thinking members of parliament who sit on the opposition 
benches.  It discourages principled decisions from having an 
impact on the future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to see some changes in our ability to effect change 
and to make a difference in the lives of Canadians, it has to 
start through significant parliamentary reform and not just 
through tinkering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supportive of the legislation and hope to see it come 
back in the future to a parliament that respects the views of 
private members enough to ensure that this type of legislation 
comes to the House in a votable form.  That would enable every 
member of the House, whether on the government side or on the 
opposition benches, to vote on issues of importance.  I know 
there is a significant level of support for this initiative on 
the government benches that will not be quantified by a vote. 
That is highly unfortunate.

Bill C-272, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (child adoption 
expenses). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to allow a taxpayer a deduction for 
expenses of up to $7,000 related to the adoption of a child when 
computing his or her income for a taxation year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that my colleague from the Bloc, the member

support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, adoption is a provincial responsibility. However, 
the lack of participation on the part of the federal government 
creates a grey area for adoptive parents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, why would the federal government, which has no qualms 
about interfering in many areas under provincial jurisdiction, 
not intervene efficiently in the area of adoption? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A federal tax deduction would not only be a welcome incentive 
for adoptive parents, but would also make the tax system fairer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biological parents are covered under the health insurance plan 
for prenatal and postnatal care whereas adoptive parents must 
pay out of their own pocket the full cost of an adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is odd that the costs of in vitro fertilization are deductible 
when the costs of adopting a child are not. This is neither fair 
nor wise on the part of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government estimates that an international adoption 
costs the adoptive parents an average of $20,000. Children of 
the World, one of the largest Canadian adoption agencies, 
estimates the cost of adopting a child in China at $17,000 per 
couple. These figures include expenses in Quebec and in China. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should allow taxpayers to deduct from their income the 
child adoption expenses, not by an amount not exceeding $7,000, 
but by double that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should recognize, as Quebec does, the 
important social contribution of adoptive parents to our 
society. It has been observed that half of Canadian adoptions 
are to Quebec families. This is in part due to the fact that 
Quebec's family policy is far more progressive than that of the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adoptive parents face special expenses, particularly in the case 
of private and international adoptions. I know whereof I speak. 
Thirty-two years ago, my wife and I adopted a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many couples who want to adopt a child think about it twice 
because of all the expenses it entails, which is where this bill 
comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost nine years now, Quebec has undergone a change quite 
unique in the western world. Every year, between 700 and 800 
children from all over the world finally find in Quebec a family 
to adopt them. 
It obviously would have made adoption easier if the adoptive 
parents had been able to deduct from their income, at the federal 
level, the child adoption expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot talk about adoption without talking about family. In 
Quebec, we are proud to have an integrated and comprehensive 
family policy.  This policy includes among other things a tax 
credit for adoption expenses, family allowance benefits and the 
development of educational services and day care for young 
children, what is commonly known as the $5 a day day care.  Quebec 
is also developing a parental insurance program based on the 
needs of families in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it is obvious that the federal government is 20 years 
behind in this area.  By quickly passing this bill, it would at 
least be taking a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I deplore the fact that this bill is not votable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the enactment of the bill is to allow taxpayers a 
deduction that does not exceed $7,000 for expenses related to the 
adoption of a child.  The bill says that a limit of $7,000 can be 
used as a deduction when they compute their income tax returns 
for the tax year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already heard this afternoon that a great number of the 
adoptions taking place in Canada at this time cost far in excess of 
$7,000.  The cost of adoptions from overseas, adoptions from 
Haiti, adoptions from China and adoptions from Vietnam can exceed 
$20,000.  The bill says that a cap of $7,000 could be used as a 
deduction, not all the expenses but a certain percentage of them, 
so that young people in some instances could afford to have a 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expenses must have been incurred in the taxation year or in the 
previous two years.  A great deal of the expenses incurred in 
adoption are over many years.  Young couples sometimes wait 
seven, eight, nine or ten years to adopt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adoption expenses mean any expense incurred on account of 
adopting a child.  Many individuals who go overseas have a huge 
output of dollars so that they can stay in a country for a set 
period of time.  Another part of the bill says that it applies to 
both children adopted within this country and those from without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relate to the House the emotional turmoil, the 
feelings of young people when they realize that perhaps they will 
be unable to raise a family.  It puts a huge emotional burden on 
them.  It is an emotional roller coaster in locating a baby for 
adoption.  In many situations finally approved for adoption, 
the birth mother changes her mind.  Then again the couple is 
thrown into a turbulent, emotional scene.  All this emotional 
stress is compounded by the financial burden, particularly for 
those in lower income brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to explain a bit about the situation my wife and I 
found ourselves in.  In 1986 we were married.  We decided before 
we got married that we would like to have four children. After 
three or four years of trying to have a baby and going through 
all the tests to check out medical reasons why we could not, we 
applied for adoption when it was obvious we would be unable to 
conceive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told at that time that it would be a seven year wait. We 
left that province and moved back to Alberta and applied for the 
adoption process there.  We went through the open adoption route 
and within a year or two our names had been chosen as prospective 
adoptive parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember with great clarity the thrill we had when all of a 
sudden the phone call came that told us a birth mother had chosen 
us to raise the child she was still carrying.  The birth mother 
showed a great deal of love in saying she realized that her child 
needed to be put into a home with parents who could look after 
her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost was close to $7,000.  We were young.  We were both 
right out of school.  I had been working for some time and we 
were able to come up with the $7,000.  When I came into the 
network of the adoption agency I met all those other young people 
who were waiting.  I met young people who were 21 or 22 years old 
who had been slaving away.  When they were hit with the fact that 
it would be $7,000, they realized they had very little chance of 
ever having a family. 
I saw young people break down when they were told that the costs 
could be $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 or $10,000.  I saw wives weep in 
realization that they would never be able to raise a family.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have friends who have stood beside us and said how they 
rejoice in the fact that we were able to adopt not just one but 
two children, because financially they would never be able to 
afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax deduction will not perhaps change all of that, but it 
does give a little more hope to those wanting to raise a family. 
I applaud again the hon. member for bringing the bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On our first adoption we adopted a beautiful little girl 
straight from the hospital, Kristen Nicole.  She is now eight, 
going on nine years old.  On our second adoption it was a very 
similar situation.  The list was long.  The list was huge.  The 
people who were applying for adoptions were begging for children. 
Many were being turned away because of the financial restraints. 
Many people were hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the time of the adoptions and I remember being 
with my wife when one of our friends made the announcement that 
they were pregnant.  I remember the evenings where my wife would 
literally cry on the pillow all night, and I would feel like it 
as well, because we did not think we would ever be able to have a 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second adoption was another gift of God and one that we are 
very thankful for.  I am particularly concerned, as I have 
already mentioned, for those who cannot have children and who 
realize that they will never be able to afford adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adoption, as we have already spoken about, is under provincial 
jurisdiction.  There are a number of other things that perhaps 
the federal government could do.  I should research it a little 
more, but at the time that we adopted the adoptive mother was not 
allowed as much maternity leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were all of a sudden going to have a baby.  If we would have 
conceived the child ourselves she would have been able to have 
three months longer of maternity leave than what an adoptive 
mother was allowed.  That amount of time is another area the 
federal government could look at because that extra time is 
needed to bond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good bill.  I wish the Liberal government would have 
made it votable.  It could have shown that it has a commitment to 
families and a commitment to doing what is right.

hon. members did not elect to participate in the debate tonight. 
I do not want to sound too condemning of my colleagues in other 
parties or perhaps even my own.  What we see unfortunately is 
indicative of the need for the process to change, as I indicated 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not crunched the numbers to see the statistics, but I 
sense there is a lower and lower priority on private members' 
legislation in this place.  Members on both sides, be they 
government backbenchers or members of the other four parties, are 
disconnecting from the process because they do not see often 
enough that all their hard work getting a bill ready to be 
presented in the Chamber is worthwhile.  It just seems hopeless. 
I think tonight is a reflection of that in that there are not 
more members here to speak to such an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just that I think it is an important issue because it 
happens to be my bill, but it is an important issue because it 
affects the lives and futures of thousands upon thousands of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad moment.  Hon. members are increasingly 
non-participatory in formulating private members' legislation to 
begin with and non-participatory in the debate as well.  When 
they see that a piece of legislation has been deemed non-votable 
anyway, what is the point?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only going to receive the one hour, as in the case of Bill 
C-272 today, and then it is dropped.  Obviously from the remarks 
of the parliamentary secretary there is not even a willingness on 
the government's part to look at this particular issue with an 
open mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my brief closing comments I will say that I at least 
appreciate the fact that other members participated in the debate 
tonight, and I thank the parliamentary secretary for his 
comments.  I do not agree with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly appreciate the fact that the parliamentary secretary 
got all dressed up in a tux tonight just to come and talk to this 
bill.  I am sure adoptive parents, who have incurred these huge 
costs and who are perhaps sitting at home in blue jeans with the 
knees out of them watching the debate tonight, can appreciate the 
fact that he got up and completely shot down the whole idea that 
they deserved perhaps a small tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said something along the lines that 
tax relief was not generally allowed for personal costs because 
these types of expenses were incurred according to an 
individual's choice.  As we laid out, and as my colleague from 
Crowfoot spoke so well about his personal experience, this is not 
a matter of choice.  In many cases this is the only choice for a 
couple who cannot conceive a child of their own.  It is not a 
matter of choice.  There is no choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the government should consider looking at 
something like this.  If it does not like the exact way the bill 
is drafted and the $7,000 cap or whatever, it should at least 
look at the possibility of doing something about this and the 
costs that are being incurred.  It should realize that in many 
cases the state would have to incur a huge cost anyway.  A child 
who was not adopted, because there were not sufficient numbers of 
people out there who could afford it, would have to be raised by 
the state, the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Etobicoke North for his support.  I thank 
the member for Kings—Hants and my colleague from Crowfoot for 
his personal story.  My cousin went through all the hoops and 
expenses of adoption.  They adopted two wonderful children, who 
are both teenagers now.  They are very grateful for the 
opportunity to have provided those two children with a loving 
family environment and for all the joy they have brought and 
continue to bring to Dale's and Darlene's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all of us know someone, maybe a relative, a friend or a 
friend of a friend, who has gone through this.  This is one piece 
of legislation and one debate tonight that we can personally 
relate to.  It is a shame that the all party committee, like all 
committees in this place that are controlled by Liberals because 
they have the majority, did not deem this votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
As the motion has not been designated as a votable item, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to follow up on my question on Thursday, 
February 15, regarding a bizarre hiring practice that the federal 
government has, whereby many jobs in the Ottawa area are only 
available and open to people in Ontario and Quebec.  It is 
offensive that people in my riding in Nova Scotia or other 
ridings in Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, New Brunswick or 
other provinces cannot even apply for jobs with the federal 
government, the national government.  The government is 
discriminating against people by virtue of where they live.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a couple of examples.  There is a job 
advertised in Ottawa for a paralegal in the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade.  It pays $38,000 a year.  Who 
can apply?  Only those who live in eastern Ontario and western 
Quebec.  I find it incredible that people in Nova Scotia, British 
Columbia or New Brunswick cannot apply for these jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is a secretary in Ontario in the Department of 
Industry.  It pays up to $35,000 a year.  Who can apply?  Only 
those people who live in eastern Ontario and western Quebec.  The 
Government of Canada will not even hire Canadians unless they 
live in a very small area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I brought this up in the House, I received a copy of a 
letter which the Alberta minister of international and 
intergovernmental affairs sent to the government.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We...have had discussions with the federal government about 
eliminating the discriminatory process used by the Public Service 
Commission of Canada (PSC).  Alberta believes the PSC practices 
are contrary to the Operating Principles and the Labour 
Mobility Chapter in the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a copy of another letter, this one addressed to the Prime 
Minister from the premier of the province of Nova Scotia.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to see any justification for the restriction of 
applications for positions in the National Capital Region which 
have a national impact. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia constituents or residents cannot even apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I point out that Article 706 of the Agreement on Internal 
Trade specifically forbids any Party to “require a worker of any 
other Party to be resident in its territory as a condition 
of...access to employment opportunities.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are...committed to ensure, by July 1, 2001, full 
compliance with these mobility provisions— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes on and on.  The hiring practice has to stop because 
the Government of Canada needs input from the east coast.  It 
needs input from the west coast.  It needs input from the north. 
If the Government of Canada in Ottawa just focuses on Quebec and 
Ontario from which to draw all its employees, we will not have a 
proper government nor will we reflect the needs of New Brunswick, 
Alberta and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to clarify this position, to rectify it now 
and tell the people in the other provinces outside of Ontario and 
Quebec that all jobs in the Government of Canada in Ottawa will 
be open to all people in the nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
for Cumberland—Colchester for his intervention in this area.  I 
can understand to some extent his frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service of Canada is indeed one of our greatest 
assets and the government strives very hard to ensure that the 
public service in reflects the diversity of the country.  I can 
assure the member that there are employees across the country who 
are resident in his province, in my province, in British Columbia 
and in the Northwest Territories.  The reality is the public 
service does reflect residency across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked very specifically about the mobility provisions.  I 
believe the President of the Treasury Board answered his question 
to some extent when he first raised it back on February 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the other issue that is important is the cost to the 
public service in providing employment applications across the 
country.  It is the policy of the public service to only impose 
this restriction on certain types of job classifications.  I know 
for a fact that today we are trying to acquire a new auditor 
general and that is a skill set that goes across the country and 
is irrelevant as to residency.  It is based to some extent on the 
skill set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thought process that is in the Public Service Employment Act 
is basically to provide, for the Public Service 
Commission to 
restrict the hiring practices for one main reason.  That is to 
restrict the number of applicants.  Clearly, if the jobs were 
advertised across the country in certain designated fields, the 
feeling is that there would be a significant number of applicants 
and that the public service would have to process those 
applications.  That would be a significant cost to the 
government.  In other words, it is conceptually possible that 
they would have 30,000 or 40,000 applications for one job and the 
cost of processing and responding to those applications would be 
substantial.

It conforms with our charter requirements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am on my feet regarding a question that I put to the 
Minister of National Defence regarding the sale of 40 helicopters 
and 8 Challenger jets by a company called Lancaster Aviation Inc. 
based in Milton, Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is patently wrong with that deal.  I have suggested to 
the minister that the crown has lost a lot of money on the deal. 
In fact, it sold 8 Challenger jets for $30 million Canadian and 
the market value on those jets was somewhere in the order of $50 
million U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked the minister how Lancaster Aviation got the 
contract because it was a sole source contract.  Nobody else was 
invited to bid on the contract.  Lancaster Aviation Inc. was 
awarded a contract in 1997 to sell spare parts.  The contract was 
then altered and a special amendment was put through without 
tender to allow them to sell Bell helicopters and Challenger 
jets.  The results of both these sales have brought in about $70 
million Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also put a question to the minister in the form of a question 
on the order paper.  I asked him what commission Lancaster 
Aviation Inc. received on this deal.  However, the government 
will not answer.  What is it trying to hide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the Lancaster deal will make Shawinigate look 
second rate.  We will blow the lid off this deal because it is a 
behind the scenes sort of a deal cooked up between the government 
and Lancaster Aviation Inc., and we want to know for what 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can always sense when the government is trying to hide 
something.  I put those questions on the floor of the House of 
Commons one year ago and the government has failed to answer 
them.  I believe Canadians have a right to know what their 
government is doing and who it is doing business with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could one company be given the sole contract to sell 
Challenger aircraft and Bell helicopters without going through a 
tendering process?  Why should that be allowed to happen?  We 
want to know why the government has yet to come up with the 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much did Lancaster Aviation Inc. get paid to sell this 
surplus material?  We are talking about millions of dollars.  Was 
there a commission of $1 million, $2 million, $5 million or $10 
million?  Nobody knows.  Why will the minister not stand up and 
tell us what went on to allow a deal like this to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had those questions out there for one solid year.  We 
will continue asking those questions until the minister stands up 
in the House and tells us clearly what happened.  I believe 
Canadian taxpayers have a right to know how the Government of 
Canada is disposing of surplus materials, if indeed they are 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aviation advertisement that I read, placed in an aviation 
magazine by Lancaster Aviation Inc., the eight jets it sold out 
of the ten it had for sale were classified as being in superior 
condition and well maintained.  Everyone in the aviation industry 
will tell us that those jets, per unit, are worth somewhere 
between $5 million and $6 million a piece.  Lancaster Aviation 
Inc. sold them for exactly half of what their worth would be on 
the open market.  Why would the Minister of National Defence 
allow that to happen?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the minister of public works allow that to happen, for 
example, reported kickback schemes within public works and 
defence?  Is that the case?  Madam Speaker, in your limited role 
as Speaker, I ask you to force the minister to answer those 
questions. The Canadian public has a right to know. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the government is 
committed to obtaining fair market value for surplus government 
assets in a manner that respects taxpayer dollars and the laws of 
our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury Board disposal policy calls for the utilization of 
private sector disposal specialists when it is cost effective to 
do so.  To this end, in June 1997 a competitive contract was 
awarded to Lancaster Aviation Inc. for surplus aerospace assets 
disposal. Lancaster's bid met the mandatory experience, resource 
and financial requirements, and it submitted the lowest 
responsive bid.  It won the contract fair and square. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government held this competition because it wanted a centre 
of expertise capable of marketing and selling a wide range of 
surplus DND aviation assets.  It was always intended that the 
surplus aerospace assets disposal contract include the disposal 
of surplus aviation assets such as aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contract specifically included, under the provisions of 
special project sales, unique project sales which may include 
high dollar value items.  It was under this provision that 
surplus Challengers were reported to Lancaster Aviation, the 
winner of the surplus aerospace disposal contract, as available 
for sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sale of this surplus equipment was completed to the letter 
of Canadian law and with the interests of Canadian taxpayers in 
mind, meeting both treasury board and Canadian export control 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accordance with the surplus aerospace assets disposal 
contract, commission rates were negotiated for the disposal of 
the surplus Challenger fleet.  The commission paid to Lancaster 
Aviation for its marketing efforts was reasonable.  This was the 
sole manner by which Lancaster was compensated for its services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government received fair market value for the Challenger 
aircraft.  The eight aircraft were sold as a lot for a selling 
price of $30 million U.S. to DDH Aviation of Fort Worth, Texas. 
The sale price reflected the fact that the Challengers were not 
certified for civilian use and would require modifications to 
make them suitable for civilian use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has conducted the sales of the Challenger 
aircraft in accordance with treasury board and Canadian export 
regulations.  Furthermore, the commissions paid to Lancaster 
Aviation for its marketing efforts were reasonable and the sale 
price represented good value to the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member opposite has information to the contrary I invite 
him to table it in the House.  Otherwise I fear he is wasting the 
time of the House, much like the leader of his party, trying to 
find a scandal where none exists.
