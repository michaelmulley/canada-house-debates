Speaker, today, as thousands of law-abiding, responsible gun 
owners are congregating on Parliament Hill, I am pleased to 
present 605 pages of petitions with 13,933 signatures of 
concerned citizens from Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, 
Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, B.C. and the 
Yukon calling on the government to repeal Bill C-68, the Firearms 
Act.

repeal of Bill C-68 petitions.  This year I have introduced 744 
pages with 17,342 signatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadians are very concerned that this billion dollar 
licensing and registration scheme will do nothing to curtail the 
criminal use of firearms, is not cost effective in addressing the 
violent crime problem in Canada, is putting tens of thousands of 
jobs in jeopardy and is opposed by the majority of police on the 
street and the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Ontario and the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, they request parliament to repeal Bill C-68, the 
Firearms Act, and spend their hard earned tax dollars on more 
cost effective, crime fighting measures such as hiring more 
police to fight organized crime and more crime prevention 
programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
following questions will be answered today: Nos. 62 and 66. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 62—<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the government provide a detailed outline of the process 
used by the Pest Management Review Agency to determine how levels 
are set for cost recovery? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Cost recovery is 
a federal government policy established for deficit reduction. 
For the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, the level of cost 
recovery was set at $22 million by cabinet when the agency 
was created in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government process to determine how cost recovery levels are 
set is a Treasury Board policy.  The Pest Management Regulatory 
Agency implemented this Treasury Board policy under the 
supervision of Treasury Board officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury Board Secretariat analysts provided input to costing of 
activities and different options on fee collection protocols 
contained in the <I>Discussion Paper: Cost Recovery Analysis</I> that 
was released on March 1, 1996.  They confirmed that our proposed 
fees were based on cost of providing the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives from Treasury Board Secretariat, Agriculture 
& Agri-Food Canada, Industry Canada, and Natural Resources Canada 
participated fully in the various impact assessments.  Treasury 
Board Secretariat was involved in the planning of the business 
impact test conducted on the Pest Management Regulatory Agency 
cost recovery proposals.  Treasury Board Secretariat and Industry 
Canada representatives attended the April 22, 1996 business 
impact test meetings with stakeholders.  Representatives of the 
above departments attended the May 29, 1996 meeting of the 
Interim Canadian Pest Management Advisory Council to discuss the 
impact assessments.  They also attended the September 23, 1996 
stakeholder meeting in Toronto where the results of the impact 
assessments were presented and participated in the September 30, 
1996 consensus-building process to develop a fee structure with 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 20, 1996, Treasury Board Secretariat called an 
interdepartmental meeting, attended by the Privy Council Office, 
Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada, Industry Canada, Natural 
Resources Canada and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency in 
preparation for the September 23 and 30, 1996 meetings with 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Re-engineering processes established by the new Agency provided 
savings which reduced the cost recovery portion of the budget to 
$15 million.  This amount was further reduced by another $3 
million for the next six years through grants from Health Canada 
and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.  The total amount to be cost 
recovered as delineated in the regulatory Impact Analysis 
Statement of April 16, 1997, is $12 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 66—<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning individuals and businesses who have to pay fees 
allocated by the Pest Management review Agency, can the 
government please provide a list of all user fees these 
individuals or businesses have to pay? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  There are two 
types of fees: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. Application fees to be paid for an examination of an 
application in respect of a pest control product (PCP).  The fee 
payable for applications received after April 15, 1997 is 
determined on the basis of the data component(s) included in the 
application.  The fee for the various data components range from 
$150.00 to $98,248.00.  The fee payable for one application is 
equal to the sum of the applicable fees for all the components 
included in the application.  The fee payable for a new technical 
active and an associate end-use product could amount to 
$228,832.00.  The regulations also provide certain exemptions. 
As well reduced applications fees are offered to facilitate 
access to the Canadian market for low volume, niche products.  To 
be eligible for a reduced fee, a registrant's revenue from sales 
in Canada of the pest control product(s) during the three years of 
the sales verification period must be less than ten times the 
applicable application fees.

registered product (per PCP number) for the right to manufacture 
or sell a product in Canada.  There are reduced fees for products 
with sales of less than $89,667.00.  The reduced fee is 3% of 
sales.  However, there is a minimum fee of $75.00.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the

and revoke their firearm registration policy that, in the opinion 
of this House:  (a) confiscates private property; (b) contains

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to let the table and the Speaker know that Reform Party 
members will be dividing their time today into 10 minute speeches 
each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to move the motion before us and to 
speak in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that bad laws are the worst form of tyranny. 
What we have in Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, is legislation that 
violates the property rights of Canadians and is a colossal waste 
of our money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intended purpose of Bill C-68, quite frankly, is an insult 
to the three million firearms owners in Canada.  The reason for 
what I have just said will become evident as we listen to the 
course of debate throughout the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to begin by explaining the motives of the Liberal 
government in pursuing a firearms registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the current health minister and former justice minister 
responsible for this legislation who said that it is his firm 
belief that only the police and military should have access to 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us analyse that statement.  What we have is a Toronto lawyer 
with no concept of what life is like in rural Canada.  The 
minister is trying to lead Canadians to believe that 
criminalizing the legal ownership of firearms will somehow reduce 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  We are talking about hunting rifles and 
shotguns, not handguns.  We have had a handgun registry since 
1934 and we all know the extent to which crime has been reduced 
by that measure, do we not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to explain what intellectually stunted 
logic he is using by making a farmer in Saskatchewan register 
his .22 rifle.  Will that somehow help him to sleep better at night? 
Will it somehow reduce crime?  How will that affect the criminal 
misuse of firearms?

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may not be aware of this fact but criminals do not 
register their guns nor do they break into people's homes and 
decide not to steal a gun because it is registered.  I will go 
out on a limb and suggest that the criminal who does steal a 
firearm is not going to decide whether or not to use it in the 
commission of an offence based on whether it is or is not 
registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the former justice minister believe that Canadians 
should not be entitled to own firearms but Liberal senator Sharon 
Carstairs said that registration of hunting rifles is an 
important first step in socially re-engineering Canadians. The 
absurdity of that statement is self-evident.  It is important 
that we understand where these people are coming from.  They do 
not understand that to a farmer in Saskatchewan a .22 rifle is a 
tool.  Toronto lawyers do not usually face rabid skunks walking 
on to their property.  Then again many farmers in Saskatchewan 
would argue that a Toronto lawyer is a rabid skunk. In any event, 
the usefulness of a rifle as a tool to rural Canadians is very 
important.  However, that fact may not be readily apparent to 
those who are trying to socially re-engineer Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they mean when they say that registration is a first 
step?   Under Bill C-68 the justice minister can by order in 
council, in other words without coming before parliament, declare 
any firearm prohibited.  What we have is a slippery slope.  The 
minister can declare 10 gauge shotguns prohibited and they can be 
confiscated without compensation to the owners. Then it could be 
12 gauge shotguns, 16 gauge, 20 gauge and eventually the 
elimination of all legal firearm ownership in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we have put forward today covers an extensive list of 
deficiencies in this bill.  I will speak to one aspect of the 
motion, Treasury Board cost benefit guidelines.  According to 
Treasury Board policy when the government is preparing to 
establish new regulations it must provide a cost benefit analysis 
of those regulations.  The policy states specifically: “When 
regulating, regulatory authorities must ensure that benefits 
outweigh the costs to Canadians, their governments and 
businesses, and the limited resources available to government are 
used where they will do the most good”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new gun registration system established under Bill C-68 has 
failed the Treasury Board test.  In particular, the government 
has left a number of important questions unanswered.  For 
instance, what is the approximate number of individuals to be 
licensed? The government does not know.  What is the approximate 
number of firearms to be registered?  That is undetermined.  What 
will the impact on businesses and the economy be?  It is Yet to 
be seen.  How many jobs will be lost?  How many business closures 
will there be?  Again we do not know.  Will these regulations 
improve public safety?  Clearly the evidence before us which we 
will see today is very strongly in the negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these questions unanswered it is impossible to determine 
the cost effectiveness of registration.  Despite this, the 
government is pushing ahead with its registration plan.  The 
reason is that it is the government's first step in eliminating 
legal firearm ownership in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration was supposed to begin October 1 but that date has 
been pushed back to December 1.  The registration system was 
originally projected to cost $85 million.  Cost projections are 
now well over $120 million.  Some are estimating the system will 
actually cost over $500 million.  Considering these huge sums of 
money I think we could agree this money could be better spent on 
areas such as health care, education and tax cuts to lower and 
middle income Canadians who are burdened excessively by the high 
spending ways of this Liberal government. The government did not 
do a cost benefit analysis of this legislation because it did not 
want to impede its efforts to eliminate legal firearm ownership 
in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville has 
seconded my motion.  I urge all members of this House to listen 
very carefully not only to what I have said and not only to the 
analysis of the legislation that we are about to hear from the 
hon. member for Yorkton—Melville but to all hon. members who 
speak in support of this motion today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly enjoyed the presentation by the hon. member 
for Saskatoon—Humboldt today on Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing he did not touch on and the way the government is 
selling this is on the proof that there will be tremendous 
criminal reduction in activity there.  There will be fewer 
suicides.  Domestic violence of course will be toned down and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he have any thoughts in that regard?  Does he know other 
jurisdictions where this has been tried?  What were the results? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my understanding is that in 
every jurisdiction in the world where a gun registration exists, 
not one case of a crime solved or prevented can be demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to correct myself earlier.  I believe the 
leader of official opposition will be resuming debate at the end 
of this question and answer session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, subsequent to the Liberals passing this legislation in 
my riding five people were blown away one night with a gun.  I do 
not think we found the registration certificates of those who did 
it in the area.  They did not leave anything behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it brings to mind the question about really how much gun 
control legislation will prevent crime.  I would like the hon. 
member to address that situation specifically.  How much in 
Canada are we preventing crime, the criminal use of firearms, by 
this legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I explained in my speech, 
what we see from the criminal misuse of handguns is that first of 
all, criminals do not register their handguns.  Second, the 
registration of a handgun does not prevent its theft by a 
criminal or subsequent use in a crime by that criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think by logical extension we can assume that the registration 
of hunting rifles will serve no useful purpose whatsoever.  The 
costs that we will have to bear as a result of this registration 
system will be enormous. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just want members to know that in replying, the member 
for Saskatoon—Humboldt did not reply to the question that was 
asked of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was asked to supply details, some facts, some statistics, not 
some speculation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this issue reminds me very much of one that occurred last year 
during the election campaign when millions of Canadians were very 
upset with the government for proposed regulations for natural 
health products. They were millions of signatures on petitions 
and this sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same kind of situation again where there are 
millions of people who are very much against the gun registration 
law proposed by this government in Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if my colleague could perhaps enlighten us all on 
the reasons why this government continues to press on with, this 
flying in the face of the wishes of millions of people across 
this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>   Mr. Speaker, that question can be asked 
of almost anything this Liberal government does. Why has this 
government increased taxes 37 times in the last four years? Why 
does it impoverish middle income Canadians with their excessive 
tax burdens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those questions are harder to answer than the one regarding why 
it is pursing a firearms registration opposed by so many 
Canadians and which will clearly achieve no benefit to Canadians 
in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to that question is because it views it as a tool, a 
first step in eliminating the legal ownership of firearms in 
Canada.  In the Liberals' minds if they can have everyone 
register their firearms then they will know where those firearms 
are, what they are and they can systematically by order in 
council declare them prohibited and then confiscate them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak on today's supply day motion for two 
reasons, first because it does articulate a longstanding Reform 
policy that Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, should be repealed for 
obvious reasons that are stated in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second reason for participating is today a large group of 
Canadians are assembling on Parliament Hill for what they had 
styled as a fed up rally in which they will be exercising their 
democratic rights to protest a government policy to which they 
object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address my remarks both to the House and to this 
broader audience of Canadians who are here today mainly because I 
think a democratic protest, the right to democratic protest and 
the necessity of this House to recognize democratic process need 
some beefing up and some reassurance at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members on this side of the House have observed since we 
came here in 1993 that the present Liberal government is weak on 
democracy. The Liberals permit no free votes in this House on 
government bills. They continue to permit 25% of the members of 
this parliament, I refer to our unelected, unaccountable 
senators, to be appointed by one man, the Prime Minister, rather 
than to be elected by the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Prime Minister and foreign affairs minister told 
the RCMP that the rights of an Asian dictator to freedom from 
embarrassment were more important than the rights of Canadians to 
freedom of speech and freedom of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is weak on democracy, even hostile to the 
exercise of democratic freedoms.  So the presence of this group 
of Canadians here in Ottawa today in particular to express their 
democratic objections to Bill C-68 needs some bolstering, some 
amplification and some recognition in this Chamber, and that is 
my second reason for participating in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-68, the government's ill conceived 
gun control legislation, I was the last speaker on that bill when 
it went through the House in June 1995.  Some members will 
remember that was the conclusion of a long debate in which 
members such as the member for Crowfoot, the member for 
Yorkton—Melville, the member for Wild Rose and others put 
forward a host of amendments concerning the defects of the bill. 
Many of those defects have now come home to roost.  At that time 
they were academic, sort of projections of what might happen. 
Now they are self-evident to many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members, not just on this side of the House but on other sides 
of the House, put forward more than 200 amendments to try to 
correct the defects of that bill.  It was typical of the 
government that it disregarded every argument made about the 
defects of the bill and ignored and rejected every amendment, 
including amendments put forward by its own members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition's position on Bill C-68 has not changed 
from 1995.  We maintain, first of all, that it is 
constitutionally defective.  It infringes on individual property 
rights. As members of this House know, the one area where our 
bill of rights is defective, mainly because of the prejudices of 
the Liberals who put it together, is in the area of economic 
rights.  It contains no affirmation of economic rights and 
therefore it is easier for legislation to infringe on things like 
property rights.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this bill is also constitutionally defective in that it 
infringes on provincial jurisdiction.  Again we have a case of 
provinces challenging the jurisdiction of the federal government 
in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally I am becoming increasingly alarmed at the number of 
confrontations between this government and the provinces.  It has 
infringed on rights of the provinces in the area of health care. 
It has slashed transfer payments to provinces in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has a row going with the premiers on the 
proper distribution of rights and finances with respect to health 
care. There is a row with the provinces over the administration 
of gun control.  The list of confrontations between a government 
that professes to be committed to positive federal provincial 
relations is getting longer and longer and therefore we cannot 
ignore the confrontation developing over Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also maintain that the legislation is administratively 
unworkable and will lead to a wasteful expenditure of public 
funds which will in no way enhance public safety.  No one in this 
House, certainly no one on this side of the House, believes the 
estimates of cost that are presented by ministers when they bring 
forward bills like Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will note that already, Mr. Speaker, the projected costs of 
administering the gun registration are three to four to five 
times higher than the figures that were quoted here by the 
minister when he introduced the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost figures brought in with government proposals are 
utterly meaningless.  We have to develop a multiplier, look at 
which minister it is, depending on how soft headed they are, and 
multiply by five, ten or fifteen to get the real cost 
implications of what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore maintain that this legislation should be repealed 
and replaced with tough Criminal Code amendments targeted at the 
criminal misuse of firearms.  That has been our position since 
1995; it is our position at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that this is our position.  I do 
not think anyone doubts our commitment to it but more needs to be 
done.  I address myself more to the people who are assembling in 
Ottawa today to protest this legislation.  More needs to be done 
to translate opposition to this legislation into political action 
that will repeal it and replace it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House actually practised freedom of voting, it would be 
possible to amend this type of legislation and even replace it 
without defeating or replacing the government.  Unfortunately 
because of the rigidities of the government, the intransigence of 
the Prime Minister on getting into the 20th century before it is 
over and permitting a more democratic exercise of freedom in 
voting in the House, the only way to repeal a government's 
position in the House is to get a bigger majority and actually 
replace the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 will not be repealed and other Liberal policies will 
not be repealed or replaced until there are 150-plus members in 
the House who are committed to doing so.  It cannot be done by 50 
or 60 members no matter how sincere we are or how hard we work. 
To win votes, not just arguments in the House of Commons, we need 
a majority of 150-plus members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore appeal to the people who are assembling in Ottawa 
today.  I commend their efforts, those who are organizing this 
fed up rally, as one of the items on their posters says, to 
organize those who oppose Liberal policies into a politically 
powerful alternative voting block. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Leader of the Official Opposition I have a constitutional 
duty not just to hold the government accountable for its mistakes 
but to help create a viable alternative to the government, a 
united alternative to the Liberals for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what my colleagues and I will be devoting much of our 
attention to over the next year.  We welcome the advice, 
encouragement and support of the people meeting in Ottawa today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime we therefore welcome the opportunity to make 
clear our position on this issue and urge support of the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for its refusal to 
replace Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, with legislation targeting 
the criminal misuse of firearms and revoke their firearms 
registration policy that, in the opinion of this House: (a) 
confiscates private property; (b) contains unreasonable search 
and seizure provisions; (c) violates Treasury Board cost<I>benefit 
quidelines; (d) represents a waste of taxpayers dollars; (e) is 
an affront to law-abiding firearms owners; and (f) will 
exacerbate the illicit trafficking in firearms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
amazed that the Leader of the Opposition would stand in the House 
to attack a bill that deals specifically with the safety of our 
communities from coast to coast.  I am surprised because I 
thought the Leader of the Opposition would stand to say that he 
was sorry his party voted against Bill C-68. I thought the Leader 
of the Opposition would stand to talk about all the benefits that 
exist in Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent an urban riding.  In my constituency—and I would 
say this is probably the case across the nation from coast to 
coast—there is overwhelming support for Bill C-68.  There is 
overwhelming support for banning firearms.  There is overwhelming 
support for the government's initiative when it comes to 
community safety across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised to see the Leader of the Opposition stand in the 
House to attack Bill C-68 and cater to the fundamentalists of 
firearms, those who have not taken the time and energy to read 
the bill to see what is in it. I have not seen one of those 
people come forward with a logical approach or logical reason for 
being opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Leader of the Opposition to tell all victims of stolen 
firearms specifically what is in Bill C-68 that he does not like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  First let me remind him that I also represent 
an urban riding, so I am not unfamiliar with the concerns of 
urban voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let me make it abundantly clear to the hon. 
member—perhaps the fact that we have said this a thousand times 
still has not permeated his mind—that we are primarily concerned 
about public safety but do not believe this approach to gun 
control enhances public safety one iota. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned what his constituents are concerned about, 
people who stole firearms and used them against other citizens. 
Note the word stole.  This is criminal use of firearms which is 
precisely our position:  target gun control legislation at 
criminals.  That is not what the bill does and that is what we 
propose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, with respect to the matter of so-called public support for 
the bill, I suggest it is exactly in the same category as the 
Charlottetown accord.  The government comes out with a proposal 
accompanied by all the PR it can muster, all the spin-doctoring 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that happens the general level of support for that type of 
thing within the first few months is 60% to 65%.  We have seen 
this time and time again, not just at the federal level but at 
the provincial level.  However, as the public starts to learn 
what it is about, as the provinces and the municipal officials 
that have to administer it start to talk about the difficulties, 
as the costs start to pile up, and as they find out that the 
public has been misled as to the cost, where does that support 
go?  It goes exactly in the same direction as it did on the 
Charlottetown accord.  It goes down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day there will be more support for the 
position on gun control that is being put forward by the official 
opposition than there will be for the bill that was put forward 
by the government.

costs, would not the money be better spent on a registry that 
registers criminals and not guns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member's 
comment that we are united in this approach.  We are hopeful that 
we may be even more united in some other approaches, but that is 
a subject for further discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the suggestion implicit in the member's question. 
The dollars that are being invested in the registration of 
firearms, particularly when the people we are trying to get at, 
the people who will use firearms in a criminal manner, are the 
last people to participate in the registry.  The justice minister 
can put an add in the Mafia magazine saying please register your 
firearms, but it is entirely unlikely that he will get a response 
that will justify that expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with the suggestion of the hon. member that if one is 
to register it might be better to register the people who are 
inclined to use firearms in a criminal way rather than to focus 
on the weapons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
once again I rise in the House to participate in yet another 
debate on gun control initiated by the official opposition that 
just does not get it.  Also I want to speak to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given ample opportunity in the House and across Canada 
to everyone concerned to speak to this issue, but Her Majesty's 
Official Opposition continues to misinform the public and to 
openly support the highly visible and vocal gun lobby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition spoke about democratic freedoms. 
That is why we have people outside the House today demonstrating 
their opinion.  In some other countries in the world, to get on 
the Hill as in this case they would have to get past walls that 
are six feet high and three feet thick.  If there are countries 
in the world where there is freedom of speech it certainly is 
this country.  We should applaud that, not condemn it as the 
opposition leader says.  The minister is currently at a press 
conference and will be speaking later in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some of the statistics because there is a lot 
of support in the country for the legislation.  In a recent Angus 
Reid poll 82% of Canadians approved the universal registration of 
rifles and shotguns; 72% in rural communities.  The opposition is 
completely out of touch with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver handguns are seized as often 
as rifles and shotguns:  70% of firearms that are seized are 
legally owned and for handguns it is less than 10%. 
Approximately 40% of women killed by their husbands are shot.  It 
appears all these statistics have no bearing on the opposition's 
memory. Some 78% of legally owned guns— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is women, after all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Yes, it is women after all.  Some 
1,400 lives are lost each year at a cost—and we talked about the 
medical cost—of $70 million.  That is a burden on our health 
care system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one hears certain members of the opposition, not to mention 
the loud protesters, one might think the government had not done 
anything in recent years to address the concerns of the gun 
lobby. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation passed by this House includes, in section 18, an 
unprecedented obligation on the part of the government to table 
draft regulations before each House of Parliament and to ensure 
that such regulations are reviewed by an appropriate 
parliamentary committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tabled regulations in this House on two occasions, first in 
November 1996 and then at the end of October 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In respect of the first set of regulations, the standing 
committee made a total of 39 recommendations.  We were able to 
accept in whole or in part 38 of these 39 recommendations and to 
make amendments to the regulations to reflect those 
recommendations. For the second set tabled at the end of October 
of last year, the committee again made 39 recommendations of 
which we were able to accept in whole or in part 35 of them and 
to make consequent amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the statute was passing through the House, concerns were 
expressed about whether the statute provided appropriate 
opportunity to protect the constitutional and treaty rights of 
Canada's aboriginal peoples.  Amendments were made to the statute 
to permit development of regulations respecting the matter in 
which any provision of the statute or the regulations applies to 
any of the aboriginal peoples of Canada and to adapt any such 
provision for the purpose of its application to aboriginal 
peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We developed a full set of regulations called the Aboriginal 
Peoples of Canada Adaptation Regulations.  Both the development 
and implementation of these regulations have involved 
consultations and communication with a wide variety of native 
communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My former colleague, Mr. Anawak from the Northwest Territories, 
stated that it does not prevent our native people from putting 
food on the table, nor does it take away their guns; it simply 
means that they must register them.  They still can keep their 
guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently we have made more adjustments and accommodations. 
There was concern about our forms.  We engaged focus groups and 
held consultations with interest groups.  We revised the forms 
extensively and in a way that improves their acceptability to all 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been concern raised again from the same circles about 
certain categories of individuals who were the victims of 
unintended consequences of the legislation, particularly in 
respect of some categories of restricted firearms.  The minister 
has indicated that an amnesty will be available to provide 
additional time for those persons to bring themselves into 
compliance with the statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister postponed the implementation of this 
program for 60 days to address the suggestion from law 
enforcement organizations that more time would ensure more 
complete data input and thus enhance public security. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole legislation has to do with public security. We want 
to make sure that firearm users have the required permits and 
that, before they obtain such permits, they can demonstrate that 
they are responsible, law-abiding citizens, that they were never 
involved in criminal activities, and that they have received at 
least some basic training in the safe handling of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in order to better control the illegal movement of 
firearms and to provide better tools to police officers when 
they conduct criminal investigations or try to settle family 
disputes, all firearms will be registered by the year 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are major public initiatives that relate to public 
security and that are applied in a customized and responsible 
manner to all Canadians. As my colleague, Mr. Rock, indicated, 
Bill C-68 has to do with the kind of country in which we want to 
live. It has to do with the kind of society we want for 
ourselves and for our families. Passing that legislation means 
our lifestyle and values will be determined by all Canadians, 
and not by the gun lobby. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firearms cause more than three deaths daily in Canada.  The rate 
of mortality from gunshot wounds varies among provinces and 
territories, ranging from 5.7 to 21.2 per 100,000 people.  Most 
deaths from gunshot wounds occur in the home, with more occurring 
in rural areas than in cities, and are inflicted with legally 
acquired hunting guns.  The cost of the consequences for the 
improper use of firearms in Canada has been estimated at $6.6 
billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition leader spoke a lot about making changes 
to the Criminal Code.  The Firearms Act is part of an overall 
strategy of this government for safer communities.  It is one 
piece of the puzzle.  This includes changes to the youth justice 
system, to crime prevention, to victims assistance and the 
setting up of a DNA data bank.  We believe that all those 
together will lead to safer homes and safer cities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the myths, the misleading of the public continues even 
in that speech, a couple of years after the bill was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, one of the things the minister trotted out is that 
large numbers of people out there support Bill C-68.  She quoted 
a poll from Angus Reid in which 82% of the people contacted 
support gun control. What she neglected to say, and this is a key 
point, is that when people find out what the gun control measures 
that this government has put in place are, the support drops to 
less than 45%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has given the impression, which I am sure is just 
pure politics, that it is doing something wonderful for society 
by bringing in a gun registration scheme that is already costing 
$200 million, two and a half times the original projected cost, 
and will probably by the government's own figures cost $1 billion 
by the year 2015. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the public finds out what the registration scheme is all 
about, support drops to less than 45%.  In fact it is in the 
neighbourhood of 43%.  She neglects to mention that when she 
quotes these polls that have been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that she trotted out is that there are over 1,000 
lives lost in regard to this but she neglects to mention that 
there is no connection between this registration scheme and any 
way that the number would be reduced.  The Liberals always trot 
out these figures in some attempt to convince the public that 
what they are doing is going to reduce that number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She then goes into a description of the form, a form that has 
been described by their own members as being no more complex than 
the Income Tax Act.  She describes this piece of paper. What she 
does not tell us is how laying this piece of paper beside one's 
gun is going to reduce crime.  Nowhere in the entire world is 
there documented evidence that this reduces crime.  She neglects 
to say that when she describes this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for her comes from her very own user group that has 
said there is going to be a 50% error rate in regard to this 
registration scheme.  The police are asking for this.  If there 
is going to be an error rate, at what level will the error rate 
be acceptable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this system has been delayed for the fourth time is 
because the government cannot make it work and it will never 
work.  My question for her is at what level does the error rate 
have to be reduced so that this will be some kind of a system 
that might have a chance of doing anything?  At what level would 
she accept this error rate that she described to be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would first like to 
quote from the hon. member himself about how he thinks that the 
American system is the best system in the world and how proud he 
is that we should have the same type of system in this country. 
Thank God we do not have the same system in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the error rate, one of the reasons we are delaying the 
implementation of this is to make sure that there will be no 
errors in the system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. parliamentary secretary made reference to the 
American system.  I presume she does not realize that there is no 
monolithic, all-encompassing legal system in the United States 
governing firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The District of Columbia for example has the most stringent 
firearms regulations in all of the western world, much more 
stringent than anything she and her government are proposing in 
this bill. It also has the highest rate of firearms homicides in 
the western world.  It is 80 per 100,000 if anyone can believe 
it. This is in a strictly regulated environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wide open state of North Dakota where anyone over the age 
of 14 can possess and use unsupervised almost any type of 
firearm, the homicide rate per 100,000 is roughly equal to that 
of Japan, 1.5.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if she is even aware of these circumstances.  Has she 
done any sort of study of gun control legislation as it pertains 
to the United States and around the world?  I wonder how she 
would explain these anomalies which seem to indicate there are 
factors more important than mere possession of firearms or 
registration of firearms in firearms homicides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, speaking of statistics, 
the murder rate with guns in the United States is 10 times higher 
than it is in this country.  Let us get the statistics right. Gun 
death and injury rates are higher in western Canada and rural 
areas because of the use of firearms.  There is also a direct 
link— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  You are not listening.  You don't 
want to hear the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order please.  It is very difficult 
for the Chair to hear the answer in light of the noise in the 
chamber.  Perhaps members might restrain themselves so all hon. 
members can hear the answer of the parliamentary secretary which 
I know will be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  Is there no requirement whatsoever 
in this House for a member opposite to answer the questions 
directly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is an experienced 
member. He knows that when members are asked questions they can 
answer them in the way they see fit.  I am sure hon. members will 
want to be able to hear whatever answer is given.  The hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you.  I suppose 
they are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a direct link between access to firearms and firearms 
death and injury.  This comes from statistics collected all over 
the world.  If they are interested in having statistics, they are 
there, but the members of the official opposition are not 
interested in the statistics nor in the truth.  They are 
interested in supporting a gun lobby that is using its power to 
come to the House and to tell us to support the official 
opposition in misinforming the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  There is such a large number of 
government members who wish to participate in this debate that I 
want to inform you and the entire House that we will be splitting 
our time in subsequent rounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  The hon. member from the Liberal 
Party did not answer the question so I seek the unanimous consent 
of the House to allow her time to answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to extend 
the time for questions and comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, gun control 
legislation, it will be recalled, is legislation that we 
supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary goal of this legislation—and this is something I 
remember, having been a member of the Standing Committee on 
Justice at the time—was to reduce the number of incidents in 
which people going through a psychologically difficult period in 
their life come across a gun and turn it on themselves, with 
fatal or very serious results, having first in some cases 
fatally wounded members of their own family, their wife or 
children, or strangers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This extremely tragic kind of behaviour, attributable to 
temporary psychological distress, would not have taken place if 
a gun had not been available at that particular point in time.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the case with hunters or employees whose activities 
give them legitimate access to firearms.  Statistics show that 
this kind of accident occurs when guns are stored, sometimes for 
many years, with ammunition nearby.  The gun has not been used 
in ages.  The original owner no longer uses it.  In short, there 
was no need for the weapon to be available to anyone. 
Unfortunately, it was available at a particular and tragic point 
in time and was used to kill one or more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with legislation that could reduce this risk, that could 
save human lives, one could hardly do other than support the 
underlying principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The then Minister of Justice introduced a bill in the House the 
very purpose of which was to reduce these risks, to save lives. 
Faced with these objectives and principles, the Bloc Quebecois 
could only agree with a bill that preserved human life, a very 
precious commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, however, the Bloc Quebecois asked the Minister of 
Justice to make a number of amendments.  An initial group of 
amendments was intended to ensure that hunters and members of 
shooting clubs were not unduly hindered by the legislation in 
the exercise of their sport.  The Bloc Quebecois introduced a 
number of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of them were accepted. The Bloc Quebecois' proposal, for 
example, that the costs of registration be low, was well 
received by the government, and the costs are very reasonable 
indeed.  However, in the case of the Bloc's proposal that a 
hunter's failure to register be decriminalized, the government's 
response was less positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc sought to have gun handling courses taken in the past 
recognized, and the bill permits this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, the bill as amended got the support of the Bloc, 
first and foremost because of the principle of the value of 
human life and then because a number of amendments had smoothed 
the rough edges.  Today, however, we are well past that 
situation.  Regulations have been submitted to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and discussed. 
These regulations were introduced and tabled here in the House 
and are now part of the package permitting the legislation to be 
applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I would like to quote to you two paragraphs of 
the Bloc's dissenting opinion in the justice committee report on 
the proposed regulations introduced by the minister in 
connection with the Firearms Act, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of industry, hunters and gun clubs all 
complained that they had not really been given the time to 
prepare properly. 
Moreover, even though some witnesses had devoted hours to 
putting together briefs as best they might, in many cases as 
volunteers, and had submitted them to the Committee Clerk, the 
briefs were never distributed to the Committee members 
because there was no time to have them translated into both 
official languages. It is attitudes like this on the part of the 
federal government that undermine the credibility of elected 
representatives and institutions in the eyes of the people. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish the quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Bloc Québécois supports the concept of gun control and 
endorses the Committee's recommendations, it strongly deplores 
the fact that the disgraceful haste insisted on by the 
government and the Committee's Liberal majority has cast doubt 
on the quality of these regulations and put at risk the support 
of all Canadians and Quebeckers, which will be indispensable in 
the near future for the implementation of such an important 
piece of legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have indeed got to that point.  The problem is not the 
principle of the law; it is not that the law wants to save human 
lives.  The problem is the way it is being applied at the 
present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with cost overruns, unmet timetables, things that 
had been anticipated and with which the Bloc Quebecois cannot 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as I read the motion put to us by the Reform Party, I see 
that it swings the pendulum totally in the other direction.  We 
are in favour of the principle of the legislation.  The Reform 
Party has never been in favour of the principle of the 
legislation, and that is where our paths diverge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, we cannot be in agreement with the Reform Party 
motion, although we continue to strongly disagree with the way 
the Minister of Justice is currently proceeding with 
implementation of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer one example: believe it or not, they are calling for 
volunteer auditors.  I have here a letter dated July 8 and 
signed by Mr. Buisson, the superintendent of the national 
firearms registry.  He says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business auditors designated by the director are volunteers 
who will be responsible for checking business inventories and 
all transfers to and from those inventories. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This creates a situation in which reliance is being placed on 
people's good will to ensure application of the very mechanics 
of the legislation, of the regulations, and is just one more 
example of how this legislation is not being properly 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois maintains that, for the sake 
of human lives, the legislation implemented must deliver the 
services we expect from it.  The value of human lives, however, 
is such that implementation of this legislation must be done in 
such a way as to respect all those involved, and this is not the 
case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to add my voice of 
concern to the direction in which this government is leading this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to ask a question at the beginning of this debate. 
Why are we debating this issue today when there should be other 
issues that are much more important in this country?  The reason 
we are debating this today is because this issue strikes right to 
the heart of what is wrong with this government.  This issue 
strikes right to the heart of the problems we are trying to solve 
in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had politics enter the area of justice and because of 
that the government is putting the whole country at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that this is politics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the passage of Bill C-68 and all the debate that took 
place in 1994 and 1995, I have been asked many times “Why is the 
government forcing this upon us when it flies in the face of 
common sense?  Why is the government pushing forth with this 
bill?”  People are asking me “What will it accomplish?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to be honest with them.  I cannot read the mind of the 
government, but I observe, as we look at this legislation, that 
this government is trying to create the impression that it is 
doing something wonderful for society by introducing a gun 
registration scheme.  The government is equating this gun 
registration scheme with reducing crime in society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we scratch the surface, when we look underneath, we realize 
that there is nothing there.  Then people say “How does laying a 
piece of paper beside your gun reduce crime?”  I say that it 
cannot.  It does not.  And nowhere is there any documented 
evidence in the world to support this.  Countries have tried this 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not even answered the question that I have 
asked many times.  We have had the registration of handguns since 
1934.  Give us some evidence of how this has saved lives; of how 
this has reduced crime.  The government cannot do it.  It flies 
right at the very heart of democracy and debate.  This government 
has hidden information from the Canadian people.  They have not 
been able to properly judge this legislation and other 
legislation that comes before the House.  This is a very good 
example of what is wrong with this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demonstration that is going to take place this afternoon 
demonstrates, just like it did in Vancouver, that we can 
demonstrate all we want but our government does not listen.  It 
ploughs ahead in the face of contradictory facts with legislation 
that will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians have been deceived.  That is my theme.  I want to 
emphasize it.  They have been deceived by their own government 
into believing that gun control is crime control and that it will 
somehow make our lives safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several myths that have been spread about by the 
Liberals.  Once people find out the truth about them, the support 
for the registration drops dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary quoted the statistic that 82% 
of Canadians support this.  She did not finish the story.  When 
the polling company asks them whether they would support it if 
the costs are $200 million, as they now are, rather than $85 
million, or when they rise to $1 billion whether they would still 
support it, the support goes way down.  It becomes a minority of 
people.  That is hidden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government always creates the impression that this is 
supported by the public, but it is not.  Once the public finds 
out the true facts it drops dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are these myths being spread about by the Liberals?  There 
are at least 10 of them.  Unfortunately, in a 10 minute speech I 
do not have time to touch on all of them.  One of the myths that 
is spread is that it is going to be cost effective.  It is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally we were told that this was going to cost $85 million. 
That number disappeared a long time ago.  In fact the budget for 
this year is over $133 million and that is just for the upfront 
costs.  That is not for the hidden costs of all the other 
departments, what the provinces have to spend and the cost that 
is probably well and beyond that.  Also, the year previous it was 
$67 million.  That is $200 million in just the last couple of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government goes on to tell us that it is going to take 
$50 million or $60 million per year to maintain the system.  By 
the government's own numbers that is $1 billion by the year 2015. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask people whether they would prefer to have that $50 
million or $60 million per year spent fighting organized crime 
rather than a registration scheme, guess what they say?  “Let's 
fight organized crime.  We don't need a bureaucratic boondoggle, 
such as the registration system, in this country.  It will do 
very little.  It is not cost effective.  We would rather have $50 
million or $60 million to fight organized crime, which is a big 
problem.  Target the criminal, not the law-abiding citizen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask them whether they would rather have $50 million or $60 
million to set up a DNA data bank, guess what they say?  “We 
would rather register criminals than law-abiding citizens.  We 
would rather have that facility available to us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask them whether they would rather have $50 million or $60 
million spent compensating victims of crime, or victims of the 
HIV blood scandal that we had in this country and is still being 
debated, there is no doubt as to where they would spend that $50 
million or $60 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That needs to be debated in this House.  We are in charge of the 
public purse.  We have to decide as parliamentarians by looking 
at the big picture what is happening in the country and how we 
are going to spend taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people find out about this registration scheme they 
would rather have the money spent elsewhere.  If they were asked 
whether they would rather have $50 million or $60 million spent 
fighting child pornography or child prostitution, guess what 
they would say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it does not have money for many of these 
very important things and yet it spends it on a registration 
scheme that is soon going to cost us $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of the public are asked whether they would rather 
have $50 million or $60 million spent on crime prevention or a 
gun registration scheme, they always choose the crime prevention, 
or $50 million or $60 million to combat family violence.  Guess 
what they say.  They would rather have the money spent combating 
family violence.   When asked if they would rather $50 million or 
$60 million be put into police resources so that they can 
investigate all the unsolved murders and sex offences, guess what 
the public says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in British Columbia they are short $15 million which 
translates into 300 policemen on the street.  They are short that 
much in order to provide the proper law enforcement resources in 
that province alone, and this exists across the country.  Instead 
we put money into a bureaucratic scheme so that every gun owner 
can put a piece of paper beside his or her gun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This defies common sense.  This is ridiculous and the public is 
fed up with it.  There are so many myths associated with this 
that need to be dispelled.  One is the cost and the other is the 
that the public supports this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does Bill C-68 not accomplish anything, it does the 
exact opposite of what is intended.  It takes resources and money 
from areas where it could be much better spent as I have just 
explained and puts it into forming more big government.  It also 
takes police off the street.  It takes away police resources and 
puts it into an area where it is much more needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need this.  We need to have our police on the street 
and a registration scheme ties up the police behind their desks, 
not out on the street where they would do a lot more good.  When 
the public realizes that it would do the opposite of what is 
intended, of what the government has said, the support for this 
drops dramatically.

Speaker, I want to direct a question to my friend from 
Yorkton—Melville, the first chance I have had an opportunity to 
do that in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest this is a kind of issue where there should be a free 
vote in the House of Commons, where we could have the reflection 
of the great diversity of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need in general parliamentary reform, electoral 
reform to make this a more democratic institution that represents 
the general will of the Canadian people.  After all, that is what 
parliament is supposed to be for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has talked for a long time about more free 
votes in the House of Commons, reflecting the diversity of its 
constituents. Can he assure us at this time that there will be a 
free vote on this issue in the Reform Party so that we can see 
that reflection and diversity in the Reform caucus?  It has 
talked about that for years.  It was a promise in 1993.  It was a 
promise in 1997. I remember those promises very well.  I have not 
seen that promise reflected in the House of Commons since its 
members were elected to this place.  I wonder whether on this 
issue, which is not really an ideological issue per se, this 
might be an example of a free vote in the Reform Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with great joy 
that I point out to the member that we had a free vote on Bill 
C-68 in this House and we were roundly criticized by the NDP 
which did not have a free vote on this. We did. 
We had a free vote and our members are free to express that. They 
can represent their constituents.  In fact, we go beyond that. 
We would like to see a lot more democracy in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that he has been going around 
the country saying we should get rid of the Senate and he has 
joined together with a Liberal member of parliament from Ontario 
to do that.  Unfortunately that would not improve the democracy 
in this country.  We need to have a Senate that has some free 
votes and some accountability and is not appointed by the prime 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go well beyond what this member is saying and we truly want 
to democratize this institution.  Those demonstrators who are out 
there today show very clearly one of the problems we have with 
this country and that is that when people express themselves they 
are not being listened to by this government.  I think it should 
be of major concern to this member here that the people of Canada 
cannot express themselves and let their will be known.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on September 1 the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville 
told Alberta radio listeners that Canada should look to the 
United States for leadership on guns.  He was asked a specific 
question about the American practice of allowing people to carry 
concealed weapons.  He told the host and listeners: “I think we 
should take a look at their experience there.  I think they are 
ahead of us on that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Windsor, right across the river from Detroit, 
Michigan, which used to be the murder capital of the United 
States.  Every day children are shot there in schools and on the 
street.  They talk about it on their newscasts like it is a car 
accident.  I cannot believe the Reform Party would hold up the 
American gun culture as an example for Canada to emulate. Every 
day Canadians watch in horror as American television beams yet 
another firearm tragedy into our homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many children have to die before the Reform Party realizes 
that the United States is not the example Canadians want us to 
follow?  How long will it take for him to realize and how long 
will it take for his colleagues to realize that these are not 
Canadian values? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question I want to ask is how can grown men, and they 
seem to be mostly men, get so upset about our wanting to regulate 
a lethal commodity in our society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting 
how members opposite cleverly manipulate the discussion in the 
House to try to show that what they are doing is so wonderful for 
society.  It becomes quite clear that they are trying to 
re-engineer society to get people to think that they are thinking 
in some way of what they are doing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of the discussion today is a registration scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe we should wait 
for a moment for them to be quiet so they can listen to the 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member would not want to wait too 
long, his time is about to expire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I point out to the 
member in answer to her question that we need to do research 
around the world on what is happening and the experience.  That 
is the point I made that she was quoting, that we have to look at 
what is happening around the world and the experience that people 
have had with registration around the world.  We find out that it 
has not worked anywhere, so why should we try to spend hundreds 
of millions of dollars here when it has not worked anywhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have had some very interesting experiences and we 
ought to look at what they have done in the city of Miami and how 
they have been able to reduce crime there in a very effective 
way. Sexual assaults went down 86% when they did a certain 
experiment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I start off by explaining that I am an active firearms 
owner and user.  I am a trap and skeet shooter.  I am not 
particularly good at it but I enjoy doing it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also a competitive pistol shooter.  I am much better at 
that.  Having said that, I say to the Liberals across the way and 
to everyone else that I support gun control.  Gun control is 
good. We should have it in Canada.  There is no question about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gun control is ensuring that international arms dealers do not 
operate out of our country.  Gun control is about ensuring that 
criminals do not smuggle Uzis and AK-47s into this country.  Gun 
control is about ensuring that terrorists cannot easily arm 
themselves with illegal weapons.  Gun control is about getting 
firearms out of the hands of criminals.  Gun control is desirable 
for the average Canadian, and I agree with it.  But Bill C-68 is 
not about gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a lot of people write to me.  An overwhelming 
majority were opposed to this bill. Some were in favour.  I spent 
as much time looking at their letters as I do with the others, 
perhaps even more.  I know what a lot of the people opposed to it 
are going to say but I want to see what the people who are in 
favour in this bill have to say about it. One women said if it 
saves only one life is it not worth it.  I am not going to brush 
that off. I am going to have a very serious look at that.  If it 
saves even one life is it worth it?  The figure that was going 
around at the time was $89 million. Later it went to $118.9 
million.  That figure is now quite low but that is the figure I 
worked with and looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, 1,354 lives were lost in some manner related to a 
firearm, suicide, homicide, accident, legal intervention, every 
means we can connect to a firearm.  The same year I looked at 
those figures I found out from talking to a doctor in charge of 
the breast cancer detection program in British Columbia that 
17,000 women would be diagnosed that year alone with breast 
cancer.  Of those 5,400 would be terminal.  I asked if I provided 
him with $118.9 million what would he do with it and what results 
would we get.  He talked to some of his colleagues.  They did 
some math.  He came back and said that if I gave them that much 
money they could double the early detection screening in the high 
risk category.  I asked what results would that give. He said 
that statistically they could save 1,710 lives.  That is 1,710 
real lives saved, victims in this country, or some unknown 
percentage in some unknown way of 1,354 that has never been 
explained to us by the past justice minister or the present one. 
If this bill is about saving lives there are a lot better ways to 
spend the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another consideration.  There are going to be a lot of 
things talked about today.  I want to hit on a couple of very 
specific points.  There is a challenge by the province of Alberta 
that has gone to court and is complete.  We are waiting for the 
decision of that court challenge.  The government is spending a 
lot of money on that court challenge.  I might add that the 
province of Alberta is supported by the provinces of 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they say there is a lot of support out there, yes there is. 
I think it is because of misinformation.  But that aside, there 
is a lot of support out there.  There is also a lot of resentment 
to this bill from individuals Canadians, from groups of Canadians 
and from entire provincial governments. There is a lot of 
opposition to this as well.  That should be a clue to the 
government that even if it wants to keep this bill it should 
perhaps at a very minimum look at it and see if there is some 
alternative to some of the aspects of it.  Even without the most 
objectionable parts of it there is some alternative to what it is 
proposing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Alberta court challenge it is anticipated, and this is 
from fairly high up and not our opinion, that the federal 
government is going to lose that challenge.  The decision will 
likely read that the federal government does not have the right 
to regulate private property.  If that happens what it will do is 
not only strike down the registration provisions of Bill C-68, it 
will strike down the registration of handguns as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is support for Bill C-68 from people who want to see 
sporting rifles and shotguns registered, can we imagine the 
outcry from these people if the actions of the government, albeit 
intending to support the desires of those people, inadvertently 
causes the loss of the registration of handguns?  I think the 
government would end up losing ground rather than gaining.  In 
light of that it might want to reconsider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, by claiming that the bill would reduce crime, 
has played a very cruel hoax on Canadians by providing them with 
a false sense of security and possibly reducing vigilance against 
criminal attack.  The government claims that Bill C-68 will make 
our homes and streets safer but the legislation does absolutely 
nothing whatsoever to justify that claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money the government is wasting on Bill C-68 could be spent 
far more effectively on disease prevention, detection and cures; 
on policing costs; on establishing DNA databanks to aid the 
police in apprehending and convicting violent criminals; on 
post-secondary education for young people who are inheriting a 
debt of two decades of wasteful program spending, which I might 
add can be compared very closely with this bill and the amount of 
money it will cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 is not gun control.  It is a phenomenal waste of 
money.  It provides a false sense of security to Canadians.  It 
does absolutely nothing to hamper the criminal misuse of 
firearms.  If anything, it actually helps criminals by diverting 
police activities from their apprehension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association, the frontline police officers, 
not the politically appointed chiefs of police, who deal directly 
with criminals and criminal situations are totally opposed to the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government's intentions were good, now is the time to 
correct the outcome.  What the government intended may not be the 
way it will come out.  I call on the government to rescind Bill 
C-68 and replace it with legislation that cracks down on the 
criminal misuse of firearms.  If the intention is good that is 
great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first speech I ever made in the House of Commons I said, 
and sincerely meant it, that I was not here to oppose the 
government for opposition sake.  If the government does something 
right I will be the first to congratulate it.  If the government 
comes out with a bill that I do not happen to agree with, I will 
speak out on it and try to suggest alternatives to make it a 
better bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done that in committee.  I have worked with government 
officials not to try to expose what they are doing and say they 
are a bunch of whatever but rather to say what I believe the 
problems are and to give a justifiable and valid alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are alternatives.  The government should not blindside 
itself by saying that everything it does it automatically right. 
It would be far better to say that everything it does it means to 
be right but sometimes it will have to make some changes along 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is one of those times.  I hope enlightened 
members will look at it and see that it is not a weakness to 
suggest that the intentions were good but perhaps some changes 
are needed.  This bill is one of those occasions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
somewhat puzzled.  I do not understand the contradiction in 
Reform Party policy when it comes to community safety.  I do not 
understand why it would oppose crime control Bill C-68.  Why does 
it want to oppose crime control legislation that will guarantee 
the safety of our communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill takes into consideration the interests of law-abiding 
citizens who own guns and the community at large.  It strikes a 
balance between those who have and those who want to be 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand how the member could stand in the House to 
oppose gun control legislation and crime prevention Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims groups in his constituency, the majority of people in

</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions his own party has indicated the need to 
control the use of firearms.  Back in 1994 it passed a motion 
that if elected a Reform government would introduce legislation 
by which the criminal misuse of firearms would be severely 
punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened between 1994 and 1998?  Why is the Reform Party 
now falling into the trap of special interest groups and lobby 
organizations?  Why is it not defending the interests of its own 
constituencies and those of victims?  Why are Reformers not 
standing up for the rights of those who wanted them to stand up 
for their rights, for those who have written to them over and 
over again to tell them to support Bill C-68?  Why are they going 
with special interest groups and against the will and interests 
of the community at large? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was a very interesting 
little spiel from the hon. member.  I am sure he has been taking 
lessons from the Minister of Foreign Affairs.   He said that the 
bill was about crime control.  That is a myth that I cannot 
believe they believe.  It has nothing to do with crime control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Law-abiding citizens are not the problem.  Criminals are the 
problem.  By definition criminals break the law.  Why does the 
government think a registration program law-abiding citizens have 
to comply with will solve crimes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine the bank robber on his way to the bank saying 
“Gee, we had better not rob the bank today because I haven't 
registered this rifle?”  When was the last time somebody robbed 
a bank with a rifle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime control, give me a break.  If the member wants to talk 
about what we are doing today then at least he should make some 
sensible remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that the chiefs of police were against us. 
I acknowledge that.  Politically appointed chiefs of police are 
onside with the government that appoints people.  What a 
surprise.  I do not know if it was intentional or not, but he was 
wrong when he said that police associations were in favour of it. 
They are not.  The Regina police refused to support the RCMP in a 
request to register firearms.  The Canadian Police Association 
that covers police from one end of the country to the other, 
frontline police who do the work, is opposed to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about my constituents.  I surveyed my constituents 
with a question that firearms owners challenged me on.  They 
asked why I was being so neutral, why I was not being stronger 
and more supportive in the way I asked questions.  I told them it 
had to be an absolutely neutral, fair question which we had 
designed for us.  I got the biggest response on that survey of 
any householder survey I have ever sent out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Table it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  I will table it.  I would love to.  I will 
give the member the figures on that.  Ninety per cent of 
respondents opposed the bill after being asked a totally neutral 
question.  I am representing my constituents.  I would suggest to 
the hon. member that he has a lot of backbenchers over there who 
are not representing their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to inform the House that the 
time for questions and comments has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is in a bit of difficulty.  I would appreciate the 
assistance of hon. members.  Prior to the speech of the hon. 
member for Yorkton—Melville, on the special agreed order in 
respect of rotation it was the turn of the New Democratic Party 
to offer a speech followed by the Conservative Party.  That 
unfortunately did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there consent to revert to those two speeches so we may clear 
this up today and then allow government members to follow since 
the official opposition has had its first two speakers?  Would 
the House agree to revert to allow these two 10 minute speeches 
to follow in the usual case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect we started a new session yesterday and members may not 
be accustomed to the usual practices.  I hope there would be 
agreement to do this.  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
start by thanking the House for its indulgence on this matter.  I 
appreciate the effort of my colleagues.  It is perhaps a good 
juncture to see the House agree to allowing me and the 
Conservative Party to speak to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had probably an hour and a half of very partisan and 
very heated debated on the opposition motion.  I would like to 
talk a bit about gun control and the gun control registry, the 
history of it in the country and what it has meant to all 
Canadians.  Let us not forget that we are here to represent 
Canadians in rural parts of the country, aboriginal Canadians and 
Canadians in urban centres, many of whom have different positions 
on the legislation because of their own different experiences and 
the different places in which they find themselves today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the history of gun control and registration is not 
new.  Since 1877 Canada has restricted the use of some firearms 
to protect public policy.  Since 1968 Canada has classified 
weapons as prohibited, restricted and non-restricted.  In 
1977—and this has been referred to by members in the debate—an 
act was introduced which created the firearms acquisition 
certificate.  For a long time there has been debate in the 
House—this is not a new issue—about how firearms are to be 
controlled and whether or not we need gun registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians have opposed the bill.  When it was introduced in 
the House last year there was tremendous debate.  Today we 
revisited much of that debate.  We have to be clear that although 
the motion speaks to registration there is a rally opposed to 
Bill C-68 on Parliament Hill today.  Much of the debate is 
focusing in reality on that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation has concerned many Canadians on both 
sides of the issue.  I have listened to many convincing arguments 
by Canadians and by their representatives in the House who oppose 
Bill C-68 and who oppose registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my caucus the member for Churchill has been eloquent in 
presenting to me as the justice critic the interests and concerns 
of her constituents about the legislation.  The member for Yukon 
in the caucus has told eloquent stories about aboriginal women in 
her community who use firearms as part of their daily lives and 
see in many cases Bill C-68 and the registration of firearms as 
an imposition on them and their historic way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand—and this reflects the diversity in the 
country—I have heard from the member for Burnaby—Douglas about 
the concerns of his constituents in a very urban riding who say 
that gun control is necessary for them to feel safe in their 
homes and in their streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from my seatmate, the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Centre, eloquent stories about constituents who have come to him 
and said  “We are afraid to sleep at night.  We cannot sleep at 
night in this city in this country in this year because of the 
sound of gunfire”.  We are not talking about Sarajevo.  We are 
talking about Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These constituents are Canadians.  All these Canadians look at 
the legislation from their perspective and from where they live. 
If there is one thing Canadians expect from the House, it is that 
we take this most serious issue and do not play politics with it, 
that we take this most serious issue and reflect the concerns of 
Canadians on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of gun control came from well-intentioned 
people.  Its opposition is from well-intentioned members.  When 
the Minister of Justice introduced the legislation I do not think 
he was trying to anger or that he did not take into account the 
concerns of rural Canadians and aboriginal Canadians. I do not 
think members of the opposition party when they were first 
elected and opposed this bill did so simply to play politics.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it reflects the real divisions in this country.  We have 
always suggested that the legislation needed to be reviewed.  We 
needed to take into account the aboriginal community, the rural 
and urban Canadians and find a way in this great country in our 
history of consensus building to meet the needs of all these 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of this debate the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition said that the Reform Party came here in part to make 
parliament more democratic.  He called for more free votes.  He 
called for better ways for us to discuss the issues of Canadians 
and Canadians' concerns.  No party in this legislature has a 
monopoly on democratic reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP have for a long time argued that there has to be a 
different way to deal with very contentious issues.  We have 
called for the abolition of the Senate but that is not the 
purpose of this debate today so I will not go into it.  We have 
called for proportional representation. And today on this issue 
we call for a free vote. Today on this issue we will demonstrate 
the commitment of our party to the reformation of this 
institution and ask for a free vote.  We will vote that way in 
this party reflecting the diversity of Canadians on this 
contentious issue, reflecting the wishes of our constituents and 
reflecting our history on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that when this law was introduced there were 
nine members of the New Democratic Party in this House. Since 
then more than half of this caucus is newly elected.  We spoke to 
our constituents about their concerns.  I have given some 
examples of what those concerns have been.  We will be voting 
freely on this motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do wish that the opposition motion called for a review of the 
firearms legislation.  I do wish that the implementation by the 
government had proceeded in a better way. I do wish that we 
played less politics with this particular issue and listened more 
to Canadians.  At the end of the day in this party that is what 
we will do.  At the end of the day when the vote is called, we 
will vote according to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, there are different merits on different parts 
of the legislation.  As I have indicated I would be happier had 
both the government and the opposition attempted to find a way to 
change the legislation to make it accommodate all of the 
interests in the country.  I believe that we can truly reflect 
the interests of Canadians in that way.  I call upon the members 
of this House to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions were put to the Reform Party whether there would be a 
free vote on this issue.  The Leader of the Opposition questioned 
the government, will there be a free vote on this issue?  Well, 
there will be for some of us.  I throw that out as an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest again that the people who live in parts of this 
country that have genuine concerns about firearms ought to be 
respected, but so too and not at the expense of other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this country have always found a way to compromise on the 
most difficult and contentious issues.  We look to our 
parliamentarians and we look to our leaders for that compromise. 
We have proposed for a long time a review of the legislation, 
that we travel the country and hear the concerns of Canadians 
which I think is the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House again for its indulgence in allowing me my 
turn to speak. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wanted to address the hon. member with a bit of 
historical information about the debates on this bill back in 
1994-95. There were in fact great efforts made to make the bill 
better, make it acceptable to all concerned.  There were some 200 
amendments proposed both by opposition members and by members on 
the government side.  The government stonewalled almost all of 
them.  There was no consideration given to them.  There was no 
compromise, a sort of take no prisoners attitude.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member if he feels that the total rejection of 
more than 200 amendments really represents an effort to govern or 
if it is merely an effort to steamroll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments.  They are enlightening to me as a member who 
has been in this House for a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I am going to reflect on and honestly one of 
the things I have learned here is that sometimes amendments are 
put forward in good spirit and sometimes they are put forward for 
purely political purposes to filibuster.  I am learning that.  It 
is one of the things that I am learning about perhaps the darker 
side of the rules in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member asks me whether that was stonewalling or whether 
it was a poor attempt to govern, I do not know what those 
amendments were in fairness.  I do not know what they reflected. 
More than 200 certainly means that they were doing their job I 
suppose.  They were reviewed by the justice committee. My 
experience on that committee to date has been that oftentimes 
parties seize on a particular issue and will sometimes play 
politics with it.  Sadly, I was not here but I thank the hon. 
member for his history lesson.  I unfortunately cannot determine 
whether or not those amendments were in good faith or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
speak earlier.  She indicated that during that debate all kinds 
of amendments were accepted.  I do not know how many must have 
been put forward to the government.  Some were accepted. 
Obviously 200 were rejected. It does not sound to me like the 
best way to do business though. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a question for the hon. member which I would like to preface. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member whether he really believes that 
this piece legislation, formerly known as Bill C-68, is more 
about taxation than gun control.  I would ask the member to share 
his thoughts with respect to whether he thinks that registering 
the long rifles of innocent deer hunters, duck hunters and 
farmers will have any effect on deterring the criminal use of 
firearms. I think ultimately it will not and the excessive 
registration costs which are rumoured to be in the area of $300 
million to as high as $1 billion are far too excessive for our 
law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to deter the criminal use of firearms in this 
country, I would ask the hon. member to answer the question of 
whether this $60 million to be utilized on an annual basis would 
be better used to put more police on the street, to actually 
seriously fight crime in a real way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a more specific question for the NDP in general.  In 
1993 the NDP called for a national gun registry, yet during the 
last parliament the majority of the NDP caucus opposed Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 in the riding of Kings—Hants the candidate actually 
painted himself as being anti Bill C-68 while the member for 
Halifax and the NDP leader painted themselves as pro Bill C-68. 
Where is the position of the NDP with respect to Bill C-68? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there were many questions 
but I will answer the first question first and then in the order 
in which they came. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was, do I think the $60 million might be put to 
better use.  I suppose it depends on one's perspective.  In the 
last session of this House before I was a member of parliament 
there was a great deal of talk and discussion in Cape Breton, 
where we have a staggering rate of unemployment, that the gun 
control registration centre would be placed in my riding creating 
upwards of 100 jobs.  That was a pretty enticing argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose from the perspective of a member of parliament who 
might possibly have some of his constituents put to work in a gun 
registration centre in an area of high unemployment it is not too 
much money. On the other hand if it is going to stay here in 
Ottawa, maybe that changes my perspective a little bit and I do 
not think it is going to be located in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the money be put to better use?  There is no shortage of 
money in this country— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time has expired.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for its indulgence.  It is always 
an honour to follow my colleague from the New Democratic Party, a 
learned counsel, justice critic and fellow Nova Scotian. He has 
given a view from his perspective on this particular debate and I 
hope to add my humble remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt, I am 
pleased to pledge our party's support for this particular motion 
before the House.  It reaffirms the position taken by the hon. 
Jean Charest in the last parliament, in the last election and the 
position of our party throughout this debate, the unwavering 
opposition to this ill conceived long gun registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus here should not waver.  It is about long guns.  It is 
about shotguns and rifles.  The emphasis here is on long guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key commitments I made to the constituents of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough was that I would continue to 
oppose this piece of legislation.  It is ineffective and unproven 
mandatory gun registration.  The legislation concentrates and 
targets law-abiding citizens as opposed to criminals who would be 
using firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 clearly does not approach and does not affect the root 
causes of crime.  One of the first motions I tabled in this House 
last September was to achieve the very goal which this particular 
motion sets out to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is very timely.  Obviously when we hear the cries of 
thousands and thousands of law-abiding gun owners who have 
assembled here on the hill today, there appears to be some 
opposition to what the government is going to do with this piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have already detailed the specific problems with this 
particular act.  Those problems were highlighted at the justice 
committee with the numerous amendments that were struck down by 
the government.  I would suggest they were useful, non-partisan 
amendments that were aimed at improving the act.  If we cannot 
kill it, the very least we can do is try to improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past several weeks I have had the opportunity to 
personally meet a number of representatives from organizations in 
my home province of Nova Scotia, individuals such as Tony Rodgers 
of the Nova Scotia Wildlife Federation to review the negative 
impact that has already resulted from this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses in the province of Nova Scotia and like businesses in 
other provinces are going to be extremely negatively affected by 
the implementation of this legislation because, as we know, it is 
going to force businesses to subject themselves to an extremely 
bureaucratic, cumbersome registry system that is not going to 
impact on the criminal use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, and it is a proven fact, that Canada already has one of 
the toughest gun control laws in the world.  We are now 
furthering that by adding burdensome registration fees which 
amount to nothing more than a tax, which was alluded to by the 
member for Fundy—Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and its well intentioned allies I might 
add have attempted to sell this issue of firearms registration as 
a question of crime control and safety.  It could not be any 
further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have made it an issue of black and white: 
proponents of Bill C-68 support gun control whereas opponents of 
Bill C-68 oppose gun control.  That is completely untrue.  Let us 
make this perfectly clear.  I do not think there is anyone in 
this House, anyone in the opposition, who has any opposition to 
gun control per se.  This is about long gun registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firearms owners I know and meet on a regular basis are some of 
the most responsible in handling guns and the most responsible 
and supportive of effective safety measures when it comes to the 
handling of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to do something specifically aimed at those who use 
guns for a criminal purpose, let us toughen up the code sections, 
let us toughen up the response of the courts to those who use 
firearms in a criminal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It came to light last spring that statistics used by the 
government to justify the mandatory registration of firearms were 
seriously flawed.  This came specifically from the commissioner 
of the RCMP himself, words like exaggeration and misuse of these 
statistics were then met by the reply of the Minister of Justice 
that these were simply a difference in methodologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to me to be a convenient excuse for the government to 
dismiss the facts it does not like to hear.  Is it any wonder 
that the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
and two territories have embarked on a challenge in the Supreme 
Court of Alberta to strike down Bill C-68.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fact the government conveniently ignores is that under a 
Conservative government Canada adopted tough gun control 
legislation through Bill C-17, which was passed through this 
parliament in late 1991 and came into effect over subsequent 
years.  In fact this government played a part in implementing 
some of those pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this previous gun law, applicants were required to obtain 
firearms application certificates, FACs, which required them to 
take a gun course, undergo police checks and wait up to 28 days. 
Handguns were considered restricted weapons and owners were 
required to have ownership permits.  Handgun permits were only 
issued to certified gun collectors and sports club members who 
were taking part in shooting competitions.  Private ownership of 
most military assault weapons was banned or restricted.  Those 
wanting to hunt were required to take mandatory hunting courses 
or required to take firearms handling safety courses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous law also included stringent storage and 
transportation regulations, making it an offence to breach these 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of these tough restrictions in place, what did the 
Liberal government then do upon assuming power?  Did the Liberals 
evaluate the effectiveness of the law?  No.  They embarked on a 
new form of intrusive and restrictive gun registration which, I 
submit humbly, was a knee-jerk and emotionally driven reaction to 
tragic circumstances that occurred in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have cited national opinion polls reporting 
overwhelming support from Canadians for this legislation.  I 
wonder how many Canadians, particularly urban Canadians, really 
understand what the impact of this legislation will be.  Would 
they be so supportive if the legislation was prefaced with the 
fact that Canadians already possess some of the most stringent 
gun control and registration laws? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps these public opinion polls are of concern to some in the 
House, but the practicality here is that this legislation is not 
going to impact on the criminal use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of justice also promised that it was only 
going to cost $85 million, despite evidence from witnesses at the 
original justice committee hearing that put the price tag as high 
as $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from all sorts of groups throughout this country, 
including aboriginal Canadians, predominately Canadians from the 
rural centres, who participate in perfectly legitimate legal 
activities involving the use of firearms such as hunting and 
target shooting.  These people have overwhelmingly voiced their 
opposition to this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the former minister's promises, we are now coming to the 
conclusion that the Canadian firearms centre and its 
administration charges are going to exceed $133.9 million to this 
point in time and we have not yet seen a single gun registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice department will not deny the reports that are 
appearing in the media that this is going to escalate to the 
point where it may exceed $500 million.  For this reason I wrote 
to the auditor general last week to urge his office to conduct a 
money for value audit on the Canadian firearms centre and the 
divisions of the Department of Justice responsible for the 
implementation of this act.  Canadians need to know why this 
money is being spent in this fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question the government's priorities.  This amount of money 
could easily be spent on front line policing, as was suggested 
earlier.  It could be spent on homes for battered women.  It 
could be spent on all sorts of justice initiatives, including the 
minister's much awaited and much ballyhooed young offender 
changes that we are anxiously anticipating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that outside the area of justice, the money 
could be spent in the area of compensating hepatitis C victims 
and compensating public service employees who have been long 
awaiting compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without any doubt, the priorities of this government have to be 
questioned.  Why not focus on the root causes of violence?  Why 
not use these resources in more effective ways? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we have seen this government switch its 
priorities at the last minute.  In recent days we have seen its 
decision to delay this further.  Why not take a hard look at what 
is taking place in this country with respect to this piece of 
legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude I want to commend the NDP for its decision to 
have a free vote.  I can assure this House that there has been 
much debate amongst our party.  We are going to be voting as a 
unified front on this, which comes about because of much 
consultation with our constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have considered the amendment and 
it is safe to say that the Chair has some concerns concerning the 
amendment, in that it appears to enlarge the scope of the 
original motion as moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the circumstances, the issue raised by the amendment 
is relevant to the main motion.  It is an opposition day.  It

</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak on behalf of my constituents, who are quite comfortable 
in this area, recognizing the diversity within Canada and also 
recognizing that as a rural northern area we probably fall into 
an area that has related incidents or deaths.  But we also 
recognize that the problem is not the gun, but rather the 
situation that precipitates what happens with the gun.  That has 
long been recognized in a number of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not willing to sacrifice the dollar usage for gun 
registration, which we in our constituency believe is faulty.  We 
do not intend to imply that law-abiding citizens should be 
affected by this legislation.

enough enforcement in this area.  There has never been 
enforcement of storage or follow through with FACs, who had 
acquired them and whether they had committed a crime after the 
fact.  That is where the fault lies with gun registration and gun 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be greater gun control, not gun registration. 
There needs to be greater enforcement.  The dollars should be 
utilized to ensure that there are better programs within 
communities and better support systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the hon. member for his amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond very 
briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for her remarks.  She knows of what she 
speaks.  It is clearly a fact that it is not guns that kill 
people, it is the person pulling the trigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her question allows me to make another point, which is that this 
registration system is aimed at helping police officers to 
identify which homes are going to house these firearms.  It is 
aimed at putting a serial number on a gun, on an inanimate 
object.  That is not going to prevent the object from killing or 
maiming a person if it falls into the wrong hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point to be made is this.  That information is not going to 
be accurate.  Canadians, by their very nature, are transitory. 
Knowing where those weapons are, who houses them, who is in 
possession of them is going to be an absolute impossibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated many times before, criminals are not going to 
participate in this registration system.  The information is 
going to be inaccurate.  Police officers are not going to be able 
to rely on the information with any degree of confidence.  I 
suggest that this will create a false sense of security amongst 
the policing community and amongst Canadians generally.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough in his 
original speech went to great lengths to try to illustrate that 
Bill C-68 has nothing to do with crime control.  Everybody, 
certainly every member of the opposition, is in support of gun 
control.  But gun control is about safe usage, storage and 
handling, and targeting the criminal misuse of firearms.  It is 
not about the legal use, legal possession and ownership of 
firearms by law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister in a few moments is going to be on a tirade 
with a bunch of statistics.  In anticipation of that and in 
anticipation of studies which quote that 82% of Canadians favour 
gun control, I want the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough to illustrate for the House how 
that is very misleading.  It is not about gun registration, it 
is about the safe usage, storage and handling of firearms that 
Canadians are in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
It is a rare opportunity to respond to a question in the presence 
of the Minister of Justice, in anticipation of what she is going 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we are going to hear a great deal about the 
methodological approach of the government and the statistics that 
it has been using to justify this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the point is well made.  The emphasis should be on the 
criminal use of weapons, not targeting those who are using guns 
for a legitimate purpose, recreational or otherwise.  It should 
put the emphasis on what criminals are doing with their guns. 
This legislation does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of the NDP suggested, why not put those statistics 
into front line policing and into areas where the police will be 
able to enforce the current laws, rather than create a new 
cumbersome process that simply will not work?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this morning I spoke at a 
press conference and thanked Canadians for their ongoing support 
of our government's firearms control program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically thanked CAVEAT, Victims of Violence 
International, La Fondation des victimes du 6 décembre, the 
Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime and the family 
members of victims who are here to ask the government to hold 
firm and implement its plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also took the opportunity to thank the Canadian Association of 
Chiefs of Police, municipalities, educators, child support 
agencies and the almost 700 member agencies of the coalition for 
gun control which have been tireless supporters of this program. 
These are the people who have learned through painful experience 
the terrible tragedies that can occur when firearms are not 
safely stored, when firearms fall into the hands of children, 
when police are asked to deal with a domestic violence call and 
have no knowledge of whether firearms are at play or when an 
illegal firearms industry develops with inadequate controls in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today opponents of gun control are demonstrating on Parliament 
Hill.  Some will make wild and outlandish claims.  Let me make 
one thing clear.  We will not be deterred by inflammatory and 
irresponsible rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Canadians support gun control.  Support for 
gun control today, including support for registration, is at its 
highest level ever, at 80% in some polls.  Today a majority of 
gun owners support gun control.  Canadians have debated the 
merits of gun control for several years.  Canadians have decided 
they believe in gun control.  The debate is settled.  The debate 
is over.  Gun control will be implemented on December 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are law abiding citizens.  I understand that when 
angry, people can make outlandish and even irresponsible 
statements but I know the vast majority of gun owners respect and 
obey the law.  So I say once again to those who demonstrate today 
that they have nothing to fear from me or from this government. 
My commitment is to ensure that gun control is implemented in the 
fairest and most efficient way possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act is about building a culture of safety around 
the use of firearms.  Through it we hope to achieve many things. 
Firearms registration and licensing of all gun owners will help 
keep firearms away from people who should not have them.  It will 
encourage awareness on the part of gun owners of the essential 
responsibility they have for their firearms, including their safe 
use and the importance of safe storage and transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A central processing site is already in service in Miramichi, 
New Brunswick.  All applications will go through there.  Owners 
will be able to get a form through a toll free line, at a post 
office or a gun shop.  They can fill it in at home and send it 
in.  Visits to the police will no longer be required.  This will 
allow our police to spend their time and resources on police work 
and not on preliminary paperwork.  Starting December 1 for a one 
time cost of $10 firearms owners will be able to register all 
their firearms.  They will register on forms made simple after 
consultations with the firearms community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken every step we can to ensure the registration and 
licensing of firearms in Canada is hassle free and easily 
affordable.  I have every confidence that firearms owners, once 
they participate in the program, will discover that their 
concerns were groundless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hunting is an activity that has been enjoyed by many Canadians 
for generations.  To farmers firearms are needed to protect 
crops.  Target shooting is a sport at which Canada excels 
internationally.  Firearms for some are needed for sustenance and 
are part of a way of life.  All these activities are legitimate 
and will not be hampered in any way by gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it perfectly clear, the Government of Canada 
unequivocally respects the legitimate rights of gun owners.  Our 
new Firearms Act is not about confiscation.  Such fears were 
raised when gun control was first introduced in Canada in the 
1970s.  They are being raised again today but they are as 
groundless as they were then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate is essentially about values. 
Canadians have told us that they want effective gun control. 
Polling shows that a majority of Canadians in every province 
support the universal registration of firearms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very glad to hear that the minister's heart is 
pure.  I feel better already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has gone to great lengths to tell us that there is nothing 
to fear in the legislation.  I believe that she believes that. 
However, if she would look around the country she would find that 
even under existing legislation let alone the draconian stuff 
that is being proposed here, ordinary citizens are being harassed 
and guns are being confiscated without compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary thinks this is a joke.  I 
wonder if Darrell McKnight, head of the computer department at 
the University of New Brunswick, would think it was a joke. His 
home was invaded by not one but three police officers searching 
for a firearm which he had duly registered and had bought in good 
faith.  It was a legally owned weapon.  By order in council the 
previous justice minister had declared this was no longer a legal 
weapon.  The police came when he was not at home.  They 
terrorized his teenage daughter, telling her she could go out and 
stand in the snow bank while they took the house apart. This is 
in Canada.  So please spare me this stuff about it is not a 
danger to us.  It is.  It always has been and it always will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe the 
hon. member actually asked me a question but let me say to the 
individual in question that I have no knowledge of the situation 
involving the person named. If he has a concern in terms of the 
way the police discharged their duties, if he has a concern with 
the way the attorney general of the province of New Brunswick 
conducted himself, or if he has a concern with the way I as 
Attorney General of Canada conducted myself in relation to the 
specifics of that situation I would appreciate that individual 
getting in touch with me.  I would be very happy to sit down with 
him and talk to him about his experience.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I myself am a firearm owner as well as a big-game hunter. I 
mention this because, unfortunately, there are still a few men 
who wonder what my involvement is in the debate on this issue, 
and I have been involved for a number of years. When I sat on 
the special committee on firearms in 1990, I was the only 
committee member with a FAC, or firearm acquisition certificate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question to the minister is this: Why does the 
government let those opposed to gun control spread all sorts of 
falsehoods? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, for instance, I tuned in to an open-line program on an 
English-language station. The caller was saying “This means I 
will have to pay $10 per firearm every year; it is going to cost 
me $60 a year for a permit.” As you and I know, this is 
absolutely false. Once the firearms are registered, that is for 
life. As for the permit, it is good for five years. Why are all 
these falsehoods still being spread? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question to the minister concerns the $350 million tab 
we are hearing about. I would like to know, first of all, if we 
will indeed have to pay such a tab and, second, how it got to be 
so high. If this is not true, I think that a public denial is in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to clarify this for us today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a 
very important point and that is those who choose for whatever 
reason to propagate misinformation and misrepresentations 
surrounding the new federal gun licensing and registration 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that wherever possible I take the 
opportunity to rectify those errors.  But I think all of us in 
this House who are people of good faith who are either legitimate 
gun owners such as the hon. member or those of us who are not gun 
owners support the right of legitimate gun owners to possess 
their weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our obligation to engage those who would lie and 
misrepresent the truth.  We must engage them.  We must destroy 
the propaganda.  We must work with all Canadians together to 
ensure we have a degree of public safety and security that all 
Canadians have told us over and over again they want and they 
deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the resolution we are debating today contains a type of 
misleading information that we have come to expect from the 
opponents of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed I want to emphasize that Canadians understand 
that the Firearms Act and the amendments to the Criminal Code of 
Canada in Bill C-68 are an investment in crime prevention which 
will preserve the culture of safety in Canada. I can tell all 
members that as former chairman of the Waterloo regional police I 
know this is correct and is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a surprise that 82% of all Canadians support the 
registration of all guns.  Seventy-two percent of rural Canadians 
approve of registration.  Seventy-eight percent of respondents 
say they approve of the act and almost half the gun owners 
approve of the Firearms Act as well.  There is massive support 
for this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opponents who are clearly driving the resolution before this 
House today are a small minority of special interests out of 
touch with the main street Canada on this issue.  It is most 
unfortunate but typical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resolution suggests that the government should be condemned 
for its refusal to replace Bill C-68.  Let us review for a moment 
the background of how this legislation came to be. It was 
introduced in the House of Commons on February 14, 1995.  Through 
successive debates including an extensive list of amendments 
brought to the bill in committee and in debate on third reading 
the bill was finally approved in December 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act contains unprecedented provisions in section 
118 which require that all regulations under the Firearms Act be 
tabled before both houses of parliament on the same day and that 
each of these regulations shall be referred by the Chamber to an 
appropriate committee which may conduct public hearings in 
respect to the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two major sets of regulations were processed in this manner with 
the first set being tabled in November 1996, the second in 
October 1997.  The standing committee reviewing the first set of 
regulations made 39 recommendations, 38 of which were accepted in 
whole or in part. In respect to the second set of regulations the 
standing committee again made 39 recommendations, 35 of which 
were accepted in whole or in part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point in this brief review is to ask the opposition why in 
view of the extensive parliamentary involvement in both the 
legalization and the regulations and in view of the number of 
changes and accommodations which were made as the legislation 
passed through the House would we even consider replacing Bill 
C-68. Why would we want to do that?  Let us remember that this is 
legislation that enjoys the support of 82% of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who support this motion would have us believe that this 
legislation does nothing to address the criminal misuse of 
firearms.  Opposition members may wish to consult the Criminal 
Code in this respect.  A significant number of offences in the 
code were modified to carry a minimum punishment of imprisonment 
for four years.  These Criminal Code offences were found under 
the headings of causing death by criminal negligence, 
manslaughter, attempt to commit murder, causing bodily harm with 
intent, sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault, 
kidnapping, hostage taking, robbery and extortion.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other offences are found for a variety of criminal offences 
including activities such as weapons trafficking, possession for 
the purpose of weapons trafficking, automatic firearms importing 
and exporting, knowing it is unauthorized, and tampering with the 
serial number of a firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were very attentive to criminal activities in formulating the 
offence provisions of Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the opposition, if they really took the time to study 
the issue, would also find that there have been a number of 
appeals of the four year minimum sentences that have taken place 
over the past two years.  All of them have been upheld on appeal 
as appropriate sentencing, expressing the will of parliament. 
They also express the will of the Canadian people, 82% of whom 
support this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition in its resolution suggests the government should 
abandon the policy of firearms registration.  There are a number 
of excellent reasons why the registration of firearms is a good 
idea. Let me address a few of these at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year an estimated 70,000 firearms are sold privately in 
Canada.  At the same time a large number are stolen, lost or 
otherwise unaccounted for, for firearms circulate within Canada. 
The registration of all guns, rifles and shotguns as well as 
handguns will contribute to a reduction in the grey and the black 
market sales of guns and provide protection for both sellers and 
purchasers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The licensing of firearms users is one of the central features 
of this legislation.  Only people who are responsible and have 
not been within the past five years convicted of Criminal Code 
offences will be eligible to use firearms.  If they have been 
convicted of an offence involving violence against a person, an 
offence involving criminal activity, the contravention of the 
Food and Drugs Act or the Narcotic Control Act or if they have 
been treated for a mental illness that involves violence or other 
behaviour involving violence, then they will be caught by the 
licensing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who sell guns should know to whom they are selling.  If 
the person buying the gun has a licence there is some reasonable 
assurance that the person is a law abiding, responsible person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, persons with licences will have completed and passed 
the Canadian firearm safety course and should have at least the 
basics in respect of the safe handling and use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, registration contributes to public safety by keeping 
guns away from people who should not have them.  Many of the 
lost, stolen or missing firearms eventually come to the attention 
of the police.  A system of registration can assist the police in 
returning these firearms to the rightful owners.  Registration 
can assist in the private property return to legitimate owners 
who have been the victims of crime.  Since licensed users will 
have shown not to have been involved in criminal activity and to 
be otherwise responsible, and since guns will be registered the 
police will have an invaluable tool to assist them in their fight 
against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents of the legislation contend that criminals will not 
register guns. We agree with that.  The legislation through the 
licensing and registration provisions, however, will assist the 
police by providing them with additional tools to charge 
criminals and to address organized crime issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registration system will provide police with an invaluable 
tool to trace firearms among former owners.  The tracing of these 
firearms is an invaluable tool for the investigation of crime. It 
helps to identify traffickers in illegal firearms.  It helps to 
identify illegitimate businesses and it provides through 
ballistic evidence a means to identify guns involved in 
previously unsolved crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration increases the likelihood that criminal offenders 
will be charged and convicted for their crime.  What 
parliamentarian would disagree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many guns come to Canada from the United States.  The attitude 
in the United States with respect to guns is significantly 
different from that of Canada.  It will come as no surprise that 
the illegal movement of firearms into Canada is a problem of 
considerable magnitude.  The registration system will register 
guns coming into and leaving Canada and the movement of those 
guns within the country.  Illegal shipments will be easier to 
stop.  Customs officers will be able to identify shipments 
against the registration database.  Any firearm imported into 
Canada for sale will be traceable through its history in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The reduction of firearms smuggling is an important way in which 
the Firearms Act and registration system can contribute to the 
reduction of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act is all about the regulation of potentially 
lethal commodities while at the same time permitting legitimate 
use by responsible owners.  The registration system created by 
the Firearms Act is an important part of Canada's effort to 
establish that our way of life and our values are the values of a 
peaceful and safe nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition contends that the Firearms Act confiscates 
private property.  We have said time and time again this 
legislation is about regulation, not confiscation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was referred by the province of Alberta, we know 
that. In particular, Alberta has asked its court of appeal if the 
licensing and registration provisions of the Firearms Act could 
be ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.  The outcome of this 
case will simply determine whether the constitutional powers of 
the Canadian government have been properly exercised in respect 
to this act. We will argue, as a matter of law, that it is in the 
order of peace, order and good government which are clear areas 
of federal jurisdiction.  We hope that is the case and it most 
likely will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residents of Waterloo—Wellington overwhelmingly support the 
government in this matter, as do most Canadians.  The net result 
of the government's proactive approach in this matter is that 
Canada will have a far more safe and secure country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Justice said that she had every confidence that 
firearms owners will participate in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent a lot of time in my riding during the month of August. I 
held seven town hall and coffee shop meetings.  From everybody I 
talked to I heard overwhelmingly that they are not going to 
participate in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal requirement to register one's firearms extends until 
2003.  The fact is there will be a federal election in the 
interim and the Reform Party, on forming the government in the 
next election, will repeal Bill C-68 immediately.  It is 
important for all Canadians to know and understand that so they 
can exercise their decision on voting day in the next election 
with wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I would like to point out is the rhetoric we 
hear from the Liberals on the other side of the House.  It is all 
couched in these little fancy terms they have.  They all talked 
about gun control and crime control.  However, what this bill 
will really do is nothing when it comes to addressing these 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' motive behind this legislation is their desire to 
see the elimination of all legal firearms ownership in Canada 
realized.  That is something which is very important for all 
Canadians to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his questions.  In making the statements he did, I think the 
member really showed the true colours of the Reform Party which 
is that it panders the special interests and for crass political 
reasons.  It is trying to do something here which is the opposite 
of what Canadians want.  I believe that came through loud and 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we on this side of the House are doing it in the best 
interests of all Canadians.  We are doing it for safety and 
security reasons for a society, a political culture that is 
distinct from the Americans and distinct from the kind of thing 
that the Reform Party would want to see in place.  We are doing 
the right thing for the benefits not only of this great country 
of ours but for each and every Canadian who lives in it.

since the minister did not answer my second question, I would 
like to put the same question to the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington and ask him what this $350 million tab he 
referred to is all about, as this seems to be how much it would 
cost to implement this firearm registration system. Is that 
right? I would really like to get an answer on this today. If 
this amount is accurate, then the public must be made aware of 
the costs involved. And how did they get to be so high? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know whether this high tab would eventually 
make the system impossible to implement and result in Quebeckers 
being told “Sorry, but unfortunately the system was too 
expensive to be implemented.” Is this a roundabout way to avoid 
enforcing the legislation?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to put a price tag on safety and security 
for the country.  I know Canadians want us to proceed in a manner 
that is most efficient and appropriate to ensure a safe and 
secure country for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there will be a price to pay for that but it is an 
important underpinning of the very values and institutions that 
define us as Canadians and in my view unite us as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are unlike opponents who would have us revert to some sort of 
American style in terms of shooting it out at high noon and all 
kinds of other outrageous and outlandish things, especially the 
Reform Party which should know better than to cosy up to those 
National Rifle Association types and others.  Those members above 
all should know better but they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is we on the government side know we must proceed in a 
manner that is in keeping with our historic and political culture 
and our historic and political values.  I am proud that we are 
able as a government to do precisely that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the constituents of Souris—Moose Mountain, very similar 
to those of Cypress Hills—Grasslands, would find it almost 
sinful if their member did not speak on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to inform the members opposite that I have yet to receive 
one letter or phone call in the last 16 months in favour of Bill 
C-68, not one.  But I have received hundreds of letters and 
hundreds of petitions in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resent very much government members, including the Minister of 
Justice, speaking on this bill and referring to those who oppose 
this bill as somewhat misaligned in thought.  There are thousands 
of people outside who have come from across Canada, some here 
from Yukon, who have paid out of their own pockets to protest and 
they are not weak in the head.  They know exactly why they are 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish hon. members opposite would quit using statistics like 
82% of this or 80% of that.  How come this terrible 
misinformation wrongly or rightly got into the justice committee 
which completely distorted the number of guns involved?  There is 
no remorse at all, none whatsoever from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a Liberal by the name of Mr. Trudeau who took a 
political gamble that he would institute a national energy 
policy. Note the word national.  But the word national would only 
affect western Canada.  So they weighed it up and introduced the 
national energy policy and to this day western Canada has never 
forgiven the party for doing just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the history behind Bill C-68.  Let us get the true 
history behind Bill C-68.  The former Conservative government had 
everything in place with the previous bill but crime was on the 
rage in Montreal and Toronto and so the government said once 
again it will do like the Liberals in the past, it will take a 
chance and bring in a national bill even though it knew it would 
isolate western Canada and certain parts. It did just that and it 
certainly paid off politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons why this government lost most of its western 
support was its complete disdain for western Canada.  There is no 
remorse yet with the Liberals for the national energy policy and 
there is still no remorse for what they are doing to the law 
abiding people in western Canada with this bill. 
Where do they get the idea that the registration of guns will 
protect me?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Read the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  The legislation says that there will be a 
registration of all guns.  This information could fall into the 
hands of the wrong people who would  say “There is a good house 
to hit.  They have three long guns in that house”.  They cannot 
prove what they are saying and they know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday afternoon in question period the former parliamentary 
secretary to the minister in charge of the wheat board asked a 
ridiculous question about North Dakota farmers wanting to sell 
wheat to the Canadian Wheat Board.  American farmers said on 
television last night, that they were getting $2.75 U.S. but if 
they sold it in Canada they would only get $1.40 U.S.  That shows 
how ridiculous the question was.  They make fun of people in 
different areas and they delight in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not one law for all people.  It is not a universal 
bill.  The minister has declared that the bill will be flexible 
in its application.  That in itself is a very dangerous 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they mean that it will be flexible in its application? 
We know what it means.  The people in western Canada know what it 
means, but the rest of Canada does not seem to know what it 
means.  It means that some people will be required to register 
their long guns and some people will not.  Yet the government 
supports the bill and says it will be flexible in its 
application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have take the time to talk to the police in my constituency 
who have basically said no way.  They want no part of it 
whatsoever.  They have made it abundantly clear that they want 
nothing to do with it because they know certain people within 
their district will be exempt from registering their guns.  It is 
not a national registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on the government.  It deliberately harasses honest 
law-abiding citizens to register their guns but at its discretion 
it leaves whole blocks of people who do not have to register 
their guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation says that it is enabling legislation.  That 
means the government, not the legislature, not this body, not 
elected officials, will have the right to change the bill at any 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is asking us to support the bill.  The Minister 
of Justice says that it is a done deal, that the legislation will 
go forward, that it will be law for all but will be flexible.  In 
other words it is not law for all and it can be changed at any 
time.  All it has to do is sit before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can any person elected to the House who is totally in favour 
of the gun bill be in favour of making it selective legislation 
where only certain people will be required to register?  How will 
that prevent crime?  It just does not add up.  The people in 
western Canada and the people in my constituency know this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked in the justice committee if they 
could guarantee that every owner of every long gun would have 
to register their guns? 
Do members know what the response was?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  There was no answer.  How could the 
government in committee change legislation that we have been 
discussing without it even coming to the House?  It is called 
enabling legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I want to make clear that they can talk all they like 
about figures, fancy surveys and so on, but there is more 
opposition from every corner of Canada to Bill C-68 than there 
has ever been.  Opposition from people who are aware of the bill 
is growing, even from those who do not own guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not have the courage to make it universal.  They do not have 
the courage to bring it back if they want to change the 
legislation.  Having said that, they should not have had the 
courage to bring the bill before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, never 
in my entire life have I heard so much nonsense coming from the 
opposition party.  It is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation was introduced by the House that party 
indicated it opposed the bill but did not put anything on the 
table to say how to improve it or the things they would like to 
see in the bill.  The bill has gone through all stages.  That 
party had all the time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I think the Chair is 
hearing words that should not be uttered in the Chamber. I know 
hon. members would want to refrain from any unparliamentary 
language in the course of the debate even if it is from their 
seats.  I hope I did not hear what I thought I heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure you heard what you 
heard.  Frankly it is unbecoming of the official opposition but 
it is an indication of the fact that it is bankrupt when it comes 
to ideas and innovations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful for them to be so opportunistic as to exploit 
public sentiment and to time, even though the bill has passed the 
House, their motion to coincide with a special interest group 
yapping outside on Parliament Hill without the true understanding 
of what the government is trying to do when it comes to public 
safety.  They should listen to their own constituents who have 
told them over and over again that they support the bill the 
government has proposed, Bill C-68, because it controls crime in 
society.  This is community safety legislation which is well 
thought out and well planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has spent a lot of time and energy travelling 
around the country from coast to coast consulting the people, 
including special interest groups, the Reform Party, and every 
individual organization that had an opinion to express to the 
government.  The government has given them that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation balances the interests of everyone.  It is 
balanced legislation and, by the way, it is not before the House. 
It has been passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish colleagues in the Reform Party would wake up, smell the 
coffee and come up with something that is relevant to the people 
of Canada, such as how the government has dealt with the economic 
situation, community safety, health care and educational issues. 
The government is handling these issues extremely well, so the 
Reform Party is trying to dig up issues that were before the 
House months ago and are not before the House now.  The only 
reason for this is that some special interest groups are out 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is trying to exploit the sentiments of 
Canadians without having any consideration for the victims and 
their families who wanted to see that party stand and be counted 
rather than continue to hear this and that without really 
focusing on the overall interest of Canadians who have told us 
over and over again that they support what the government has put 
before them when it comes to the crime control bill. 
Let the member stand to endorse what the government has done on 
this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, how dare the hon. member 
refer to the rural people of Souris—Moose Mountain as a special 
interest group.  Shame on him.  How dare he refer to the police 
associations out there in protest as special interest groups. How 
dare he refer to the Reform Party applying accountability for the 
position it holds by taking the bill back to the people and 
getting their opinion on it.  How dare he make mockery of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess my speech has intrinsically raised some guilt in the 
hon. person.  My people are not special interest people.  They 
are real people.  They are not ignorant people. They are very 
clever people.  The group out there has every right to protest. 
He would like to say that they are a special interest group, 
without intelligence, and they have no right.  Shame on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the member say that Reform sat idly by and did nothing 
when it brought in not a 150 amendments but 200 amendments to the 
bill.  Shame on you for making that statement. You certainly are 
totally out— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain intended to address his remarks through 
the Chair. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as we are speaking, there are some 20,000 protesters in front of 
Parliament, including about 1,000 Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are opposed to the registration of hunting weapons 
but, more importantly, they are opposed to searches without 
warrant and to the confiscation of private property without 
compensation. These people are farmers, lumberjacks, trappers, 
and so on. They are people who live in the country, people whom 
the hon. member does not like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But not all of them are from the north. There are also urban 
dwellers who realize that Bill C-68 is a threat to everyone. 
These people believe in democracy and in civil rights. 
They fully understand the risk involved in giving the government 
the power to send police officers to our homes for the most 
trivial reasons, and they are getting worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these people are not represented by any Quebec 
member. For example, three years ago, a coalition of seven 
Quebec groups representing several hundreds of thousands of 
people opposed to Bill C-68 sought the support of Liberal, 
Conservative and Bloc members, but was turned down. In the end, 
it was a Reform member who became the spokesperson for these 
Quebeckers before the Standing Committee on Justice, in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 is based on unfounded biases, on the fallacious 
arguments of some bureaucrats, and on mass hysteria. This is a 
pretty weak basis for an act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad fact that only a small minority of Canadians have an 
inkling of what Bill C-68 contains.  This is not surprising when 
one considers its length of 137 pages and its complexity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's reluctance to release copies for public 
distribution is also a factor.  I have had to have my own copies 
printed for interested constituents. The justice department's 
reluctance to let the public see this awful document is supposed 
to be an economy measure but there is no lack of funding for 
distribution of departmental propaganda or puff pieces for the 
Canadian firearms centre.  My constituency office is full of that 
stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions for arbitrary infringements or abrogations of 
civil rights and liberties which date back to 1689 have nothing 
to do with crime control and everything to do with the regulation 
of property which is a matter of provincial jurisdiction.  Four 
provinces, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and two 
territories have tested the legitimacy of Bill C-68 in court and 
are still waiting after a whole year for a decision. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly enough, Quebec, the champion of provincial rights, remains 
on the sideline. The PQ government refuses to defend Quebec's 
right to conduct its own business. This is strange. Perhaps the 
members sitting to my left could explain this situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case anyone here has forgotten what the House passed in June 
1995 and for the benefit of new Liberal backbenchers who probably 
have not read the bill, I wish to draw attention to some of the 
most noxious bits.  I hope that new members will note the section 
numbers so that they can look it up themselves in case they do 
not believe me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 102.  Police will be able to search premises without 
warrants on the flimsiest pretext.  They will be empowered to 
open any container, require any person to produce records, enter 
any computer system and confiscate firearms or any other thing. 
These things can be done without any evidence that a crime has 
been, is being, or will be committed.  Oh Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 103.  A custodian of premises being searched must 
co-operate with the inspectors or risk being charged under 
section 111 with an indictable offence carrying a penalty of up 
to two years in prison.  In other words self-incrimination is now 
a requirement under Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 104.  A warrant may be obtained to search a private home 
if an inspector believes on reasonable grounds, whatever that 
means, that the home contains a prohibited firearm or more than 
10 other firearms and that entry is necessary for the enforcement 
of the act or the regulations and that there are reasonable 
grounds for believing that entry will be refused.  Catch 22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 117 provides the Minister of Justice with almost 
unlimited power to regulate firearms by order in council. Under 
section 108 those orders in council will become law within 30 
days of being laid before parliament regardless of whether or not 
they are approved by parliament or even debated. Under section 
119 even that slight bow to parliamentary democracy may be 
avoided if in the opinion of the minister these are immaterial, 
insubstantial or urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago the former justice minister described his dream 
of a Canada where only police and the military would possess 
arms.  During debates in the House he altered his position 
perhaps because it dawned on him that he had succinctly described 
a police state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, thanks to events at last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, 
we know that the government has extended those police and 
military privileges to armed foreign thugs on Canadian soil.  Was 
this indicative of philosophical kinship, a shared contempt for 
those damn peasants who do not know their place, who are not 
capable of making decisions and who do not share the prime 
ministerial vision of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several times quoted James Madison in the House with 
regard to the loss of freedom.  I shall close by doing it one 
more time.  “There are more instances of the abridgements of 
freedom of people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in 
power than by violent and sudden usurpations.”  Words to live 
by.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
guess I should start by congratulating the gentleman across.  I 
am quite surprised to hear that he is the self-appointed voice of 
Quebec now.  That was quite amusing. I have a couple of questions 
for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, for my interest, I am wondering if he might 
clarify what he considers a special interest group.  I have heard 
some of the hon. members say you cannot classify this as a 
special interest group, people in my riding.  I am curious if he 
brought the entire population of his riding or a group of 
citizens within his riding that are interested in one specific 
topic, gun registration. I would ask what his definition of 
special interest group is because he certainly seems to be 
catering to them in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is one on domestic violence and the fact of 
gun registration and is it appropriate. Domestic violence knows 
no borders.  It happens in rural Canada.  It happens in rural 
Alberta.  It happens in rural Simcoe—Grey. And it certainly 
takes place in many urban communities throughout this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not think that the police have a right to 
know when they are going to that most unpleasant of calls where 
there is nothing but emotion in play, whether or not there are 
firearms in the residence?  Do they have that right to know? If 
there is a situation that is taking place where a woman is being 
abused and assaulted and there is a potential that there are 
weapons, long rifles upstairs, downstairs, somewhere in that 
house, should the police not have the right to know before they 
walk in that door? Of course, they govern themselves accordingly, 
but they still should have the right and it could save lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that the police should have the 
right to know whether or not there are weapons in the house?  If 
there are weapons that can kill people, should the police have a 
right to know they are in there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will start at the top. 
The hon. member asked so many questions that I have already 
forgotten the first couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question of knowing whether or not there are firearms in 
the house is ridiculous.  I have discussed this with a lot of 
frontline police officers.  I dare say the hon. member has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Once again speaking on my behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  You bet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The object of this supposedly is to make it safe for police. Any 
police officer who is not demented is going to approach a house 
with domestic violence in progress as though there were arms in 
that house.  If he does not, he will probably end up dead at some 
point.  They do not need and they will not rely upon a computer 
record to tell them they should be careful, that there are arms 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police officers treat every domestic incident as a 
potentially violent situation.  So this is just nonsense that is 
being discussed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to special interest groups, there is a very clear 
definition of special interest groups.  Special interest groups 
are these bloodsucking institutions that get federal funding.  I 
have not heard of those people out front, those ordinary real 
Canadians whose freedoms are being endangered by these 
cryptofascists, who are being abused, who are being threatened, 
tell me that they are getting federal funding.  If they are 
getting federal funding, I would like to see the cancelled 
cheques. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member, a colleague of mine in the 
Reform Party, if he sees any parallels between this depriving of 
civil liberties and freedom of speech in this obnoxious gun 
control bill and the APEC summit and some of the depriving of 
rights that took place there on that occasion.

to defend themselves against a bunch of Canadian farmers. If the

listened with great interest to the speech of my colleague from 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands. I must, by the way, congratulate him 
for speaking in French.  I think it shows much progress and I 
congratulate him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting, because he spoke at length about Quebec.  I 
represent a riding in that province.  I have lived there for 
many years and should therefore know what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to an Angus Reid poll done in May 1995, 79% of 
Quebeckers supported Bill C-68.  Quebec's own Minister of Justice 
at the time, Paul Bégin, officially backed the bill. 
A few months earlier, in November 1994, a Gallup poll had 
revealed that nine out of ten Quebeckers, or 90% of Quebec's 
population, were in favour of registering all firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a fact of life in Quebec since 1972, because 
provincial legislation requires that all firearms be registered 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 is a bill of which we on the government side are very 
proud.  It represents the view of the vast majority of 
Canadians.  It is a bill that was democratically and 
legitimately passed in this Parliament by a government majority. 
Today, the bill is law in Canada.  To reopen this debate, as the 
Reform Party wants to do today, in league with the National 
Firearms Association, brings to mind what is going on in the 
United States. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right wing and the extreme right wing have been sleeping 
with the National Rifle Association for ever and a day.  No 
matter what the congress of the United States wants to do to

majority view of the great number of Americans that want some 
control over firearms, the right wing has managed in the United 
States to defeat it because of the tremendous lobbying power of 
the National Rifle Association.

and we feel we do it well.  We have been elected by a majority of 
Canadians to express their views. Their views on gun control 
legislation have been extremely clear.  In fact the police chiefs 
across the land have pointed out as shown in a study published by 
the Ottawa </I>Citizen<I> on August 28, 1997 that 52% of guns 
found at crime scenes in Canada are shotguns or rifles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know registration is not very pleasant. We have to register 
our boats.  I register my boat every year.  It is something I 
would like to avoid if I could but I do it.  If they made a law 
tomorrow to make licensing of people handling motorboats 
compulsory, I would be for it.  It would be an inconvenience but 
if it can save people from getting hurt or from being killed then 
it is certainly a step forward despite the inconvenience. I 
register my car every year and it is not pleasant.  I have to 
send a cheque to get the sticker. We all do.  The difference 
between cars, boats and guns is that guns maim and kill. 
The experience in Canada is that guns kill a lot of people, as 
they do everywhere in the world.

it will cost the government and the taxpayer to register a gun.

one life, then registration would be worth it.  We should not be

focussed on the broad issue of registering firearms, looking at 
all the ridiculous arguments that have been raised by opponents 
of Bill C-68.  They said it will cost a fortune, and so forth, 
when registration will, in fact, be a one-time event, costing 
only a few dollars annually, just like a driving licence, just 
like licensing our car or boat costs a few dollars.

their guns because of the force of the NRA and the right wing.

registration of firearms will serve the best interests for the 
safety of Canadians.  It will also save human lives, which have 
no price.

Mr. Speaker, just so we can bring some truth and honesty to this 
debate, the question that was asked on the Liberal poll was: 
“Would you support gun control considering it would cut crime 
and save lives?”  What Canadian would not vote yes for a 
question like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this members knows, because he was here in the last 
parliament when the former minister of justice brought in the 
bill, day after day after the bill was introduced Reform Party 
members asked the minister and his cohorts to give us one 
historical piece of evidence, one substantive fact or one honest 
description of how Bill C-68 would cut crime in this country and 
we would vote for it.  All through that debate the minister could 
not comply with that request.  His parliamentary secretary could 
not comply with that request.  Not one Liberal on that side could 
tell us how Bill C-68 would cut crime and save lives in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have things changed?  Has the former minister of justice changed 
his mind about it?  We cannot see any evidence and we are still 
asking that of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is so simplistic 
it is sad.  I did not decide for myself how it was going to save 
lives.  I am not smart enough to know that.  It is not my field. 
I am relying on the police chiefs in my riding who I have spoken 
to.  I am relying on the people in my riding who control justice: 
the judges, the magistrates, the people who are involved with 
crime.  These people are overwhelmingly in favour of gun control 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also relying on the example of other countries.  I have 
cited a list of countries as long as my arm that insist on 
registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Just answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  This is typical of what is going on 
today:  big loudmouths who scream, shout and put out simplistic 
notions but ignore what is going on around them the world.  They 
ignore what the police chiefs, the magistrates, the judges and 
the great majority of Canadians are saying poll after poll after 
poll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the polls, about 75% of Canadians do not want any 
of the Reform Party's notion that freedom means carrying guns 
that are not registered and not licensed.  Canadians at large are 
saying loud and clear that they want guns to be registered and 
gun owners to be licensed.  That is what we have expressed here 
as the representatives of the majority of Canadians who elected 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a democratic law, passed by a democratic government.  If 
the Reform Party does not want to abide by it, too bad. Canadians 
will judge them accordingly.

from my colleague from Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, whether according 
to his information, he can confirm the rumours about the costs 
of this new firearm registration program, forecast to be in the 
order of $80 million, now having risen to $350 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, is this rumour correct, and second, if it is, how

costs.  All that is still being put into place.  All we know is 
that costs have been set for permit charges, and for 
registration charges.  We do not know the exact cost of 
processing and of the operation as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my Liberal colleague who spoke before me pointed out, 
however, the key element in all this is surely the cost of human

Speaker, one thing that I have noticed here today is that the 
opponents of this legislation seem to distort, misrepresent and 
deny the benefits of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at and start to think about what this legislation is 
going to do for the average Canadian, I think it proposes safe 
streets, a confidence that someone can live in a community 
without a threat, and many, many things that we should discuss 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to look at the positive aspects of this 
legislation.  The law imposes tough criminal penalties.  They say 
“Don't touch the criminal”.  That is absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even our opponents across the way have to admit that this 
legislation does a great deal to impose penalties on people who 
misuse guns in this community.  The minimum penalty of four 
years, in many cases, is a very strong deterrent to those people 
who would misuse guns in the commission of a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts, by the way, have totally supported this legislation 
up to this day.  The statute is about lethal instruments, 
articles designed for the most part to kill.  This legislation is 
not about confiscation.  Let us be very clear about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recognizes that the vast majority of firearm owners and users 
are responsible, prudent people.  The practices which are 
embodied in the statutes reflect the prudent practices of 
responsible people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statute strives to encourage a culture that is safe for 
Canadians, a culture that is well trained in activities and 
practices for responsible gun owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legitimate practices of those responsible gun owners can 
continue under this statute.  Hunters can continue to hunt. 
Target shooters can continue to target shoot.  Buyers and sellers 
can continue activities that they have done for years.  Museums 
can continue to display the weapons that are displayed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent and purpose of some is incompatible though.  There 
are some uses of guns in this country that are not for sporting, 
that are not for the business uses that we have in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, several military assault weapons have been banned. 
Fully automatic rifles have no legitimate purpose in this 
country.  Most handguns are treated with particular concern due 
to their lethal nature and the fact that they can be concealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have taken strong measures to deal with such firearms, 
the statute is focused on respecting the legitimate interests of 
people and good gun owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our opponents advocate a situation respecting firearms 
such as that which exists in the United States.  That is what I 
have heard opposite pretty well all day today.  It is worth 
noting that there are 30 times more firearms in the United States 
than there are in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A much higher proportion of homicides in the United States 
involve firearms.  On average, 65% of homicides in the United 
States involve firearms as opposed to 33% in Canada.  Do members 
realize that?  There are double the number of homicides in the 
United States than there are in Canada and those members are 
telling us to look at that country.  That is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study for the Centre for Disease Control examined the cause of 
death among children in 26 developed countries and found that 86% 
of firearm related deaths occurred in the United States.  In the 
United States, 86% of deaths among children involved firearms. 
That means there are too many guns for children to access. 
That means we have to lock these guns up.  That means we cannot 
have children exposed to them.  Recent news events describing 
schoolyard shootings speak for themselves.  The United States 
environment respecting guns does not give a better vision that 
Canadians want to see.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act addresses only crucial social situations that 
are created by domestic violence.  Required firearms licensing 
and screening of gun owners will result in specific checking of 
probation orders, prohibition to orders before licences are 
granted. Licences will have to be renewed every five years.  So 
there will be an examination of violence on a regular basis. For 
those who wish to acquire new firearms, the applicants must 
contact their former spouses or someone involved with them so 
that if there is a problem they will be able to bring that 
testimony forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fully implemented all firearms owners will be licensed. 
They will have taken a course emphasizing safety and safe 
handling of guns.  The guns will be registered.  This will assist 
police in their investigations.  It will encourage owners of 
stores and guns to make sure sales are appropriate.  It will 
assist the recovery of lost or stolen firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration together with licensing and other aspects of 
firearms is aimed at facilitating a continued enjoyment of sport 
in Canada by responsible safe practices. This will encourage the 
continuation of free movement of Canadian citizens within a 
culture that recognizes safety and responsibility.  The Firearms 
Act embraces all these as positive effective contributors to all 
aspects of Canadian life.  The Firearms Act has the support of a 
large majority of Canadians.  It is a reflection of a country of 
peaceful communities and its fairness will make them much better 
places to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
listening to the comments of the hon. member opposite is a 
revelation of a thought process I do not quite comprehend and do 
not pretend to understand.  I thought I was a fairly clear, 
reasonably thinking person.  There are a number of discrepancies 
in what the hon. member is saying.  I would like to question him 
on a couple of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use an example.  This morning on the Internet I found 
some information put out by the government.  It is propaganda on 
Bill C-68.  One of the items is 10 reasons for the registration 
of all guns.  We could go through the argument point by point but 
we would be wasting a lot of valuable time although they deserve 
to be looked at.  One of the last points is less paperwork. I 
want to ask the hon. member about that issue. Somehow this is 
going to put more policeman in service on the streets because we 
will have less paperwork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the application forms for this law that is going to 
bring less paperwork, make our streets safer, give us more 
policemen actually on the beat in our communities.  It starts 
with 669 and goes up to 774.  These are the forms that are 
available for registering guns.

acquiring firearms and/or crossbows, these are for individuals;

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know from the member opposite, after he sits there and 
gives his head a shake, how we are cutting paper and putting more 
people on the street.  Come on now.  I would like the hon. member 
to explain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to think you would 
agree with me how incredible it is that a member can stand for 
four minutes and describe all the different forms that we have 
after a speech on safety in the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we start looking at a comparison between the United States 
and Canada on safety of our streets and we think about what the 
average Canadian wants and needs for safe communities, the only 
question he can come to is that we have 100 forms here and we may 
have to fill them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me it is incredible that is the mentality driving the debate. 
To me the critical issue is safety.  It is lives.  It is good 
community spirit.  It is making sure that the use of those 
firearms by Canadians is still allowed.  I would say that once 
all the guns are registered, once all the forms are filled, once 
we get that and it is recorded in today's society, we do have the 
means by which to reduce paperwork dramatically.  Everyone knows 
paperwork can be reduced dramatically if it is organized and 
presented properly.  That is exactly what those forms are doing. 
Once it is done, once it is in the registry, once we have all the 
paperwork done then the continuation is very reasonable and can 
be carried out in a good, appropriate way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what we have come here today to discuss and debate is a 
matter of utmost importance.  That goes without saying.  I have 
heard comments in here in the last few minutes about whether this 
is supported, safety and these various issues that come up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to support, I would like the members in the House, 
if they have not already done so, to take a few minutes and step 
outside and look at the Canadians standing out there, average 
Canadians.  They are not people who are looking to break the law. 
These are average Canadians who have come here en masse with one 
of the biggest demonstrations certainly that has been seen here 
for a long time, if not ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every one of those people out there I can assure members 
that there are hundreds and possibly thousands represented by 
each one of those. The question of support for this bill, for the 
abolition of the Firearms Act, is represented by these people, 
and let us just talk about additional support for abolition of 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met the other day with the minister of justice in Manitoba, 
Mr. Vic Toews.  If he does not represent one million Manitobans 
on this issue, I will eat my shirt.

Manitoba, Alberta, Ontario, the Northwest Territories and the 
aboriginal people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How many more do the Reform Party have to identify as Canadians 
who are against the Firearms Act to convince the members opposite 
that they are out to lunch on their exaggerated numbers they 
claim support this bill?  As referenced in the court case which 
happened in Edmonton, the justice department, on behalf of the 
Liberal government, took the RCMP statistics and built them up to 
a point where they were plain untrue.  There was a lot of 
correction over that.  They finally got the RCMP to admit that 
the figures had been misinterpreted or something. That is not 
true.  They were outright changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of safety is one that has been debated here for 
some time.  I will go back to my experience in life as a police 
officer.  The question of safety with firearms was already 
addressed fully before the Firearms Act came into place.  There 
was safe storage.  There were firearm training programs.  I was 
an instructor at one time.  There was registration of handguns. 
The registration was inaccurate but it was there.  I never seized 
any registered guns from the criminals I arrested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to safety in family disputes, you did not know 
whether there was going to be a firearm in the house or whether 
the fellow or wife was previously known to have firearms.  The 
computer systems the RCMP and the Ontario provincial police had 
already had the capability of entering and tracking these people 
as dangerous.  There were already provisions for serial numbers 
of stolen firearms to be entered.  Residents and people who were 
known to be active criminals or who were known to be suspects 
capable of violence were entered.  The computer systems were 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that this is going to increase safety it wrong. I 
hesitate to use these words, but the hidden agenda of this 
government is clearly to make up enough rules that the average 
law abiding Canadian is going to break some of those rules either 
in transferring a firearm or registering it wrongly.  The 
government can then take that act and say they have made a 
mistake.  From then on they will be prohibited from owning a 
firearm.  The ultimate goal would be to remove as many or all 
guns from legitimate law abiding Canadians.  That will leave the 
criminal with the guns. There is one other group of people who 
are going to have guns in this country, the military and the 
police.  They have them now and it is a good thing they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is proceeding along the road of arming more of 
its departments.  The question I ask is will this hidden agenda 
ultimately end up with only the government and the criminals 
owning guns and the average Canadian having nothing. To back that 
statement up, the government is arming Canada Customs. The 
conservation officers are being armed. There are all kinds of 
these things happening.  It all translates into more government 
control.

harsher.  These things were all in place.  It is frustrating to 
know that the only impact of the act put in place by the 
government will be an increase in costs for average Canadians to 
own firearms.  People who require firearms like me and the rest 
of the farmers and hunters in the country will have increased 
costs.  It will also cause people to quit a hobby they enjoyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate an experience I had the other day.  I was 
attending a clay shoot which involves aiming at little clay 
targets with shotguns.  There were about 60 to 70 people there 
from my riding.  It was a beautiful sunny day.  We had a nice 
time.  I am sure we were not hurting anyone.  I did not see any 
criminals.  There were none.  We are talking about support for 
this type of legislation.  The talk that day was that the 
legislation would add costs for firearms and ammunition to a 
hobby that already had costs built into it.

spending money which helps the economy.  More than that, what is 
irking a lot of us is that we have the right to enjoy ourselves. 
If we are doing it in a lawful manner, why should the government 
put hindrances and expenses on us which are not needed and will 
do no good other than for its belief that Canadians should not 
own firearms and that only governments and foreign powers that 
come to the country with their security guards should be the ones 
to have firearms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand by my right as a Canadian to own a firearm without 
harassment from my government.  I intend to fight for that.  I 
support the motion entirely and I invite every member, 
particularly those on the Liberal side who know what their 
constituents want, to vote for the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was quite amazed to listen to the member's comments. I was 
wondering if some of the people in the House and some of the 
people watching today were actually listened to what he is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is fearmongering.  He is promoting fear in 
Canada.  He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.  He is 
suggesting that the Liberal government is trying to create a 
police state.  Perhaps the hon. member should visit a police 
state.  He should be absolute ashamed of himself.  Enough of the 
fearmongering and enough of the false statistics.  He should 
simply makes some calculated comments without— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member by his comment 
has provoked something in the House, but it is very hard for the 
Chair to hear and I do need to hear what hon. members on all 
sides are saying.  I would appreciate some order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for quieting 
them down.  They get to be quite a violent lot some times.  My 
point was simply to suggest that the Liberal government is trying 
to create a police state is absolutely false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that he was a past police officer and 
did not see any benefit in the legislation.   Let me give him an 
example.  What would he think if he were attending a domestic 
violence call in a municipality of 15,000 people where he did not 
know everybody? I am sure the hon. member accepts the fact that 
domestic violence knows no bounds, not just urban but rural.  If 
he had to attend a domestic violence call and there was no 
criminal record of the people living at that address, does he not 
think it might be good use of information, that it might assist 
him in that call if he knew there were guns there? 
Does he not think that maybe that information might be pertinent 
as to how the officer is to conduct himself or herself?  I ask 
that question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should also keep in mind if he walks in and 
assumes that there are guns there—I am talking about long 
guns—and quells this domestic situation and says:  “Turn over 
your guns.  We are here to take your guns”.  Should he take the 
person's word that there is only one or two guns, or should he 
not have access to knowing?  Is it not fair to say that police 
officers should have access to knowing there are long arms in 
there?  Perhaps, if the member would take off his blinders, he 
could help officers to eliminate some domestic violence 
situations that turn into tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be useful information to an officer responding to a 
call if he were provided in advance with the fact that there were 
long arms in there which could potentially be used in a domestic 
violence situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, no.  When officers 
attend these domestic disputes or any other allegation of any 
kind of criminal activity, they go in there knowing that it is a 
volatile situation.  The very facts of the situation cannot be 
know beforehand either by some computer, if it is accurate, or by 
the information they receive.  In that area the hon. member is 
listening simply to chiefs of police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke also of fearmongering.  Let us talk about 
fearmongering.  He can take a look at the city police in Winnipeg 
and at the courts.  In the newspapers the other day there was an 
article about a gang rape of a 15 year old girl by four bikers. 
This young girl refused to testify in court.  She was terrified 
of the criminal and refused to testify, and the police could not 
protect her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fearmongering is on the side of those who promote gun 
registration.  The moneys being spent on firearm registration 
should be spent on working with victims of crimes and fighting 
the biker gangs.  There is nothing being spent on biker gangs, 
and $150 million would help.  Fearmongering is on the side of the 
Liberal government.  It is not on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Resuming debate with the hon. member 
for Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order please.  I know there is a lot 
of enthusiasm for the hon. member for Wild Rose, but I also know 
that hon. members would want to hear his remarks.  I would hope 
that there would be some quiet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Not to worry, Mr. 
Speaker, I was a school teacher for 30 years and have put up with 
this nonsense for a lot longer than this.  The only thing is the 
children are a little older now and ought to know better; but 
they do not have any brains so it does not make any difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make an exception.  The gun registration under Bill C-68 
is to cost $200 million.  Let us say that is the case.  We have 
not been told once how it will save a life.  We asked the 
Liberals, lots of times, to please show us how it would save a 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make a second exception. 
Probably two of the biggest killers we have in the country are 
breast cancer and prostate cancer.  If we had $200 million and it 
had to go to one or the other, how many Liberals would pick gun 
registration over cancer research?  I will tell the House how 
many would pick gun registration:  all of them because they 
listen to the dictators and they do what they are told to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals billed legislation that has almost a hundred orders 
in council, the old thing they used to put into legislation 
during wars and real serious activities to protect our land; 
throughout the War Measures Act there were orders in council. 
This legislation has in it nearly a hundred times where one 
person in the House, one individual on that frontline can decide 
whether or not a certain firearm should be confiscated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the power that exists under the bill.  That is the kind 
of power to which any normal Canadian taxpayer objects.  That is 
the kind of power they have in all these countries that have 
failed a hundred times under dictatorial power.  When will 
members on that side of the House wake up and smell the coffee? I 
heard a member over there a while ago saying “smell the 
coffee”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on that side of the House are a bunch of sheep.  They do 
what they are told because they believe strongly in the will of 
the party and not the will of the people.  That is what they 
believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  In a week or two they will be reading 
an article in the </I>Western Producer<I> written by Larry Fillo 
describing the absurdity of the bill.  On July 10, 1998, Lorraine 
Dewetter was informed by two police officers of the death of her 
husband.  Mr. Dewetter apparently died after a heart attack when 
his vehicle was stuck in a field.  The RCMP, however, did more 
than just deliver the unfortunate news of Mr. Dewetter's passing. 
While in the Dewetter home informing his wife of his death the 
RCMP confiscated a .22 calibre rifle and a 12-guage pump action 
shotgun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the pickup that was stuck there was a .410 shotgun which a 
lot of farmers carry around with them.  The RCMP seized a legal 
.410 shotgun from the pickup, but when they went to inform his 
wife that he had died in the field they confiscated all the guns 
in the house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what comes about with this kind of legislation: search 
and seizure without any particular reason.  It contains 
unreasonable search and seizure regulations.  It is unreasonable 
to do that.  It is as simple as that.  It confiscates property. 
It did in this case.  Members can read about it in the </I>Western 
Producer<I> in two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  After question period the hon. member for

today, opponents of gun control are demonstrating on Parliament 
Hill.  A number of speakers will be making unfair demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to state that, with firearm control legislation, the 
government is responding to the call of Canadians, the parents of 
child victims of crimes or accidents involving firearms in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to continue to work along with these Canadians, who 
have called for gun control legislation in hopes of reducing the 
crime rate in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not allow itself to be intimidated by 
statements from the other side of the floor, or from 
demonstrators on the Hill. A large majority of Canadians support 
gun control. The debate is closed.  The Canadian firearms control 
program will come into effect December 1.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
September 2, 1999 the citizens of Canada will pause and remember 
the tragic crash of Swissair flight 111.  Many citizens of the 
south shore of Nova Scotia are living today with the aftermath of 
that disaster.  The communities on the Aspotogen Peninsula and 
Tancook Island are in the midst of the ongoing cleanup effort 
that is literally on their doorsteps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishers from those communities were among the first to respond. 
They, like their forebears, are no strangers to disasters at sea. 
They left their homes in the dark of night to assist in the 
desperate search for survivors.  Today there are still hundreds 
of men and women involved in the cleanup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sincere effort made by all the volunteers and professionals 
who have assisted and continue to assist in this tragic accident 
is a testimony to the strength of Canadian character and the true 
fibre of the men and women of the south shore of Nova Scotia.

Hill, I would like to remind this House that the purpose of our 
government's Firearms Act is to help ensure Canadians continue to 
live in a safe society.  When I look at our neighbours to the 
south, I am shocked to see the gun lobby fight simple protective 
measures like trigger locks and safe firearms storage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am horrified every time I hear about a child taking firearms 
to school and using them with deadly consequences on innocent 
schoolmates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and other opponents of Canada's new Firearms 
Act would have us believe that firearms regulation is just one 
step on a slippery slope.  Nothing could be further from the 
truth.  I want to assure law-abiding gun owners that they have 
nothing to fear from the Minister of Justice or this government. 
Our commitment is to make sure that gun control is implemented in 
the most efficient way possible.

Rather than labelling other people, the Prime Minister should be

He was involved in organizing the repression of a peaceful

only be resolved by the Prime Minister himself coming clean on

<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

who came to Canada.  The RCMP was responsible for keeping order 
so that the leaders visiting Canada could be safe.  This is done 
for every meeting of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My role was to be chairman of the APEC meeting on behalf of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

protesters even if they were not a security risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP memos say things like “PM's specific wish” or “PM wants 
the protesters out”.  That PM was not me and it was not the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

seen many people in departments speaking on behalf of their

this Prime Minister seems to have his fingerprints all over this.

want on this whole issue because they are disgusted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the Prime Minister resorts to blaming a

yesterday she did not want us to have people with guns registered 
in Canada coming from abroad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
further we delve into “peppergate”, the more we realize that the 
real responsibility for suppressing anti-Suharto demonstrators 
lies not with the RCMP but with the Canadian government, which 
was consumed with reassuring the dictator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, we learned that the RCMP liaison officer was told to 
do everything necessary to meet Suharto's demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister admit that the testimony by officer 
Peter Montague confirms that the extreme intervention by the 
RCMP in Vancouver is directly related to the directives his 
government issued to the RCMP? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
I said, there is an investigation into this matter.  A 
commission will conduct an inquiry, giving members of the public 
with complaints against the RCMP an opportunity to present their 
views, and the RCMP an opportunity to justify its actions.  The 
commission is to begin its work shortly.  Let us leave it to do 
its work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
commission of inquiry will investigate the actions of the RCMP, 
as the Prime Minister points out.  Our questions are directed 
not at the RCMP, but at the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Prime Minister be so good as to tell us what lesson we 
are to learn from seeing a supposed statesman deliberately 
crushing the individual rights of his fellow citizens so that he 
can stay on good terms with a dictator, because that is the fact 
of the matter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Such rhetoric, 
Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to inform the hon. member that, as the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs pointed out yesterday, we provided financial 
assistance to bring protestors to the parallel summit in 
Vancouver.  We ourselves provided assistance for protestors to 
come from other countries to hold a parallel summit in 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people who do not want to hear anything about civil 
liberties, I think we have gone further than anyone in issuing 
an invitation to these people and paying their expenses so that 
they could come and protest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for two 
days now the Prime Minister has been hiding behind the RCMP 
public complaints commission in order to avoid answering 
questions on the role he and his office played in repressing 
Vancouver students during the visit of dictator Suharto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister hide behind this commission when the 
issue is that he and his office dealt with the RCMP as if it 
were a political police force?

dictators? 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is also for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A federal government lawyer claims that the Prime Minister has 
no relevant testimony to give before the Public Complaints 
Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister pretending that he never discussed the

sensitivities with any of his officials? 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was aware that some of the delegations wanted 
reassurance.  I did that for many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the President of China was supposed to go to 
Victoria to receive a doctorate.  We could not guarantee him that 
there would be no demonstrations and he declined to go.  We knew 
that people could protest.  The President of China did not accept 
the offer to receive a doctorate from the University of Victoria 
because we could not guarantee there would be no protesters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are not demanding accountability for the Prime 
Minister's awareness, they are demanding accountability for the 
Prime Minister's actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has already said that any witness 
requested to appear before the Public Complaints Commission 
should do so, including presumably the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister agree with the solicitor general? 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just said that at this moment there is an inquiry.  It 
will look at all the facts.  Nobody has asked me to appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances we looked at the precedence and it is 
not usual in Canada for the Prime Minister to appear in front of 
a commission.  It has never happened before.  We will see what 
happens, but there is no need now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not preoccupied.  I want people to let the inquiry do its 
work.  The leader of the fourth party is inventing stories.  The 
facts will be told to the commission in a few weeks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister, with his answer a few moments ago in the House to the 
Reform members, appears to indicate that it is better to have the 
armed thugs of a dictator in Canada than to leave lawful and 
legitimate long gun owners free from government regulations and 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is out there somewhere about who ordered the RCMP to 
stifle legitimate protesters at the APEC summit.  The solicitor 
general said yesterday that the Prime Minister cannot avoid a 
subpoena to testify about the real story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister simply explain to the House his role in 
the pepper spray matter today?  No one—

<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to confess one thing.  After it was all over I 
was asked a question about the pepper spray.  I did not know what 
they were talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the journalist what he meant.  It is a product that I 
have never used.  I did not know that it existed.  That is why I 
made the joke and I probably should not have made it.  I did not 
know that there was a spray of pepper.

Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from documents on November 14 that the RCMP were unhappy 
with the political role they were asked to play in the APEC 
affair. Like the Prime Minister, we want the inquiry to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister guarantee the House and Canadians that 
the inquiry will be allowed to investigate the office of the 
Prime Minister and not just look into the issue of the RCMP?  Can 
it guarantee us that it will be able to look into the political 
role that was played in the Prime Minister's office? 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the complaints of citizens. It has a wide range of opportunities 
to investigate and it has a good history for the last 12 years of 
doing Canada justice. These people should let that committee do 
its work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said the public complaints commission can 
look into those who have grievances against the RCMP. The 
question posed by my colleague is can it look into the affair

<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>

<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
Prime Minister responded to our questions concerning social 
union in a somewhat cavalier manner, irresponsibly even, going 
so far as to describe the government of Ontario as ultra-right. 
Really now!  For the social union to work, there must be a 
minimum of openness and good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the importance of the social union, the problems being 
experienced across Canada in the health field as a result of the 
federal cuts, and the consensus of the premiers, can the Prime 
Minister brush off a serious question of such import in such a 
cavalier manner? 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Absolutely not, 
Mr. Speaker.  The debate on the social union was an initiative 
by this Prime Minister, from this side of the House, with the 
premiers at the meeting of last December, almost a year ago.  We 
wanted to consider social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, however, always said, and say again today, that the five 
principles of health insurance, as set out in the law adopted by 
the Parliament of Canada with a view to assuring all Canadians 
of a program, are not negotiable.  The rest, however, is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I 
understand from the Prime Minister's response is that Lucien 
Bouchard could have been blamed if a consensus had not been 
reached, which would have suited the Prime Minister, but now 
that there is a consensus, he no longer knows what to do.  That 
is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, and on what basis, can the Prime Minister say that the 
provincial premiers want to abolish the five principles in the 
Canada Health Act?  On what authority does he make that 
statement?  There is nothing to that effect in the agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the Minister of 
Health proud of the fact that all hepatitis C victims in Ontario

other provinces who contracted the virus before 1986 will 
receive nothing?  Does that make him proud?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if the hon. member had at heart the real interests of those who 
contracted hepatitis C from the blood system he would support the 
proposal we have made. The proposal we have made is to ensure 
that persons who contracted hepatitis C through the blood system 
at any time will not have to pay out of their own pockets for 
medical services and drugs they need.  That is what we propose. I 
call on the member to support us in that initiative.

he come up with?  Some catchy new slogan, care instead of cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what is the sick dad supposed to do, take his whole family

the Reform Party is so profoundly out of touch with Canadian

compassion is by their health care system.  The hon. member has 
no idea that the way Canadians show their concern about others is 
through health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason that we are now urging the provinces to 
join with us to ensure that those who have become sick because of 
the blood system, no matter when, have access to drugs and 
treatment they need.  At the moment they have to pay out of their 
pockets in most parts of the country for interferon and important 
medical services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying let us put that behind us and make sure people 
have the treatment they need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

its own decisions.  The superintendent, in conjunction with the

actuary.

use that as price support and not as income support.  I sent a 
letter to the minister of agriculture for the province of Quebec 
a number of months ago asking him to sit down and discuss this 
matter with me.  He has yet to respond.

to do with the shameful capitulation by the government this

the government is not able under NAFTA to legislate in the public

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Wild Rose has about five minutes left in debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in a 
letter of July 1997 the commissioner of the RCMP, Philip Murray, 
accused the officials in the Department of Justice of 
misrepresenting RCMP firearm stats by overstating the number of 
firearms involved in violent crime.  Contents of this letter were 
uncovered by Reform through access to information.  Other letters 
revealed that the former minister of justice and his colleagues 
used inaccurate firearms data produced by the Department of 
Justice to help justify Bill C-68.  At the time the RCMP 
commissioner requested that these incorrect stats be removed from 
circulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the policy and legislating decisions 
which resulted from these misleading stats are now interfering 
with justice and public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By March 1998, $240 million was wasted on registering guns owned 
by more than five million law-abiding Canadians.  That is 
diverting resources from programs which would do much more to 
improve public safety, such as putting more police on the 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was ever a case for the auditor general to step in, 
this is the one.  The government has tried to grossly 
underestimate the cost, but it is estimated that by the year 2003 
$1.2 billion will have been spent on gun registration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With four provinces to date opting out of gun registration and 
the federal government hiring personnel to administer the system 
in these jurisdictions, this comedy of errors has to be brought 
to an end.  It is becoming a real comedy of errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about $1.2 billion to register firearms.  And I 
repeat, the registration of shotguns and rifles will not save a 
life.  It just so happens that criminals do not care if the gun 
they use is registered.  I have not been able to get that through 
the heads of government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the $1.2 billion and let us not say no to hepatitis 
C people, but help that gang out.  I know some do not want to.  I 
know that no one on the other side wants to because they all had 
to vote no.  The magic leader said “You had better or else”, so 
the little sheep bleated and they jumped up and did what they 
were told once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps $1.2 billion could be put into cancer research.  That 
would save lives.  We know it and members opposite know it.  But 
the registration of guns will not save lives.  I hope someone on 
the other side will get up and give me an example of where the 
registration of one shotgun or one rifle will save the life of 
anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell members about something that happened in Winnipeg 
yesterday.  This was in the headlines.  A local city teenager 
blew his head off with a rifle that he had stolen the previous 
day.  When the owner of the gun called to report it stolen the 
police rushed to his house to arrest him.  That is what we all 
feared when Bill C-68 came into existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if this has happened elsewhere in the country, but 
we know for sure there is a big outrage in Manitoba.  This victim 
who had his gun stolen is looking at very serious jail time.  He 
was a victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the Criminal Code for the last four or five years 
when I was in the justice area and I never found anything in the 
Criminal Code that was bad.  I thought it was a good Criminal 
Code.  It went after the criminals of the land.  Why all of a 
sudden do we want to invent inclusions to the Criminal Code that 
go after law-abiding, taxpaying citizens, such as we see outside 
today, in a manner that is totally wasteful and unnecessary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Ottawa Centre said earlier today “Wake up and 
smell the coffee”.  That is a brilliant statement.  They are 
going to spend $1.2 billion, according to the auditor general's 
estimates, and it is not going to save a life.  It is not going 
to make our streets safer.  It is a bunch of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite know it.  Their constituents know it.  Their 
leader knows it.  But it shall be done because the dictator of 
Canada has spoken.  The dictator of Canada has said to those 
members over there “Vote for this bill”.  They will.  They will 
continue to support the things that cause innocent victims to be 
arrested, such as the individual in Winnipeg.  That is what is 
going to happen, but they cannot see it.  I feel sorry for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On questions and 
comments, we will proceed first with the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle and then we will hear from the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members would make it a lot easier for the Chair if they 
indicated that they wanted to ask a question.  Just give me the 
finger or a nod and if there are a lot of hon. members who would 
like to ask a question, then we will keep the questions and

Because of that I want to ask him this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decided in our party to have a free vote on this issue, which 
will reflect the diversity of public opinion.  Will the Reform 
Party be having a free vote on this issue later on this

we will continue to always have free votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  With respect to Bill C-68, the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a more simple question for the hon. member for 
Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke at length about the high cost of gun registration.  If 
gun registration cost only, say, $10 million or even $1 million, 
or if indeed gun registration cost nothing at all, would he then 
support it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would support anything 
that would be voluntary.  In fact, this hon. member can go out 
and ask all the criminals of the land if they care to register 
their guns and see if they step forward to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that registration will not solve the problem.  They 
cannot get that through their heads.  I would like one member to 
stand over there and give me one illustration of where 
registering guns will save a life. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just wondered if the hon. member was familiar with the 
Alberta president of the National Firearms Association.  Just in 
case he does not know who he is, his name is Mr. Lickacz, and he 
has an interesting statement on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says “Maybe not all Canadians are sheep.  I find it 
astonishing that given the bitterness that the RFC”, the 
recreational firearms community, “has for the federal government 
with respect to the firearms situation here that this type of 
comment has not been seen before”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear that this is not something I am saying.  I am 
simply quoting this person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says “I have been told by many firearms owners that they 
will shoot the first—cop on my doorstep that comes looking for 
my firearms”.  I deleted an expletive, and a big one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that these people are not the lunatic fringe.  His 
personal opinion is that his home is his castle and whether the 
justice department agrees or not is irrelevant.  It is his castle 
and he is not going to let anybody in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also went on to write a letter to the Minister of Justice, 
asking her to allow him and his little friends in Alberta to form 
a militia to drill and exercise.  What is this?  This guy is a 
member of the Reform Party, is he not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot say for sure. 
He could be a Liberal for all I know.  I do not know the man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way in the world that any of us would support 
anybody breaking the law.  No way in the world would we support 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear a “ha” from over there.  I would like the hon. member 
to stand up and prove me wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not support anybody breaking the law.  What I support are 
good laws.  This is a bad law.  Please look at it carefully.  It 
is a bad law.  Registration has not worked anywhere effectively. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the member for Oxford. 
I heard the member for Wild Rose say, and this is pretty close to 
a quote, we will have to get the </I>Hansard<I> to check, that he 
would support anything if it was voluntary.  I think that is what 
I heard him say.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that mean then that criminals are going to voluntarily 
register?  On one hand they are saying that criminals will not 
register their guns.  Obviously they will not.  What the member 
said is that he would support the bill if it was voluntary.  That 
is what I heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very interesting that we have principles and if you do 
not like them, we have other principles.  The point is what I 
heard is that the general concept is something the member can 
agree.  He just does not want it to be a forced situation.  That 
is very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder where the Reform Party went wrong when it decided not 
to support the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the 
Canadian Police Association, the Canadian Association of 
Police Boards.  You would have thought that these gentlemen and 
women would be lining up behind everything these 
groups had to say.  Yet they will say that registering 
guns is a horrible violation which will not help the police in 
doing their job in fighting crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three bodies I just mentioned would beg to differ. They say 
that registration will help police solve crimes where firearms 
are recovered.  That seems like a reasonable idea.  It will help 
identify the sources of firearms that are recovered.  It will 
enable police to trace some of the 3,000 firearms that are lost 
or stolen every year back to their rightful owners.  It will 
enable police to determine whether firearms have been skimmed 
from commercial shipments.  It will allow information on safe 
storage and handling regulations to be directed specifically to 
firearm owners.  The police are very concerned about that.  It 
will help the police to determine what types and numbers of 
firearms they might encounter when they are responding to an 
emergency call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just talk to someone in the business of policing.  They get a 
phone call. Quite often it can be late at night.  There is a 
report of violence.  There is a report of someone in distress and 
we are asking them to simply walk into that situation with no 
ability to access a database that might allow them to determine 
that the place they are going into happens to house a firearm or 
a number of firearms.  Why would we restrict that information 
from the police?  Why would the Reform Party restrict it?  It is 
truly incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the leader of the Reform Party earlier today 
saying that it was his mandate, or words similar to that, that he 
would fight against these unjust laws.  What he is really saying 
is that he is the Leader of the Opposition and therefore he is 
going to oppose it, whether it is good legislation or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see all these folks out on the front lawn of Parliament Hill. 
No one can deny there is a movement against registering firearms. 
They ask why would we support this. They call us sheep.  They 
say we are simply going to do what we are told.  Let me tell you 
who is telling us what to do.  It is the Canadian people, with 
78% of all Canadians approving of the legislation; 86% of people 
in the province of Ontario approve of the legislation; and 47% of 
firearm owners who are registered approve of the legislation. Why 
would they not?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the problem?  It is absolutely mind boggling.  We 
register our cars.  We have to renew the license on a regular 
basis.  We register things like our home ownership and our 
mortgage.  We register our dogs, for goodness' sake. We register 
most things.  We even register our children.  Why in the world 
would we not want to have some idea?  Granted, it will not solve 
all the problem.  There is no question that criminals are not 
going to come forward and say “I am here at 11 division and I 
want to register six firearms that I use to rob banks”.  We 
understand that. Why would we be opposed to registering weapons 
that could be dangerous?  We need to have some confidence that 
they are being treated properly and that people are properly 
licensed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view we have a real serious problem in this country.  When 
I see the province of Ontario deciding that it is going to lower 
the age for hunting to 12 I get a little nervous. I understand 
about education, training and getting young people into a sport 
early to make sure they understand how to use guns properly.  But 
I get a little nervous about the sense of responsibility, about 
the confidence, about the understanding and the calmness.  I am 
not sure I want to be walking around in the woods this November 
in Parry Sound where I have a cottage.  I am not sure I want to 
go out in the woods knowing there are 12 year olds with rifles. 
It is a little nerve racking knowing there are men and women. But 
to go down to the age of 12, I do not know where in the world 
those people are coming from or what they are thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing I find most interesting is the lack of information. 
The people out front, and we will hear the speeches, and the 
people in the Reform Party fuel myth. I cannot use the word lie, 
it is not parliamentary. It is a myth when they say that this act 
is just about registration.  We know— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Hon. members, we all 
know that we do not bring through the back door that which we 
cannot bring in through the front door.  Let us not make 
connections which we do not even have to stretch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not referring to 
any individual in this place.  I am referring to the fact that 
there is misinformation.  There are myths that are being 
propagated by members opposite to crowds which get them all 
emotional and excited about issues.  If they would deal with the 
facts then we could have a calm discussion about the issue of gun 
control, registration and the costs involved.  There will be 
setup costs and startup costs.  There will be revenue that will 
offset those costs.  But we never hear about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear that it will be expensive, that they are going to jack 
the price of registration up.  Yet I have never heard anyone from 
the opposite side admit that for $10 we could register 10 guns. 
A buck a gun.  Not a problem.  No one is going to come back and 
ask us to pay $100 or $1,000.  I have never heard anyone mention 
that once the gun is registered it is registered for life.  Why 
would we not want to do that?  They want to whip people up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one I love is that the police are going to be able to break 
down the door and come running in with their dogs and their guns 
drawn.  It is absolute nonsense.  They can investigate if they 
know there are weapons in the house.  They must either have our 
permission or they must have a warrant issued properly in a court 
of law, giving them permission to be able to enter and 
investigate.  They would do that if they thought there was 
potential for abuse or potential for crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the Reform Party would stop all the misinformation, stop 
leading people in the wrong direction and simply understand that 
this is good for Canada, good for Canadians and good for the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the debate today the aspersions that have been thrown in 
this direction have been rather interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected fortunately in 1993 with 49% of the plurality. In 
1997 I was elected with 62%.  The difference of the 13% was the 
way the Liberals rammed Bill C-68 down the throats of all 
Canadians.  I speak for the people of Kootenay—Columbia, and no 
member on that side of the House should misunderstand who I am 
standing up and speaking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member has obviously not read the bill.  He does not 
understand the bill.  He talks about misinformation.  His 
summation of the so-called facts of how he understands the facts 
clearly demonstrates that he does not understand.  He just does 
not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about Liberal social engineering.  The bill is about 
an understanding that the Liberals have only from their own 
specific urban perspective.  The bill is not going to make the 
streets of Toronto or the streets of Cranbrook any safer.  The 
bill is doing everything to drive a wedge between honest, decent, 
law abiding citizens and the police forces and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the member a very simple question.  How can we 
believe anything that the Liberal pack say when at the outset 
they gave us the bogus figure of $85 million or $87 million or 
$78 million, whatever that number was— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we can all flex our 
political muscles.  In my riding 65% of the people voted Liberal 
in the last election.  In the province of Ontario I think that 
was probably almost an average.  The vast majority of the people 
in the province of Ontario, some 86%, support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member does not understand that this is not a debate about 
the bill, this is a debate about the implementation and the 
regulations.  We are not here debating whether there shall be a 
gun control law.  That is a done deal.  What we are talking about 
is how it is going to be implemented and how it is going to be 
set up.  It is going to be set up in a way that will give the 
police some confidence in the database that will be available so 
they will know at least where the vast majority of the weapons 
are in this country when they are fighting crime and it will 
provide— 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to my hon. friend 
from Mississauga West.  I believe he is serious in his comments 
in terms of reflecting the views of his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for him regarding registration. The assumption 
is that if we have a decent registration system fewer people will 
get shot in our country as a result of that.  That is presumably 
the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may have my figures out a point or two but the general thrust 
will be accurate.  Every year in Canada about 1,450 people are 
shot one way or the other.  That is the number of people who lose 
their lives as a result of firearms.  Eleven hundred of those 
people commit suicide by firearms.  Would these people likely not 
commit suicide using a firearm if it was registered? About 100 
gangsters kill each other each year. If we have registration will 
gangsters not kill other gangsters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 100 people are shot in domestic disputes each year.  If a 
someone wants to shoot his or her partner, would they likely not 
do that if the gun was registered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 100 people are killed in hunting accidents each year.  If 
the gun was registered would these people likely not be shot in a 
hunting accident? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My serious question to my friend from Mississauga West is the 
following.  When I look at those categories it seems to me that 
very little will change in those categories as a result of 
registration.   Am I wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would always be 
careful with the hon. member to make sure he is not reading from 
one of our throne speeches from days gone by as he did one time 
when we all got up and decided to go into a rant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am assuming those figures are accurate.  The hon. member 
raised some interesting issues.  I want to just deal with the one 
on suicide.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking it would be my view that someone wanting to 
commit suicide would find a way and it would not necessarily 
matter if a gun were available.  We just had a tragedy in the 
local community park where I live.  Down the street where I walk 
my dog in morning a man who was accused of shooting his wife shot 
himself.  I do not know that registration would prevent suicide. 
They may find some other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All their issues are not what this is about.  This is about 
bringing some kind of order to registering guns and putting in 
place rules that all Canadians know about.  They can be licensed 
and trained.  It will help the police.  It will not solve crime 
but it will go a long way toward assisting the police in doing 
their job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to the Reform Party motion on Bill C-68 with which we 
dealt in the last parliament.  It is interesting that the Reform 
Party is using its first opposition day in the new fall session 
to debate an issue on which it fought and lost an election rather 
than using it for other important issues that Canadians are 
concerned with.  Where is the vision?  Vision means looking 
forward, not backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that no one wishes to give you the finger, Mr. Speaker, 
but I have been trying to give some of my colleagues opposite the 
finger for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to the opposition motion I find the language in it 
extreme.  It smacks of the kind of advertising the National 
Firearms Association and others put out.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for its refusal to 
replace Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, with legislation targeting 
the criminal misuse of firearms and revoke their firearm 
registration policy that, in the opinion of this House: (a) 
confiscates private property— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does no such thing.  It “contains unreasonable search and 
seizure provisions”  As my friend from Mississauga West just 
said, that does not apply.  It is not the way it is done.  The 
words in the motion are full of extra meaning. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—(c) violates Treasury Board cost/benefit guidelines; (d) 
represents a waste of taxpayers dollars— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of waste of taxpayer dollars here and there.  I 
wonder what is the value of human life.  My friend from Kamloops 
referred to domestic disputes and 100 hunting accidents.  Two 
days after I was elected my friend, the former warden of Oxford 
county, died in a hunting accident.  His wife wanted to throw all 
his guns down the well that afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It “is an affront to law-abiding firearms owners” to ask them 
to register a gun, to ask them to pay a small fee for that 
privilege.  It “will exacerbate the illicit trafficking in 
firearms”.  What nonsense.  Of course it will not exacerbate it. 
It may help stop some of it but it will not exacerbate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the last election Reformers swarmed across southwestern 
Ontario telling our constituents, mine in particular, that voters 
had to send a clear message to the Liberal government about gun 
control and Bill C-68.  Imagine their surprise when a clear 
message was delivered in Ontario regarding gun control.  The 
message was that the people of Ontario support Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure many Reformers were embarrassed that the only Reform 
MP to hold a seat in Ontario voted against gun control and that 
seat was won by a Liberal MP.  I assure all hon. members that the 
Liberal member for Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford is serving her 
constituents with distinction in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny this is an important issue for many of my 
constituents.  Several of them have positions in the leadership 
of the anti-Bill C-68 lobby.  When Bill C-68 was first proposed I 
received many postcards from gun owners who were opposed to 
measures included in the bill.  After a lot of work in caucus and 
after voting in favour of this bill I received many letters and 
calls of support from the constituents of Oxford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that original bill there were some far-reaching things that 
had to be corrected. 
There were prohibitions on black powder use.  There were 
prohibitions on re-enactment use.  There were prohibitions on 
certain handguns that were used only for target shooting. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of those matters were corrected.  The complaints that we 
find in this resolution were largely resolved.  At the polls 
during the 1997 election most constituents indicated their 
support for this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My re-election is an indication of the support Oxford has for 
this government and this legislation.  The Reform candidate after 
finishing second in the 1993 finished third in Oxford in 1997. 
That is also an indication of the level of support Reform enjoys 
in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to discuss the particulars of the bill and some of 
the questions that have been raised.  It is true that criminals 
will be unlikely to register a firearm.  Everyone can concede 
that point, but people must also concede that by that very fact 
criminals will identify themselves.  The fact that a firearm is 
not registered will alert the police to the possibility that the 
firearm may have been stolen, illegally imported, illegally 
manufactured or bought on the black market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the Canadian 
Police Association, the Canadian Association of Police Boards and 
groups representing victims of crime support registration of all 
firearms for practical reasons, the same reasons that we register 
our cars, our bicycles, our birth, our citizenship and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will help police solve crimes where firearms are recovered. 
It will identify the source of firearms that are recovered.  It 
will enable police to trace some 3,000 firearms lost or stolen 
every year back to their rightful owners and to return many of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will enable police to determine whether firearms have been 
skimmed from commercial shipments.  It will allow information on 
safe storage and handling regulations to be directed specifically 
to firearm owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these rules and regulations and the education of firearm 
owners regarding proper storage, it will certainly prevent a lot 
of people being killed by unloaded guns, the situations where the 
child in the home points an loaded gun at somebody but when 
father put it away it was unloaded.  It does not hang above the 
mantle piece loaded but unloaded in everybody's opinion.  When 
the loaded gun is pointed, people are killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite clearly, if a gun is registered the owner has the 
possession certificate and there is nothing to fear in the bill. 
It is only those who are in possession of illegal firearms, 
whether prohibited, stolen or unregistered, who need fear losing 
their firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt 
said that the bill allowed our police forces to confiscate 
private property.  It does no such thing.  I would anyway like to 
ask my friend from Saskatoon—Humboldt how an item that is 
illegal and illegally held can be considered private property. 
Will the Reform Party be saying next that police cannot seize 
drugs because they are the property of an individual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also say how dismayed I was to hear the member for 
Yorkton—Melville ask us to follow the example of Miami, Florida, 
in dealing with crime.  Perhaps this member would tell us how 
many gun related deaths there are every year in Miami or how much 
higher its crime rate per capita is to any city in Canada. Such a 
comparison is somewhat ridiculous and the Reform member would 
know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we have come to expect from the Reform Party on 
this issue.  This is a party that regularly encourages its 
membership to compare gun control measures to those of Nazi 
Germany, a party whose thinks the government's legitimate 
attempts to put forward measures supported by a majority of its 
citizens is bordering on Fascism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a party that brags about using direct democracy to make 
voting decisions in the House.  Yet only three Reform MPs had the 
courage and honesty to vote in favour of the bill after 
discovering their constituents supported Bill C-68.  I applaud 
them, all three.  Those members mentioned represented Calgary 
Centre, Edmonton Southwest and Vancouver North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority of Canadians support the gun registry including those 
in British Columbia and Alberta where most Reformers are from. I 
guess the only way they could say that the public supported their 
measures would be to trump up questions on a survey.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the deputy leader of the Reform Party certainly cannot 
vote for the motion.  An Optima Research poll taken in that 
riding last year showed that 55% of respondents support the 
registration while only 28% oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny that this is an important issue for many of my 
constituents.  I hope it will go forward after the vote this 
afternoon and we can get on with the many issues in which we can 
all get involved and do some good for Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, many of the 
people from West Nova in the riding I represent are hunters. They 
are law-abiding citizens.  They are honest, hard working people 
who see hunting as many of us would see golfing or any 
recreational sport of that nature.  There is absolutely no 
criminal intent on their part.  There is no malice in what they 
use their guns for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member across the way is very simple. 
How would registration of long guns reduce the incidence of 
violent crime?  I ask him to explain to me how that would happen. 
I am known as someone who thinks very rationally, who does not 
rant and rave about issues, but I would really like to understand 
how he sees it preventing violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suppose I agree with my 
hon. colleague that registering a gun may not in and of itself 
prevent a crime.  That is not what we are about.  We are about 
the safe storage, use and control of firearms.  That is what 
people— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It doesn't exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Oh, it does exist.  Yes, it exists.  Two 
neighbourhood boys were visiting one another. They found the 
father's gun and were playing with it in the bathroom. One boy 
asked for the gun back and the young boy from next door said “No, 
no”, pointed it at him and shot him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were a serious, law-abiding gun owner, the gun would 
have been locked up, would have had a trigger guard on it, the 
ammunition would be nowhere near the gun and the accident would 
not have occurred. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the hon. 
government member was saying.  The hon. member said that the bill 
was not about decreasing crime and then went on to tell a tragic 
story about an accidental death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat what my hon. colleague mentioned.  How would gun 
registration actually decrease accidental deaths?  Is the member 
aware of something called opportunity cost?  If money is taken 
from </I>a<I> and put into </I>b<I>, in this case money from the 
functional arm of justice being put into gun registration where 
it is proven to have less effect than leaving it with the RCMP 
right now, how does he account for his government's desire to 
pull hundreds of millions of dollars out of the functional arm of 
justice and put it into gun registration which is proven not to 
make our streets safer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we do not have gun 
registration now.  How have we proven anything by that statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Yes, we do.  We have had it since 1934. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Of course not.  Most democratic 
countries in this world have gun control rules or gun 
registration.  Many of them— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  They are not as onerous as ours and they 
have less crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Boy, oh boy.  We do not have less crime 
but we are the best place in the world to live.  There is a real 
objection, is it not?  It is a perfectly good conclusion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
heard the hon. member mention that we have to register cars, 
this, that and one thing or another. 
I want to talk about gun collectors. Does the hon. member realize 
that he does not have to register a car?  He can buy all the cars 
he wants and take them to his home. They can sit there and they 
are his.  He cannot take them on the road, though.  Then he would 
have to register them.  But he does not have to register to have 
a collection of cars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am a gun collector what is wrong with me just owning guns? 
I am not going to use them, so should I have to have a 
registration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite 
right.  It is not owning the car, it is using it.  It is the same 
thing with guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said that if gun owners want to own a prohibited weapon, then 
they can disarm it.  If they have a collection they can disarm 
all the guns.  But no, they would not go for that.  They do not 
want that.  The gun is not real then.  I think black powder and a 
ball will kill you just as fast— 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on the Reform motion which 
refutes many of the fallacies about Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say at the outset that if Bill C-68 would make our streets 
safer the Reform Party would support it.  However, it is for the 
reason that Bill C-68 is going to make our streets less safe that 
we oppose it.  I will get to the reason why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half of Bill C-68 is good.  Half of it involves penalties for 
the criminal use of guns.  We support that. We have been fighting 
for it for many years.  Half of it, however, will make our 
streets less safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point one is the registration of guns.  In this country 
two-thirds of the people who are murdered are murdered with a 
weapon that is not a gun. One-third die of gunshot wounds. Of 
that one-third, which amounts roughly to 225 people, the number 
that die with a registered handgun is five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that the cost of gun 
registration is going to be hundreds of millions of dollars and 
the government's estimate is over $1 billion. That money has to 
come from somewhere.  It is going to come in part from the 
pockets of the citizens of this country.  But in large part it is 
going to come out of the functional arm of justice. That means if 
we are going to remove money from the RCMP, if we are going to 
remove money from the police forces we had better make sure that 
where we are putting it has better bang for the buck. But the 
reality is it will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to have fewer RCMP officers hired, less equipment, 
fewer training opportunities for them and in short, if we are 
going to have fewer officers training, those officers are going 
to be less able to arrest criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Liberal member I spoke to during debate some years ago said 
if we can save five people, then we have saved five people.  I 
said to him if it is going to cost $500 million or $1 billion to 
save five people, is that worth it. He said any price is worth 
it.  Although we cannot put a price or a value on human life the 
reality is money does not grow on trees and the money is being 
taken away from the functional arm of justice and will make our 
streets less safe. That is the fundamental issue of why we do not 
support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of justice appeared before the committee and 
gave the reasons.  One is that it will decrease murder.  We have 
proven that it will not. The second reason is that the minister 
said it will decrease suicides.  If a person is depressed and is 
going to kill themselves, do they go out and get a firearms 
acquisition certificate, take a course, wait six months to get a 
gun and blow their head off?  No, they do not.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that gun registration will do nothing to decrease 
the suicide rate.  Will it help the police?  In a domestic 
dispute situation the police always go in with a view that a 
dangerous weapon is on hand.  This is standard procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members across the way have said that the police support 
this.  If that is the case why did 91% of the RCMP officers in 
Saskatchewan and 85% of the police officers in Alberta not 
support this?  The men and women on the front lines of justice in 
this country know full well that the money is going to come out 
of their funds to fight crime. They know gun registration does 
not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this decrease accidental death?  Accidental death with a 
firearm is a function of the use of that firearm.  If a person 
has registered that firearm, leaves it loaded on his or her bed 
and the children come in to play with it and shoot themselves or 
someone else and someone dies, that is a tragedy of youth.  It is 
a tragedy of people not using guns properly.  Gun registration 
will do nothing for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the member across the way who talks about all the 
good things that we have, implying that we do not have issues 
such as the firearms acquisition certificates, storage rules and 
regulations and trigger locks for handguns, we have those and the 
Reform Party supports those.  We believe, as does the government, 
that these are going to make our streets safer and are effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, our view is that we are simply not going to pursue or 
support a bill that is going to make our streets less safe.  That 
is why we have been so vocal about this for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were truly interested in decreasing crime then 
it would hit crime where it counts.  The problem in this country 
today is that we have rules and regulations on the boards that 
are simply not being implemented.  Most of the criminal activity 
with the use of firearms is done by criminals using illegal 
firearms.  When those people commit an offence with a 
firearm what happens?  They often get the firearms offence 
plea bargained away or to run concurrently with the other 
offence.  What message does that send to the criminals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It tells the criminals to go ahead and use a firearm because all 
they will get is no penalty or a penalty that runs concurrently 
with their other sentence.  This means that there is no penalty 
whatsoever for those people who use firearms in the commission of 
an offence.  That is what our party has been fighting for so 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we all want to do is to ensure that criminals are not going 
to be using firearms.  What we must do is enforce the law.  If 
somebody is using a firearm in the commission of an offence then 
we should take that and run the sentence consecutively, not 
concurrently.  We must stop plea bargaining away those sentences. 
If a criminal is guilty of pulling out a gun in the commission of 
a robbery then we should hit them with the book.  We must make 
sure they pay the penalty so they know they will not get off scot 
free when using firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to do something about the egregious situation we 
have in the country concerning the trafficking of firearms 
between our country and the United States.  The penalties for 
trafficking are there but they are not being applied. Trafficking 
is taking place, for example, on certain reserves in Quebec and 
the RCMP are sitting back and are being told, from what I 
understand, not to intervene.  That is a serious problem because 
it ties the hands of our law enforcement officers when these 
offences are occurring in front of their eyes.  Furthermore, it 
puts into jeopardy the lives and welfare of aboriginal people on 
those reserves and the people outside the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good effective justice and good effective laws would ensure that 
the laws of this country are being applied in the courts and not 
merely pushed underneath the carpet.  That is what we are in 
favour of.  In that way we can hit the criminals and leave the 
law abiding citizens out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a serious offence for law abiding citizens, who have never 
been a criminal in their lives, to transfer their guns to their 
children and loved ones.  Some of these guns are very valuable to 
them but the government is violating their rights as property 
owners.  We would not be in favour of just allowing guns to go to 
people who do not have to go through the proper criminal checks, 
firearms acquisition certificate application process that 
law abiding firearm owners have to pursue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We support that but we oppose vehemently the government's 
violation of people's rights to merely take those guns away from 
them with no recourse whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask any member of the government to tell us how that is 
going to make our streets safer.  If we look at history and what 
has been taking place in other countries where they have applied 
and implemented gun registration, it is proven that it does not 
work. In Australia it did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members across the way and the government have clearly said 
repeatedly, this may not make our streets safer.  If it is not 
going to make our streets safer, if it is not going to save 
Canadian lives, if it is not going to increase the safety of 
people, if it is not going to improve the ability of the police 
to do their job, then why do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why support something that is going to make our streets less 
safe and hamstring the ability of our police officers to do their 
job by tearing away the resources that they require to keep our 
streets safer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to pursue the enforcement of the laws of 
this land when it comes to guns.  It needs to scrap the idea of 
gun registration.  It needs to apply the penalties for 
trafficking.  It needs to work with us on effective measures to 
prevent crime and give the police the tools to do their job, as 
well as clean up our legal system and the judicial structure we 
have that hamstrings and ties the hands of our police officers in 
doing their job to keep our streets safer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca reminds me that 
the first dead person I saw was a suicide victim with a shotgun. 
The technique was put the shotgun in the mouth and pull the 
trigger and the head was completely blown off.  I was 17 at the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently I became a police reporter, a journalist, and I saw 
a lot of murders and suicides in the course of that part of my 
career.  One of the things I learned about suicides is that there 
are two things that often operate.  One is that the suicides 
generally do not want to hurt themselves.  They do not like to 
use knives and other methods that actually may do them injury or 
may lead to a fairly slow death.  What they prefer is something 
that is instantaneous and something also that will answer their 
impulses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often suicides are not planned over a long period.  If they get 
very depressed suddenly they will try to take their own lives. In 
the presence of a firearm in a household where there is a person 
who is known to be subject to these violent depressions who might 
be a potential suicide, registration would be very important in 
this instance.  I would have thought that the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, in the light of his profession, would 
appreciate that. I was very surprised that he said the opposite 
because gun registration surely would save the lives of some 
suicides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member 
mentioned that because, as an emergency room physician, I have 
seen a lot of people kill themselves, the vast majority of whom 
did not use guns.  Let us take the issue at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in this House would love to prevent suicides. I am 
glad the hon. member mentioned the issue that suicide can be 
impulsive. It can also be a part of an ongoing major depression 
and the person can be ruminating about this for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if somebody was going to be suicidal and they wanted to 
get a gun to kill themselves, in order to do that today without 
gun registration, it would take them six to nine months before 
they even get a gun because they have to go through a firearms 
acquisition certificate, they have to take a course, they have to 
go and buy the gun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So if somebody was going to kill themselves, they would not go 
through that.  They would find many other ways of killing 
themselves, which most people do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned somebody killing themselves because a 
gun was available in the house.  How would gun registration 
actually prevent that from happening?  Indeed it would not 
because we already—

Fundy—Royal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for his speech. 
I thought it was a very thoughtful presentation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight something he pointed out in his 
comments, that is, the necessity for us to have severe minimum 
penalties for any kind of criminal use with respect to a firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals such as myself and the member I believe as well are 
not against gun control.  This has become a very black and white 
debate, whether someone is for gun control or against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to be very prudent with respect to gun control and 
require that there be a clear acquisition certificate, that 
weapons and ammunition be stored under lock and key in separate 
places, that hunter safety courses be taken.  The kind of 
initiatives that were part of the previous legislation actually 
accomplished that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member whether in his estimation would he believe 
that this piece of legislation, Bill C-68, is more about politics 
than crime prevention.  Is it not more about taxation than 
deterring the criminal use of firearms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend 
from the Conservative Party.  He is right on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I think this bill, as my friend mentioned, is a 
political bill meant to pit urban versus rural voters.  It is 
meant to seduce the urban votership onto the side of the 
government by the government looking like it is the big defender 
of the public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that everybody in this House wants to make our 
streets as safe as possible.  We are in favour of the firearms 
acquisition certificate, the courses, the rules and regulations, 
the criminal checks that do our best to ensure that people who 
should not have access to guns do not have them, as opposed to 
the situation in the United States which we completely abhor and 
which the Reform Party opposes greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want to make is on suicide.  If we are truly 
interested in decreasing suicides, we can take the money from gun 
registration and put it into health care where it should be to 
treat people with depression. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today to address the 
motion put forward by my colleague concerning gun registration, 
specifically Bill C-68 which was about to be enacted in a couple 
of short weeks.  It actually will not be fully put into place 
until December 1.  That is what we have been told in the last few 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that 10 minutes is a very short time to address such 
an important issue.  When I say important issue, I really want to 
target the majority of my comments today specifically to my 
riding and more generally to the difference in how this issue is 
viewed by people residing in urban centres and by rural people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the whole issue of “gun control” as my colleague 
from the fifth party just mentioned, the reality is that we who 
are questioning Bill C-68 are not talking about no gun control. 
It is not a question of gun control versus no gun control.  We 
already have some of the most stringent gun control legislation 
and laws in the western world in place in Canada.  My colleague 
from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca talked about that very eloquently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to do in the short time I have is to try to educate 
some of our urban brethren as to what really constitutes the 
difference on how this issue is viewed by rural residents in 
Canada and those in the more urban centres, specifically some of 
the vast urban centres and the crime problems in places like 
Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that in the debate today a number of members of 
parliament in representing their views have used specific 
instances on both sides of the argument. I want to talk very 
briefly about one tragic incident that happened in my riding. 
The hon. member for Hamilton—Wentworth who just spoke from the 
government side used a very tragic instance from his recollection 
where an individual used a firearm.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one on the other side of this issue.  I would like to 
quote from the text of the Vancouver </I>Province<I> newspaper 
that carried the account of this tragic incident on August 17, 
1997, just a little over a year ago. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her husband died a hero—that much Angela Kitchen knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the sudden nature of Ray Kitchen's death and the random way 
fate struck didn't make any sense to her yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One minute, the Fort Nelson father was stopping for a swim with 
his daughter and her friend on a hot day.  The next minute, 
hearing the cries of a mauled woman trying to protect her son 
from a rampaging black bear, Kitchen was throwing himself into a 
situation that, as an outdoorsman, he knew could mean death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bear tore him apart.  He died, as did the woman he ran to 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Someone mentioned that he died a hero.  I'm really proud of 
him for that”, a tearful Angela Kitchen said yesterday.  “It's 
just so hard”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The savage attack Thursday night also left the woman's son and a 
28 year old Calgary man injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurred as Patti Reed McConnell, 37, and her two children, 
Kelly, 13, and Kristin, 7, were out walking at Liard Hot Springs 
Provincial Park, 310 kilometres northwest of Fort Nelson.  The 
family were on their way to Alaska from their home in Paris, 
Texas to start a new life in a land McConnell had fallen in love 
with. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to describe the incident in more detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More deaths were averted in this tragic incident.  How were they 
averted?  Because one individual at that scene had a firearm.  It 
happened to be an American tourist that was stopping in this 
location, Liard Hot Springs.  I am very familiar with this area. 
When I do my summer tour of my riding, and the riding goes all 
the way to the Yukon, I travel up the Alaska highway. I stop and 
talk to the lodge owners along the way. Most MPs on both sides of 
the House visit their ridings during the summer and they converse 
with their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often stopped at this hot springs. This was not the first 
incident of a bear attack or of bear sightings at this hot 
springs. At this hot springs there is a boardwalk of some 100 
yards in length which carries people from the parking lot to the 
hot springs itself where people bathe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened when this bear attacked those people?  Someone had 
to run back along the boardwalk and find someone who happened to 
have a firearm in their recreational vehicle.  I am not sure 
whether it was a motorhome or a fifth wheel trailer. An American 
tourist happened to have a firearm which was stored separately as 
the storage laws require.  They rummaged around and got the 
ammunition out.  This was an elderly gentleman who fortunately 
gave it to a younger person and said “Take my firearm and go and 
save some people”.  This person rushed back down the walkway and 
shot the bear with one shot. Unfortunately for Patti Reed 
McConnell and for Ray Kitchen, my constituent from Fort Nelson, 
it was too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that there is a vast world of 
difference between ridings such as mine, Prince George—Peace 
River, and this whole issue of gun control, gun registration and 
gun storage because what we are relating this to is the people in 
Toronto who do not understand guns.  They do not ever want to 
understand guns.  They do not want to own a gun.  They do not 
understand why anyone would want to own a gun because they have 
never been in situations like McConnell's and Kitchen's.  They 
have never been placed in those situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born and raised in Fort St. John in northeastern British 
Columbia and was a hunter as a young lad. I was raised with and 
had a strong respect for firearms and know how to handle them, 
and I can say that I do not understand people like that either. 
Therein lies the problem.  The people in the big urban centres do 
not understand this issue from the point of view of rural 
residents.  To me that is the fundamental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members throughout this debate, going right back to the 
time when we were first here, first elected in any numbers back 
in the fall of 1993, have tried to bring what we believe is some 
common sense to this issue. 
We have tried to represent not just the people who have 
legitimate concerns about safety and the illegal use of firearms 
in the cities of Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton and 
Calgary for that matter, but also to represent the very 
legitimate concerns of law-abiding firearms owners in the rural 
areas of our country, people who already fervently believe that 
we have enough gun legislation in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact many would argue that we had enough under the old Bill 
C-17, Kim Campbell's gun legislation that ranges back to the time 
of the Progressive Conservative government.  They would argue 
that we did not need parts of that legislation or it should not 
be applied the same in Toronto as it is at Liard Hot Springs in 
northeastern British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at this motion.  “That this House condemns 
the government for its refusal to replace Bill C-68, the Firearms 
Act, with legislation targeting the criminal misuse of 
firearms”.  I will stop there and not go on to read the rest of 
it.  The rest has certainly been adequately covered by many of my 
colleagues. Targeting the criminal misuse of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read again into the record what I said when I 
introduced a private members' bill to show what Reformers have 
been actively endeavouring to do since we came to the House.  On 
December 5, 1994, almost four years ago, when I introduced 
Private Member's Bill C-293 I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it is my pleasure to introduce the bill to the House.  It 
will increase the minimum mandatory sentence for the use of a gun 
in the commission of a crime to five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are demanding stiffer sentences for the criminal 
misuse of firearms but the recently proposed four-year mandatory 
sentence of the justice minister is only restricted to 10 
offences and is not consecutive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is merely introducing a minimum sentence of four years for 
these crimes, and with parole it may be less.  Although the 
tougher sentences in his reaction plan are a step in the right 
direction, the bill would go even further.  It would make the 
minimum five-year sentence consecutive to any other sentence and 
would apply to any accomplices who had access to the firearm 
during the crime or attempted crime whether or not the gun was 
fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want deterrents and I believe the bill would provide 
some. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is concrete action that the Reform Party and indeed many 
members in a number of parties would like to see.  Let us get 
tough on the criminals who misuse firearms and leave law-abiding 
firearms owners alone because they are already respecting the 
law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the sincerity with which the member made 
his remarks but in making his remarks he betrayed some of the 
lack of understanding of the west with respect to Ontario and 
central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is wilderness in central Canada. I am one who for many 
years has canoed and camped in the wilderness, oftentimes in 
Algonquin Park which is only a few hours north of Toronto.  Tens 
of thousands of people use Algonquin Park and the area around 
Muskoka.  There have been two fatal bear attacks in the last 10 
years in Algonquin Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This very weekend I was surrounded by wolves on an island as I 
camped with my son.  At my cottage in the summer, I killed a 
three foot rattlesnake. My cottage just happens to be in the 
range of the only poisonous snake in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To use the member's logic, everyone who goes to Algonquin Park, 
everyone who goes to Muskoka, and there are thousands and 
thousands of them coming from Toronto, Hamilton, Waterloo and 
Cambridge, should go with a firearm every time they get in a 
canoe. We in Ontario do not feel that is acceptable.  It is not 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the member opposite will admit that an attack by a wild 
animal, whether it is a cougar or a grizzly bear, is indeed a 
very, very rare eventuality and we do not have to go armed into 
the wilderness every time we want to go away for the weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I would like to know how 
the individual across the way who posed the question killed the 
three foot rattlesnake.  With a shovel?  I am not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  An axe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  With an axe.  He is a very brave 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that many lives would be saved. Earlier on in the 
debate individuals across the way were talking about how it does 
not matter how much it costs if we just save one life.  I heard 
that statement across the way. 
It does not matter how much it costs as long as we save one life. 
What I was talking about was saving lives as well.  Not every 
individual should probably carry a firearm in every situation. 
However, the reality is that people who travel outdoors and know 
how to responsibly use firearms because they have been trained or 
have been raised with firearms should carry firearms to protect 
themselves.  There would be less incidents like the one I 
referred to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is probably a fundamental 
difference and fundamental disagreement between the hon. member 
and me on gun control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has tried to use personal tragedy to score some 
political points.  He refers to an incident at Liard River Hot 
Springs, which I gather is in his riding.  It was a terrible 
tragedy.  He implied that somehow or another gun registration 
would contribute to an incident that had already occurred at a 
time when gun registration was not in place.   Also the hon. 
member implied that safe storage would somehow play into the 
incident.  He is trying to confuse the viewers of this House of 
Commons session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 insofar as registration is concerned is not invoked. 
It is not in place yet and will not be on a compulsory basis 
until 2003. I do not understand how non-registration would have 
somehow prevented this terrible incident in Liard River Hot 
Springs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If somehow or other the hon. member could share this information 
maybe we would be all better off, but as far as I am concerned I 
do not think gun registration is relevant insofar as this 
incident is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will certainly share with 
him my thoughts in that regard and he will be better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that legislation like Bill C-68 and its 
forerunners are step by step and incrementally discourage gun 
ownership in Canada today.  That is what it amounts to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same as any other law passed in this place that make 
it more and more onerous on private citizens to own certain 
property.  The more laws and the more difficult we make it for 
people to own something, obviously there will be less and less 
people who own it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, as its forerunners, goes even further than 
that.  The government can arbitrarily decide that certain makes, 
models and types of firearms are suddenly on the prohibited list. 
No one on that side has ever adequately explained how that does 
not constitute confiscation of private property.  That is exactly 
what it is.  At least the people in rural Canada and the people 
of Prince George—Peace River know that is exactly what it is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise with some considerable interest in this issue as it is a 
matter of great interest to Canadians and to my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion deals with two issues:  Bill C-68 which was passed in 
the last parliament and the proclamation of the attendant 
regulations scheduled for October 1 and now postponed to December 
1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles behind Bill C-68 were quite eloquently stated by 
the president for the Coalition for Gun Control.  They are the 
significant costs of not acting now in terms of victimization, 
years of life lost and economic impact.   The remedy is 
understood, available, feasible and at a reasonable cost. Guns, 
crime, injury and death is a problem which will likely escalate 
if not addressed now.  Finally the longer the proliferation of 
unregistered guns continues, the more difficult it will be to 
contain.  In other words, gun registration addresses current 
problems and it invests in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The single most important motivation behind the bill is public 
safety and the safety of police officers.  I frankly have trouble 
understanding the position of the members of the Reform Party. 
Are they in fact against public safety? 
Do they wish to put the lives of police officers at risk?  Do 
they prefer to see what we see in the United States of America?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will direct their minds to certain rates.  There are 30 times 
more firearms in the United States than in Canada.  There are an 
estimated 7.4 million firearms in Canada.  There are 222 million 
firearms in the United States of which 76 million are handguns. 
There is a much higher portion of homicides in the United States 
that involve firearms.  On average there is 65% of homicides in 
the U.S. compared to 32% in Canada. Firearm homicides are 8.1 
times higher in the United Stated than in Canada.  Handgun 
homicides are 15.3 times higher.  In the face of such startling 
statistics the government cannot simply stand by, ring its hands 
and do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble believing that the hon. member who proposed the 
motion wishes to go in that direction.  This is a piece of 
legislation which is broadly supported by the Canadian public and 
the constituents in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would draw the hon. member's attention to a recent Angus Reid 
poll in which 82% of Canadians approved the universal 
registration of shotguns and rifles.  Contrary to the thesis of 
the member previous to me, interestingly there was 72% support in 
rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, to give statistical response to the member's 
previous statement that this was really people in Toronto who do 
not know what they are talking about, may I suggest to him that 
he refer to the analysis done which says that in populations of 
one million the firearm homicide rate is 422 per 100,000.  For 
communities less than 100,000 it is 427.  For other homicides it 
is 768.  In communities of less than 100,000 it is 804. Virtually 
identical rates for cities in excess of one million and for 
cities and communities of less than 100,000.  There is no urban 
or rural divide on this issue.  This is broadly supported by all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and their kissing cousins, the reformatories in 
Queen's Park, are not responding to the public demands for public 
safety.  Last week the reformatories proclaimed legislation 
enabling 12 year olds to be licensed.  One has to wonder what 
they are thinking about by putting guns in the hands of children. 
In my community destroyed it absolutely destroyed their 
credibility on their big issue of getting tough on crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has not been nor, if this legislator has any say about 
it, will ever be a country in which the right to bear arms is a 
constitutional, legal or moral mandate.  The philosophy of Bill 
C-68 is sound and enjoys wide public support among many segments 
of the community, including those most likely to be victims, 
namely police officers and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning now to the regulations, I am curious to know if the 
mover actually has read the regulations or read the original 
regulations which I have in my hand.  If he did, he would know 
that the government has moved miles in responding to quite a 
number of legitimate regulatory issues.  This set of firearm 
regulations is a substantial change from that which was 
originally presented to us on the committee.  I congratulate the 
government, as I do not often do, on its willingness to be 
flexible and not impose unduly bureaucratic regulations on 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representations were made to the committee by manufacturers and 
changes were made; by the entertainment industry and changes were 
made; by shooting clubs and changes were made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day when the regulations were presented for a 
vote the only opposition on the committee came from those who 
fundamentally do not believe in Bill C-68.  This gun control bill 
will never satisfy everyone no matter how reasonable, measured or 
balanced the regulations might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning now to the motion, the first issue is the confiscation 
of private property.  If the mover thought about that for more 
than five seconds, he would realize that a proper registration 
system gives security of ownership and enhances value.  Far from 
confiscating, it does the exact opposite and legitimizes the 
owning of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly property registration does wonders for land titles and 
land values as it does for motor vehicles and other forms of 
property.  Why would it not be true with firearms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that it contains unreasonable search and 
seizure.  With the proclamation of the law, the police will know 
if the occupant is licensed to own arms and what they might 
expect to find behind that door.  If I were a police officer 
responding to a call I would sure like to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If individuals choose not to obey this law on some misguided 
point of philosophy, they derogate from the rule of law.  This is 
not the advice the hon. member should be giving to Canadians.  I 
urge him to rethink his position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is that it violates Treasury Board guidelines. 
These are conclusions rather than arguments and need no comment. 
Given the more casual approach to public safety, I would not 
expect him to say otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth point is that it is an affront to law-abiding firearm 
owners.  As of October 1, now December 1, all owners of firearms 
are law abiding, but in the days following those dates they put 
themselves beyond and outside the rule of law.  Until April 30, 
1999 I am a law-abiding, taxpaying citizen, but if I do not file 
my return I cease to be a law-abiding, taxpaying citizen.  So 
also will it be for those who fail to register their guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth point is that it will exacerbate the trafficking of 
firearms.  This is indeed a strange argument.  Licensing will 
enhance property values, facilitate the processing of insurance 
claims and legitimize the owner.  If anything, trade in illicit 
firearms will be carried on at the fringes.  After a number of 
years those without proper licensing and registration will be 
marginalized and unable to acquire, dispose or trade.  The police 
will know who they are, what they are doing, and will not have to 
unduly intrude into the lives of law-abiding gun owners that this 
motion purports to defend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion deserves strong rebuke from the House as it defeats 
itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the suggestion that weapons control or the registration 
of firearms will actually enhance their value is one of the 
funniest things I have ever heard said in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, firearms dealers in the northern tier states are 
scooping up enormous quantities of Canadian owned firearms at 
bargain basement prices because people want to get rid of them 
before the regulations come fully into effect.  People in this 
country have collections of heritage weapons.  In my riding, for 
example, one of the most popular collectors items would be a 
carbine that was brought to the west by the Northwest Mounted 
Police when when made their march west.  Those things are being 
sold off into the United States at 50 cents on the dollar because 
people just do not want the hassle.  It is all about hassle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about protecting police officers.  I wish he 
would have gone outside and talked with the five serving and 
retired police officers who spoke at the rally and who think that 
the whole thing is nonsense. 
No police officer worth his salt would approach a dwelling in 
which a domestic violence has been reported without taking due 
precaution.  He is not going to look at a computer to see if 
there are weapons in that house.  If he did,  he would probably 
receive a reprimand from his chief.  The last thing I—

this issue to my hon. friend because he simply does not 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the issue.  I could have a pile of firearms in my home 
and feel it will be too much hassle to get rid of them so I dump 
them at 50 cents on the dollar or whatever.  I recommend that my 
hon. colleague speak to those who think that way because they are 
being absolutely foolish.  They are blowing out an inventory 
which they should not.  All they have to do is register.  It is a 
fairly simple system.  Suddenly they will have preserved their 
asset at 100 cents on the dollar.  I cannot understand why anyone 
would discount their assets on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his second point about police officers looking into a 
computer, I do not know how many times the hon. member has been 
in police officer's car but there are computers in the car.  They 
punch up the name of the person, see whether there are guns, 
whether the individual is a registered firearm user, and then 
appropriately approach the residence.  This seems to be fairly 
fundamental.  If I were a police officer, I would like to know 
what was behind that door.

I rise on behalf of the constituents of Okanagan—Coquihalla who 
are very interested in the member's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a lot of claims from the Liberals but now they are 
claiming that Bill C-68 will end the proliferation of guns.  That 
is very interesting because thousands of people are on the lawn 
today who are law-abiding citizens.  They are not smugglers. They 
are not illegally bringing guns into the country.  However, if 
there is a problem with proliferation of guns coming illegally 
into the country, that should be dealt with in a legal manner. 
They should go after the criminals instead of the law-abiding 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal government planning on doing?  Is it 
planning to run ads in gun smugglers weekly magazine suggesting 
that smugglers run to the local police station to register their 
illegal firearms?  That will not happen.  This legislation is a 
waste of taxpayers' time and money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned penalties.  Let's talk about them.  For not 
registering a gun under Bill C-68 the maximum sentence is 10 
years for one of those law-abiding citizens out on the lawn— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member but time is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to the first 
point with respect to the proliferation of guns.  It is my view 
that a great number of homicides are committed by people who know 
each other; in fact something in the order of 90%.  They are 
either business partners, spouses or family.  The registration of 
guns will diminish that level of homicide and that level of 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  This is so patently obvious that the 
members opposite are unable to grasp the point.  There will 
continue to be an effort on the part of the government to control 
trafficking in firearms. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I begin by expressing some impatience with respect to 
the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in this debate. In 
condemning the government's legislation in Bill C-68 in the same 
breath he condemned parliament and the procedures by which the 
House operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very tired of this.  The Leader of the Opposition fails to 
realize we are one of the oldest and most successful democracies 
in the world.  We operate under the British parliamentary 
tradition, not the American system.  To put the matter very 
delicately and to use an expression that is very common in the 
countryside where I live, even swine don't defecate in their own 
corner.  I wish the Leader of the Opposition would direct his 
remarks as they should be directed against the government but not 
against parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Leader of the Opposition also cited the charter of 
rights and complained in his remarks that the charter of rights 
contains no provisions for property rights.  That indicates how 
the Leader of the Opposition equates human rights and human 
values with property.  It is true that in the United States 
deadly force can be used to protect property.  However, we in 
Canada honour human rights above property rights.  That is one of 
the things that makes us Canadian.  I am sorry the Leader of the 
Opposition fails to realize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reserve my main remarks for something the member for 
Kootenay—Columbia said.  He stood in the House and said from his 
heart that he was speaking on behalf of his constituents, on 
behalf of what he believed people wanted him to say with respect 
to criticism of gun registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criticism of gun registration is legitimate, but I remind 
members what the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt said in reply to 
a question very early in the debate from one of his colleagues. 
He was asked what the government's agenda was in introducing gun 
registration.  The member for Saskatoon—Humboldt replied that 
they wanted to register all the guns and disarm everybody.  That 
is what he said.  Members can check </I>Hansard<I> and find that. 
I want the Reform Party to hold that thought in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always had a great interest in special interest groups. 
Just a few days ago the Reform Party introduced a bill that 
reflected my studies of special interest groups.  One of the 
special interest groups that I tried to probe during the debate 
on Bill C-68 was the National Firearms Association of Edmonton 
that turned out to be very prominent in the lobby against Bill 
C-68.  I found out that the leader of the National Firearms 
Association in Edmonton was also the riding association president 
of the riding of Edmonton—Strathcona.  I believe he still is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all the information I could find out.  There was this 
lobby group behind the Reform Party and I could find no other 
data. However a computer search I did turned up another 
association with exactly the same name:  the National Firearms 
Association of Austin, Texas.  Thanks to the Internal Revenue 
Services I was able to get its basic financial data.  I was also 
able to get a constitutional document.  It is a flyer it puts out 
which explains what the National Firearms Association of Austin, 
Texas, is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from saying that an attack on one gun owner group is an 
attack on all and no compromise ever, and so on and so forth on 
gun control, this is the key phrase: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only through concerted action will we emerge victorious against 
those who would seek to disarm the people of the United States. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where in the debate did we hear that?  We heard it from the 
member for Saskatoon—Humboldt and we have heard it frequently 
from members of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing wrong in my mind with coming up here and 
attacking the government because perhaps gun registration is 
working out to be more expensive than it should be, but I caution 
members opposite when they speak to make sure that they are 
genuinely speaking for Canadians. I will show them the dangers 
that might be inherent in speaking for the National Firearms 
Association, which we suppose may have something to do with the 
one in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another statement from the document of the National 
Firearms Association of Austin, Texas, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our right to keep and bear arms is an absolute inalienable God 
given right just like our right to live and breathe. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of talk we get from the National Firearms 
Association in the United States.  Americans have the right and 
the advantage of being armed unlike the citizens of other 
countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with 
arms.  That is the kind of rhetoric we have here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep 
and bear arms is a last resort to protect themselves against the 
tyranny of government”.  That is where it is coming from.  In 
the United States is a movement that wants to arm itself against 
the government and is not too far removed from the citizens 
militia that caused a terrible tragedy in the United States not 
long ago.

militia?  Are they not ourselves?  Congress shall have no power 
to disarm the militia.  Their swords and every other terrible 
implement of the soldier are the birthright of an American”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document goes on and talks about a new world order.  What 
the National Firearms Association in the United States is all 
about is that it is afraid there will be a new world order set up 
in Europe that will persuade the president of the United States 
to disarm all Americans and that they will lose their guns and 
live under tyranny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the final messages in this document is that they urge all 
members to remember that it is not just a crisis in the United 
States but a crisis in the entire world and that they should be 
going out fighting for freedom, for guns in every other country 
in the world including Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members opposite talk about problems with any kind of 
legislation, they should remember that it is government 
legislation. They should not condemn parliament because this is 
where we have very good debates but should remember when they 
speak to speak for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There are quite a 
few indications of interest in questions and comments.  We will 
go first to Nanaimo—Cowichan, second to Yellowhead and third to 
Battlefords—Lloydminster, but members will have to keep their 
questions and responses short. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to make an observation which I have not heard in in the 
debate today and then ask a question of the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years I have been an observer of the somewhat sad 
condition of the human race.  In spite of the fact the government 
maintains that gun registration will somehow lessen the number of 
murders or whatever, I am afraid I have to say that gun 
registration in itself will not in the least stop people from 
killing each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My observation of the human race is that it is done only because 
of the evil in men's hearts.  When that is there, there is 
nothing that can prevent someone from hurting someone else. That 
is my observation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of not having any real statistics that gun 
registration will decrease murders or criminal activity and it 
being said that a number of people are now being killed by knives 
in this country, on the same premise the government is now taking 
on gun control can we expect that at some point in the near 
future there will be knife control brought in by the government? 
Is that what will have to take place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member had been here 
throughout the debate, as I have been, he would have realized 
that the government has repeatedly stressed it does not believe 
that registration is the cure-all or the end-all or even that it 
will necessarily improve the situation with respect to crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are bringing in legislation, to sum it up for all 
on the opposition side, is that we want to remind Canadians that 
guns in Canada are a privilege, not a right as they are in the 
United States, and as a privilege it must be managed competently 
and securely in the interest of all Canadians.  That is why we 
are bringing in gun registration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member from the government who just spoke talks about Reform 
representing Canadians.   Let us talk a little about Reform 
representing Canadians.  Let us talk about a phenomena that the 
government seems to be forgetting or overlooking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the federal government conveniently forgets that 
it is being challenged in court over Bill C-68.  Who is taking 
the government to court?  Is it a lone Canadian citizen or a 
firearms association?  The federal government is being challenged 
in the court by government itself, not by one government but by 
four provincial governments:  the governments of Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario, and the two territories, the 
Yukon and the Northwest Territories, over half of the Canadian 
population.   What about geographics?  It amounts to 75% to 85% 
of Canada's land mass.  That is the stark reality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is being challenged in court by over half the 
Canadian population representing a big chunk of Canada's land 
mass.  Can this member at least tell me why the federal 
government is not putting on hold the implementation of this bill 
until at least the Alberta Court of Appeal comes down with a 
decision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer to that is that 
if we did that with every legislation every time there was an 
appeal, the implementation of all legislation would be stalled 
because it would be an open door to block every kind of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address another point very quickly.  I think it is the 
correct process that if there is any area in society, any 
province or group that objects to the gun registration, sure they 
should challenge in the courts.  There is nothing wrong with 
that.  That is due process. But the essence of my speech was that 
I was afraid that many members opposite, and I respect many of 
them, were nevertheless parroting myths and the aims of a foreign 
organization.  I challenge them to go out and look into the 
finances of the National Firearms Association that is so much in 
your pocket, or are you in their pocket?  I am really quite sure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to split my time with my colleague from 
Tobique—Mactaquac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come at this with perhaps a different 
perspective.  I heard the fearmongering from the hon. member on 
the Liberal side just recently with respect to all these terrible 
antics of other organizations that are now going to throw the 
government out. There is going to be insurrection.  That is not 
what I want to do, come to fearmongering.  What I would like to 
do is give detail of some of the truisms that are out there in 
our society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number one, I am not a member of the National Rifle Association. 
Number two, I do not belong to the National Firearms Association 
was mentioned by the hon. member. I do not even own a firearm but 
I do represent an area of this country where firearms and long 
rifles and shotguns are a part of daily living.  It is a rural 
area.  It is a rural economy and in a lot of circumstances 
firearms are still very necessary in order to deal with predators 
on agricultural land as well other requirements, one of which is 
of a recreational nature, duck, goose and dear hunting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not do any of those activities either but I know of people 
who do and they enjoy them.  We are Canadians and we do have 
rights and we do have freedoms and for those people who wish to 
do so I see nothing wrong with honest, law abiding citizens of 
this country having the opportunity to go out and take part in a 
pastime which they enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of that pastime they require a firearm.  Firearms are 
not difficult to control in our society today.  We in the 
Progressive Conservative Party, and I would suggest members from 
the official opposition, do not have any difficulty with control 
of firearms, with safe storage of firearms so that they are not 
going to go off accidentally, that they will be looked after 
carefully.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do have is some difficulty with the registration 
component to firearms.  I learned from a long time in this 
business of politics that it is good to pass good laws.  Good 
laws are laws that can be enforced and maintained.  Bad laws are 
laws that cannot be enforced and maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us touch on that for a moment.  The registration component 
of Bill C-68 is what we are opposed to and have always been 
opposed to because it is bad legislation.  It is not enforceable. 
It never will be and never can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who own firearms in their homes who do not and 
who have not used those firearms for years, in some cases for 
decades.  These people are law abiding citizens. They will not in 
most circumstances register that firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore at the date they have to register, if they have not 
they are criminals.  That in itself is criminal and it is 
unenforceable unless the police departments are going to go into 
people's homes to look for a firearm that may well be there that 
is not registered. That is very dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another venue in another government, we passed laws and we 
listened to the people.  People said to give the rationalization 
for the law, tell them why we put it into place and is it 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to some of the laws that we refer to as bylaws and we 
looked at them.  They were not working.  There were certain 
licensing procedures that we put into place in the municipality 
that were not working and we went back legitimately and said if 
it is not enforceable and if it is not working, then don't have 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We struck those laws from the book.  What we are asking this 
government to do right now is to simply take a step backwards, 
look at the viability and the enforceability of this component of 
registration with Bill C-68 and say it will not work, it will not 
serve the purpose that it thought it was going to serve when it 
put this legislation into place. Take the step backwards and do 
the right thing for Canadian society.  Do not take the police 
officers off my street to enforce a law that is unenforceable 
because I would prefer to have those police officers doing the 
job they are supposed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to chastise the government for spending $135 
million to this day and not in fact registering one firearm.  I 
will not chastise its members because I think they thought they 
were doing the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members should take what they hear now from the opposition 
benches.  They should take what they hear from the 20,000 people 
who were outside this House today who were like us, law abiding 
Canadian citizens who simply want to speak their mind and tell 
the government that the law it has enacted is a stupid law. 
Take out the registration component and everybody will be better 
for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the fearmongering.  I heard that we will overthrow 
governments.  I heard that we have militia groups behind us. I am 
a Canadian.  I do not own a gun.  I do not belong to the militia. 
I do not belong to firearm associations and I believe it is a 
stupid law.  There are thousands and thousands like me out there 
who believe the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the regionality in this country. I appreciate the 
diversity of this country and I ask nothing more of the 
government than to appreciate the same diversity when I and my 
colleagues from this side of the House say there are serious 
flaws in the registration component of Bill C-68.  Remember what 
I said.  Nobody here is opposed to the safe control and operation 
of guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker said it would diminish homicides if we have 
gun registration.  We can use that argument and I can give a 
rebuttal on that as well but I am not prepared to do so right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply, listen to the people who are out there telling this 
government what they would like to see in legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have been holding my fire today on this issue but I 
would like to put a bit of a lie to some of the comments that 
have been made in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about confiscation and discouraging gun owners 
and yet the Reform Party by its very arguments has demonstrated that is 
not what has happened because it has pointed out that handguns 
have been regulated now for 60 years and has not seen any of that 
happening out of the registration of handguns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the member who just spoke, I am not very good at predicting 
the future.  We have to see the results sometimes.  I do know that 
I was very impressed in this debate by an international research 
paper that was done by the International Police Association a few 
years ago demonstrating very clearly that the stronger the 
gun legislation is in a country, the lower the rate of violent 
crimes and deaths as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member is aware of that report.  If he is aware 
of it, has he chosen to totally ignore the results of that report 
which show a very clear correlation between strong gun control 
legislation and less violent crime?  That is what I want to see 
for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can honestly say I have 
not seen that report nor have I read it.  But there are a number 
of statistics that have been bandied about by the government used 
when selling this particular piece of legislation to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also told at that time that there was support from the 
police association as well as the RCMP.  However, false 
statistics were used in presenting that piece of legislation. 
Reports are reports and I have no reason to dispute the fact that 
perhaps there is less violent crime where there is stronger gun 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for 60 years of gun control with handguns, which is 
very strict, there are still homicides being performed by 
handguns. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure of sitting on the 
standing committee on agriculture with the member for 
Brandon—Souris. There are a few things we have disagreed on 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows me as an active farmer living in rural Canada. 
I am also a gun owner.  I have black powder at home, shotguns, 
a 44-40, a .303 and a .22.  I can go on.  They are all properly stored and 
I have no problem with registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the speakers on the other side have said that if we 
register these long guns in a very short period of time police 
officers are going to come into our homes and confiscate our 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had registration of handguns since 1934. When the 
member for Brandon—Souris was mayor did he instruct his 
police force to go into homes of residents in that city and 
confiscate their handguns because he knew where they were, where 
they were registered?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to think about this and comment on it. 
Registration is $10 for ten long guns or a thousand because it is 
not just restricted to ten. We tried to make this as economical 
as possible.  In my opinion this is the cheapest insurance policy 
we are ever going to get.  If someone stole my shotgun 
and they happened to be out in Manitoba and they were pulled over 
they would be asked about the ownership.  Under the new law they 
will have to produce registration and ownership.  I would get my 
shotgun back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is nice to live in a 
world of naivety and I do appreciate that from the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke nothing of confiscation in my dissertation.  I spoke of 
a piece of legislation that in my estimation and in the estimation 
of thousands of Canadians is unenforceable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the fact that the hon. member will register his 
guns.  I thank him very much for that.  I can also assure the 
member that there are law-abiding citizens in my area and in 
areas of western Canada who will not register their guns.  They 
will be criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is my police force to go into those houses and look for those 
people who have not registered a long rifle and charge those 
law-abiding individuals?  If they are, we will need substantially 
more police officers in our municipalities to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not subscribe to a lot of the rhetoric that has come from 
these benches with respect to confiscation.  However, I do know 
in my mind that if legislation is unenforceable then it is not 
good legislation and should not be on the books. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a privilege to stand in the House today to talk about the 
current Firearms Act, formerly Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ran for politics, during my campaign I became very 
familiar with Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a rural riding in New Brunswick.  As a matter of 
fact, I live in the woods and owned a gun at one time.  When I 
ran for office, a lot of people in my riding, in New Brunswick, 
were totally against Bill C-68.  As I heard and read more about 
it, I became totally against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ran to become a member of parliament I was very vocal 
about being against Bill C-68.  My party, the Conservative Party 
of Canada, at that time said that if we formed the government we 
would scrap Bill C-68.  I am now a member of parliament, but my 
party did not form the government.  The people who put this bill 
forward have formed the government. I do not agree with it, but 
that is how democracy works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time I have been bothered by a few questions.  I have 
personally been against firearm registration.  I sold my gun 
because I did not understand why I should have to register it. 
As I had a licence and the gun was already registered, I wondered 
why I should have to register it a second time.  For me it is 
purely political and a tax grab by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothers me the most is that today is a Reform supply day 
and all day they have been talking about Bill C-68.  The Reform 
Party also said that if it formed the government it would repeal 
Bill C-68, but it did not form the government.  Since then the 
Reform Party has been very vocal in the media and outside the 
House as to what Bill C-68 will do to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes inside this House I feel that the story is different. 
We know that a subcommittee was set up last December by the 
justice department, made up of the justice critics from each 
party.  Bill C-68 has now become law.  It is harder to throw a 
law out than to throw a bill out.  Now that the law is there we 
thought it would be easier for us to present amendments to the 
subcommittee which would help change some provisions within the 
law to make it easier for Canadians who live in rural areas to 
hunt.  Just because we own guns does not mean we are criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time arrived for all parties to meet at the 
subcommittee, the date was December 2, 1997.  The critic for the 
Conservative Party was there with five amendments.  He would have 
been able to change some of those provisions. 
The Reform Party went to the subcommittee with one amendment, 
which was to repeal Bill C-68 and nothing less than that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met people who voted for the Reform Party.  They told me that 
the only gun control they want in the country is to be able to go 
to bed at night with a loaded gun next to their bed.  Do we live 
in Canada or do we live in the jungles of Cambodia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the subcommittee, after the Reform Party brought in the 
amendment to repeal Bill C-68, which was defeated, instead of 
staying at the meeting to help the Conservative Party with its 
amendments, Reform members left the room saying that it was not 
an important issue for them.  We had five amendments.  On three 
of them even the Liberal side was split.  If the Reform Members 
had stayed at the subcommittee three of the amendments could have 
passed, but we lost everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House we spent all day listening to speeches about 
Bill C-68.  Personally I feel it is a waste of taxpayers' money 
because when members of the Reform Party had the chance to change 
some of the amendments they walked out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there was a big rally on the Hill.  From my office I could 
see the people.  I sympathize with all Canadians because I 
support them and I am one of them.  I do not know how many people 
there were at the rally.  There may have been 5,000 or more.  I 
support them and I will keep supporting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am against gun control, but it is law now.  Why can we not 
work together to try to change some of the provisions within the 
law to make it easier for people like me and many other Canadians 
who live in rural areas to own a firearm? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party come to the House and advocate one 
thing, but when they go outside it is another story.  They tell 
Canadians that they are on their side and they are fighting to 
repeal gun control, but at the subcommittee they walked out, 
saying it was not an important issue for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on here?  It is a waste of taxpayers' money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the speech we just heard was a complete misrepresentation of the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has led the charge in opposition to Bill C-68. 
There is a Reform Party motion before the House today to repeal 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only comment I have for the hon. member from the 
Conservative Party is that if he is concerned about taxpayers' 
dollars why is he in a party that jacked up government spending 
and the size of the federal government from about $88 billion a 
year when Mulroney took office to about $120 billion a year when 
he left?   Why did it crank up deficits that started to exceed 
$40 billion a year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is interested in saving taxpayers' money?  It is certainly 
not the Conservative Party.  It, I might add, is comparable to 
the sinking </I>Titanic<I>.  It is impossible to plug the holes. 
The ship is going down and the only reason that anybody is still 
in the Conservative Party is because when a ship sinks there is 
always somebody left on it when it hits the bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is sad that a member 
of the Reform Party would talk like that about the Conservative 
Party.  After all, we are a national party, whereas the Reform 
Party is just a regional party.  When it comes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member knows full well that the Reform Party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point 
of order, that is a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to answer the 
member of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not talk very much about gun control.  He talked about 
the waste of the Conservative Party when it was in power. Since I 
have been a member of parliament we have all criticized the 
Liberals because of the waste they have created since 1993.  I 
sympathize with all opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party thinks it is number one because it is the 
official opposition.  It has criticized the government at every 
chance.

hall.  After the election he moved into Stornoway and wasted $1 
million of taxpayers' money to renovate it.  This year he is 
going to waste another $230,000.  The Reform Party has nothing to 
show the Conservative Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
we could get back to the business at hand, I have a comment and a 
question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comment is to state that one of the primary reasons I 
supported Bill C-68 and continue to support it is due to the 
request of the Canadian Police Association.  As the front line 
officers dealing with law enforcement in this country, the 
Canadian Police Association supported Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is a lot of controversy over their position.  I 
would like to read from a letter dated February 19, 1996 from 
Scott Newark, the executive officer of the Canadian Police 
Association, to myself, where he indicates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of gun control is one on which we have expressed 
opinions over the years.  Indeed, we approached the current 
government on enforcement aspects as early as December 1993.  We 
were alerted to the fact that the government was considering 
changes along the lines of Bill C-68 and thus, at our Annual 
General Meeting in August of 1994 we struck a National Panel to 
examine the issues in the specific areas contemplated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group met and presented its report to our Executive Board 
Meeting in March of 1995.  Following this, our delegates, 
assembled from every jurisdiction in Canada— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I emphasize “every jurisdiction in Canada”— 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—(Ontario being the largest), voted.  Unlike when the Bill was 
presented in the House, our delegates were afforded the 
opportunity of voting on each item separately.  Most passed 
unanimously and registration was passed by an approximate two to 
one margin, and, as you recall, subject to two very precise 
conditions which the government met. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what the 
hon. member from the other side of the House was referring to. 
He never put his question forward.  I think he was just making a 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing I can say is that today we have a supply day 
which is dealing with Bill C-68.  I will vote in favour of 
repealing gun registration because I believe in it.  It is not 
because of the Reform Party, but because I believe in it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the debate here today 
with some interest.  I have to say, coming from Quebec, that I 
think all members know that the overwhelming majority of people 
in Quebec are not only in favour of the gun control act which was 
already adopted, but also with registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons is that there are studies that have shown 
that deaths caused by suicide or accidents can be reduced by 
limiting access.  One of the ways that we limit access is to take 
control and register guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are law-abiding will register their guns.  Those who 
are not will suffer whatever the consequences are in the 
legislation.  I think that is perfectly fair.  There are a lot of 
people who know how to drive, but do not get behind the wheel 
because their licence has been suspended, because they have lost 
merit points— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I will give the last 
minute to the hon. member for Tobique—Mactaquac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk about 
myself.  I said that I did own a gun.  I had an FAC licence. 
What more do I need?  Why do I have to register the same gun 
twice?  If that is not a tax grab, what does she call it?

our colleagues from the New Democratic Party should be shown as 
having voted in favour of Motion No. 2.  As I applied the votes, 
I regrettably did not take note of the fact that the preceding 
vote on which I asked for the application I misread their party's 
voting intention.  To correct the record, members of the New 
Democratic Party of course on the Competition Act would continue 
to have voted nay, but then when we go to Motions Nos. 2, 4, 8, 
6, 9 and 10, they voted yea.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 27 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-235, an act to amend the Competition Act (protection of 
those who purchase products from vertically integrated suppliers 
who compete with them at retail), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this private members' 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this bill was well intended.  The bill proposes to 
change the Competition Act which would prevent unfair pricing 
practices by vertically integrated suppliers, especially in the 
oil and gas industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the hon. member's reasons for bringing forth 
this legislation.  In my five years as a member of parliament I 
have received countless letters, phone calls and petitions from 
Canadians living both within and outside my riding, all 
concerning gas prices and competition between retailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both independent retailers and individual consumers have 
expressed concern over what they believe to be unfair pricing 
practices.  I believe it is the concerns of the first group, the 
independent retailers, that the hon. member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge wished to address. Unfortunately I have 
serious concerns about the bill as it may not be effective in 
serving the intended purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes to the Competition Act are intended to 
prevent vertically integrated suppliers from practising below 
cost selling when their own gas stations are competing with the 
independent retailers they also supply.  This is very important 
to ensure fair competition.  However, the Competition Act already 
prohibits this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 78(a) of the Competition Act specifically prohibits 
anti-competitive acts including “squeezing by a vertically 
integrated supplier of the margin available to an unintegrated 
customer who competes with the supplier for the purpose of 
impeding or preventing the customer's entry into or expansion in 
a market”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act also prohibits selling articles at a price 
lower than the acquisition cost for the purpose of discipline or 
eliminating a competitor.  Section 50 of the Competition Act 
outlines severe consequences for those companies guilty of 
anti-competitive acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the hon. member, I am strongly opposed to predatory 
pricing. However, I believe the Competition Act already addresses 
this issue as is.  The problem does not rest with the provisions 
or wording of the Competition Act but with the lack of vigour and 
enthusiasm with which it is enforced by the government and its 
regulators.  If large oil companies are in fact engaging in 
unfair pricing practices, a fact of which I am not convinced, 
then the fault lies with the federal government for not being 
more vigorous in enforcing existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated before, I believe the hon. member had good 
intentions in bringing Bill C-235 to the House.  When the 
committee began looking at this issue it wanted to unveil unfair 
practices including price fixing and collusion, which was a noble 
goal.  However, when the hon. member found no evidence of this, 
he switched his focus to protecting the interests of a small 
group of independent retailers, some 20% of the retail market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere in this process the interests of individual consumers, 
the very group that the hon. member set out to represent, were 
forgotten.  Therefore, believing the hon. member to be an 
individual of good conscience, I encourage him to be vigilant, 
especially with regard to the bill's potential impact on 
individual consumers.  I would implore him to give greater 
consideration to the millions of Canadians who will suffer as a 
result of government intervention and excessive regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a firm believer in fair competition in the marketplace. 
However, I am also a firm believer in the market system whereby 
market values are determined by supply, demand and corner 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that this bill if passed would result in the 
abandonment of the market system and the adoption of a floor 
price that would hinder rather than strengthen competition among 
retailers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian gasoline prices are among the lowest in the world and 
have been falling for two decades. Conversely, taxes on gasoline 
have been rising, now accounting for more than 50% of pump 
prices. This in itself is one very good reason why independent 
retailers are suffering 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both refiners and marketers of gasoline have seen their profit 
margins shrink as a result of normal competition in the 
marketplace but have also suffered the burden of government tax 
grabbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When gasoline prices are considered in isolation from taxation, 
however, it is abundantly clear that the individual consumer 
benefits from the current competition among retailers.  Pretax 
prices are lower than they have been in two decades.  The market 
system is working exceptionally well for the consumers in this 
way. Not only have gasoline prices fallen, but gasoline retailers 
have found it necessary to improve services in order to remain 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vertically integrated suppliers and independent retailers alike 
have diversified operations by building car washes, convenience 
stores and restaurants on site.  These benefits to consumers are 
on top of low gasoline prices as determined by the market forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this bill would protect the most vulnerable, the 
independent retailer, but I fear that it would also establish a 
floor price for gasoline much higher than the price determined by 
market forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the province of Quebec is considering establishing a 
floor price for gasoline in that province.  Quebec Professor 
Alain Lapointe has been studying the issue of gas pricing and 
estimates that the floor price would cost Quebec consumers 
anywhere from $140 million to $280 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far I have discussed the negative implications of this bill. 
In fairness to the bill and to the hon. member from 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, however, I think it is equally as 
important to consider the long term impacts should independent 
retailers be forced out of the market.  This is one of the hon. 
member's concerns and I share that concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even so, I am concerned about the effects the proposed 
legislation will have on other industries.  To this point, 
changes to the Competition Act have been discussed almost 
exclusively in terms of their impact on gasoline prices. This is 
primarily because the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge 
has targeted major oil companies in his argument.  However, if 
accepted by the members of this House, the changes proposed by 
this legislation would reach much further in their application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means Canadians would not only face higher prices for 
gasoline but could face higher prices for electronic equipment, 
cars and a multitude of other products.  Canadians would also 
face the inefficiencies of further government intervention and 
control in their lives.  The successful operation of the market 
requires that market forces be allowed to run their course.  The 
successful operation of the market also requires fair competition 
whereby predatory pricing and abuse of dominant position are 
prohibited by law and this law is vigorously enforced. The market 
system has operated well thus far, resulting in the declining 
pretax gasoline price for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act explicitly prohibits predatory pricing below 
cost selling and abuse of dominant position.  By my estimates 
this means that the conditions necessary for successful operation 
of the market should already be in place. Unfortunately, it 
appears as though the market is not operating successfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the hon. member opposite to take a hard look at the 
influence of his own party on market prices.  Federal and 
provincial taxes average 28.6 cents per litre which is more than 
50% of the pump price. That is 28.6 cents per litre less for the 
retailer. The lower the retailer's profit margin, the greater the 
difficulty to survive.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is truly committed to protecting the 
independent retailer taxes should be reduced.  With lower taxes 
and greater profit margins the independent retailers would be 
better positioned to compete with the large oil companies and to 
diversify their operations in order to meet the ever changing 
needs of their consumer base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by commending the hon. member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for his efforts.  I appreciate his 
vigour and determination.  I encourage him to continue his 
struggle, albeit in a somewhat different direction.  Instead of 
pursuing a solution that would potentially hurt the consumer, I 
suggest he try to encourage his Liberal colleagues for more 
vigorous enforcement of existing laws and clearer definitions 
within those laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have concerns with this bill I see the merit in 
highlighting this issue and hope that in the future the hon. 
member and I will be able to study this issue from the same side 
of the fence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this effect, Mr. Speaker, I think you will find unanimous 
consent for the following motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move: 
<A NAME="LINK257">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-235, an act to amend the Competition Act, not be read 
a second time, but that the order be discharged, the bill 
withdrawn, and the subject matter thereof referred to the 
Standing Committee on Industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The amendment is in 
order.  The debate is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today I am addressing the House on the 
subject of private member's Bill C-235, an act to amend the 
Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to state my full support for this much needed bill. 
I wish to congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, for seeing this bill to second reading 
and for the work of his committee on behalf of all Canadians, 
especially our small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, this bill would provide for the enforcement of fair 
pricing between a manufacturer that sells a product at retail 
either directly or through an affiliate and who also supplies 
product to a customer who competes with the supplier at the 
retail level.  This provides a supplier's customer with a fair 
opportunity to make a similar profit as the supplier at the 
retail level in a given market area.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A supplier who tries to force a customer to set a certain retail 
price on marketing policy may under this bill face a fine, 
imprisonment or both.  Bill C-235 would establish a clear 
legislative basis for the enforcement of industry wide fair 
pricing policies.  That is why I believe the proposed legislation 
would go a long way toward repairing the industry's battered 
image among the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am so concerned about gas prices today is there can 
only be one winner or loser at the gas pump and that is the 
consumer.  Unfortunately a summer's worth of rapidly changing 
prices at the pumps has only served to frustrate and anger 
consumer in my riding of Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale as 
well as those living both in Ontario and across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a doubt gasoline pricing is a politically sensitive 
issue and will remain so until certain problems within the system 
are addressed.  After all, gasoline prices are probably the most 
advertised prices in Canada. Every citizen sees them every day 
and often is shocked when they suddenly go up.  Unfortunately 
normal supply and demand economics cannot account for the large 
price swings that Canadians see at the pumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though the committee on gas pricing's report concluded that 
price fixing and collusion do not occur, it added that it does 
not occur because it does not have to.  All a station manager has 
to do is look at his competitor's sign and match his price. 
Indeed price signs on retail outlets can be an easy way for 
market participants to achieve the same results without having 
the resort to any illegal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, I would like to make it clear that there remains too much 
mystery surrounding the relationship between the refining and the 
retail operations of integrated companies such as Shell and 
Imperial Oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is greater transparency within the industry since 
as things stand now very few Canadians have any idea how much 
these big companies charge their own stations.  There is still a 
lot of smoke and mirrors within the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again acknowledge the tremendous initiative and leadership 
demonstrated on this matter by our colleague, the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge.  This member not only helped to create 
the caucus committee on gasoline pricing, he also agreed to be 
our chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235 would give the customer a fair opportunity to make a 
profit similar to that of the supplier, hence ending the practice 
known throughout the industry as unfair pricing. Since that is 
what the bill aims to resolve I wish to call on my fellow members 
of parliament to join me in support of Bill C-235. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to discuss the 
gas pricing issue in the House yet one more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to stand and support the referral to committee of 
Bill C-235 sponsored by the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
It is a bill which has merit.  It is a bill which will provide 
some competition seriously lacking now in the gasoline pricing 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to provide a much needed first step 
to implementing a predatory pricing definition in the Competition 
Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT96"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT96"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1830
<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a definition that makes sense to non-integrated or what 
we like to call independent gasoline retailers who compete 
against the vertically integrated or the large corporate 
marketers.  It is the first step in re-establishing some retail 
competition which, at this moment, is on the verge of breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act was watered down significantly by the 
Conservative government of Mr. Brian Mulroney.  We used to have a 
bill called the Combines Investigation Act.  That bill gave 
regulators the power to investigate if they suspected predatory 
pricing or price fixing in the marketplace in gasoline or other 
commodities.  They had the power to go into a company suspected 
of price fixing or predatory pricing and take the files for 
investigative purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened was that Mr. Mulroney wanted to change that 
because the large corporations made huge contributions to his 
party.  In response he said “I am going to let you fix prices, 
so I will repeal the Combines Investigation Act and set up what 
we will call the Competition Act”.  I call it, and many of my 
constituents call it, the “lack of competition act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really a monopoly act.  It provides large corporations 
with the unfettered ability to do whatever they want in terms of 
pricing goods and services in this country.  The reason I say 
that is because I have worked with the oil industry for a number 
of years, in particular on the issue of gas pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill which is before the House is a very important.  It 
tries to change the lack of competition in the current act to 
make it a more competitive act by providing a definition of 
predatory pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the act there is a very small section outlining predatory 
pricing.  None of the people who have been charged under this 
clause have been found guilty by the courts.  The reason is that 
the definition is so narrow and so precise that it really does 
not provide any flexibility to gather evidence to prove the 
charges laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compare that to the United States of America, the most 
capitalistic society and economy in our world.  They have pages 
and pages in their legislation on predatory pricing and other 
anti-competitive acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-eight states in the United States of America have 
predatory pricing practice protection for their consumers.  What 
do we have in Canada?  Zippo.  We have nothing here for our 
consumers.  That is a very worrisome development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge has 
recognized this and has gathered some support in terms of having 
the committee review it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out a few things about the independent retail 
gasoline marketers who are shrinking in numbers.  They are the 
people who market gasoline or heating oil.  They retail under 
their own brand and do not own a refinery.  They operate under a 
type of joint venture agreement with a refiner marketer who is a 
vertically integrated company, such as Imperial Oil, Irving Oil 
or Shell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Defined in this way, independents refer to the group that 
includes large retailers, such as Canadian Tire or the Olco 
Petroleum Group, Sunny's Petroleum, as well as a number of 
smaller businesses that operate only one or a few gasoline 
outlets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past eight years have seen increasingly difficult times for 
independent marketers who are attempting to remain viable in a 
market controlled by the major refiner marketers, the companies I 
referred to earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, several retailers have either sold all or parts of 
their chains, or they have entered into partnerships with a major 
oil company, for example, Pioneer or United Cooperative Ontario, 
or they have left the business voluntarily or through bankruptcy. 
Some examples are Safeway, Payrite, Gas Rite and Mohawk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the non-affiliated independents' market share has 
dropped dramatically in most provinces across Canada.  During 
this time all major refiner marketers have increased direct 
market share and control over the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to use some statistics which are quite illustrative of 
what I have just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, in the province of Alberta, the independent market 
share was 27.8%.  In 1997 it was 20.1%, a decline of 25% in five 
years. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT97"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT97"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1835
<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, with the recent sale of Mohawk to Husky Oil, Alberta 
will see a further decline of 6.3%, down to 13.8%, which from 
1992 to 1999 will mean a 55% drop in market share of independents 
in Alberta.  In those five years alone this lack of competition 
has cost Alberta consumers about $80 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan, in 1992, the independent market share was 
20.6%.  That is now down to 15.1% of the market, or a decline of 
25% in five years.  Where has the market share gone?  To the 
major multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very alarming because once that market share gets to a 
point where it is not relevant, these independent retailers will 
cease to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a small business person by profession.  I see these people 
as small or medium enterprises trying to make a living, but also 
providing competition and some price options for consumers and 
businesses.  But as the market share declines with respect to the 
independents, we no longer have competition.  We have monopoly 
pricing.  It is pretty much the same in Manitoba in terms of the 
decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing are independents who have to buy wholesale 
price gasoline at the pumps.  Of course when there is a bit of a 
war on, when the major retailers want to get rid of the 
independents, they drop the price below what the independents 
purchase at the pumps.  The independents carry on for as long as 
they can, but eventually they go bankrupt or they sell out to 
larger companies in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the people who are listening that what we have 
here is a bill which is very supportable.  It is something that 
will enhance and improve the Competition Act as we know it.  It 
will indeed provide some competition.  But why has the Liberal 
Party or the Conservative Party not supported this kind of 
initiative?  Many Liberal members support it, but the majority 
will vote it down.  I hope I am wrong, but that is my suspicion. 
I think it is because the major oil companies provide huge, 
substantial political contributions to the Liberal Party and to 
the Conservative Party.  One can only conclude that if those 
parties are getting huge contributions they will allow the oil 
companies to do as they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of gasoline pricing is quite phenomenal.  I want to 
make one reference to my home province, Saskatchewan.  We have 
seen the price of oil at the wellhead decline by approximately 
50% year over year.  It has been sustained for six or seven 
months now in this country.  It is down to $11 to $13 a barrel, 
depending on which day you are looking at.  It used to be $25 
about a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen in this country is that in some areas the 
price of gasoline does not go down.  The refiners keep the price 
high.  They are making huge margins on their sales and everybody 
else pays the fare.  What we have seen is that in Saskatchewan 
the price of gasoline has been inordinately high throughout the 
last six months of this low oil price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled across the country and I have talked to people 
across this country.  Saskatchewan has the same provincial sales 
tax as British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and the Maritimes.  We 
pay between 3 cents and 9 cents a litre more in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been raising this issue in my province.  I had a visit 
from Petro-Canada, my good friends, and they showed me all these 
graphs and told me how they are hard done by.  They said “The 
reason it is lower in other provinces is because of volume”.  I 
said “Why do the prices go up in the springtime in Saskatchewan 
when the farmers need the fuel for seeding?  That is more volume 
and the prices go up.  Why does that happen?”  They cannot 
answer that.  It is the same in the fall with the harvest.  It is 
just pure price gouging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my sense that we need some competition in this country. It 
is my sense that we need this amendment to the Competition Act. 
It is my sense as well that we need support for my private 
member's bill, to be coming before this House hopefully before 
long, which calls for the establishment of an energy price review 
commission.  That will assist the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge in his efforts to make sure that oil 
companies are charging consumers fair prices.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to support Bill C-235, a bill that would 
mandate that major oil companies selling gasoline to independents 
would have to sell it to independents at the same price that they 
sell it to their own branded dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the good pleasure of working with the member of 
parliament for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge on this initiative and I 
would like to commend him for his leadership on gasoline pricing 
and for chairing a task force that he put together.  I was 
fortunate enough to work with him on that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might ask “What is the concern?  If independents are 
charged for gasoline at a different price they can go to someone 
else.  Instead of buying from Esso they could go to Shell or 
Petro-Canada”.  The problem is that the wholesale market is very 
much a homogeneous market.  It is controlled by three or four 
major companies:  Petro-Canada, Shell, Esso and Ultramar.  There 
is really one wholesale price that is driven by what they call 
the rack price.  I will touch on that briefly later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There really are not many choices, so it is imperative that the 
independents are charged the same price as the branded dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we set up this task force we met with Canadians all across 
Canada.  In my own riding of Etobicoke North we had a meeting on 
January 23.  There were representatives from the Etobicoke 
Chamber of Commerce, the gas dealers, trucking companies and 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we consistently heard across Canada is that Canadians want 
fair gasoline pricing.  They are concerned also about the long 
weekend pricing and the volatility of pricing, but they really 
want a competitive and open market for gasoline pricing to ensure 
that prices are fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, looking at gasoline prices right now, they really are 
not that bad.  But the problem is that if the independent 
gasoline dealer is eliminated in Canada, then prices in the short 
run might be low but we will be burdened later with higher prices 
through this sort of oligopolistic market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve the goal of allowing independents the room to 
operate, to make a fair profit and to survive in a very 
competitive industry is a very challenging and daunting task. 
The independent gasoline dealers are really squeezed by the major 
oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the oil industry there is a high level of concentration. 
There are now only 18 refineries in Canada, down from about 44 in 
1960. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If I may beg the 
indulgence of the hon. member for Etobicoke North, a little 
earlier the hon. member for Athabasca moved an amendment and I 
did not bring it to the attention of the House appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now asking for the unanimous consent of the House to revert 
to where we were before I erroneously read the motion.  Does the 
Chair have the unanimous consent of the House to revisit the 
motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It has been moved by 
the hon. member for Athabasca that Bill C-235, an act to amend 
the Competition Act, be not now read the second time, but that 
the order be discharged, the bill withdrawn and the subject 
matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee on Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent of the House for this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is not 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was describing the large 
degree of concentration in the oil industry.  In Toronto, for 
example, 75% to 85% of all retail gasoline sold is priced by the 
major oil companies through controlled operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major oil companies say that at the retail level the 
competition is very fierce and intensive and the economics are 
very poor.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The independents are certainly struggling and fighting for 
market share against the majors.  The independents do not have 
some of the opportunities which some of the major companies have. 
They are unable to develop the ancillary services that a lot of 
the major oil companies are doing today:  car washes, convenience 
stores, et cetera.  They cannot access the capital to do these 
types of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks will not touch the independent retailer of gasoline 
because they are concerned about how long they will be in 
business and what they call site remediation or environmental 
problems with sites.  The small independents cannot get capital 
from the banks.  The banks have said categorically that they will 
not look at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the majors?  Are they making money at the retail 
level?  They say they are not, but if we look at their annual 
statements we could not tell because that information is just not 
provided.  Even if we could decipher that from their annual 
statements, the fact is that major oil companies price the 
product right through the whole chain.  They are integrated oil 
companies so they explore, drill, extract, refine, market and 
retail.  These are big oil companies such as ESSO and Shell. They 
control the price at the wholesale level which they call the rack 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say they have to charge the rack price at a certain level 
because they are concerned about product substitution from the 
United States.  In other words, if they price their product too 
high, independent retailers and others would import gasoline from 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our consultations we discovered that in theory that is 
interesting but in actual fact there are the problems of 
importing gasoline, particularly in eastern Ontario and other 
parts of Ontario.  They are faced with transportation costs, a 
lack of storage and terminal infrastructure, and a lot of red 
tape and bureaucracy.  In my view one would need at least an 8 
cent per litre spread to make it worth while to import gas from 
the United States.  I think the argument of product substitution 
is a little weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1991 many independents have unfortunately left the Ontario 
market.  There could be a short term benefit for Ontario 
consumers because of the kind of pricing that goes on in the 
marketplace.  What about the medium and long term?  We have some 
evidence to show what happens in cases like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Brunswick and Newfoundland where there are very few 
independents the prices at the pump are among the highest in 
Canada.  What my colleague's bill addresses is referred to as 
predatory pricing, in other words pricing designed to put others 
out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are industry experts who believe that major oil companies 
are trying to squeeze out the independents.  I would just like to 
cite a study by Bloomberg's which reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—major oil companies were going to use price wars, new credit 
terms, and the strategic closure of service stations and 
refineries to squeeze independent gasoline retailers out of the 
market in central Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another study by ScotiaMcLeod suggested: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set the stage for a better downstream environment beginning in 
1993, it is our opinion that Imperial Oil Ltd. has put a strategy 
in place in 1992 to discipline the retail markets, with the aim 
directed at the independents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise Wood Gundy stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imperial, Shell Canada Ltd. and Petro-Canada Inc. have targeted 
the country's independent marketers as being their most effective 
competition and with the current wave of rationalization, are 
trying to get their cost structure down to the same level as 
independents, who enjoy a two to four cent per litre advantage 
over the majors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is because of their lower cost structure.  They do not have 
all the overheads to support.  I think my colleague's bill 
addresses very well the question of predatory pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to talk very briefly about the Competition Act 
and the competition bureau.  Many Canadians have complained to 
the bureau and the bureau because of the legislation conducts its 
investigations by seeking meetings among the majors, and even at 
the local level, where they sit around at Tim Horton's and set 
prices.  That does not have to happen because there are few at 
that level.  They are price leaders and price followers.  They do 
not have to sit around and discuss and decide on prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need some beefing up of the Competition Act and to change the 
criminal burden to more of a civil burden.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I sum up by saying Bill C-235 if passed would 
protect the independents we need to ensure a competitive 
marketplace.  By ensuring that the integrated oil companies 
priced their product to independents at the same price they 
charge their own dealers we would ensure good prices for gasoline 
in Canada and for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill C-235, an act 
to amend the Competition Act, the protection of those who 
purchase products from vertically integrated suppliers who 
compete with them at retail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a long way of saying let us go after the gasoline 
companies and try to score some easy political points.  The 
problem is that it is not that simple.  It is not that easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with the bill in a thoughtful manner and outline 
the many serious concerns my party has with it.  Canada has been 
oblivious to the issues addressed by the bill.  The Competition 
Act implemented by the previous Conservative government to 
replace the Anti-Combines Act deals with the inherent issues of 
Bill C-235 without making any amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues of price discrimination, price maintenance and abuse 
of dominance are already addressed by the act.  Let us deal with 
the issue of fair pricing first.  The problem with the 
legislation is that it would create an artificial profit margin 
by gearing pricing to competitors based on any formula that 
includes retail pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would be creating a floor price below which no one 
could go.  The elimination of the ability to engage in 
discounting would be a peculiar approach to addressing fair 
pricing.  The result would in fact be higher prices, which 
certainly is not in the best interest of the Canadian consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has already overburdened small and medium 
size businesses across the country with outrageous reporting 
requirements either in the area of sales tax, payroll tax, 
Statistics Canada or any other number of government bureaucracies 
or agencies that enforce different degrees of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislators must begin searching for ways to ease the paperwork 
burden and let Canadian businesses get back to their core 
services.  This would not happen under Bill C-235.  In fact the 
opposite would be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine how the government could possibly begin tackling 
the issue of what constitutes proper wholesale prices, profit 
margins and marketing expenses of firms.  Quite simply it could 
not be done.  We would be creating another level of bureaucracy, 
an extra burden of government, an enormous enforcement cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about another implication of the bill.  If a 
vertically integrated company sells only a small portion of its 
product to independent outlets, what would happen?  Will it 
submit to the burdensome review process it is required to go 
through in order to change its prices?  I suspect it would not. 
In fact it would be my guess that it would cease selling to 
competitors at all.  This would lead to a very negative impact on 
the independent retailers that my hon. colleague seeks to 
champion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally this comes down to whether or not governments 
should be trying to interfere in those affected industries or 
allowing market forces to prevail.  The fact is that price 
regulations work well when prices are on the rise, but they do 
not work well when they are coming down.  We would in effect be 
artificially skewering the marketplace to favour small 
independent companies over the interest of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address something that was raised the last time 
the bill came before the House on May 27 of this year.  At that 
time the hon. member for Palliser rose to give his support to the 
bill.  In so doing the spectre was raised of the Irving Oil 
Company.  It was as if the mere mention of this bogeyman should 
be enough to rally support for the bill.  While I understand the 
rabid hatred the NDP harbours toward successful Canadian 
companies, Irving Oil Company Limited does not sell gasoline to 
its competitors so it would not be affected by this legislation. 
That is why facts get in the way of good speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the bill is generic in its wording, but it is clear 
that it will have a great impact on the retail gas industry.  The 
result would be to abandon market based forces as the proper 
determinate of gasoline prices and instead move to a cost based 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who sponsored the bill is well known for his 
tendency to do battle with oil companies. 
Motivations aside, I am fearful that the implications to other 
industries have not been fully thought through.  He would not 
want to inadvertently undermine another industry out of some sort 
of zealous drive to take on the oil companies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final issue I wish to discuss is that of alternatives to the 
bill.  During the last session of debate it was mentioned over 
and over again that many of the provisions of Bill C-235 already 
exist in the present Competition Act.  They are sections of the 
Competition Act which relate to abusive dominance and price 
maintenance.  Sections 50.1(c) and 78 on their own without any 
amendments are currently drafted in a manner which addresses the 
issues raised by Bill C-235. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Predatory pricing, which is defined as selling products at 
prices unreasonably low, has the effect of substantially 
lessening competition or pricing aimed at eliminating or impeding 
the expansion of a competitor, is a criminal offence under the 
act as it now stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, abusive dominance in situations where substantial 
lessening of competition results is a civil provision.  One of 
the subsections of that provision deals specifically with the 
issue of dominance of vertically integrated firms squeezing the 
profit margin available to non-integrated customers and competing 
with the suppliers for the purpose of impeding or preventing the 
customers' entry into or expansion in the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even without the reassurance that comes from these provisions my 
hon. colleague should take comfort in the M. J. Ervin report 
which shows that since 1994 Canada has enjoyed retail gasoline 
prices that on a pre-tax basis are among the lowest in the world. 
Whereas the pump price of gasoline is made up of more than 50% 
excise taxes, maybe the member's time would be better spent 
lobbying his own government to reduce these if he wants to see a 
real benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to appear to be advocating a laissez-faire 
approach to industry.  However, I prefer to see legislation that 
creates an environment where businesses can operate and flourish 
under normal marketing conditions.  This is not a component of 
Bill C-235.  In effect it would be shackling the marketplace with 
a central command approach to economic questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the Competition Act must be above all else 
focused on achieving desirable results for our consumers.  It 
should not be used to undermine the legitimate outcome of 
competition such as low prices. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
just want to make mention of a point for my hon. colleague from 
Markham.  Unless I am wrong or unless he wants to prove me wrong, 
absolutely no part of the Competition Act addresses the 
definition or standard of what constitutes predation or predatory 
activity.  Therefore the act is deficient.  That is what we are 
trying to address in the debate and with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge.  I suggest again to the member for 
Markham that he is not known for fighting oil companies.  He is 
known for fighting for consumers.  I think his track record in 
that regard is extremely admirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last sitting I had the very informative experience of 
participating in the Liberal caucus committee on gasoline 
pricing.  Members will notice a lot of the speakers from this 
side shared that experience.  Many of the opinions that I have in 
support of the bill were developed through that process.  It was 
a long and laborious process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the focus of the bill would seem to be the petroleum 
industry.  I must say that one of the most emotional components 
of the gasoline pricing committee was the testimonials from 
independents who were at the brink of collapse or who had 
collapsed because of declining margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all fairness we are seeing the downside of consolidation in a 
number of retail sectors.  The corner hardware store comes to 
mind.  I honestly felt at the time, as I do now, that something 
was not working in the case of gasoline retailing.  Although this 
bill has its roots in the petroleum industry, it is a timely 
debate to have as the forces of globalization and centralization 
begin to impact virtually any economic sector with high levels of 
vertical integration combined with oligopolistic market 
structure, which what we have in the gasoline-petroleum industry 
in Canada.  We are not only talking about the petroleum industry 
because deregulation will cause us to have similar concerns and 
similar debates in the telecommunications industry, the 
information technology industry, the travel industry, utilities 
and the financial services sector, just to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues talk about the role that taxes have in 
reducing margins. 
Taxes in this country are based on per litre, not price.  They 
are a fixed cost.  The debate over taxes may be valid but it is 
not a reason or it is not a contributing factor to forcing 
independents out of business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface this discussion obviously seems to be a classic 
debate between those who advocate free market and those who 
advocate government regulation.  There are larger issues here 
that need to be examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members across the way point out, the current federal 
Competition Act provides for criminal sanctions against persons 
involved in agreements or actions that unduly lessen competition. 
The burden of proof in the Competition Act is that predatory 
pricing and price discrimination must be proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  In large part because of this burden of proof, 
very few cases make it through the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paradox is that although we recognize the seriousness of 
anti-competitive behaviour by enshrining the offence in the 
Criminal Code, that high standard as opposed to, as was 
suggested, a civil code standard make enforcement of the 
regulations very difficult. It is not always easy to distinguish 
competitive from anti-competitive practices.  There is nothing 
wrong with tough competition even from a dominant firm, but when 
its intention is to eliminate competition or prevent entry into 
or expansion in a market, there could be an abuse of that 
dominant position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this bill necessary?  Traditional approaches to defining 
predatory pricing use costs as a measure of intent.  In most 
cases pricing above total average costs results in non-predatory 
practices.  Pricing below average variable cost is likely to be 
treated as predatory in the absence of some clear justification. 
If a company is selling off inventory that is perishable, then it 
is justified in doing that.  But it is prices between average 
variable and average total costs that are the grey area.  They do 
not even get looked at because of the high standard in the 
Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with vertically integrated companies is that the 
seamless nature of their operations, the womb to tomb continuum 
that they enjoy makes it very difficult to clearly define and 
allocate costs at specific points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this amendment does is it takes the focus away from the 
allusive and historically futile endeavour of trying to prove 
predation based on costs and puts it on price, the wholesale and 
retail prices of the supplier in relation to an independent that 
purchases product from that supplier.  What could be clearer?  My 
hon. colleague says that would be impossible.  It is hanging on 
the street. Price we know; price is public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the focus on the petroleum industry?  First of all gasoline 
is not a discretionary purchase for most Canadians.  It is a cost 
of living.  We all know that.  When the price spikes up, we get 
the calls.  There are few substitutes for gasoline powered 
automobiles in the market today.  Putting my environmental 
sentiments aside for a moment, the price of gas is an economic 
issue to most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from octane level and a few product variations such as 
ethanol, there is little if any opportunity for independent 
retailers to differentiate the product once they purchase it 
wholesale.  They are at the mercy of low brand loyalty.  And 
there are significant barriers to entry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion that the loss of an independent gas retailer is only 
a slight temporary adjustment and that any attempts by the 
dominant firms to increase margins will be offset by new 
entrants, classical economic theory, goes out the window here. 
The classic self-policing concept of competition does not apply. 
The current players are simply too big.  We need to recognize 
this concentration and ensure that we protect fair competition at 
the retail level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries are also trying to come to grips with these 
changing market forces.  The French government amended its law in 
1996 to make predatory pricing an infringement on its own 
regardless of any issue of dominance.  The Americans, the keepers 
of the capitalist faith, have recognized this risk and have put 
in place statutory variations of divorce legislation that limit 
the percentage of retail operations a vertically integrated 
supplier can own.  It is not because they see this as an 
intervention of the government into a free and competitive 
market, but as a necessary action to ensure the long term 
viability of a free and competitive market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the pressures of globalization put pressure on companies to 
grow through mergers, the accompanying concentration makes 
vertical integration a viable and sensible strategy.  In order to 
protect consumers and promote effective competition, federal 
legislation must not simply prevent companies from pursuing 
growth strategies.  That growth must come from the effective 
implementation of a solid marketing strategy and not simply 
disadvantaging competitors by exploiting proprietary control over

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this bill will allow the intent of the 
Competition Act to be enforced by setting a benchmark for 
predatory practices that is both public and workable.

hon. member for Cambridge will have six minutes and will be able 
to carry over another four minutes, but he has six minutes at 
this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to have the opportunity to debate this important bill 
which was introduced by the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act was designed to promote competition and 
efficiency in the Canadian marketplace.  It sets out a basic code 
of conduct for businesses in this country and covers criminal 
offences such as conspiracy, discriminatory and predatory 
pricing, price maintenance, misleading advertising and deceptive 
marketing practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However based on what I have been hearing from my constituents 
in Cambridge, the Competition Act is not protecting consumers in 
the case of the gas industry.  Very real concerns remain about 
what has been happening in this sector.  In fact these concerns 
have been growing.  There has been much debate over the issue of 
gasoline pricing.  Independent gas retailers and many consumers 
believe that the major oil companies are using their dominant 
position in the marketplace to set out prices which adversely 
affect competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a town hall meeting in my riding of Cambridge, consumers, 
trucking companies and independent retailers all expressed 
frustration over fluctuating gas prices.  We know that across the 
country gas prices prior to long weekends and during summer 
vacations go up and in midweek they go down. Sometimes retail 
outlets owned by the major companies charge less for their gas 
than the independent retailers purchase it for but the price 
mysteriously goes up again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major companies say that this practice is because of the low 
supply of gasoline, production problems and of course the 
refinery shutdowns. I do not believe that Canadians, including 
myself, buy that argument.  When there is a frost in Florida 
the price of oranges does not go up only over the weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the Liberal committee on gasoline pricing 
which travelled throughout Canada.  Time and time again we heard 
from independent gasoline retailers how truly difficult it is to 
stay in business when the supplier they are competing against is 
the same person who sets the cost at which they are going to 
receive the supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if a supplier wants to increase his market share at 
your expense or the Canadian taxpayers' expense, it is not hard 
to predict that the independent retailer will be out of business 
in a very short time. This is the story of the bully on the block 
who is bigger and stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many complaints have been filed with the Competition Bureau 
about unfair practices.  Unfortunately we hear from the 
Competition Bureau that it does not have the tools to resolve 
these ongoing complaints.  We must give the bureau those tools 
and this bill is doing exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The holes in the Competition Act have been identified by others. 
We know that in 1986 the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission 
recommended that the federal government take steps to determine 
the limits of appropriate pricing in the specific dual 
distribution context of the petroleum industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Brunswick all-party committee also looked into the 
operation of the petroleum industry.  In 1997 it issued a report 
which stated that the Competition Act has little effect in 
preventing discriminatory pricing or predatory pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from the committee when it was travelling that consumers 
and independents in New Brunswick and Newfoundland have been 
squeezed out. Surprise, surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am aware that I have another minute but I could 
go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge all members of the House to support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 27, 
1998, I rose in my place to ask the government to review its 
practices concerning disability benefits.  In Bill C-2 introduced 
at the beginning of this Parliament, the Liberals turned their 
backs on those living with a disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their program-slashing frenzy, this government attacked our 
society's most vulnerable members, those living with a 
disability. 
The government expects to cut $1 billion in disability benefits 
between now and 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the appeal process.  It takes three to 
four months for the first-level appeal to be heard.  The second 
stage, the appeal to the review tribunal, takes six months.  The 
third level of appeal, to the appeal board, takes one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of one of my constituents, Jean-Marie 
Doiron.  An accident when he was 21 left him in a wheelchair. 
That was 40 years ago.  Jean-Marie worked throughout this period. 
He did what he could.  During the last 14 years, he repaired 
school textbooks.  On turning 60, Jean-Marie decided to apply for 
the Canada Pension Plan.  His doctor decided he should leave the 
work force because of his handicap eight months after his 60th 
birthday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, because more than six months had elapsed since he had 
applied to the CPP for disability benefits, he was turned down. 
Jean-Marie took his appeal to the first level and won.  But the 
government told him it would go to the appeal board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean-Marie has already been waiting one year, and will have to 
wait one more before his case is heard.  There are already 
several cases like his in the works.  It is unbelievable that 
people are treated this way by the Government of Canada.  It is 
unbelievable that the government goes after the most vulnerable 
citizens, those who have worked for our country, people like 
Jean-Marie Doiron, who has been in a wheelchair for the last 40 
years and who cannot get CPP benefits, despite all the 
legislation governing the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the Government of Canada to amend the disability 
benefit eligibility criteria. 
In addition, this government should do something about the 
appeal process so that it does not take Canadians three years to 
get disability benefits.  It is high time that this government 
demonstrated its commitment to those living with a handicap.

<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government is very concerned about all issues involving persons 
with disabilities.  We are equally concerned about client service 
because timely service is one of the fundamental responsibilities 
of Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the length of time to process CPP disability 
applications, it is important to point out that over the last 
decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number of 
applications.  This rise was due to a number of factors, including 
changes in eligibility rules, referral of cases to us by private 
insurance companies, as well as some provincial social service 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This put a tremendous strain on departmental resources as well 
as on the CPP review tribunal and the pensions appeals board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1996 report the auditor general raised concerns about the 
rapid increase in CPP disability expenditures.  As a result, 
changes to the administration of disability benefits were 
introduced to ensure that the benefits were granted only to those 
for whom they were originally intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  We are attacking the problem.  We have already 
taken action.  We have recruited and trained new staff and we 
have taken staff from other areas to address the workload.  We 
have moved the first level of appeal to regional centres.  This 
will reduce the time required to obtain correct information from 
clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also working with the administration of the CPP review 
tribunal and the pensions appeals board to improve service.  For 
example, we have increased the number of judges and panel members 
in order to enable us to hold more hearings and to use a better 
scheduling system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Thornhill, our new 
parliamentary secretary to the health minister.  As a former 
minister of the crown in the province of Ontario, I am sure she 
will do a good job.  I am glad to see her there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few points I want to make in relation to a question 
I asked the minister before the House rose in June. It had to 
deal with the 1994 decision by the Government of Canada to reduce 
taxes on cigarettes.  This was the biggest capitulation by the 
Government of Canada in the history of Canada and led to the 
largest increase in the number of new smokers in the history of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I am concerned about it is that 40,000 Canadians a year die 
as a direct result of smoking.  That is a statistic that can be 
proven by any measure. It is not an exaggeration.  We know 40,000 
Canadians a year die from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I suggested the government do, which it has not, is have a 
three pronged approach to attacking smoking, especially with 
young Canadians.  It has to attack pricing, that is taxation.  It 
has to attack advertising and, most important, there has to be 
education out there so that young smokers know what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the interesting things happening and one of the most 
interesting bills introduced in parliament in recent history is a 
bill introduced by none other than Senator Colin Kenny, an 
example of how much the Senate can contribute to the Parliament 
of Canada when decides to do so.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he is suggesting is that we should have a levy of 50 cents 
per pack on cigarettes.  He is calling this a levy because 
technically he cannot call it a taxation measure.  Normally a 
senator cannot introduce a taxation measure.  That 50 cent levy 
would bring in revenues to the tune of over $100 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $100 million would be broken down to be spent in the 
following ways. Some would be used to assist farmers moving out 
of tobacco crop. Millions would be used to educate young 
Canadians as to why they should not start smoking. Some of it 
would be used for the arts and sports programs that now depend on 
funding from the cigarette manufacturers, which I think is 
absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to do something and take some 
strong measures to combat smoking.  It is a big problem.  I would 
love to get into the details of Senator Kenny's bill but I do not 
have the time now to do that.  However, I think it is a positive 
example of how the government can do something with no cost to 
the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about hepatitis C victims and the cost to the 
taxpayers because of mistakes by the government but here is an 
example of where the government can do something right at no cost 
to the taxpayers and it is time it acted and acted very quickly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada has had an enviable record 
in smoking cessation and in its smoking cessation policy.  This 
government is committed to public education.  We realize that 
public support is essential in a civil society if we are to make 
progress toward our goal of a smoke free society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specific to the member's point in question regarding the 1994 
tobacco tax reduction, it is important to remember that at that 
time, as the Prime Minister explained on February 8, 1994, we 
were dealing with an enormous problem of law enforcement and 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem had become a deep rooted and far reaching national 
issue of smuggling of contraband tobacco.  Action was necessary. 
The four point national action plan on smuggling was an 
enforcement crackdown, a reduction in consumer taxes on tobacco; 
a special surtax on tobacco manufacturer profits and, most 
significantly, the tobacco demand reduction strategy which was 
the most ambitious tobacco control initiative in Canada's 
history.  It was designed to counter the impact of the tax 
reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the reduction in Canadian tobacco taxes was clearly 
stated as a temporary measure.  Because of the government's 
actions since that time in the area of anti-smuggling efforts, 
the contraband situation has improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance in collaboration with the provinces has 
introduced three tax increases in provinces where taxes were cut 
in 1994.  In addition, the 40% surtax on the profits of tobacco 
manufacturers was instituted in 1994 and will remain in place 
until March 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tax measures are consistent with the government's desire 
to increase taxes in a gradual manner to meet our health 
objectives without creating renewed contraband activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, public education, particularly to our young, is important. 
Pricing is important.  Advertising policy is also important.  As 
the member opposite knows, we are moving toward an absolute ban 
on advertising tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.24 p.m.)
