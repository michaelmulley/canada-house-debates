</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, the government should undertake a study of the 
issues posed by the fish-farming industry, with particular 
regard to ecosystem health. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, members may want to know what I mean by a 
study.  Either an independent scientific panel or a House of 
Commons standing committee or subcommittee should investigate and 
examine this issue so long as the study is conducted at arm's 
length from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and so long as 
it is comprehensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may also want to know what is meant by ecosystem health. 
What I mean is aquaculture's impact on water quality, other 
species such as marine species and birds, and the genetic 
integrity of the wild salmon stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also focuses on the environmental risks posed by fish 
farming.  A comprehensive study would also consider the impact of 
this industry on aboriginal and coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In explaining to the House why a study of the environmental 
impacts of this industry is necessary, I will begin with a brief 
description of the industry itself.  I will then describe the 
level of public concern with the impact of that industry, the 
federal government's involvement in promoting and regulating the 
industry, and finally a brief outline of the evidence of the 
damage caused by aquaculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By this I hope to demonstrate that the environmental impacts of 
fish farming in Canada is a significant issue of national 
concern.  More important, this is an issue where there is an 
urgent need to provide a forum for Canadians to express their 
views and for an independent comprehensive study of its 
environmental impacts.  This is the intent of the motion before 
us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major form of fish farming in Canada is salmon farming which 
currently accounts for 64% of total aquaculture production in 
Canada.  Salmon are raised initially in freshwater hatcheries and 
at the juvenile stage transferred to open net pens in marine 
coastal waters to complete their growth.  It is while in these 
net pens that possible interaction with wild salmon and their 
habitat occur and where escapes of farmed salmon take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the world's fourth largest producer of farmed salmon. 
British Columbia and New Brunswick produce almost all of the 
farmed salmon in Canada.  While fish farming takes place mostly 
on the east and west coasts, it is an issue of significance to 
all Canadians since this fish ultimately ends up on our dinner 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a recent pilot study conducted by a British researcher 
found that farmed salmon had higher levels of toxins such as PCBs 
and pesticides than wild salmon.  Therefore this is an issue that 
should concern us all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Fisheries and Oceans manages and regulates the 
aquaculture industry.  Just last December the report of the 
Auditor General of Canada to the House of Commons contained a 
chapter entitled “Fisheries and Oceans: The Effects of Salmon 
Farming in British Columbia on the Management of Wild Salmon 
Stocks”.  It is disturbing to find that the first main point of 
the auditor general's report is that the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans is not fully meeting its legislative obligations under 
the Fisheries Act to protect wild Pacific salmon stock and 
habitat from the effects of salmon farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general found that the department is not enforcing 
the Fisheries Act with respect to salmon farming operations, that 
there are shortfalls in the research and monitoring to assess the 
effects of salmon farming operations, and that the department has 
not put in place a formal plan for managing risks and for 
assessing the environmental effects of new fish farm sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the auditor general, a major constraint to 
enforcing the habitat provision of the Fisheries Act is the lack 
of scientific information.  Hence, that is the importance of a 
comprehensive study as proposed in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the federal government has provided substantial 
funds to support and promote aquaculture in the form of technical 
support, engineering assistance, moneys through the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency in the form of direct grants to fish 
farms, processing plants expansions, interest free loans, 
training programs through Human Resources Development, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August of last year the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
announced $75 million in support of the aquaculture industries. 
Such extensive government support calls for an indepth analysis 
of the benefits and the costs of this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aquaculture industry has been one of the most rapidly 
growing industries in Canada and it is now time it came under 
public scrutiny.  Therefore, I believe a thorough study by the 
government is the appropriate procedure to deal with this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must note that there are approximately 17 federal departments 
and agencies with responsibilities relating to the aquaculture 
sector.  It is evident many aspects of environmental health have 
fallen through the cracks of the current patchwork of 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to close one of those gaps in 1998 when the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development 
conducted its review of the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act.  The issue at the time was to clarify the authority of the 
Minister of the Environment to protect fish habitats from 
deleterious substances.  Apparently the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans still fails to enforce the fish habitat provisions of 
the Fisheries Act when it comes to aquaculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans 
in February and March of last year had a few meetings to study 
aquaculture.  No report was issued but the records of those 
meetings reveal how anxious many Canadians and members of 
parliament are to see this industry adequately regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1999 the commissioner of aquaculture instigated a 
legislative review of all acts and regulations applying to the 
aquaculture industry with two perhaps conflicting mandates to 
this review.  One was to undertake a comprehensive review of all 
federal legislation and regulations to identify and remove, where 
appropriate, constraints to aquaculture development.  The other 
was to develop and implement a responsive and effective 
regulatory and policy framework to ensure aquaculture is 
conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review is now completed but it is not yet published.  In the 
meantime the auditor general has warned that in responding to the 
review the department ought to give appropriate consideration to 
environmental issues in accordance to its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident that the department is committed to expanding this 
industry despite growing evidence of its damages and that a 
double mandate as both regulator and promoter of the industry is 
inappropriate given the statutory mandate to protect fish 
habitats.  I would go one step further and submit that the 
promotion and development side of the aquaculture industry, as 
with any other industry, should be left to the Department of 
Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate of this motion is very timely as some members may 
have seen last week's excellent documentary on salmon farming on 
<I>The Nature of Things</I> by Dr. David Suzuki. 
The documentary presented a wealth of scientific research and 
reports on the environmental impacts of aquaculture, many of 
which I will make reference to.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Environment Canada recently released a study on 
the dispersion and the toxicity of pesticides used to treat sea 
lice on salmon in net pen enclosures.  The study outlined the 
negative impact of those pesticides on water quality and other 
marine organisms.  Fish farming also generates the release of 
cage wastes, feces, nutrients from the fish feed, antibiotics and 
other veterinary drugs, pesticides, antifoulants and other 
chemicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These wastes are deposited and accumulated on the sea floor. 
This accumulation can actually lead to the area being too rich in 
nutrients, triggering algae blooms which are toxic to fish.  The 
composition of the accumulated waste can also lead to the release 
of noxious gases like ammonia and methane.  This affects animals 
like crustaceans and arthropods that live in the sediment.  It is 
worth noting the area under the net pens is actually often 
referred to as the dead zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aquaculturists manage feeding regimes, temperature, light levels 
and genetic selection of fish.  Atlantic salmon raised in fish 
farms frequently suffer from the salmon anaemia virus, a disease 
that spreads rapidly due to the conditions under which these fish 
are raised.  What is even worse is that there are reported cases 
of the disease spreading to our already endangered wild stock of 
salmon.  Fish in fish farms suffer from a wide range of 
bacterial, viral and parasitological diseases and these epidemics 
are controlled by extensive use of antibiotics and pesticides. 
These health problems are associated with ever more intensive 
production, the objective being to always bring the fish to 
market in the shortest possible time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent scientific study entitled “Potential Genetic 
Interaction Between Wild and Farm Salmon of the Same Species” 
concluded that the large influx of genes from farm fish into wild 
gene pools could cause severe declines in the wild fish stock. 
Already escaped farm fish have been reported in streams and 
rivers of British Columbia and New Brunswick.  The situation will 
likely get worse as the industry continues to grow unchecked. 
Escaped fish can spread disease, compete with wild salmon for 
food and habitat and interbreed with the wild stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wild salmon fish stocks are already declining due to loss of 
habitat and salmon farming puts an additional stress on this 
precious resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wild salmon and fish farms can coexist.  There is a possibility 
for a sustainable aquaculture industry, no doubt.  However, we 
are clearly not on that path at the moment.  We must put the 
brakes on the promotion and funding of the status quo and conduct 
an comprehensive study identifying the environmental effects 
before considering further expansion of the industry.  Only then 
will we have accurate directions on how to put the existing fish 
farms on a sustainable path and whether and under which 
conditions the industry can be allowed to expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This improvement will likely require fulfilment of the 
government's statutory duty to protect the wild salmon stocks, 
changes in fish farm techniques, reductions, strict control and 
containment of pesticides, drugs, feed and the fish themselves. 
A greater regulatory presence in the aquaculture industry would 
prevent long term negative impacts on the environment and thus be 
beneficial to the long term economic health of this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also at stake here are the stocks of wild salmon.  Those 
great big fish, gifted travellers, covering immense distances to 
return to their native river, those accomplished swimmers, brave 
waterfalls, strong currents, grizzly bears and other obstacles in 
their way.  Enduring symbols of nature's strength and 
determination and yet, now serving as a warning to us all of the 
fragility of the great Canadian wilderness, of how our once 
plentiful resources, the wild salmon stocks, can quickly be 
decimated when exploited for profits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there is a serious problem that warrants this 
motion:  the extensive influx of the aquaculture industry on the 
environment; the inadequacy of the current regulatory framework; 
and the negative publicity the industry will receive if the 
situation is not corrected.  This issue is of significant concern 
to Canadians and it must and can only be addressed by a 
comprehensive parliamentary study, as suggested in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the participation and input of my colleagues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, before I respond to the hon. member's motion, as 
this is my first time speaking in the House I would like to thank 
the citizens of Nanaimo—Alberni for the trust they have given me 
to represent their interests in the House.  As I begin my career 
in serving them I pray that I will honour that trust.  I thank my 
campaign manager and the wonderful team that worked hard to 
ensure our success during the election.  I also thank my wife 
Helen for her love, constant support and encouragement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you will permit me a small personal digression, 
I would like to pay tribute to my late father, Albert Lunney, who 
passed away during the election campaign on October 24.  I know 
that there are a number of hon. members who have followed their 
fathers' footsteps into the House and I congratulate them.  On 
his deathbed my father told me that he had bought a pair of shoes 
a number of years back and he liked them so much that he bought a 
second pair.  He had never been able to wear out the first pair, 
so he wanted me to have the second pair.  To my surprise, they 
fit me.  When I visited him in the hospital the next morning, 
although he was unable to lift his head from his bed I could see 
the pleasure on his face when I whispered to him “Dad, I am 
going to wear your shoes in the House of Commons on my first 
day”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to have fulfilled that pledge the day 
we first assembled in the House for the 37th parliament, the same 
day the Speaker was elected and, Mr. Speaker, you yourself were 
appointed.  I congratulate you also.  It is a day that I and many 
of us will never forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final word and then I will turn to the matter of 
debate.  One of the things I learned from my dad was a love for 
truth.  My dad used to say that truth is stranger than fiction. 
It is my hope that during the 37th parliament members of both 
sides of the House will be known for a passion for truth and for 
service to the people who have elected us to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the matter of debate, Motion No. 119 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of the House, the government should undertake 
a study of the issues posed by the fish-farming industry, with 
particular regard to ecosystem health. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to address this issue because it is one of 
particular significance, study, opinion and debate in my own 
constituency of Nanaimo—Alberni.  Aquaculture in B.C. began in 
the early 1900s, with shellfish, oysters, clams and mussels. 
Farmed salmon were introduced in the early 1970s and have quickly 
become the leading product in the industry.  The B.C. coastal 
area currently employs about 2,400 people and produces product 
worth about $200 million Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aquaculture shares elements of concern with all elements of 
agricultural activity.  Indeed, all human activities leave a 
footprint of some kind on the environment.  It falls to us as 
good stewards of the environment to consider the short term and 
long term impacts of that footprint and to make sure our 
practices are balanced so that our needs of food production and 
the growing demands of humanity for food are balanced with the 
environmental concerns to protect unpredictable wild stock and 
natural resources.  We must ensure that we employ best science 
practices to balance these potentially competing concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, we know that extensive studies have been and continue 
to be done.  The minister announced last August, just in time for 
the election, a commitment of about $75 million over the next 
five years for sustainable and environmentally sound aquaculture. 
I understand that included about $32.5 million for science and 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that we have an aquaculture commissioner's office now, 
with a $2 million budget, and we have had travel to both coasts 
by the fisheries and oceans committee to look into the issue. 
Ongoing studies are continuing.  We might wonder in this request 
in Motion No. 119 whether we are asking for funds for a study to 
study what the government is already studying and spending.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the Commons debate on the issue in the 36th 
parliament, I quote my colleague for Vancouver Island North, who 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a big budget aquaculture commission in Ottawa is 
not the answer.  What is needed is a clear progressive mandate 
and budget for more biologists to vet project proposals. The 
committee heard from private investors who either had already or 
were prepared to invest their money in labour intensive 
aquaculture only to see their hopes and dreams dashed on the 
bureaucratic rocks. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frustration of many in the industry has resulted in a brain 
drain coupled with capital shift as many highly skilled and 
experienced personnel from B.C. are increasingly leaving for 
countries such as Chile, Norway and Asia.  Indeed, on my last 
flight home to Vancouver Island I spent considerable time in 
conversation with one such individual returning from Chile to his 
home in Nanaimo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many genuine and serious concerns about protection and wild 
stocks and the environment have been advanced.  We have heard 
them articulated very well this morning by the hon. member in his 
motion.  The concerns include, as he mentioned:  escapement, the 
potential for escaped salmon to interbreed; disease; sea floor 
contamination; bioactive chemicals; and potential nutrification 
of the sea floor.  Also, there are economic concerns on the west 
coast as commercial fishermen see their market undercut by low 
priced farm fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these are legitimate concerns and are worthy of 
scientific and public scrutiny.  These issues have been studied, 
are being studied and no doubt will continue to be studied.  I 
will say that intense scrutiny and study has brought about some 
changes, at least on the west coast where our provincial 
government has put in rather extensive controls.  There was a 
moratorium on expanding fish farms a few years ago and to my 
knowledge it has not yet been lifted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been improvements.  The early farms involved shallow 
water which was sheltered.  That of course led to real problems 
with disease and to sea floor problems.  All farms now have to be 
in deeper water where there is a greater flush.  That has reduced 
the problem of disease, at least in our end of the world, and the 
sea floor problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that treatment is also expensive.  Treatment has to 
be prescribed by a veterinarian and that adds to the cost of the 
feed.  That in itself encourages good farming practices.  Science 
has contributed to safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Predators do attack the nets.  Auxiliary nets are now being used 
to keep them away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent advance is the use of cameras to control feeding so 
that when feeding slows the dispensing of food also slows and 
reduces the sea floor pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we have had escapes of Atlantic salmon and there are 
anecdotal stories of salmon in our coastal streams, there is no 
indication they have been successful at spawning or 
crossbreeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the concerns originally advanced have been addressed by 
good science applications.  A whole new area of concern is the 
attempt to develop genetically modified fish.  The report of the 
Royal Society of Canada which was recently presented calls for an 
intense protocol of scientific screening before any GM organism 
is released into the environment.  This principle should rightly 
be upheld in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the coin, I know that in our environment 
the fish farmers often come under criticism for being found in 
pristine areas where boaters or kayakers do not expect to find 
them when they are seeking solitude.  However, occasionally these 
people have also been involved in rescue and in harbouring and 
sheltering boaters who have been in trouble.  Also, they are 
involved in cleaning up the environment as they pick up after 
other boaters who discard diapers and floating bottles and other 
paraphernalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned some of the horror stories that have 
happened, where production has gone unbalanced.  Indeed, there is 
going to be a need to maintain balance.  There is a dynamic 
tension among production, regulation and conservation.  To be 
successful we must find the balance.  We must retain fundamental 
respect for the earth.  The earth is our home.  We must use the 
best tools of science, such as observation, measurement, 
quantification, verification and diligence, to ensure that 
production is optimized with minimal long term impact, but we 
must also strive to ensure that bureaucratic and unwieldy 
regulations do not frustrate an industry that has the potential 
to contribute to growing demands for food and to an urgent need 
for stable, long term, year round employment in our coastal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has raised some very good issues.  The need for 
ongoing study is certainly there.  We hope that much of the 
available funding already committed to by the minister for the 
next five years will be invested in continuing the research that 
needs to be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to intervene on the motion concerning aquaculture 
and the environmental impact of aquaculture as presented by the 
member for Davenport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person rises to speak after two presentations like those, 
naturally there are a number of points, both statistical and 
actual, to be presented to the House.  I would like to address a 
number of issues that have not been considered yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, why is fish farming so often chosen?  Why do we choose 
this type of production to raise populations of fry and fish, 
often for commercial purposes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is it is rather odd.  Quite recently, the government 
decided to create the position of aquaculture commissioner to 
manage and oversee the operations of the various types of 
aquaculture in Canada.  At the same time, it decided to invest 
several tens of millions of dollars in aquaculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something rather odd.  There is something rather—the 
word is quite specific—paradoxical about the federal 
government's policy on aquaculture.  It decides to spend tens of 
millions of dollars on an industry—and we can call it 
that—which, 
creates jobs and helps raise the gross national 
product, but this industry is defeating the environmental efforts of 
this selfsame government. For years, it has been signing 
international agreements, including one on biodiversity, but now 
it is financing this industry.  This also defeats the efforts 
made on behalf of the environment in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that the whole issue of Atlantic salmon, the 
ever shrinking population of salmon in the ocean at the moment, 
is due in large part, naturally, to the environment of the 
commercial situation and to the major industries, which in 
recent years, have polluted the various oceans, if we may say 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paradoxical as well,  according to what I was reading 
recently: a report on the issue published by a university in 
Indiana.  It speaks reams.  A number of groups have referred to 
it. 
I am surprised that the member for Davenport did not refer to 
that study, which is rather eloquent in that regard. Many 
environmental groups quoted it, as recently as in January 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That report indicated that there were major impacts linked to 
the new phenomenon of aquaculture. It also mentioned that fish 
which is genetically modified and transgenic through aquaculture 
is seriously affected. According to the report, the biggest fish 
can concentrate on preys that had so far been left alone while 
also going after a bigger volume of traditional preys. The 
imbalance that could result becomes obvious when one looks at a 
natural species such as the Nile perch which could, less than a 
decade after being introduced, eliminate 50% of the species in 
Africa's Lake Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This environmental impact from transgenic fish is also found in 
Quebec. 
The introduction of mere minnows in trout lakes is enough to 
cause drops of up to between 50% and 60% in fish stocks.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aquaculture is a type of production that must not be analyzed 
merely in commercial terms. While the government is investing in 
that industry, it might be appropriate, from an environmental 
point of view and for the sake of public health and the balance 
of ecosystems, to also invest money to deal with the 
environmental impact of that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of researchers have made other eloquent findings. That 
same report from a university in Indiana mentioned that 
researchers and officials from Atlantic coastal countries 
indicated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wild salmon stocks in the North Atlantic are always in trouble 
and, according to scientists, they are currently at their lowest 
level ever reported. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an obvious reduction in the level and volume of 
wild salmon stocks in the North Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves whether aquaculture can be the solution to 
this reduction in salmon stocks. The answer is no. I sincerely 
think that, instead, we should work on our ecosystem and improve 
the environment in which this salmon lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two strategies were put forward. The first one consists in 
reducing salmon catches. 
It is not merely a matter of introducing into our ecosystem, 
into our oceans, new transgenic fish; it might be wise as well 
to give some thought to reducing catches.  As well, this fish's 
ravaged habitats on both sides of the Atlantic need to be 
restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, therefore, not a matter of merely increasing the stock 
through aquaculture, producing transgenic salmon fry, but rather 
of finding and working on solutions further back in the system, 
in order to reduce catches, restore habitat and ensure the 
survival of the species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be wise, while the Canadian government is busy making 
noise about applying the principle of caution, to remind it, if 
I must, that at no time in 30 years has the Canadian government 
applied the principle of precaution to the aquaculture industry. 
At no time has the principle of precaution been applied.  The 
only thing that counts is production.  The only thing that 
counts is commercial markets.  There is no assessment of the 
risks inherent in aquaculture and in this introduction of fish 
that have been transgenicly modified to some degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Might it not be wise also, when looking at amending the 
International Boundary Waters Treaty Act, to seek some advice 
from the International Joint Commission in order to have a 
proper analysis of the impact of aquaculture on our environment? 
Why would this not be the time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a joint commission that analyses a number of elements 
from certain points of view.  I, and we, propose that it be 
consulted on water exports.  Why would it not be the time as 
well for it to analyze the impact of aquaculture and transgenic 
fish on our waters?  The joint commission could analyse the 
situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the joint commission has nothing to say on this 
matter.  I see my time is up.  In principle, I support the 
motion by my colleague from Davenport, provided of course that 
this is done in close collaboration with the provinces and with 
Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
more than happy to address Motion No. 119 of the hon. member for 
Davenport which pertains to a study of fish farming and ecosystem 
health.  I think that issue has been discussed in parliament. 
Certainly it has been discussed at the fisheries committee for 
some time.  There are several areas that need to be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to make a couple of points before I get into the 
gist of my speech today.  I should like to comment on the 
documentary on the David Suzuki Foundation that was aired earlier 
about ecosystem health.  It was very anti-fish farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us have a responsibility in this place to understand the 
facts as best we can and to present them in a manner that shows 
both sides of the story, not just one side of the story.  A 
number of issues deal with fish farming in Canada.  A number of 
issues will continue and will be ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from Suzuki's report.  I have a serious problem 
with some of the science in that report.  I also have a serious 
problem with members of parliament who simply want to quote 
something verbatim without taking a long, hard, serious look at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Suzuki report there was mention of the salmon that were 
tested.  This is a major report which causes some doubt about a 
major food source on the planet.  Millions of tonnes of salmon 
are grown every year by Canada, Norway, Scotland, Ireland and 
Chile.  We also have some very serious salmon farming operations 
in New Brunswick, some in Nova Scotia, and a lot of salmon grown 
in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Suzuki Foundation tested just eight salmon, four wild salmon 
and four farm salmon, and put out a report.  That is far too few 
to reach any scientifically defensible conclusions about 
contaminant levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not say that we should not be worried about 
contaminant levels, that we should not be vigilant about 
contaminant levels, but it certainly says that it is based on bad 
science.  The Suzuki study has been neither independently 
reviewed nor published and the organization has not released any 
of its findings to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Scottish study to which he referred found no discernible 
difference in the PCBs and dioxins found in wild and farm salmon. 
The author of the Scottish study, Dr. Miriam Jacobs, has called 
the BBC 3 show claim absolute nonsense.  The levels of the PCBs 
and dioxins that the Suzuki Foundation reportedly measured in 
farm salmon were well below the safety standards set by Health 
Canada and enforced by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to question both on a scientific basis and, more 
important, on a public basis the use of limited, unpublished and 
unsubstantiated data purporting to claim health concerns 
respecting farm salmon.  If there are health concerns, we should 
be the first people to be concerned about them.  If there are 
not, we should not be supporting a bogus claim of such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that little statement on Suzuki's evidence, I make clear 
that I grew up on a small salmon river in Nova Scotia called the 
Gold River.  As a young boy I was able to catch salmon in that 
river.  We actually still have a few wild Atlantic salmon that 
return to that river every year.  That should indicate that I am 
very friendly to the Atlantic Salmon Federation and to anyone who 
supports wild salmon.

industry not to point the finger of blame at some place that it

aquaculture industry?  Absolutely we do.  Have those problems 
been attended to, reported and looked at in a very serious manner 
over the last 10 years?  A lot of them have.  Do we still have 
problems with escapees, with algae bloom and with feces on the 
bottom?  Yes, we do.  Have most of those problems been attended 
to? Yes, they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to break that down into a bit of detail.  Last 
year the fisheries committee proposed a study on aquaculture.  We 
finished the majority of that study, although we did not finish 
it all.  We visited the west coast of B.C. and Washington State. 
The report will tell hon. members that we also visited the east 
coast.  We were there for two days.  All members were not able to 
attend.  We were in Maine, New Brunswick, and had one quick stop 
in Nova Scotia.  It is a long way from being an indepth study on 
aquaculture on the east and west coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also spent six days in Scotland.  While we were there we were 
able to meet with the minister responsible for aquaculture in 
Scotland, the minister responsible for aquaculture in Ireland, 
and a number of officials in Norway as well dealing with fin fish 
aquaculture.  That is another difference that needs to be 
explained.  We are dealing with two totally different types of 
aquaculture.  It should be made very clear to the listening 
public that we do not want to get the two mixed up.  Fin fish 
aquaculture and shellfish aquaculture are two entirely different 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember when shellfish aquaculture, which has been around 
for the last 20 years, was first becoming an important industry 
on the east coast.  If anybody in the House is not aware of it, 
95% of the blue mussels in the world are raised on P.E.I.  A lot 
of oysters have been raised traditionally for the last thousand 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember in Mahone Bay in Indian Point when the Indian 
Point Mussel Farm first opened.  There was a lot of fear between 
the traditional lobster industry and the farmer who was trying to 
introduce the blue mussels.  What happened was that the mussel 
socks were put over muddy bottom, which is not lobster bottom. It 
attracted a lot of predators, including crabs and lobsters for 
the dead mussels that were falling out of the socks, and actually 
improved the habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same type of potential not necessarily to improve 
the habitat for other species by having salmon farms, but we 
certainly have the potential if we look at it in a smart, 
reasonable and responsible way to have fin fish aquaculture side 
by side with the traditional fishery.  Will that be an easy 
process?  Absolutely not.  Is there a lot of fear out there from 
the traditional fishery about fin fish aquaculture?  Yes, we do. 
Have there been some mistakes in the past?  Yes, there have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at a couple of those mistakes.  It is a fact that in 
the past way too many antibiotics were used on fish farms. That 
antibiotic rate has been cut down in the last three or four years 
in particular, first, with the use of more vaccines and less 
antibiotics.  Second, it has been cut down so that probably today 
we can fairly accurately state that aquaculture uses less 
antibiotics than any other veterinary science.  That is a big 
statement.  If members visit some beef lots and some feed lots 
for the beef industry, and I am very familiar with those as well, 
they will see lots of antibiotics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue, which is a very real and significant one, is that 
of escapees.  We have a problem with escapees.  There is 
absolutely no question about it.  If members have studied the 
aquaculture sites where they have significant problems with 
escapees in the past, they will see that problem has basically 
been managed.  The escapee level has dropped dramatically in the 
last five or six years.  The previous speaker said there were no 
incidents of escapees actually surviving. Unfortunately that is 
not true. 
There are incidents of escapees on the west coast.  Incidents 
have also been recorded in New Brunswick and more incidents in 
Norway.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need to protect the biodiversity and the salmon stocks 
that are there?  Absolutely.  Can we do that?  Yes, a methodology 
can be applied that will do that and still allow for fin fish 
aquaculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real culprit for the decline in the wild stocks is that we 
overfished them.  We overfished them on the west coast.  The 
government helped to do that.  We overfished them on the east 
coast in a very serious way.  When wild stocks were found off 
Norway, Canada, Norway and the United States fished them to 
extinction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the hon. member 
for Davenport for bringing this very important issue to the House 
of Commons, the place where these issues should be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we are here to either slam aquaculture or to 
promote aquaculture.  We are here to debate the discussions and 
the perceptions that are around aquaculture in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aquaculture is not new.  A lot of Canadians think the industry 
is perhaps 15 or 20 years old, but in reality it has been around 
for a long time.  It was in our hatcheries well over 100 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aquaculture in Canada and around the world has expanded very 
rapidly.  People have concerns over genetically modified foods. 
They have concerns over trangenics, or what is called 
frankenfish.  People have concerns about what they are eating 
when it comes to fish proteins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and other members of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans have studied aquaculture but not to the extent that we 
should.  When the committee does meet, we will be meeting again 
on the concerns of aquaculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and the previous Conservative government 
were sleeping when aquaculture was happening.  The industry said 
that it was looking for support and resources in order to 
ascertain the industry in the new world.  How do we replenish 
fish stocks when we cannot do it for the wild species? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wild species of salmon, cod, hake and turbot, as well as many 
other species, are declining in our oceans.  The void is being 
filled by aquaculture, and therein lies the debate. There are 
people within the department who are traditionalists and who 
believe commercial fishing is the way to go and that it must be 
maintained.  We also have people within the department saying 
that the commercial fishery is a thing of the past and that we 
have to go to aquaculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly what does that mean?  I and my party believe that 
aquaculture and the commercial fishing sectors can co-exist but 
only—and this is where I want to thank the member for bringing 
the issue up—when we have clear scientific evidence to move 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Aspotogan Peninsula near St. Margarets Bay a big battle 
is being waged by a local community group that does not want to 
see an aquaculture site expanded in the area.  The DFO is doing 
an environmental assessment.  It will pass its recommendations on 
to the province and the province in the end will make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the community waits.  Meanwhile the businessperson who 
wants to run the aquaculture site waits.  Members can understand 
why there is so much friction between the community, the 
commercial fishers who harvest the lobsters and the person who 
will invest a lot of money in an aquaculture site.  There is no 
streamlined process yet, and this is where a lot of the debate 
and anger heats up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the west coast the aboriginal people are saying that they 
will, under no circumstance, eat Atlantic salmon because to them 
it is foreign.  When the debate involves all these sectors, it is 
no wonder people argue and facts go out that are maybe not 
correct and that there is misinformation.  It is not fair to the 
aquaculture industry, the commercial sector or the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need clear guidelines on who is responsible for what.  Right 
now the DFO is responsible for the environmental work and the 
provincial governments are responsible for the licensing and 
leasing of the sites.  That is a contradiction that needs to be 
streamlined.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Open net aquaculture farming has been going on for many years. 
Along with the David Suzuki Foundation and many other people we 
have advocated it is time to move toward a closed net system 
because the problem with escapees is very real.  It is extremely 
real.  The aquaculture industry used to tell us that escaped 
salmon could not go up rivers and could not survive in the wild 
or reproduce.  We know to the contrary that is not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard that 15 to 20 years ago a tremendous amount of 
antibiotics used to be added to the feed and to the other sources 
that feed the penned salmon that are there now.  That has been 
greatly reduced.  However, what is feeding those salmon today? 
Canada does not have that information.  We know that a lot of it 
comes from grains and from vegetable proteins, but a lot of it 
comes from other fish stocks as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago, three pounds of wild fish used to be taken out of the 
ocean to market one pound of aquaculture salmon.  That used to be 
so, but it is not that way any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the aquaculture industry's greatest problem is its 
public relations efforts.  It does not come consistently clear 
with the information that Canadians need, especially those in 
coastal communities.  Aquaculture can be a future industry.  It 
can have positive growth in the country.  However we must make 
sure the Canadian people know exactly what they are eating when 
they buy salmon or have it at a restaurant.  Almost all salmon in 
stores, restaurants or on airlines is farmed salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraging the industry.  I tell Mr. Rideout, the head of 
the CFIA, all the time that he should label the salmon that is in 
the supermarket.  If we are proud of our farmed salmon then we 
should say so.  We should say the salmon came from a particular 
farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do it with eggs.  We mark eggs properly.  We tell Canadians 
what area they come from.  We do it with chickens.  We do it with 
beef.  Why not label salmon as well?  Why not label other fish 
stocks that are marketed through the farm method, like mussels, 
oysters, clams, et cetera?  If we did that, a lot more Canadians 
would be aware of what they were eating.  They could then ask the 
questions that are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The North Sea oil in Norway is about to evaporate, probably 
around 2015.  Norway has made it clear that the industry it will 
focus on in the future is aquaculture.  It will be the world 
leader.  It is the world leader now and it does not plan to let 
that go.  Norway is way ahead of Canada when it comes to science, 
when it comes to co-operation with communities and when it comes 
to marketing its product around the world.  If we want to be in 
the market we will have to be more open with Canadians and with 
government officials when the questions come around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yves Bastien is the commissioner of aquaculture at DFO.  Most of 
the information on his government website comes directly from the 
industry.  There is a perception that something is not right.  If 
the commissioner of DFO for aquaculture must get his information 
directly from the industry, there is a perception that the 
information may be tainted or misleading.  That is completely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If DFO is to be in the business of promoting aquaculture, it 
must make sure it is a completely separate entity.  It must 
gather its own information and not information from the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cultural clash is happening within DFO between the traditional 
managers who were born and raised in the commercial fisheries and 
the new ones who are more used to aquaculture.  They will have to 
get their act together, otherwise aquaculture will not grow in 
the country.  It will be completely at loggerheads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot and should not ever say that aquaculture will replace 
the commercial fishery.  If we do that we will have abrogated our 
responsibility as parliamentarians to the natural health of the 
country and of the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a battle the other day between Maine and the U.S. 
federal government about making Bay of Fundy salmon stocks an 
endangered species.  The American government did so, simply 
because it does not know what is causing the stocks to collapse. 
It could be aquaculture.  It could be forestry.  It could be 
mining.  It could be commercial fishing.  It could be 
environmental problems, global warming or the whole bit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However when it comes to aquaculture issues, if we want to 
protect natural species we must have all the information at hand. 
We simply do not have the information right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party I thank the member for Davenport for 
raising the issue.  I wish we could discuss it more and I am sure 
we will during the committee stage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to rise in the House today to respond to the motion put 
forward by the hon. member for Davenport.  I thank him for his 
continuing interest in aquaculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know the implications of aquaculture for the 
environment.  For Fisheries and Oceans Canada the matter is a 
very high priority.  The program for sustainable aquaculture 
announced by the minister last summer is an investment in 
aquaculture's ability to grow and flourish as a key Canadian 
industry.  It also ensures that such growth does not come at the 
expense of our aquatic ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past decade DFO has undertaken a number of initiatives 
to examine the environmental impacts of aquaculture.  Since the 
announcement last summer, the department has accelerated its work 
in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not support the hon. member's motion for an entirely new 
study of the issues posed by aquaculture, simply because such 
work is already going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In past reviews a large part of the work has already been done. 
For such a relatively young industry, aquaculture has been the 
focus of rigorous studies and reviews over the past decade. 
There have been federal studies, provincial studies, 
international studies and industry studies.  A number of these 
have included indepth public consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the member's speech, but it being 11.57 a.m., and according to 
Standing Order 95(2), the main mover of the motion has five 
minutes to reply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the 
members for Nanaimo—Alberni, Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, South 
Shore, Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, and 
Labrador for their interventions, for the input they have 
provided and for sharing their knowledge on this rather complex 
issue.  I very much appreciate their interventions and what they 
said and I will comment briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Nanaimo—Alberni asked what I thought was a very 
relevant question:  Why we are asking for funds to study 
something that is already being studied? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Labrador just informed us that the process is in 
action.  We will only be able to find the answer when we see the 
study publicly.  The public has not yet seen the study, and 
neither have we.  We are not in a position to determine whether 
the many interesting questions raised during the past hour are 
being dealt with in an appropriate manner in the departmental 
study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that kind of ignorance, so to say, we have to let the 
matter rest until the study is published.  We sincerely hope the 
department and the government will publish it very soon. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the remarks by the hon. member for Rosemont—Petite-Prairie, 
he has raised as usual a deeply philosophical question. I agree 
with him that there is something of a paradox in fish farming, 
but the same could be said of government activities in all 
industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take for example government activity in the asbestos 
industry, in the lumber industry, or in agriculture, there is 
always a contradiction between activities on behalf of 
commercial interests and on behalf of those who want to protect 
the integrity of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, our task is to find solutions that protect all 
interests at the same time. This is not always feasible, but 
that is what is called sustainable development, and it is the 
subject matter of Bill C-4, which we will discuss in a few 
minutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for South Shore, who has displayed a tremendous 
amount of knowledge of the subject, recognizes the problem, and 
particularly with escapees.  We are all happy to learn that in 
his experience and knowledge there is an inherent need to protect 
biodiversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck by his conclusion, which was very apt, that the 
real culprit of the situation in which we may find ourselves with 
aquaculture is the overfishing of the wild stock to extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Sackville, in his usual incisive style, thinks 
there can be a co-existence between commercial fisheries and 
aquaculture provided of course that we take the necessary 
precautions for the long term, which is in essence the substance 
of this motion.

<A NAME="LINK13">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-4, an act to establish a foundation to fund 
sustainable development technology, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to present for second 
reading Bill C-4, an act to establish a foundation to fund 
sustainable development technology.  I will begin with some 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an era in which the economic, social and 
environmental well-being of Canadians, and indeed of all the 
world's people and nations, hinges on our capacity to innovate, 
to respond to new challenges and new opportunities in new ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is all about technological innovation in support of 
sustainable development, a clear and compelling priority that was 
identified in our Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainable development is a complex balancing act among 
economic, social and environmental values and goals. Furthermore, 
it is a balance that constantly changes, influenced by such 
variables as science, population growth, economic circumstances 
and environmental requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The optimism that we can stay on top of all the challenges, that 
is keep our balance, assumes that as we move down the road our 
ability to respond to those challenges will also evolve and 
develop, that we be refreshed and re-equipped with new knowledge, 
ideas and technologies to keep the equation balanced in our 
favour and that we redefine the limits of what is possible.  All 
of that is fundamental to our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New technology by itself is not a silver bullet that will slay 
every dragon that we will face but it is indispensable to our 
success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership in developing and deploying new generations of 
sustainable development technology will bring economic, social 
and environmental rewards. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is in a worldwide race to reap those rewards.  The United 
States, the European Union, Japan and others are committing major 
amounts of money to support new technology for sustainable 
development, and Canada must keep pace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the principle of sustainable development is written 
right into the legislative mandate of my department, Natural 
Resources Canada.  That is why our government tabled a whole 
series of departmental sustainable development strategies just 
last week.   For the same reason, significant new dollars for 
sustainable development activities were committed in both last 
February's federal budget and in the economic statement last 
October; over $1 billion worth all together.  That is why we have 
this new legislation before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget 2000 we first announced the government's intention to 
establish a foundation with initial funding of $100 million to 
stimulate the development and demonstration of new environmental 
technologies, in particular climate change and clean air 
technologies.  Bill C-4 delivers on that commitment from budget 
2000.  It creates the organizational structure, the legal status 
and the modus operandi of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a moment about goals and points of focus for 
this new foundation.  The proposed foundation gives funding 
support for development and demonstration of new and promising 
sustainable development technologies.  It will also support 
measures to get these new tools into use as quickly and as widely 
as possible.  A bright new idea is only an idea as long as it 
remains in the laboratory or in some academic institution.  We 
need to get it into the field where it can really make a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation will focus in particular on the funding of new 
and emerging climate change and clean air technologies, including 
some in which Canada has already established an early 
international lead and in which further investment is very likely 
to produce new breakthroughs and new benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many hon. members in the House will be familiar with certain 
projects of this kind in their own regions, provinces, some even 
in their own constituencies.  They will be familiar with the 
environmental and economic benefits that these initiatives have 
brought to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, for example, of technologies that reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions at source before they enter the atmosphere.  I think of 
technologies, such as carbon sequestration, that allows us to 
capture and store greenhouse gases underground.  I think of the 
development of new and alternative fuel sources, including 
ethanol, solar energy and wind power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of energy efficiency technologies to conserve our 
resources and reduce emissions at the same time.  I think of 
technologies in the field of enhanced oil recovery that reinforce 
our energy independence by squeezing new oil from old wells and, 
at the same time, reduce the environmental footprint.  I think 
also of technologies that reduce particulate matter in the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within these areas and others, the foundation will concentrate 
support by mobilizing collaboration among partners, partners in 
industry, government, the universities, academic institutions and 
not for profit organizations.  Let me expand on that point for 
just a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we analyze various strategies for spurring technology 
innovation throughout the world, we find that a common 
characteristic of those that truly work is support for 
collaborative effort, people working together.  The sum of these 
combined efforts is much more than their individual parts. 
Synergy succeeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, the bill is about supporting synergy, about putting 
money into the pooling of skills, resources and expertise, 
bringing people and their talents together.  It will help to 
finance projects that bring together Canadian experts from 
industry, from universities, from a variety of associations and 
many others.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will pull together team members from the whole spectrum of 
technology innovation, each bringing a specific competence to the 
table.  In doing these things, the legislation will fulfil 
another vital need.  It will use the leverage of the foundation's 
funding to bring other money, new money, private sector money, 
into the development and demonstration of new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these objectives are unique, nor are the strategies for 
achieving them.  They are similar to those of several other 
federal programs that occupy a specific niche in support of 
technology development.  This foundation will complement and will 
reinforce these other efforts through its emphasis on 
collaboration and specifically its emphasis on sustainable 
development technologies, in particular climate change and clean 
air.  It will also bring new money into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The achievement of these goals requires attention to several 
complex issues:  administrative, technical quality and otherwise. 
As hon. members will note, the legislation takes these issues 
very much into account, for example, the question of intellectual 
property rights:  who owns and who can access the fruits of all 
of this co-operative, publicly funded labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are issues related to funding.  The bill requires 
recipients to conform to certain principles that the foundation 
would set on funding issues, for example, the question of who 
qualifies for funding.  The legislation defines these 
qualifications and requires that they be addressed.  Details on 
these matters will be spelled out in the specific funding 
agreement to be entered into between the government and the 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately the benefit of this funding to the Canadian 
environment and to the Canadian economy depends on the quality of 
targeting and team building.  This requires careful design of the 
machinery of governance for the foundation.  The legislation 
outlines this machinery.  It calls for the creation of a board of 
directors.  The board would operate at arm's length from 
government.  It would report annually to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second component in the governance structure is a committee 
representing stakeholders and potential clients of the 
foundation.  We call the people on this broader body the members 
of the foundation.  The board would consist of 15 directors, all 
of them drawn from outside government.  The first seven, that is 
six directors and the chairperson, would be appointed by the 
Government of Canada.  The other eight would be appointed by that 
broader group known as the members of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board would be an executive group.  It would supervise the 
management and services of the foundation and, subject to the 
foundation's bylaws, it would exercise all of its powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board would need to be balanced in a number of ways.  First, 
it would need to be balanced in terms of expertise.  It would 
comprise directors who collectively represent the whole spectrum 
of sustainable technology development in Canada, public, private, 
academic and not for profit.  Last but not least of course, the 
board would have balance in the geographic sense with members 
drawn from all regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation requires the board to establish financial and 
management controls to ensure efficient execution of the 
foundation's business.  It calls for the board to appoint an 
auditor and it outlines the qualifications for that role.  It 
requires the annual report, that I mentioned earlier, to include 
an evaluation of results achieved by the funding of projects year 
by year and also cumulatively since the start of the foundation, 
so that we in the House, and Canadians generally, will be able to 
know and to track the progress that is being made.  Here again 
the funding agreement between the government and the foundation 
will spell out these requirements in detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last thought that I will leave with the House before I close 
is about the relationship between knowledge and technology on the 
one hand and our national well-being on the other.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the knowledge based world in which we live, we are now well 
across the threshold of an era in which the winners are not only 
the swift and the strong but also the smart and the innovative. 
Nowhere is this more true than in Canada's natural resources 
sector, a sector in which economic and environmental imperatives 
converge, a sector in which the cause and effect relationship 
between innovation and success is clearly demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today our resource companies are among the biggest of 
the big spenders on innovation.  They account for 22% of all new 
capital investment in Canada.  Of the ten most innovative 
Canadian industries, five are resource based.  Collectively the 
companies in this sector are in the first ranks of being the 
creators and the consumers of new technology.  The results are 
there for all to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Dow Jones sustainability group index, which was 
introduced about a year ago, rates major corporations around the 
world on their success at integrating economic, environmental and 
social performance.  That Dow Jones sustainability group index 
ranks four Canadian companies at the very top of the index. 
Significantly, all four are resource based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the past two years, average productivity growth rates in 
our resource based industries have been two to three times higher 
than those of the Canadian economy overall.  These are powerful 
facts, refuting the simplistic analysis of some, which tends to 
think that natural resources are only the mainstay of the 
so-called old economy, with a great past but little future in the 
new economy of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today, energy, mining, forestry and earth sciences 
account for more than 11% of our gross domestic product.  That is 
close to $90 billion.  Looking outward, they account for about 
$100 billion every year in Canadian exports, with a favourable 
trade surplus of $60 billion.  Canadian resource knowledge and 
technology are being marketed and applied throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, innovation is paying off for Canada.  However, to meet 
challenges like climate change, to meet challenges like clean 
air, we must maintain and indeed accelerate our momentum in the 
field of science, knowledge and innovation.  We must keep 
building our brain power and move rapidly to put new ideas into 
action.  Our record of performance thus far is encouraging, but 
we need to do more, and that is what this bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new millennium, Canada must become and must remain the 
world's smartest natural resources steward, developer, user and 
exporter.  That means being the most high tech, the most 
environmentally friendly, the most socially responsible and the 
most productive and competitive, leading the world as a living 
model of sustainable development and successfully so. The 
legislation now before the House will help us to reach those 
goals, goals that I believe are worthy Canadian aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an enormous wealth and an enormous heritage of natural 
resources in our country.  It is exceedingly important when it 
comes to developing and managing those resources, not just for 
the current generation but for generations of children and 
grandchildren yet to come, that we do so in a responsible manner, 
a manner that effectively balances our economic, social and 
environmental imperatives.  The new fund proposed by the 
legislation will help us get there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-4. 
Certainly the minister paints a fine picture and I would not 
disagree with much of what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the critic for the Canadian Alliance Party, I begin 
the debate quite frankly undecided as to what position to take on 
the bill, because it is generally quite vague and lacks a lot of 
specific detail.  Certainly in his presentation the minister did 
little to add any of that detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the seven years I have been in the House, many as the critic 
for natural resources and for this particular minister, I have 
found that he has always been a master of words and is able to 
get around specifics while presenting a very encouraging picture. 
However, I need to understand some of the details around the bill 
and specifically why we need to create this new bureaucracy to 
achieve the goals the minister spoke about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Kyoto protocol in 1997 and Canada's commitment at that 
conference, the government seems to have been in a constant 
search for that silver bullet the minister referred to and seems 
to be shooting bullets in every direction rather than focusing on 
any particular strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the billion dollars the minister referred to that has 
been put in place to help us to reach the objective has been 
scattered around in so many directions that it is quite frankly 
hard to keep track of.  There have been a number of programs: 
the climate change early action fund, $150 million; the $60 
million for renewable energy initiatives; $15 million for the 
procurement of green power; $125 million for the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities to support environmentally friendly 
technologies; $100 million for international capacity building; 
and the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I was hoping to learn from the minister's presentation was 
why there is a need for the new bureaucracy and specifically what 
it would achieve in enhancing our chances of reaching the Kyoto 
protocol, the possible achievement of which seems to be quickly 
evaporating in regard to the government and Canada.  In spite of 
how many times we read the government's action plan on climate 
change, which was introduced before the election, it just does 
not cut it in regard to the possibility of achieving the Kyoto 
protocol targets.  By my calculations, at least, if all of the 
objectives under action plan 2000 were achieved we would only be 
one third of the way to the Kyoto commitment, so we are certainly 
not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other concern I have is in regard to the minister speaking 
about how our survival depends on our ability to innovate.  I 
suggest that there is some truth to that, but I certainly would 
also suggest that our survival depends very much on our ability 
to afford and to implement those innovations as they come along. 
Of course that has been part of the problem with this whole 
climate change initiative and where we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technologies that are emerging and will emerge and become 
available generally, at least in the timeframe of the Kyoto 
protocol, are totally unaffordable for the average Canadian who 
would use this technology.  I refer to the Ballard power cell and 
the development of prototype power cell vehicles and electric 
cars and those kinds of things, and to the government's own 
initiative in investment in green power.  These cars are three 
times the price of standard cars on the market today and are 
certainly far out of reach of the average citizen who drives to 
work every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the government's investment in green power comes at a 
price at least double that of even today's marketplace 
electricity rates, so again it is a wonderful idea but 
unaffordable in general society.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our challenge is not only to develop these innovative ideas and 
technologies but to make them affordable so that we can put them 
to work in society.  If we cannot achieve that, the development 
of these things has little impact on or benefit for mainstream 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I have to spend a little time on the bill 
itself because I have some real concerns with how it is put 
together and what it is advocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I ask why we need the bill.  Why could these funds not be 
delivered through existing mechanisms that are already in place 
under the climate change envelope, through the Business 
Development Bank, through some regional development agencies that 
a lot of government dollars are funnelled through?  As well, why 
could they not be delivered through some of the grassroots 
community development associations that fund the development of 
new technologies, new ideas and new projects?  One has to wonder 
why the government is choosing to go with this format.  I did not 
hear any indication as to why in the minister's speech.  I am 
really concerned simply because it is the creation of another 30 
bureaucratic positions, albeit 15 of them are not in a true sense 
paid bureaucrats and the establishment of the foundation is a 
good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, long ago the minister established all kinds 
of these bodies to help him understand his portfolio and to 
advise him on all kinds of issues that fall within that 
portfolio.  They are called ministerial advisory committees.  All 
kinds of very knowledgeable and pretty sharp people sit on these 
advisory committees at no cost to the people of Canada other than 
the cost of their expenses, as would be the case for this 
foundation.  I do not think we need to create this foundation to 
get the services of these people from industry and from society 
at large in order to achieve what we want.  Of course the board 
of directors is another story because the directors will be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation itself will set the terms and conditions, the 
salaries, the job descriptions and all of the rest of those 
things that do not exist in the bill.  The bill gives broad 
powers to the foundation itself to set up all of those things. As 
the minister suggested in his speech, the specific funding 
agreement between the foundation and the government will come at 
some time after the creation of the bill.  Based on the 
government's record of accountability and transparency and its 
record on the appointment of people favourable to the government 
for these kinds of positions, this is cause for concern for most 
Canadians.  If the government is just going to use this as 
another source for patronage appointments to reward those loyal 
to the government, I do not think we need more of them.  We have 
more than enough already.  The government, or the governor in 
council as it is called, has abused that power in the past.  We 
do not need to create more of those positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we need only to look at other crown 
corporations that the government has created in the past to 
deliver funding in partnership with the private sector and for 
good causes.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the foundation generally sounds like a good 
idea, particularly when the minister presents it.  Why will this 
be different from, for example, what happened to the president of 
the Business Development Bank when he chose to turn down a 
project in the Prime Minister's riding favourable to the Prime 
Minister?  It did not take long for him to change his mind and it 
did not take long to find somebody else to replace the president 
of the Business Development Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is whether the foundation, its president and board of 
directors will be treated any differently by the government than 
those other organizations.  That is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to determine exactly what this arm's length 
organization, as the minister put it, will be.  It appears to me 
that it is in fact a crown corporation created by the government 
to move the disbursement of funds away from the government, away 
from direct responsibility of the minister and to remove it from 
scrutiny by the Auditor General of Canada.  That is one of my 
biggest concerns with this whole foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals a fair bit with the creation of an auditor who 
would be hired and directed by the foundation itself.  However, 
it would be accountable only through its financial statement once 
a year to parliament.  I do not think that is sufficient scrutiny 
or sufficient transparency to satisfy most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general must have access to this thing.  It must be 
more than simply an effort to move the whole idea of funding the 
development of new technologies away from the government so that 
the government can deflect a lot of the criticism for the failure 
of these projects.  Of course the government always accepts the 
accolades for the success of the projects.  Essentially if it 
moves away from the department as it exists now to this crown 
corporation, then the crown corporation is a shield for the 
minister and for the government for any undesirable results that 
might in fact happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has to be addressed and hopefully we can talk about that. I 
will be introducing some amendments in the process to hopefully 
achieve some of that transparency and some of that accountability 
for those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, it could be a good tool for the government to use 
to move and to help create this development of new technologies. 
However, it is very hard to determine just exactly how this 
foundation and its board of directors will achieve the goals that 
are laid out for them.  Clause 19(1) of the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From its funds, the Foundation may provide funding to eligible 
recipients to be used by them solely for the purposes of eligible 
projects in accordance with any terms and conditions specified by 
the Foundation in respect of funding— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is okay expect that nobody knows what those terms 
and conditions will be or what the agreement between the 
government and the foundation will be.  Hopefully we will have 
some clarification of that as we go through the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what concerns me is that it states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—including terms and conditions as to repayment of the funding, 
intellectual property rights and the maximum amount and 
proportion of funding for eligible projects to be provided by the 
Foundation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to understand whether the foundation is simply 
seeking out projects that show potential and helping to provide 
funding in those projects or whether its role is to provide loans 
to these projects. 
It does not appear that the foundation has the ability to 
actually have any ownership in these projects.  It says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Foundation shall not acquire any interest, whether through 
the acquisition of share capital, a partnership interest or 
otherwise, in any research infrastructure acquired by the 
eligible recipient for the project.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a little hard to understand what the objective is, whether 
it is for the foundation simply to cast around and pick winners 
and losers and when it thinks it has a winner to heap money on to 
the project in the hopes that it will be successful or whether it 
is something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both provincial and federal governments certainly do not have a 
good track record when it comes to picking winners and losers in 
business.  I do not think that should really be the role of 
government.  At any rate, the government's role is to provide an 
environment where business can flourish, be successful and 
develop these kinds of technologies.  Government interference 
through the use of tax dollars into business and into the 
development of business can make winners if enough is invested. 
If we invest enough money we can grow bananas at the North Pole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that it distorts the marketplace.  It distorts 
market forces of competition and innovation.  I do not know that 
that should be the government's role.  In fact, I do not think it 
is.  Say we have a promising private sector company in one part 
of the country and a similar private sector company in another 
part of the country, both with some interesting projects that 
show potential.  We have this foundation of people generally 
appointed by the government and favourable to the government. 
Again, if we look at the history with the Business Development 
Bank, which is vulnerable to political pressure and political 
interference by the government, it is easy to see how choices can 
be made to influence the success or failure of a particular 
project.  Depending on where the company is located in the 
country and how favourable that particular organization is, or 
perhaps even how large a donation it has made recently to a 
particular political party, could have an effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to be so skeptical.  However, after the years that I have 
been here it just seems to happen over and over again.  I have no 
reason to expect that this particular venture will be any 
different from the ones in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned some things already from the government's 
efforts on greenhouse gas emission reduction.  It is worthy to 
note that the government has already made some serious mistakes 
in this rush to reduce emissions, to clean up our environment and 
to create sustainable technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right from the very beginning of the conference of the parties 
in Buenos Aires, I believe it was, and as we move forward, the 
environmental side of the equation has always presented the 
theory that we had to force, either through taxation or through 
market forces, the cost of fossil fuel energy higher.  It was too 
cheap in North America and we had to do something to force energy 
prices higher, much higher than those in Europe.  We had to force 
energy conservation which would help us achieve our objective of 
reduced emissions because we have used less fossil fuel and less 
energy, thereby fewer emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is anything to have been learned in the last year with 
the energy crisis that we are facing with spiralling energy costs 
in electricity, in natural gas in particular and gasoline, it is 
that higher energy prices are not the answer for conservation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fossil fuel intense projects like greenhouses, transportation, 
commercial and residential heating are switching back to 
technologies less favourable to the environment instead of simply 
using conservation measures to reduce the consumption of fossil 
fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With organizations like the Pembina Institute, Friends of the 
Earth, Greenpeace and the others that had this idea, it is 
becoming clearer that there were other agendas at play other than 
just energy conservation through higher prices for energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at that, learn from it and understand that the 
development of new technologies will be the answer and will be 
our saviour.  They will reduce emissions and use less energy. 
The fact is that the average citizens out there would love to be 
more environmentally conscious and would love to do their part in 
the reduction of emissions and saving the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government actually done to help them do that?  To 
my knowledge the only thing under this climate change initiative 
the government presented was an offer of $100 to pay half the 
cost of an energy audit for one's home, so that a new industry, 
energy auditors, could be created and could go around telling 
people how they can be more efficient and save money on their 
energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take a rocket scientist to understand that once the 
energy auditor presents recommendations, the real cost in that 
initiative is going to be the implementation of those 
recommendations.  The upgrading of residential and commercial 
buildings and all of things that go with it can run into the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point the government is going to have to look at a 
program to help Canadians take hold of the new technologies which 
have been developed and implement them.  That would not only be 
in residential situations but also in transportation and all 
kinds of sectors.  There are some terrific ideas that will come 
forward and that are already coming forward.  However, the cost 
of implementing them cannot be borne by the individual or by the 
corporate sector that will be expected to use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine what would happen to the cost of fresh fruits and 
vegetables if the cost of transportation continues to rise as it 
has done in the last year?  We clearly have to find better and 
newer technologies to implement in the transportation sector. 
Because that sector operates on such a fine margin, there has to 
be some kind of program and thought put into just how that 
sector could implement those technologies and still be able to 
provide a service to Canadians that is affordable and reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen any indication from the government that it would 
do that.  The only thing it has done so far is the recent energy 
rebate which has turned into the biggest boondoggle we have seen 
in a long time.  People in penitentiaries, dead people and people 
who never paid an energy bill in their lives are receiving 
rebates, while those who are responsible for those costs are not 
getting anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this morning I had a call from a lady not too far from 
Ottawa.  She was wondering what the longer term plan of the 
government might be and what we could suggest to the government 
that might help Canadians next winter and the winter after that. 
It is inevitable that energy costs will continue to rise, 
hopefully not at the rate they did this winter.  It is a finite 
resource and the cost of energy will continue to rise either 
because of the depleting resource or because of the 
implementation of these new technologies of which the minister 
spoke.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was hard-pressed to give the lady a lot of assurance that 
there was anything on the drawing board that would help her in 
particular.  However I did suggest, as we have suggested to the 
government on a number of occasions, that by just simply 
designating home heating fuels as an essential commodity and 
removing excise tax and GST from those commodities would be a 
step in the right direction.  Gas bills having now reached a 
point where in many cases they are higher than mortgage payments, 
I think the removal of those taxes would go a long way toward 
showing some compassion for the hardship created by those energy 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the bill getting into committee so we can hear 
witnesses and hear an explanation of all these things.  At that 
time we will make up our mind whether to support the bill at 
third reading stage.  There needs to be a lot of discussion and a 
lot of answers from the government side on exactly what we are 
trying to achieve, how we will get there and how we will assure 
Canadian taxpayers that this foundation is a good use of their 
tax dollars.  Canadians need assurance that their dollars are not 
being squandered and abused as so often is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the debate and discussion in committee.  We

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today had been introduced before parliament 
was dissolved. It was then know as Bill C-46. The new Bill C-4 
aims at establishing a foundation to fund sustainable 
development technology. Incidentally, the word foundation is 
reminiscent of the sad chapter of the millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of this session, it is difficult to see in what 
direction the government is aiming. 
Of course, the throne speech and its promises could provide 
interesting leads. We realize that all that can be found in that 
document looks like déjà-vu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the legislative program looks the same as what it was 
before the election was called. Just consider the legislation 
concerning young offenders and the employment insurance program. 
Even with regard to Bill C-3, a minister's assistant said only 
the cover page was changed. That is a nice program. Even the 
Cabinet remained unchanged. The old federal reflexes of 
interfering in everything and anything are likely to carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put things briefly in context. Bill C-4, formerly Bill 
C-46, sponsored by the Minister of Natural Resources, would 
create a corporation, the Canada Foundation for Sustainable 
Development Technology. 
The objects and purposes of that foundation would be to provide 
funding for projects to develop and demonstrate new technologies 
to promote sustainable development, including technologies to 
address climate change and air quality issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the Canada Foundation for Sustainable 
Development Technology is one of the initiatives that the 
federal government announced in its February 2000 budget to 
promote environmentally desirable technologies and practices. 
The foundation would operate as a not for profit organization. It 
would consist of a chairperson, six directors and eight members, 
some of them appointed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation would have to table in parliament an annual 
report of its activities. The foundation would also have to 
administer a sustainable development technology fund, which 
would be provided with an initial amount of $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the backgrounder entitled “Canada Foundation for 
Sustainable Development Technology”, which was released by the 
government when the bill was introduced, the foundation would 
provide funding in two dominant areas: new climate-friendly 
technologies that hold the potential to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, and technologies to address clean air issues. This 
undertaking is not as clear in the bill, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding would be for specific projects. In order to benefit 
the maximum number of innovative sources, the foundation would 
accept proposals from existing and new collaborative 
arrangements among technology developers, suppliers and users, 
universities, not-for-profit organizations, and organizations such 
as industrial associations and research institutes. 
Small and medium size enterprises would be strongly encouraged 
to participate and lead projects supported by the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation's activities would complement other government 
programs encouraging technological innovation, such as the 
Technology Early Action Measures component of the Climate Change 
Action Fund, and Technology Partnerships Canada in the case of 
environmental technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a funding agency responsible for promoting the 
development of ecological technologies was recommended by the 
Technology Issues Table. 
In its December 10, 1999, report on the development of 
technological innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
the Technology Issues Table recommended the creation of a fund 
to develop climate change technologies in order to encourage the 
development of target technologies with the potential to reduce 
greenhouse gas effects and stimulate international sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology issues table called for an initial investment of 
$20 million annually, to be increased to $200 million annually 
starting in the fifth year.  It also recommended that 50% of the 
funding come from federal sources, 25% from provincial sources 
and 25% from private sources, although it felt that this could 
vary from one project to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Noting that one of the major challenges of innovation is the 
initial introduction of new technologies and new services in the 
market, the issue table also recommended the creation of a 
climate change technology demonstration program that would 
offset some portion of the financial risks involved in early 
domestic commercialization of greenhouse gas mitigation 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the issue, this option should ramp up from 
$60 million per annum for year one to $300 million per annum for 
year five. The federal government should provide, on a portfolio 
basis, up to 30% of the investment, with the remainder 
originating from provincial and industry sources. The federal 
component would be repayable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context the government decided in its budget 2000 to 
create the Canada Foundation for Sustainable Development 
Technology, which would support both development and 
demonstration activities but would not limit itself to climate 
change technologies. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255
<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, it would fund various projects aimed at promoting 
technologies that contribute to sustainable development. Thus, 
this is a category of much larger projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government said it intended to put the emphasis on the 
funding of new technologies relating to climate change and clean 
air, the bill does not reflect this priority. It simply deals 
with the funding of sustainable development technologies, 
particularly those that are aimed at bringing solutions to 
climate change and air pollution issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the definition of “eligible project” in clause 2, the bill 
does not give express priority to the latter type of projects. 
Therefore, it might be up to the foundation alone to determine, 
under clause 19, what types of projects relating to sustainable 
development it would be prepared to fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the definition of eligible 
recipient in clause 2 refers to an entity that meets the 
criteria of eligibility established in any agreement entered 
into between the government and the foundation. It is not 
clearly indicated if this power, whose concrete aspects are not 
defined anywhere in the bill, could be used by the government to 
restrict the definition of “eligible recipient” to those 
claimants that carry on specific types of projects, thus 
influencing or restricting the foundation's funding decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, could the government and the foundation agree on 
eligibility criteria that would impact on what is an eligible 
project? It would be appropriate to get some clarification on 
that point, particularly since the government said that the 
foundation will not be an agent of Her Majesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The round table on technologies recommended initial funding of 
$80 million for the two phases of the projects, that is 
$20 million for development and $60 million for demonstration. It 
also recommended that this amount be increased to $500 million 
after five years, or $200 million for development projects and 
$300 million for demonstration projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, the foundation would get an initial amount of 
$100 million to support development and demonstration projects. 
Now, since the foundation's mandate goes beyond the financing of 
technologies linked to climate change, one could come to the 
conclusion that the financing provided is insufficient, at least 
for the initial period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk about some Liberal commitments 
regarding the environment. I would like to remind the House of 
some promises made by the Liberals during the last election 
campaign and contained in the third edition of the red book. 
However, the events of last week have shown the real usefulness 
of such documents. They do not seem to stand the test of time, 
since the authors of the promises contained in the red book 
voted against a motion containing one of those promises word for 
word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of those promises which are directly linked to the 
subject matter of today's debate. Again, these are promises made 
by the Liberal government. They are the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) A new Liberal government will help the private sector by 
maintaining R&D tax credits that are already among the most 
generous in the world, and by working to commercialise 
discoveries made in government and university labs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) A new Liberal government will act to significantly improve 
air quality for all Canadians. We will make special efforts to 
clean-up the air of our cities, where the population and the 
pollutants are most highly concentrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) A new Liberal government will continue to support the 
development of cleaner engines and fuels, and we will strengthen 
emissions standards for vehicles. We will greatly reduce sulphur 
in diesel fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) A new Liberal government will attack the problem on several 
fronts under our Action Plan on Climate Change. 
We will promote increase energy efficiency in industry and in 
the transportation system. We will fund the development of new 
energy technologies, such as fuel cells, and help farmers to 
reduce agricultural emissions through improved farming methods. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are promises still.  I continue: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will increase Canada's use of renewable energy, such as 
electricity from wind and ethanol from biomass. We will 
encourage consumers to buy more energy-efficient products by 
providing information and setting high product standards. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That makes a lot of promises.  In the throne speech, the 
government essentially repeated the same things.  It said, for 
instance. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its efforts to promote global sustainable 
development, the Government will ensure that Canada does its 
part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will work with its 
provincial and territorial partners to implement the recently 
announced first national business plan on climate change. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to comment on these statements and promises one 
by one.  A number of them, however, were already known.  For 
instance, the action plan on climate change was announced last 
October 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 and 1999 throne speeches, the Liberals announced 
that they would make the environment one of their priorities, 
that they would address the matter of climate changes and commit 
to promoting sustainable development on an international scale. 
Yet the budget allocated to the environment has done nothing but 
decrease since 1994-95. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How then can the Liberals be believed?  We have no choice but to 
conclude that there is a lot of difference between talking the 
talk and walking the walk.  For example, Environment Canada 
announced several months ago that it was going to call for 
tenders for the design of an import-export policy for 
PCB contaminated waste.  This was made necessary by budget cuts 
at Environment Canada.  As a result of these cuts, the private 
sector was entrusted with the mandate of designing policies on 
the import and export of hazardous waste.  Really now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, nonetheless, retained a few words from the vocabulary 
used in the promises and the throne speech: “on several fronts”, 
“provincial and territorial partners”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several fronts suggests a shotgun approach, in all directions 
and none at the same time. 
I presume that the government has good intentions and is acting 
in good faith. However, what does such concern hide? We saw the 
government move on several fronts in the case of the millennium 
scholarships and other initiatives in the education area, but 
its partners are given very little consideration. The federal 
government always acts as if it was the holder of absolute 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn briefly to what the environment and sustainable 
development commissioner said. If the federal government really 
wants to take the path of sustainable development, it should 
start by examining its own operations to identify the areas it 
could improve before telling people that they should consume 
more ecological and energy efficient products. In his report for 
the year 2000, the Commissioner of the Environment and 
Sustainable Development said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1990, the federal government has made commitments to 
Canadians that it would green its operations. Yet, a decade 
later, there is a lack of rudimentary information about 
government's vast operations, the costs of which are likely more 
than $400 million annually for water, energy and waste disposal. 
We found that the government does not have complete and accurate 
data on the annual cost of running its buildings and on the 
environmental impacts of its operations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When compared to Liberal commitments, this statement by the 
commissioner reveals that what is probably lacking the most at 
the federal level is concerted action. After the fiasco of the 
heating bill visibility operation we see clearly that the 
government does not have a long term vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I would be remiss if I did not underline the recent 
findings of the auditor general on various appointments. The 
establishment of a foundation necessarily implies the 
appointment of a board of directors. I hope that the ministers 
who will make the appointments will base their decision more on 
the competence of the candidates than on their political 
allegiance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is the fact that Canada clearly will not fulfil 
its Kyoto commitment. Not only does Canada not appear to be on 
the way to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, but it 
actually appears to be increasing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the February edition of <I>Le Monde diplomatique</I>, it is reported 
that Canada is part of group of countries called the umbrella 
group. Reference is made to the November 2000 conference held in 
The Hague, which ended in failure due to these countries' 
intransigence.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These countries are attached to loopholes such as the unlimited 
emission rights instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
insist on taking forests into account in the determination of 
efforts made by each country. Organizations have already 
denounced the hypocrisy of Canada, which is hoping to boost its 
reactor sales by trying to include nuclear energy among clean 
tools of economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Vancouver environment and natural resources ministers 
conference, Ottawa tried to address only public awareness 
measures and investment projects in less energy consuming 
technologies. 
And yet, if the trend holds, greenhouse gas emissions in Canada 
could be 35% above what they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must therefore conclude from these examples that what Canada 
is lacking is the firm political will to significantly reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. Resorting to its age old strategy of 
invading provincial jurisdictions rather than developing a joint 
strategy, Canada will not be able to meet its international 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of foundations and other similar initiatives 
will only ease the Canadian government's conscience without 
leading to any tangible result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would this be a new hobby aiming at shrinking the provincial 
role?  Quebec does not need anybody's advice. As Mr. 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau used to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to offset the attraction of separatism is to put time, 
energy and huge amounts of money at the service of federal 
nationalism. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt, the environment will be the next area to be invaded by 
the federal government to try and shrink Quebec's role even 
more. After the Canadian millennium scholarships, education, the 
health minister's plans for a family medicine program, the new 
federal hobby may well be the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, the bill under consideration, which establishes 
a foundation to develop and demonstrate new technologies to 
promote sustainable development, appears to belong to the 
Canadian government's continued effort to have its way in many 
spheres of human action. What will the foundation do? How much 
money will it have at its disposal? The news release announcing 
the bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Foundation will administer the Sustainable Development 
Technology Fund for the development and demonstration of new 
technologies, in particular, those aimed at reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions and improving air quality. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told as well that the foundation will have a budget of 
$100 million.  How will the federal government reconcile the 
many efforts being made in the area of climate change and 
sustainable development?  How will the money allocated for this 
foundation differ from the climate change action fund?  Part of 
this fund is intended for cost effective technological projects 
promoting a reduction in greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have a long tradition of unfulfilled promises with 
respect to the environment. 
More specifically, in the area of greenhouse gases, not only is 
Canada not sufficiently reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, 
it is significantly increasing them.  Rather than making a 
serious commitment to reduce them, Canada is now one of the 
group of countries that is looking more for loopholes in the 
Kyoto protocol than it is for sustainable ways to reduce 
emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard Quebec's energy choices are exemplary, and 
Quebec is resolutely committed to reducing greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this foundation support initiatives in the nuclear sector? 
We could think so, since Canada has lobbied vigorously to have 
nuclear energy considered green. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our election platform we noted that an investment of $1.5 
billion was required for the environment.  The federal 
government must attack this problem seriously.  Had it not 
implemented the policy of $125 for heating oil, for example, it 
could have saved $1.3 billion.  Will the foundation's $100 
million be enough?  Only the future will tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois of course would support this bill because our 
party is concerned about the environment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would support the bill if it were amended on six factors 
giving rise to concern and opposition from the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is the division of powers. We see this as an 
underhanded way for the federal government to intrude once again 
in provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one is that Quebec already has such a foundation. The 
creation of this foundation comes as a surprise, since a $45 
million action fund for sustainable development already exists 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of creating this foundation, the federal government 
should transfer the money to Quebec's agencies, which are 
already working along the lines recommended by the table and 
which have a good understanding of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concentration of powers is another factor. Practically all the 
directors of the foundation are appointed by the governor in 
council. Under the bill, the governor in council, on the 
recommendation of the minister, appoints seven of the 
fifteen directors. However, the eight other directors are 
appointed by the very members appointed by the governor in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the chairperson and all directors may be removed for 
cause by the governor in council. This method of appointment 
seems to be a roundabout way of allowing the federal government 
to interfere in an area under provincial jurisdiction and to 
have control over an organization that is not accountable to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the governor in council has the authority to enter 
into agreements with the foundation to set eligibility criteria 
regarding eligible recipients shows that this organization would 
not really operate at arm's length from the federal government. 
The latter would, in a roundabout way, have a say as to how 
funding is granted to eligible recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another factor is the dangerous definitions contained in the 
bill. For example, since the term “eligible project” deals with 
technologies that include, but are not restricted to, those to 
address climate change and air quality issues, this could allow 
funding for nuclear technology projects justified as a means of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which would be contrary to 
the commitments made by the federal government in Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth factor to consider is the disparity between the 
recommendations from the table and the bill. The foundation 
would be responsible for managing funds to support technologies 
to promote sustainable development. It is certainly a lofty 
goal, but it is rather vague when used in a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of such a foundation would not reflect the 
main recommendation of the table which was to allocate money for 
the development of technologies to reduce greenhouses gas 
emissions and to stimulate international sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not reflect the general direction of the 
recommendations of the technology table, mainly because it does 
not include a goal oriented implementation strategy. Also, the 
bill does not promote co-operation between the federal 
government, the provinces and industry and does not contain a 
qualitative definition of the benefits and factors contributing 
to our quality of live for each of the options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill only focuses on two of the eight options brought 
forward by the technology table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last factor has to do with the level of funding. 
We are concerned about the small amount allocated to the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998, the Anderson 
strategy had a budget totalling $1.3 billion over a period of 
five years to fight this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 10, 1998, the table released a report on the 
development of technological innovations to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, in which it recommended that a fund be set up, 
with an initial contribution of $80 million for both stages, 
development and demonstration, and that the funding be increased 
to $500 million after five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the terms of reference of the foundation are not limited 
to technologies addressing climate change, the funding for the 
initial phase is not enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would say that, through its environmental 
policy, the Bloc Quebecois does support positive and proactive 
actions, provided they take into account the fact that Quebec is 
an important stakeholder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we will be moving amendments at committee stage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I say a special merci beaucoup to 
the translators of the House of Commons who do a great job 
interpreting what we are trying to say to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we say about the bill?  It is sustainable development 
technology.  It is a $100 million fund that will go into a pot 
somewhere and then some people will look at it and do something 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is anything like the millennium scholarship fund, we in 
the New Democratic Party fear that it will go absolutely nowhere 
and benefit very few people.  I find it pleasing that the 
government is at least talking about sustainable technology.  We 
fear that the government will not do very much about it.  Anyone 
needing more proof should look at our commitments at Kyoto and 
Rio.  What did we do about those commitments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set targets and guidelines for CO2 emission reductions for 
2006 and 2008.  The goal posts have now been moved to 2010 and 
2012 and so on.  It is quite ironic that while we are debating 
the bill there is a report from the UN coming out today 
mentioning that global warming is indeed real.  It is happening 
and it is having a great affect on the population of the planet, 
not just in one specific area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us on the east coast, as my Conservative Party 
colleague from the South Shore knows, people living by the ocean 
are getting a little nervous.  On the prairies this has probably 
been one of the driest winters my friends in Calgary have ever 
had.  Yet St. John's, Newfoundland, has had over 16 feet of snow 
and it is still coming down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the floods on the Saguenay River in Quebec and the Red 
River in Winnipeg, it is very important that all Canadians start 
to realize that they should not be critical of the reports by 
scientists from around the world and the UN.  Global warming is a 
fact although I have to say, tongue in cheek, that members of the 
Reform Party, now the Canadian Alliance Party, stated in the 
House many times that global warming was a myth.  They said that 
it did not exist and asked what we were worried about.  We should 
be very worried about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the government is at least discussing 
sustainable development technology.  However I suspect, like the 
millennium fund, that it will be just a group of people who the 
government mostly appoints.  Most NGOs, groups like International 
Fund for Animal Welfare, the David Suzuki Foundation, the Sierra 
Club of Canada, the World Wildlife Fund Canada and a group from 
my own riding like the Ecology Action Centre, are great people 
who volunteer a lot of their time to promote sustainable 
technology in the world and in their own community.  I suspect 
they will be left out of this so-called inner circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astonishing that the government wants to bring something 
in like that.  At the same time it says not to worry because it 
knows that Canada has to be the number one nation in the world 
when it comes to sustainable technology.  It knows that Canada 
has to care for the planet and be world leaders.  At the same 
time it says that, CIDA gives $280,000 to Monsanto so that it 
could have its genetically modified cotton and corn seeds grown 
in China.  This is absolutely unbelievable.  It is incredible 
that the government would give a large corporation like that any 
tax dollars at all to support genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that the fund will end up supporting large 
multinational corporations such as Monsanto so that they in turn 
could promote genetically modified foods and all kinds of things 
of which Canadians are simply unaware.  That simply would not be

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were serious about sustainable development 
technology it would have incorporated into law two motions that 
were passed in the House.  One was in the name of my colleague 
from Winnipeg Centre that asked for a major retrofit of the 
50,000 government buildings that Canada owns.  Not only would 
that create green jobs, but it would reduce the amount of energy 
those buildings currently use.  The savings would be enormous and 
it would create work at the same time.  So far the government has 
been silent even though the motion was passed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one was in the name of Mr. Nelson Riis, a former member 
of the House.  His motion passed in the House.  It basically said 
that any company of business that wished to give its employees a 
transit pass to take a bus to their workplace instead of using a 
vehicle would be allowed to claim the transit pass as a business 
deduction.  That makes a lot of sense, especially for urban areas 
like Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver, Edmonton and Halifax. 
It may not be so big in Bridgewater down on the South Shore or in 
areas like Sheet Harbour, but in the major urban centres it would 
make a lot of sense.  So far there has been silence from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of initiatives that we as New Democrats 
bring forward.  Many government members voted for the motion, so 
why has it not been incorporated?  It would reduce our dependency 
on fossil fuels, which would be great for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having $100 million going to a specific fund that other people 
could access to do various projects basically means that the 
government could then turn around and say it is not responsible 
any more and be at arm's length.  The government would supply 
taxpayer dollars.  There are no assurances that taxpayers will 
get the best bang for their buck.  This group, whomever they are, 
will decide how to spend it or what to do with it.  When a 
problem arises, the government could easily wash its hands and 
say that it is not responsible and that the group is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More proof of that is the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum 
Board.  I believe oil and gas exploration and commercial fishing 
can co-exist, but the fears of commercial fishermen in the 
communities along the coastlines, especially in the areas of Cape 
Breton, New Brunswick and P.E.I., should be allayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are basically asking for clear, independent scientific 
assessments on what seismic drilling and gas exploration do to 
the fisheries along their coast, especially on the inner coast. 
That is all they are asking for and they cannot get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is not its responsibility any more.  It 
handed that responsibility over to the Canada-Nova Scotia 
Offshore Petroleum Board.  When the province is approached, it 
says the same, that it is not responsible. It turned that 
responsibility over to the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum 
Board which is now responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this happen already.  Seismic drilling leases have 
already been granted in phase 1, which is the Cabot Walk just off 
Cape Breton.  The company will do the assessment afterwards. That 
is putting the cart before the horse.  What should happen quite 
clearly is that the assessment must be done first and then a 
lease should be granted, depending on the environmental 
assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assessment may say it is not a good place to drill because 
it could do harm to the fish stocks.  We do not know.  We should 
not be drilling or even testing until that information is brought 
forward first.  If the information says they can co-exist, that 
is great for everybody.  As long as we do not have an assessment, 
we will always have a large percentage of people opposed to oil 
and gas drilling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In previous discussions we had earlier this morning we discussed 
aquaculture.  I believe aquaculture could be a very good thing 
for the country only if the precautionary principle is taken. 
That means that we do all the environmental work upfront to 
ensure that the aquaculture site, the oil and gas sector or 
whatever is using our waterways is done within the strict 
guidelines of the environmental assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those assessments must be paid for by the government.  They 
should not be paid for by industry, because there is always the 
perception that the advice or the information may be tainted. 
The perception is that if we pay enough money and get the right 
scientists they will tell us whatever we want to hear.  However, 
when it comes to our environment, the thing that sustains us the 
most, we should take every precaution when it comes to protecting 
our environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The $100 million fund will simply not be enough.  We believe the 
government should put a couple of billion dollars into the fund 
and see what happens.  The fact is that $100 million will simply 
not cover what is required to develop new sustainable 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the aquaculture industry, I have said many times 
that the federal and provincial governments should be working 
with industry to develop the closed net systems.  By doing that 
we would have no escapes and no effluent running from those cages 
into our waterways.  We need to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be working together with the industry and 
with other groups for the best technology that is out there.  The 
government must accept its responsibility.  It cannot hand off 
its legislative ability to an arm's length body.  It cannot do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people come to us, whether we are in government or in 
opposition, to express their opinions and their views.  They do 
not see these other groups and organizations.  All they know is 
that they elected us to protect them when it comes to their 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as legislators, whether federal, provincial or municipal, 
have a responsibility to the citizens of Canada to ensure that 
they, their families, their children and their children's 
children have a proper, healthy environment in Canada and 
worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was right when he spoke about Canada being a world 
leader.  If he had said that from his heart and his head I would 
have believed him, but he was reading a prepared speech at the 
time he said that.  It is a little tongue and cheek when I say 
that I am rather doubtful that the Liberal government will once 
and for all understand the environmental damages some of its 
policies and past Conservative policies have placed on the 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A classic example of environmental damage is at the tar ponds in 
Cape Breton.  I am sure my Conservative colleague has been there. 
The Sydney tar ponds are an absolute disaster, a major blight.  I 
am not talking about Prince Edward Island and the potato blight 
problem it has.  I am talking about an eyesore not only on Cape 
Breton but right across the country.  It is our worst 
environmental mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government and the province do about it?  They set 
up a committee called JAG to work out solutions and figure out 
what was going on.  They have been talking about it for years and 
still nothing has been cleaned up.  People are getting cancer and 
dying from the residue.  The NDP has been encouraging the 
government to put the resources behind it and clean up the mess 
once and for all.  There was even a proposal, and I am not sure 
if it was this particular group, to cement it all in, cover it up 
or maybe put a parking lot on top of it.  These are the kinds of 
ideas they come up with and they are unacceptable.  It is time 
the government accepted its responsibility when it comes to 
protecting our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many great organizations out there that are saying to 
the government that they will help.  They are saying that they 
would like to become part of the so called inner circle when it 
comes to these types of funds.  They want to work with industry 
not against it.  They want to work with the provinces and the 
municipalities.  As my colleague from the Bloc said, one of the 
things the Bloc will have concerns with is that this may intrude 
in the provincial powers that Quebec has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Bloc that it should lighten up a bit because the 
environment knows no boundaries.  The federal government has a 
responsibility in all parts of the country, whether it is in 
Quebec or anywhere else.  We are opposed to the legislation at 
the current time because it is too vague and wishy-washy.  It is 
$100 million so the government can show what it did.  However it 
has not done anything.  It will not reduce CO2 emissions one 
ounce when all is said and done. 
It will not encourage the environmental groups to get onside and 
give them their ideas and work together.  It will not do any of 
that.  Some of the people here will be appointed by the 
government.  We know what happens when the government appoints 
people.  The former member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port 
Coquitlam, Mr. Lou Sekora, was appointed, I believe, to the 
immigration board, a $100 million board, to discuss citizenship 
and immigration.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like Mr. Sekora.  He is a great guy and a lot of fun.  However 
when he sat on the fisheries and oceans committee we had to wake 
him up all the time.  Now this guy, who happens to be a 
Liberal, has been appointed to the board of citizenship and 
immigration.  What qualifications does he have for that job? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I greatly admire Mr. Sekora but he should have appeared before a 
committee and the committee should have decided whether he was 
qualified to do the job.  It should be the same for this kind of 
board.  If the government spends $100 million of taxpayer money 
parliament should, especially in the environment committee, have 
a say in who is on the board.  That is open and transparent 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we do not have that in the House of Commons.  The 
vote the other day showed that.  The Liberals voted against their 
own 1993 promise, with the exception of a couple of members who 
had the fortitude to say that what the government was doing was 
wrong.  They supported the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics get in the way.  If the government can do that, who 
says it will not do it with this type of legislation?  Over and 
over again, decisions are made within the PMO and to hell with 
anybody else.  That is why a lot of people have no trust in 
either government or opposition MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe most Canadians understand that Ottawa has an 
obligation and a right to protect them in terms of the 
environment.  However if we asked any Canadian they would say 
that the government does not know the first thing about 
protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As legislators we have done a bad job of protecting the 
environment because we have been afraid of upsetting major 
multinational corporations.  There is a court case in B.C. 
involving a company called Metalclad.  The company wants to override 
Mexican laws and put its plant in Mexico.  Its plant will pollute the 
air and do all kinds of things but Metalclad does not care what 
the Mexican government says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true on MMT.  We tried to ban a manganese additive 
from gasoline in Canada but we did not have the legislative 
ability to do it.  While it is banned in other countries and in 
many U.S. states, we cannot ban it here because of our trade 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not address the trade agreements.  It does not address 
whether Canada will have the ability to protect itself.  Will the 
people appointed to the board administering the $100 million fund 
go to the government for answers on what they can do, or must 
they go to some obscure place like Brussels and ask some trade 
panel what they can do?  These are the worries we have over on 
this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the initiative the government is finally talking 
about.  We appreciate the government for doing that.  However we 
are disappointed that it is very vague and superficial.  There is 
no hard evidence in the legislation that the government will 
finally get serious about global warming and other environmental 
effects on our country.  Without further amendments we simply 
cannot support the initiative at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to add a little correction to my friend's comments about 
MMT. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very closely involved with that legislation.  The member 
has led us to believe that some U.S. states still outlaw MMT. In 
fact the U.S. supreme court overruled the EPA about a year and a 
half ago, making MMT legal in any state where the refiners still 
want it.  I wanted to make that correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is incredibly timely when we hear reports 
continually about global warming and the fact that it is 
accelerating to a degree we did not imagine even six months ago. 
The challenge is how to deal with it and properly address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced the bill on sustainable 
development technology to try to address it.  It has proposed 
that a board be set up to look at proposals on new technologies 
and hopefully to assist in their development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my hon. friend say that the people making the proposals 
should come directly to government.  I may have misunderstood 
what he said, but I think he said that government itself should 
intervene with the developers rather than an arm's length 
organization.  Perhaps I was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question for the member.  Why does he say that 
$100 million is not enough?  It may not be enough and may be a 
fraction of what is needed but what amount would the member 
suggest?  Would he suggest we get into the dozens of billions of 
dollars?  Does he have some foundation to put an accurate figure 
to the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the MMT debate, I will 
check my notes again.  It was very interesting that he asked 
about the amount.  When the millennium scholarship was started it 
was $2.5 billion.  That was a good figure to start with.  If it 
can be done for the millennium fund, why not put the same amount 
into something of this nature? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is ultimately responsible for environmental 
protection.  It is amazing to hear a member of the government say 
that the government had no idea six months ago that global 
warming existed.  It is as if the member just had an epiphany and 
found out about the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have been talking about global warming for many years. It 
is not new to the people of Canada or to the citizens of the 
world.  Unfortunately, however, it may be new to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to correct my hon. friend.  That is not what I said 
at all.  I said that the government had no idea that global 
warming had accelerated to the extent that it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
pointing that out but the facts are there.  Where are the real 
commitments?  Where are the Kyoto commitments?  Has the 
government completely ignored them?  I bet it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will now come up with something new.  If it would 
honour the commitments it made in world cities like Rio and 
Kyoto, maybe we would not need $100 million.  If it had honoured 
its commitments initially we would perhaps not be having this 
debate today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I 
start into the bulk of my speech on the Canada foundation for 
sustainable development technology, I will comment on a couple of 
points made by my colleague from Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore.  My colleague in the NDP could not resist 
the urge to take a swipe at the Conservative Party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1340

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Conservative policies did recognize climate change 
and climate warming on the planet.  We were the people behind the 
Rio summit and we started the whole operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague also mentioned a small problem with potato blight. 
If he was a farmer in P.E.I. with a million dollars worth of 
potatoes in cold storage, and if he was looking at $10 million 
that the Liberal government put into a composting program while 
it did absolutely nothing to help farmers in P.E.I., he would not 
think it was a small problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am getting off subject, but as far as the tar ponds go, I 
spent a good part of my life mixing mud on oil rigs and know a 
little bit about how to make mud.  Anybody with a couple of tons 
of barite, a couple of tons of gel and a little bit of resinex 
could mix that stuff in the tar ponds and would have had it 
pumped out of there long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we had was an abrogation of responsibility by the former 
Liberal provincial government of Nova Scotia and by federal 
governments in Ottawa that did not deal with that issue.  It 
could have been dealt with, the waste could have been incinerated 
and it would have been gone and we would not be dealing with it 
or discussing it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the point of the debate, the Canada foundation for 
sustainable development technology act is a bill that would 
establish a foundation to fund innovative projects specifically 
in the areas of climate change and air quality.  Those are two 
areas we must deal with.  We were never able to ignore the fact 
that climate change was taking place, but we can no longer afford 
to look the other way and not deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite shocked to hear that the bill could not get at least 
tentative support from the NDP to go to the committee stage.  My 
tendency, as critic for the Conservative Party, is to at least 
support the bill going to committee stage where we can have a 
look at it, debate it much more indepth and then see what comes 
out of committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the foundation will be to support the development 
or demonstration of new technologies or innovations that will 
help to reduce the impact of climate change, whether through 
energy efficiency, alternative energy sources or other 
developments.  It is a lofty and commendable objective since we 
all know that Canada needs to do its share to help reduce climate 
change worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada committed itself at Kyoto to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions to 1992 levels.  I will address today whether 
establishing the foundation is one way of achieving that 
objective, but I will also be closely examining it at committee 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous alternative energy sources available on the 
market but getting them into public use or making them cost 
effective can be challenging.  Canada may be a world leader in 
some areas, such as the Ballard fuel cell or solar technology, 
but I question whether we are fully exploiting these 
capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change, 
which was mentioned earlier, released its assessment two weeks 
ago. In its report it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now new and stronger evidence that most of the warming 
observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human 
activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is anything new but it is very damning 
evidence when a number of countries and industries on the planet 
say that they are not contributing to climate change or, even 
worse, that climate change does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capitalizing and exploring opportunities to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions will be a challenge for Canada.  Although Canada 
offers generous tax credits for research and development, the 
private sector has been slow to embrace the new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may have the ability and the ideas but we are not bringing 
them forward or pushing them into mainstream applications.  There 
are large markets for these technologies or ideas if they can be 
shown to be effective.  However, Canadians need to be encouraged 
to bring forward ideas, to seek new solutions and to develop them 
for the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the research and development tax credit has failed to spur 
innovation can the proposed foundation overcome the obstacles and 
help bring new ideas to the market stage?  That is the gist of 
what this is about, and it is really the issue we are talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Andrew Weaver made an interesting argument for more action on 
greenhouse gas reductions in his article in the <I>Edmonton 
Journal</I>.  In asserting that countries should continue to try 
to meet their Kyoto commitments, Mr. Weaver stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason lies not so much in the carbon-dioxide reductions that 
will ensue, but rather through the spawning of new technologies 
which will lead us to a less fossil-fuel-based society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what the legislation hopes to accomplish in 
some small way.  With $100 million to allocate over a period of 
time that will likely span five to seven years, it will be a job 
for the foundation to ensure that the money is used in the most 
effective manner possible.  By leveraging projects at a 25% basis 
there is a maximum potential to spur $400 million worth of new 
projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament we all know many people are seeking 
government funding for good ideas.  Projects to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, however, are the target of the legislation.  It 
will be up to a board of directors and a board of members to make 
decisions about which projects receive funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted, as was noted by other members who spoke to 
the legislation, that one of the items in the bill we really do 
not fully understand is the remuneration that will go to board 
members.  The per diems that will go to board members will be the 
same as those that go to any federal employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to find out at committee stage who comprises the 
board.  We know that seven of the fifteen board members will be 
appointees of the federal government.  Who comprises the board? 
Who picks the board?  How much industry representation will be on 
it?  How much exactly will the board cost Canadian taxpayers who 
take the money out of their back pockets to run this operation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the foundation will be provided with $100 
million that it will have to allocate over a period of time with 
the aim of helping those projects that best meet the 
qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these qualifications will be that the development or 
demonstration be widely applicable and not limited to a single 
application.  Since the objective will be to help Canadians, the 
idea and the developing technology must be made available to 
other interested parties.  That is why the issue of intellectual 
property, while not belonging to the federal government or the 
foundation, will have to be discussed by the partners to ensure 
accessibility for anyone else who would like to utilize this 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the time to highlight a few technologies 
and ideas which I think are relevant to this discussion.  One 
example is LNG, liquefied natural gas.  It is a gas that has been 
cooled to a liquid state, meaning that the higher volume can be 
stored in a smaller space.  There is improved fuel economy and 
lower emissions because there is greater optimization of engine 
performance with liquefied natural gas.  Obviously this is one 
option for helping to reduce emissions and ultimately improve air 
quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are limitations, however, with liquefied natural gas.  The 
gas has to be cooled to -125°C, presenting some challenges and 
some additional costs.  Otherwise vaporisation would occur and 
some of the fuel would be lost.  That is one of the reasons why 
this fuel is geared toward long distance, heavy duty vehicles 
which could conceivably handle the storage challenge.  These 
challenges, however, are being addressed with a growing emphasis 
on alternative fuel sources.  There may be greater attention paid 
to developing more practical applications of liquefied natural 
gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the first patent for liquefied natural gas was issued 
in 1914, it was not until the 1990s that it really moved beyond 
the experimental stage to the point where today its application 
as a fuel alternative is being seriously examined and tested.  By 
offering a fuel alternative with lower emissions, it is an 
example of the type of innovation that the legislation would want 
to promote and encourage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example that is more broadly familiar to Canadians is 
the Ballard fuel cell.  Ballard Power Systems began in 1979 but 
it was not until 1983 that it began testing the concept behind 
fuel cells, mainly the combination of hydrogen fuel and oxygen to 
create electricity.  With heat and water vapour the only 
byproducts of the combustion process, fuel cells show immense 
potential as a means of reducing greenhouse gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A prototype vehicle powered by Ballard fuel cells was unveiled 
in March 1999 and can travel 450 kilometres before refuelling. 
Ballard hopes to have fuel cell powered cars on the market for 
public use in 2003 to 2005 from major auto manufacturers such as 
Ford, General Motors, DaimlerChrysler, Honda and Toyota. Although 
not yet available on a commercial scale, the focus for Ballard 
will be to help develop viable alternatives and applications on a 
wide scale mass market level. 
If cost reductions could be achieved by mass marketing, this 
technology would allow the advantages of the product to be widely

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point behind the government's bill.  It is to take 
good ideas and good concepts that are not mainstream now, put 
them out there and apply them on a very wide scale.  It is this 
type of innovation that the legislation before us today hopes to 
promote and encourage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much room exists for renewable energy sources.  Currently 
renewables make up only 2% of the global energy supply, but the 
International Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development suggests that by 2020 it will make up 
only 3% of the global energy supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from that statement that the world and certainly 
Canada, the United States, the developed countries and the G8 
nations are moving painfully slow in the direction of renewable 
energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to improve the projection, it will be imperative for 
the Canadian government to encourage the development of new 
technologies and to encourage not just new ideas but to challenge 
people to think of new applications for the regional, national 
and global markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy demands are increasing as a result of our increasing 
reliance on the high tech industry and its immense need for 
electricity.  If any of us need to think that over, we best think 
about brownouts and blackouts in California where the high tech 
industry for the entire world is situated.  The fact is they use 
so much electricity in that field that they are taking more 
electricity than the grid can offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the rapid industrialization of developing countries 
will also increase global demand for energy sources.  If there 
are new options that provide cleaner fuel sources or that use 
alternative energy sources, we could take steps toward reducing 
global greenhouse gas emissions.  It is a challenge for everyone 
but the federal government needs to be taking the lead if it 
wants to demonstrate any commitment to meeting its Kyoto 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is another step, but further study will help us 
to determine if it is truly a step in the right direction or 
simply another government initiative that looks good but really 
does not accomplish its objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions were raised before that there was not enough money, 
that $100 million was not enough money.  If members would do 
their research on the legislation, they would recognize that it 
dovetails with a lot of other existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to review the other legislation that the new piece 
of legislation would dovetail with.  The existing federal 
technology programs all have features that distinguish them from 
the sustainable development technology fund but are complementary 
in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the program of energy research and development has an 
allocation of $58 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of 
Canada does not fund development or demonstration projects led by 
the private sector as the SDTF will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is a budget for the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation of $2.4 billion, quite a substantial amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth is Technology Partnerships Canada with another budget of 
$300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the industrial research assistance program funds for 
small and medium size enterprises to help them improve their 
innovation capacity through research and development projects 
that could span the full spectrum of technological and industrial 
sectors.  It has an annual allocation of $7 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology early actions measures funds technology projects 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nationally and internationally 
while sustaining economic and social development.  Its allocation 
of $57 million over three years is basically now depleted.  I 
suspect the $100 million may dovetail quite nicely into that 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of federal funding is going into sustainable energy and 
alternative energies.  There is a lot of commitment by the 
government and previous governments to deal with the issue.  We 
have to ensure any time we are spending taxpayer money, and 
ultimately it is always taxpayer money, that the money is 
allocated in a proper manner and that the government spends it 
responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue if there is one with the $100 million fund is 
certainly that there are a number of other programs out there 
now.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of those programs would dovetail very neatly into the 
existing program.  I should like to find out more about the other 
existing programs at the committee stage before we support the 
bill when it comes to a vote in the House.  I certainly encourage 
and applaud the government for moving in the right direction with 
the bill.  We will take into consideration at the end of the day 
whether or not we will support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was very 
happy and excited to hear the member's comments in support of the 
bill and getting it to committee to be properly scrutinized and 
perhaps amended and improved as we go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's heart is in the right place.  He understands the 
direction that the country has to go in.  We do not have a choice 
any more.  I would leave him with one question.  How does he 
consider a finite resource is sustainable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, how do we consider a 
finite resource is sustainable?  All resources ultimately are not 
sustainable and we will end up using every resource on the 
planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about sustainability of finite resources and if we 
are speaking about fossil fuels, the issue becomes how we better 
utilize the fossil fuels in the ground today.  We have new 
technologies.  We have new ways of getting more gas and more oil 
out of the ground.  We have found ways to develop the tar sands 
that were not in existence 20 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finite resources may not be as finite as we once thought, 
but it is an issue we have to deal with.  The government has to 
deal with it.  We simply cannot continue to ignore it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, energy sources will become even more valuable 
than they are today.  We will depend upon larger sources of 
electricity.  We will be using more electricity as the IT sector 
takes off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done it in every other resource.  We do not use less 
energy; we use more energy.  Some people would argue that we use 
too much energy.  The fact remains that we use energy and we have 
to find ways to produce it, more sustainable ways not only of 
finding alternative and new energy sources but new ways of 
utilizing and extending the energy sources that are there 
already.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the official opposition, the markets 
and most economists have been saying for some time that we are 
going into a downturn.  The federal Liberals have been in constant 
denial about that, just whistling that we should not worry and be 
happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday in the House the Deputy Prime Minister agreed with the 
official opposition.  He said “The Canadian and U.S. economies 
are headed to a slowdown”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Deputy Prime Minister agrees that we are headed toward a 
slowdown, why is the government not putting into place clear, 
precise steps of action to reduce the impact of that slowdown on 
Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has said right from the very beginning 
that the Canadian economy is not immune to a slowdown in the 
United States.  We are indeed preoccupied with what is happening 
with our neighbour to the south and, obviously, its effect on 
jobs and the quality of life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that the Leader of the Opposition mentioned 
Nortel and given the fact that what has happened at Nortel is in 
fact a reduction in demand outside our borders, primarily in the 
United States, would he tell us what we could do in a Canadian 
budget that would improve consumer demand in the United States? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

be addressing that in a news conference complete with charts and 
very specific steps of action.  He should come on out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some call it a slowdown and some call it reduced demand from 
outside the United States.  It is incumbent upon governments to 
plan,— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It is very difficult for the

appropriate for members to hear the Leader of the Opposition ask 
his question, certainly the Chair wishes to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is noisy over there. 
Who let the dogs out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon a government to plan for both the good 
times and the bad times.  The only planning we have seen from the 
government is a stale-dated mini budget last fall based on rosy 
predictions which even their resident economist, the now member 
for Markham, said could lead into a deficit because of their 
increased spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not table a budget to deal with the 
uncertainties and to show clear steps of actions to reduce the 
impact.  Table the budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely right, it does take 
foresight and planning.  That is why in the October statement not 
only was there the largest degree of stimulus in Canadian 
history, the largest tax cut of $17 billion this year, but there 
was also massive spending both on health care and on early 
childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than the Leader of the Opposition waiting for his 
charts—will he wear a wetsuit at the same time—what would he do 
in a Canadian budget that would increase consumption in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have said on two occasions that the government, as a 
result of its prudence, as a result of its tax cuts, which are 
unparalleled in Canadian history, and as a result of its 
spending, has put in place the measures that are required.  While 
the Americans are debating tax cuts, the government has done 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that the tax cuts that we brought in on 
January 1 were greater than were the tax cuts that were 
recommended by the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I go back to the hon. member.  I have asked him the question 
three times.  What would he put in a budget now that would affect 
consumer demand in the United States?  That is where the problem 
lies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the problem lies with a finance minister who cannot 
recognize reality.  We proposed $125 billion in real tax cuts, 
unlike the kind of CPP payroll tax increases being imposed by 
this minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December the manufacturing decline was offset by an increase 
in shipping of electronics parts.  Now that Nortel has laid off 
10,000 people, we can see that the picture will change 
significantly down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the finance minister not agree with the growing number 
of experts who say that it is time to come in with a real budget 
and a plan to jump start the Canadian economy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the slowdown in the United States is taking place now. 
The tax cuts that we put into place are greater than the first 
year tax cuts that the Alliance would have brought in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the Alliance did recommend $25 billion in tax cuts in the 
fifth year, greater than what we did, but that would have put us 
back into a deficit.  Would the hon. member tell us why going 
back into a deficit would improve the situation with consumers in 
the United States? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if he wants to talk about deficit, perhaps he should 
talk to his member for Markham who said that his own wild 
spending plans in this budget could put the government back into 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he seems to be in denial, perhaps he could talk to his own 
parliamentary secretary who said on TV last week, on a panel 
with me, that growth this year could be as low as 2%.  That 2% is 
a whole lot less lower than the 3.5% which was the growth 
projection in this government's tax and spend fiscal plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the member for Markham and his own parliamentary secretary 
contradicting him, will the minister come in with a budget that 
will jump start this economy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the October statement we set aside prudence factors 
that in fact compensate for the reduction in growth that is now 
projected.  The fact is that we showed the foresight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member just said that we should be cutting spending. 
Would the hon. member tell me how cutting spending will add 
stimulus to the Canadian economy at a time of slowdown in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois leader should also recognize that 34

</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial draft chapters in these nine areas were developed

see the americanization of our institutions and, instead of a

completely different and that has nothing to do with our own 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada, we have our own way of doing things; the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
does a very serious job. Canada's position

<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is very 
serious.  On February 8, the Prime Minister said he could not 
make Canada's position public, because the other countries did 
not want it and he could not reveal it to us parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the minister has just said the same thing, that we cannot 
make it public, since the 34 countries do not want us to.  A 
U.S. government document, dated January 17, says that American

issue.  It would have been totally surprising if the Prime 
Minister and I were to say the opposite thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member of one thing and that is that the 
Canadian government wants there to be as much transparency as 
possible in the negotiations of the free trade area of the 
Americas. We were the first country to make our bargaining 
positions public and we will ask our partners in the Americas to 
release the texts of negotiations, because this is what we want. 
However, Canada will not do it unilaterally. It will do it with 
its partners and the other parties to the negotiations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, 
when the U.S. government, whose members are not exactly in the 
pee-wee league of this type of international negotiations—as 
members will acknowledge—consider it legitimate to make the other 
countries' positions public and accessible to their 
representatives, the minister should not be surprised that we 
consider it unacceptable for the Canadian government to call 
itself transparent and refuse to reveal its position.  This is 
abnormal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of talking about transparency, the minister should act 
coherently, tell us the truth and show us the documents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

the United States and Chile followed our example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the first country to ask for publication of the 
negotiations texts, and I really hope we can convince our 
partners in the Americas so that we may all look at them

that documents may be available to American members of congress 
that are not available to Canadian members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Minister for International Trade answer a 
question.  Never mind Americanization.  The most Americanizing 
thing that one could think of would be the FTAA.  It is not a 
question of Americanization.  It is a question of democracy and 
access for members of parliament to important documents. Will he

proceeding.  I will look into exactly how they are proceeding in

is available to congress, it will not be long before it becomes 
public.  Let me look into exactly how the Americans are 
proceeding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Peschisolido (Richmond, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the economy is taking a turn for the worse and the 
finance minister is ignoring it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bank of Canada has decreased its economic forecast by one 
full percentage point.  Forty-three per cent of Canadian 
manufacturers are planning for an economic slowdown.  Thousands 
of Canadians have lost their jobs.  Why is the finance minister 
ignoring the problem and not tabling a budget in the next month? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government is obviously preoccupied by the economic 
situation.  There is no doubt that whenever a Canadian loses a 
job it is a tragedy and it is of utmost concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fact is that in the last six years there have been 
two crises, the Mexican peso crisis and the Asian crisis, both of 
which the government has taken the country through.  We have done 
very well.  In both cases panic was demonstrated on the other 
side, which is exactly what is being demonstrated now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, as I have before, if there is to be a new 
budget what would the hon. member like to see in that budget that 
will improve consumer demand in the United States.  That is where 
the problem lies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Peschisolido (Richmond, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Friday, the Deputy Prime Minister clearly said that 
the economies of the United States and of Canada were slowing 
down. It is obvious that the Deputy Prime Minister's view is very 
different from that of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With what part of the Deputy Prime Minister's economic analysis 
does the Minister of Finance not agree? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member seems to be having a little trouble understanding. 
There is no doubt that the economy of the United States is 
slowing down.  There is no doubt that this will have an impact on 
us. Furthermore, that is why the government introduced the 
largest tax cut in Canada's history.  That is why we put so much 
into new spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, if the hon. member has other suggestions, I look forward to 
hearing them.  Does he want us to go into a deficit?  Does he 
want to cut spending?  Does he want to increase tax cuts?  And, 
if so, how will this work?  How will this improve the economic 
situation of the United States?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
response to my question a little while ago, the Minister for 
International Trade told us it would mean the Americanization of 
our institutions if we were to allow parliamentarians to have a 
right of inspection, to be informed about the documents relating 
to the Summit of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about the countries' positions.  I am referring 
to the nine sectoral working documents, which we have been 
requesting for several weeks. The Americans are entitled to see 
such documents.  Why would we not have the same right? How is it 
that our system would be thrown into total disarray if 
parliamentarians were informed?  Are we not headed toward the 
same situation we had during the negotiations on the 
multilateral agreement on investment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are working in conjunction with partners 
throughout the country.  With the standing committee on foreign 
affairs, we have a web site, a protected site, through which an 
ongoing dialogue is carried out daily with all provincial 
governments focused on the multilateral agreements.  Whether the 
free trade area or the World Trade Organization is involved, we 
are constantly seeking improved ways of working.  We are totally 
open to any possible improvement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is the same thing we heard when they were negotiating the MAI. 
That is what they were saying when a text came out on the 
Internet at a certain point.  A great hullabaloo ensued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister this. We are told here in the House 
that the countries had agreed not to make the nine documents of 
the sectorial tables public, whereas this had happened in the 
United States as far back as January 17.  There are two possible 
scenarios here: we were not told the truth, we were lied to, or 
the government was not aware of this.  Neither is a particularly 
attractive situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want to improve the situation, as the minister has just 
said, would he accept doing the same as is being done in the 
United States, here in this very House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that here in Canada we have 
an approach to multilateral and bilateral agreements that 
involves a parliamentary committee.  The positions of our 
government, my negotiating mandate, were put on the Internet 
site and very closely reflected what had been said by the 
parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We worked with the parliamentary 
committee and our position is very closely in line with its 
wishes.  It is, moreover, our intention to continue to do a good 
job as far as openness in the negotiations is concerned, and the 
negotiations are being discussed with the provinces.

Canada are taking corrective action.  The fiscal leaders in the 
United States are taking corrective action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the finance minister wants to go into the future with a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

States is major tax reductions spread over a 10 year period, with 
the bulk of them to occur at the end of the period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our case we brought in a massive tax plan on a per capita 
basis equal to that of the United States.  It was not done over 
10 years.  It was done over 5 years and ours was front end 
loaded. The fact is that while the hon. member talks about it, we 
did it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the

referring to all the work that we are going to do during the 
Summit of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That summit will of course include discussions on trade. But the

opportunity to discuss with the other countries issues such as

Mr. Speaker, we have been asking about the Prime Minister's 
interest in the Grand-Mère Golf Club for two years but he still 
refuses to answer questions to Canadians whether at home or 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has described his unsold shares in the golf 
course as a debt that was owed him, as a receivable and as an 
asset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor described them as a bad debt and a 
financial obligation to the Prime Minister.  How could the Prime 
Minister expect Canadians to believe he had no personal interest 
in collecting on the debt owed to him? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

shares in question in the 1996 period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been stated over and over again.  This has been 
confirmed by the ethics counsellor.  Insofar as there are any 
allegations of criminal wrongdoing, the RCMP has found on the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister is simply wrong.  The 
Prime Minister owned shares in the golf course through his 
company, J & AC Consultants.  He claimed he put all his affairs 
in a blind trust when he became Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all the dealings of his company were really in a blind trust, 
how did the Prime Minister even become aware that the sale of the 
shares in the golf course had fallen through?  If these shares 
were really in a blind trust, why did he personally intervene and 
phone the ethics counsellor on the evening of January 27, 1996, 
to discuss this matter?

Auroras that are left is being cut by 60%.

Mr. Speaker, we will continue to meet all our obligations in 
terms of the protection of the country and in terms of patrol and 
surveillance of our coastal waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a reduction of five aircraft in the Aurora 
surveillance and patrol aircraft.  We are talking about a 
reduction in the number of hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are making that plane more efficient by the upgrades 
that will be put into it.  That will in fact cut down on the 
number of training hours, but in terms of the surveillance 
capacity there will be no diminution of the service provided to 
Canadians.

Mr. Speaker, the 19,000 figure is wrong.  The current number of 
hours is about 11,000.  We are talking about reducing that to 
8,000 in 2003-04, but that includes more than just surveillance. 
That includes the training hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With new equipment and new simulators we will be able to cut

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last week the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
stated that the leader of my party and the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party were promoting blackmail by 
western separatists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to assume that the minister's words mean that he feels 
that it is never acceptable for any Canadian from any region to 
suggest that their region could get a better deal from Ottawa by 
negotiating with a knife at the throat.  I applaud that 
sentiment.  That is why our leader has said “any discussion of 
separatism is absolutely untenable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we learn from the minister that he will not be going to 
Alberta during his upcoming tour.  How will this exclusion of 
Albertans make them feel more included? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is not our intention to exclude Albertans.  In fact, 
we have great sympathy with Ralph Klein when he said “I would 
hope the Alliance Party would return some of that money”, that 
is the $70,000, “on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition to 
the Alberta treasury to help offset the atrocious cost of that 
lawsuit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary—Nose Hill happened to say when she heard 
of it “$70,000, whoo-ee, we need to get to the bottom of it”. 
Those were real western sentiments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. Deputy Prime Minister for that 
spectacularly irrelevant response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election Alice Farness, a Liberal candidate, 
threatened Saskatchewan farmers that they would get no help from 
Ottawa if they did not vote Liberal.  So far, the government has 
done a spectacularly good job at following through on this 
election promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, last week the intergovernmental affairs minister 
went all the way west to the University of Toronto Law School to 
remind western Canadians that the policy of tough love is still 
in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has not even hinted at repudiating Mrs. Farness' 
comments.  Will he do so now or does he think they are 
legitimate?  Are they policy?

for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very happy that at last the Leader of the

never flirt with any kind of separatism in the country.  It was

doing to improve safety at railway crossings in Cambridge and the 
rest of the country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

fund separation at railway crossings.  In fact, an announcement 
was just made at the end of last week on the latest funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is right across the country.  Unfortunately there is not 
enough money to do all the crossings that are so needed, 
particularly in urban areas.  We have to come to grips with the 
fact that we have to put more money into this kind of project, 
and we need the participation of our municipal and provincial 
partners to really do the job.

Mr. Speaker, finally last week after an unusual prolonged silence 
the industry minister acknowledged what the opposition has been 
saying for a long time, that the current equalization formula 
impedes economic development in the Atlantic region.  He promised 
to push his cabinet colleagues to change the formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite repeated urging by the opposition, other parties and now 
even the industry minister, the finance minister has refused to 
address the issue.  Has the industry minister finally managed to 
convince the finance minister to change this counterproductive 
equalization system? 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member ought to know that the equalization 
formula is constantly under discussion by officials and that is 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also ought to know that I will be meeting with my provincial

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is nice to know the industry minister is having 
an influence over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before meeting with his cabinet colleagues last week the 
industry minister announced to the media that he intended to 
raise the equalization issue.  In that way he ensured he would 
get credit for any agreement on equalization which came out of 
that meeting or any subsequent meeting.

assure us in the House that he is able to set aside his eroding 
leadership aspirations, in spite of the credit the industry 
minister may get, and deal with the issue properly?

of Iraq.  We know that Great Britain not only agreed in advance 
to this, but also took part in the U.S. military action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Can he 
confirm whether Canada was consulted before the bombings?  Is the 
minister himself in agreement with the U.S. attitude, and does he 
intend to accept an emergency debate on this? 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not a matter of whether or not we were consulted 
beforehand.  We are, however, in favour of exclusion zones, which 
are in my opinion necessary to protect civilian populations in 
Iraq, the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Moslems.  This is 
therefore necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I believe it is necessary for the pilots to be protected

Members sometimes disagree about statements that other members 
make in the House, and of course in debate we do have

sure he will make it very promptly and will want to conclude with 
that.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I wish to rule today on a 
point of order raised by the hon. member for Repentigny on 
February 14, 2001. This point of order concerns comments made by 
the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac during question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of order raised by the hon. member for Repentigny 
concerns a question put by the hon. member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac to the government House leader. In 
phrasing his question, the hon. member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac referred to a statement by “The Bloc 
Quebecois”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member for Repentigny raised the point of order, 
he claimed to have been targeted by that comment and quoted the 
statement he had made during the time allotted to Statements by 
Members on Tuesday, February 13, 2001. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Repentigny argues that the hon. member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac attributed to him comments that he never 
made.  He objects to the interpretation given to his statement by 
the hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac and claims that what 
was said in the House was inaccurate and impugned his integrity 
and honesty.  He also asks that the comments be withdrawn and 
that an apology be offered. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I checked the videotape of the exchange that took place on 
February 14 and the transcript of the <I>Debates</I>, and I can 
confirm that what was said was not a personal attack or a 
quotation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments made did not refer to a specific individual and 
constituted, at most, a partisan remark by one party about 
another. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Fraser, who had to rule on a similar question on May 15, 
1991, stated the following at page 100 of <I>Debates</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has raised an issue which is not an unusual kind 
of issue to raise.  The difficulty that is always with the Chair 
in these cases is that there are often very great differences of 
interpretation on answers that are given.  It is not a question 
of privilege, it is a question of disagreement over certain facts 
and answers that were given. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I finish the quotation from Speaker Fraser and I say we have 
witnessed exactly the same thing today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case involving the hon. member for Repentigny, the 
exchange also constitutes a disagreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat what I said when the point of order was raised, that 
“there is a disagreement concerning the facts in this case” and 
that “it is not up to the Speaker to rule that this is a point 
of order”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. members who intervened in this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I raise a question of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I properly understand your ruling, and this is where I want 
to ensure I have got your ruling right, it means that anyone in 
the Bloc Quebecois may say, without foundation, that we heard 
one or more Liberals make outrageous remarks, last week, against 
the people of Quebec, for example.  We could say that in this 
House and would be entitled to do so.  With this ruling, you are 
allowing us to do that.

decision, which will be available in today's <I>Hansard</I>.  It is not 
up to me at the moment to interpret my ruling for members.  I 
have made my decision.  In my opinion, it is very clear.  The 
hon. member may read it and decide for himself whether it is 
clear and, I hope, in his opinion, wise.

The second is that the pension plan of MPs should be in line with

them in line with the program of federal superannuation paid to 
all public servants in the country.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IRAQ 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I have received a notice of motion pursuant to 
Standing Order 52 from the hon. member for Mercier. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 52, I wrote you a letter requesting an emergency 
debate on the British and American bombing of Iraq.  Why? 
Because this question concerns Quebecers and Canadians.  It also 
concerns parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exclusion zones proclaimed by the United Nations were not 
even respected during the February 16 air strikes.  Four of the 
five targets were not in the exclusion zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises some extremely important fundamental questions about 
rights.  Canada, along with Poland, are the only countries that 
confirmed the right of the Americans and the British to do what 
they did, according to the dispatches I have read so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously 
signed a report calling for the lifting of the economic embargo 
affecting the population of Iraq.  Since the 1990 air strikes, 
poverty has increased dramatically, affecting children in 
particular.  We can see that the sanctions are not affecting 
Saddam Hussein, but they are seriously affecting the general 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, a delegation of Quebecers and Canadians visited the 
region and returned greatly troubled.  They called upon 
parliament and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs to bring 
pressures to bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This movement to put an end to the economic embargo that is 
affecting the population has made some progress, but the air 
strikes of February 16 are a backward step and likely to make any 
diplomatic solution to this conflict that has been going on for 
11 years extremely problematic.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, and this third reason strikes me as a very important 
one, the situation in the Middle East is already tense. 
Considering the deterioration in the relationship between the 
Israelis and the Palestinians, the events in Iraq on February 16 
cannot help but inflame the Arab peoples of the entire region 
still further. What is likely to happen is that the region will 
become a powder keg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of these reasons, because peace, or the lack of it, 
affect all Quebecers and all Canadians, and because there has 
been such a major change in the Middle East situation, I call for 
an emergency debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for Mercier for her 
request for an emergency debate on the situation in the entire 
Middle East as a result of last Friday's air strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I considered this matter at length, before Oral Question Period 
today as well as during her remarks, and I agree with her on the 
serious nature of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my duty, however, to reach a decision under the applicable 
procedure, that is Standing Order 52.  At this time, I am not 
prepared to grant the request by the hon. member for an emergency 
debate.  Should the circumstances change, a similar request could 
be considered differently.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK179">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-4, an 
act to establish a foundation to fund sustainable development 
technology, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the minister for introducing the bill and for the 
compassionate commitments he made a few hours ago to the cause of 
sustainable development.  I also congratulate the member for 
South Shore for his open and very supportive intervention which I 
found extremely helpful, and I am sure the government did as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Athabasca raised some fears in connection with 
the bill which perhaps could be allayed because there is 
definitely a precedent for the foundation that is being proposed, 
namely the foundation for sustainable development technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Budget Implementation Act, 1997, we find the commitment 
by the federal government to create a Canada Foundation for 
Innovation for the purpose of modernizing, acquiring or 
developing research infrastructure in science, health, 
engineering and environment.  In terms of its structure, the 
Canada Foundation for Innovation is very similar to the proposed 
Canada foundation for sustainable development technology.  It is 
managed by a mix of appointments approved by the governor in 
council and foundation members.  It is also required to table an 
annual report of its activities before parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One important difference between the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation and the foundation for sustainable development is 
funding. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast to the $100 million that would be provided to the 
Canada foundation for sustainable development technology, the 
Canada foundation for innovation was given an initial allotment 
of $800 million, an additional $200 million in the 1999 budget, 
and in the 2000 budget, another $900 million, for a total 
investment of $1.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another noteworthy difference is that unlike the Canada 
foundation for sustainable development technology, there is no 
authority for the governing council to enter into agreement with 
the Canada foundation for innovation to develop eligibility 
criteria respecting eligible recipients, thus making this body 
more independent from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Canada foundation for innovation appears to have 
worked out very well in practice.  Hopefully, the proposed Canada 
foundation for sustainable development technology will follow in 
its footsteps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate at second reading, which is a debate on the 
principle of the bill, there is room for discussion on what 
technology for sustainable development should be all about. 
Perhaps there is a conceptual challenge here.  I would argue that 
one should be clear in his or her mind as to what the technology 
for sustainable development ought to achieve.  Should it achieve 
a balance between the economy of the environment, as some people 
suggest and have suggested in recent years, or should it instead 
be a technology for sustainable development to integrate social, 
economic and environmental objectives?  I fully subscribe to the 
latter interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that perhaps this concept of integrating 
objectives of a social, economic and environmental nature ought 
to be incorporated in the definition of sustainable development 
in the bill, in addition to the one that is already in draft 
form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the minister outlined five areas of activity for 
this particular foundation for sustainable development 
technology.  He referred to technology for carbon sequestration, 
for new and alternative fuel sources, for energy efficiency, for 
enhanced oil recovery and for technology to reduce particulate 
matters in the air.  These are all energy related areas, some of 
which could provide interesting results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me only comment, perhaps in a superficial manner, to the 
fact that when it comes to carbon sequestration, we already have 
a well developed technology that has existed for millions of 
years, our trees and forests.  I submit that it would be hard to 
find better ways of sequestering carbon that would be able to 
compete with the durability and effectiveness of trees and 
forests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another area, some of the technology to reduce particulate 
matters in the air already exists.  It is a well known fact that 
particulate matters are in good part due to the burning of diesel 
fuel.  The purification of the diesel substance and the removal 
of sulphur and particulate matters is one that ought to be 
possible without additional research as envisaged in the outline 
this morning. 
What the removal of particulate matter requires is timetables, 
percentages and the will to do so.  I believe that the Minister 
of the Environment, on his announcement on air quality later 
today, this week or next month, will make a substantial statement 
on this matter to this effect.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it be technology to research ways and means to reduce 
energy demand or just to enhance and facilitate energy supply? 
That is a question that troubles me.  We seem to be engaged in 
recent times in research and in emphasizing the need for 
increased supply.  We seem to have lost sight of the importance 
of energy demand and how to handle it.  However, evidently if we 
are going into energy efficiency, we must probably go into energy 
conservation and some knowledge has already been accumulated in 
this field in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, on a global plane, the predicted rising population from 
some six billion people today to nine billion people some 40 
years from now is posing an enormous challenge to this particular 
foundation in Canada and of course around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In examining what the technology can do, obviously the 
technological fix, as they call it, can go a long way in 
resolving some of our economic, environmental and social 
problems.  However, I would submit that on climate change in 
particular, which seems to be the main thrust of research that is 
to be assigned to this particular foundation, attention ought to 
be paid to existing policies.  In other words, technology needs 
help from changes to current policies, and in particular, to 
current policies in taxation on energy.  The technology thrust, 
in order words, cannot be effective in isolation.  It needs to be 
helped by measures that will make the task of reducing, for 
instance, greenhouse gases easier by the way in which we act 
through our fiscal and taxation provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have outdated tax subsidies which increase greenhouse gas 
emissions, as members know, with particular respect to the 
production of oil sands.  We have an outdated tax system 
favouring fossil fuel energy over renewable sources of energy. 
Certainly, we still have to establish as a bare minimum a 
so-called level playing field between non-renewable and renewable 
sources of energy in the taxation treatment that we give in 
Canada to these sources of energy.  Progress must be made in 
updating and fitting our taxation system in a manner that will 
help to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions so that taxation 
policy will support and reinforce what the foundation is being 
asked to do.  The taxation system of course could then make the 
achievement of the goals of the foundation much easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some thoughts that came to mind while listening 
to the debate so far.  I submit them for the consideration and 
attention of the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to applaud the member for 
Davenport year and years of work on this subject.  We have become 
quite good friends as I have been getting to know him. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him one question regarding my concerns with 
this legislation.  We all agree that it is really important that 
we address the global warming issue and look at new innovation, 
new technologies and how do we develop them.  At the same time, 
it is critical to ensure that this does not become political. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going to appoint seven out of the 15 people 
who would be on this board.  In order for it to succeed, it is 
absolutely critical that it be based on the scientific community 
as opposed to the political community.   Is there changes that 
the member would put forward to ensure that the scientific 
community would be in control as opposed to the political 
community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his kind words.  My understanding from Bill C-4, in 
particular section 11, is that there is an elaborate system for 
the appointment of directors.  This would make the foundation 
fairly independent and considerably at arm's length from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision as written divides the directors into three 
categories.  The first one deals with persons engaged in the 
development and demonstration of technologies to promote 
sustainable development, including technologies to address 
climate change and air quality issues.  One could safely 
interpret this clause to mean that these would be scientists, 
technicians and researchers or engineers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second category would be from the business community on 
which I do not need to elaborate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third category is non-profit corporations.  They would 
probably be NGOs and other agencies that are knowledgeable and 
competent in providing advice and direction to the foundation on 
technological innovation on the mandate of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three sectors put together would seem to indicate that 
this type of foundation would operate with a considerable degree 
of independence, if not entire independence.  It should be able 
to achieve the goals, and we hope it will achieve them, that the 
hon. member and I have in mind. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Saanich—Gulf Islands, I 
am pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot about global warming today in this debate. 
Global warming is an important issue.  At this time of year in my 
riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands, which on the southern tip of 
Vancouver Island, we are usually counting flowers.  I would like 
to advise the House that I took my little ones David and Victoria 
tobogganing in Victoria this weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the concept of this bill.  I look forward to it 
going to committee where it can be further flushed out and we can 
get into it in more detail.   I agree that as we go into this 
millennium air quality is going to be an increasing concern for 
people globally.  It is something that we should tackle head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This foundation will receive $100 million in funding from the 
government to look at everything in technology and to ensure that 
we can have increased air quality and reductions in greenhouse 
gases.  That is a positive thing.  I agree that is a good first 
step.  It is going to becoming increasingly more important as 
time goes on.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago people were talking about the importance of air 
quality.  That debate of course is so much more significant today 
than it was 10 years ago and it will be increasingly so 10 years 
from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I alluded to my concerns with the board in my question to the 
member for Davenport.  As I understand it, seven of the 15 
members, including the chair, will be appointed by governor in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are boards out there that work.  I know David Strangway, 
the former President of UBC, is the Chairman for the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation.  It does a lot of good work.  If this 
is going to work though, it is so important that there is 
accountability to the taxpayers because it is essentially 
taxpayers' money.  They want to see value as I do.  Members 
across the way want to see that it is truly working toward this 
goal.  This is a concern I have.  We do not have to go very far. 
We know some of the other stories.  There is the Federal Business 
Development Bank and we do not have to go too far into that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that there are patronage appointments.  I would urge 
anybody in the House who has influence in the debate that these 
appointments be based on the foundation being very functional and 
based on science.  I know there are provisions in the bill that 
there be people from the scientific community, the business 
community and from the not for profit, so there is a strong 
balance.  Again, I only have to go back to some of the things 
that have happened in the past.  I see that the former Liberal 
candidate from Port Moody—Coquitlam, Mr. Lou Sekora, was 
recently named a citizenship court judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In earnest I question if these decisions are based on politics. 
I would argue that in appointments such as that they absolutely 
were. I would hate to see a foundation like those types of 
appointments.  I know the member opposite would love to see it 
based on scientific communities, arm's length, with NGOs and a 
whole cross section of people who have the same ultimate goal in 
mind and that their decisions are based on science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this goes off to committee these ideas can be fleshed out and 
we can get into greater detail to ensure that these safeguards 
are put there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with the member for Davenport that we should not 
just look at reducing greenhouse gases.  This is critical.  We 
have to reduce greenhouse gases and ensure better air quality in 
the future, but consumption is such a huge part of this equation. 
We not only have to, through technology, decrease consumption and 
deliver the same, but we have to look at the whole way we do 
things.  I think we can.  We have to start changing the mindset 
of people not to be wasteful.  We see an energy crisis in 
California right now.  These are very real problems and they are 
happening in our own backyard.  I take our own backyard as being 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled all over North America as most members of the 
House have.  We would all agree that we live in somewhat similar 
economies.  Other parts of the world are much different.  In 
North America things generally can be quite similar.  They are 
having problems in California which is very heavily populated. 
It is a sign to all of us to say this could be a problem that 
could expand and grow if we do not take the issue head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with the member that consumption is a very real 
problem.  At the same time, when we are looking at this 
foundation, we have to not put blinders on and recognize there 
has to be a balance between economic growth and industry.  I 
would argue that we use the best available technology to ensure 
the reduction of greenhouse gases, that we ensure better air 
quality in the future and we start getting the continuum going 
the other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the bill going to committee.  I look forward 
to following the bill closely and seeing what recommendations 
they come up with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank you for giving me this opportunity to address the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether I am pleased or displeased to do so, 
particularly since I have been watching the debates since 11 a.m. 
and I am under the impression that everything has already been 
said about this bill and I would not want to repeat the same 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ad lib, and I hope that I can accurately express 
the concerns of women. As the Chair knows, I take a great 
interest in this issue. In fact, I am the Bloc Quebecois critic 
for the status of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women are very concerned about the environment and about health, 
education, family policies and poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the bill before us, it is obvious that women cannot 
be opposed to it, since it is a small step in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we feel that this bill is incomplete. Moreover, women 
do not trust it. This bill reflects a blatant lack of respect for 
the table. It lacks transparency, and duplication, including in 
Quebec, costs money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss these issues so as to explain the position of 
Canadian and Quebec women on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, we would ask the minister to go and do his homework, 
very simply because the bill is incomplete.  There is absolutely 
no reference to the requests made at the issue table.  A person 
who belongs to a group of women knows all about an issue table 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An issue table can be bodies or people each with their own 
attributes agreed on undertaking a project and giving their 
opinion.  This is very special, because these people are 
qualified to give their opinion and because it costs money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it costs moneys, the group agrees to use the report 
prepared by the issue table and to implement it. People agreed on 
that. Women are very aware of the value of money, because they 
are poor and do not have their fair share of this product.  Women 
do not necessarily enjoy equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is incomplete.  The groups working at the issue table 
on the bill came up with eight ideas.  Eight elements were 
advocated.  The government chose only two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the women's groups, this shows lack of respect for the 
individuals and the organizations working at this table.  The 
women are very perplexed about what will happen next.  When there 
is no respect for the remarks made at an issue table, for what it 
establishes, for what it advocates, how will people react later 
on in setting up this famous bill.  Will it be respected?

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, women think that the bill is lacking in transparency 
because of the process for appointing directors. If I read 
correctly, if I understand the bill correctly, the governor in 
council will appoint seven directors out of fifteen. That will 
leave eight directors to be appointed. These eight directors will 
be appointed by the other seven, who have been appointed by the 
governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can presume, even though it does not mean that it is indeed 
what is going to happen, that the governor in council will 
appoint people it trusts. Maybe these people will in turn appoint 
people they know and trust. In fact, people will appoint each 
other. That means that the government has not set up a 
transparent process to appoint members to the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we have no guarantees with regard to the projects that 
will be favoured by this foundation because the directors who 
will appoint each other will most likely favour projects for 
which they have a personal preference. The bill does not provide 
for any mechanism for project selection. Again, the 
recommendation from the table was not followed. As for directors, 
there is no mechanism to ensure transparency with regard to their 
appointment and their eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we have eligibility criteria for projects, but there are 
none in the bill. For women's groups, this bill certainly does 
not inspire confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning of my speech, this is something we 
could support, although it is a bit timid. What guarantees can 
the federal government give women that the money allocated to 
this foundation will be spent wisely and legally, in a 
transparent way, and how will the expenditures be accounted for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when one out of five children in Canada is poor and 
when a lot of single mothers in Quebec are having trouble making 
ends meet, the government is spending $100 million establishing 
this foundation, which leaves women wondering how these millions 
of dollars are going to be spent. As I said earlier, women are 
concerned about the environment, but also about poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of a support group for women with AIDS. This Canadian 
group just had a grant application for $15,000 turned down by 
Health Canada, because it does not necessarily look out for all 
women. Yet this group only needed $15,000. The government 
scrutinizes the work of this support group, but introduces a bill 
with no mechanism to ensure the good management of public funds 
and the transparency of the appointments to the foundation board. 
I do not get it. 
I would also remind the House that in Quebec we already have a 
fund. Bill C-4 is promoting the same thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to say is that it is upsetting, really upsetting, 
and for a woman it is even insulting. The Liberal government is 
going to use money to do the same thing in Quebec when we, in 
Quebec, have already allocated money and have our own bill. This 
is duplication. In this sense, I wish the federal government 
would take the money it wants to use and give it to Quebec, so 
that we can do what we want with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe that it is not only in Quebec that things 
happen this way. 
I think this happens also in the other provinces. In this 
respect, women are tired of seeing that for the sake of power 
and political visibility, our political leaders take money and 
use it for other things than what could help fight poverty, such 
as social housing, or to help children, and women with children, 
and to eliminate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would like to say that the environment, 
greenhouse gases and clean air are issues very dear to me 
personally. The future quality of life of Quebecers, Canadians 
and their children depends on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can guarantee that, if there are no assurances that all the 
money allocated for the implementation of the bill will indeed 
be used to develop new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions as requested by the technology issues table, women 
will continue to oppose this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the member with respect to her comment that women 
need money in the form of transfers and that they do not support 
such a bill.  I think that that goes without saying.  Women 
are not the only ones opposed; so are young people and other 
groups as well.  Opposition is widespread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When blank cheques are handed out as a result of legislation 
such as this, with terms as important as technology, in order to 
produce equipment necessary for the environment, the amounts in 
question are very large, but the board must know how to manage 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for my colleague is this: with respect to the money 
now available, how much will be spent on implementing such an 
important piece of legislation?  Will the federal government's 
contribution be used to promote this technology, or will it 
really be used to buy the necessary technology?  Does the member 
not think that this money will simply be used to put in place 
another system identical to the one the provinces already have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is this:  will this money just be transferred to 
the provinces to buy the technology or will it be used to create 
another level, when it is really much more necessary to buy the 
equipment for this technology?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois: </B>Mr. Speaker, I have clearly understood my 
colleague's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the start of my speech, I wanted to go beyond the 
theoretical framework in order to explain the view of this bill 
held by the women of Canada and Quebec.  A group of women got 
together to look at this bill and we found it did not go far 
enough, that it did not contain enough guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some things were obvious. We did not go to see what the 
situation was in the other provinces, but the Government of 
Quebec already has a sustainable development fund of $45 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill, the government is going to use a certain 
amount in order to certain things in Quebec. It is very clear to 
us that this is federal interference in an area that falls under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that my colleagues in the House are sufficiently 
clever to understand. I think it is clear: a province is in the 
best position to know its own needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going still further, the women expressed concerns that the 
federal government would uses this money to interfere in the 
municipalities' environmental management, for instance 
municipalities on the shores of waterways wishing to create a 
special project.  This is a concern to me.  There is no guarantee 
in the bill, nothing to specify what would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are aware, women are prudent creatures.  They 
feel that the best action if one is not sure is no action. 
Canadian women and Quebec women have reservations about this bill 
and wish no action to be taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the people of Surrey Central are pleased to have me 
participate in the debate today on Bill C-4 concerning the 
establishment of a foundation to fund sustainable development 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the folks who are watching, sustainable 
development means development that meets the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet 
their own needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 2000 federal budget, the Liberals announced that they 
would be creating a sustainable development technology foundation 
to administer these funds at arm's length from the government. 
Later on when we look at the bill we will find out that the 
length of the arm is too short.  Perhaps their hands are in their 
pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that budget they earmarked $100 million as the amount of 
initial funding.  It is to be operated as a not for profit 
organization.  It will administer funding primarily to projects 
that will bring innovation and technology.  The foundation will 
accept proposals from existing and new collaborative arrangements 
among technology developers, suppliers and users, universities, 
not for profit organizations, and other organizations, such as 
industrial associations and research institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5 of Bill C-4 provides that the objects and purposes of 
the foundation are to provide funding to eligible recipients for 
eligible projects.  That is a very vague definition. 
The foundation will dole out funds on a project by project basis. 
Clause 19 of the bill talks about eligible projects in a very 
vague way.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Foundation may provide funding to eligible recipients to be 
used by them solely for the purposes of eligible projects in 
accordance with any terms and conditions specified by the 
Foundation—

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned that those who qualify for funding will 
be mentioned in specific funding agreements.  What are those 
specific funding agreements?  We will never see them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being the past co-chair of the scrutiny of regulations 
committee, I can share with the House that most bills give very 
little information about subject matter, the modus operandi or 
various other things that cover the whole bill or the scope of 
the bill.  Most of the stuff comes through the back door in the 
form of regulations.  We will never debate those regulations nor 
the terms and conditions of the stipulations.  That is what will 
happen with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the principles that will guide the allocation of 
funds?  Will they be coming through the back door?  We do not see 
transparency in the allocation of funds.  I would like to see the 
regulations before the House in black and white so that we can 
debate them in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Surrey Central support the kind of initiatives 
that will create synergy and teamwork where people will work 
together to respond to new challenges by way of innovation.  We 
appreciate the initiative to enhance innovation in technology and 
sustainable development as well as a clean and healthy 
environment, but we do not agree with the modus operandi as 
suggested in the bill.  The bill is poorly worded.  It lacks 
clarity, transparency, accountability and effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would venture to say that members of the official opposition 
would like Canada to create a balance of economic, social and 
environmental goals and challenges and thereafter reap the 
rewards from them.  We want excellence in exploring efficient 
fuel sources.  We want to explore various ways of harnessing 
energy, such as solar and wind power.  We want to enhance oil and 
natural gas recovery technology and mobilize partners in 
industry, universities, research institutes and in businesses 
everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to protect the environment and work on projects related 
to greenhouse gas reduction and improving air and water quality. 
Our children certainly want that and we want our children and our 
grandchildren to have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Canadian Alliance policy supports sustainable 
development initiatives.  Our policy states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to protecting and preserving Canada's natural 
environment and endangered species, and to the sustainable 
development of our abundant natural resources for the use of 
current and future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard someone from the Liberal side, perhaps the environmental 
minister, saying no.  The Alliance policy goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we will strike a balance between environmental 
preservation and economic development.  This includes creating 
partnerships with provincial governments, private industry, 
educational institutions and the public to promote meaningful 
progress in the area of environmental protection. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, the Liberals have mismanaged our environment 
and failed to provide sustainable development.  They have signed 
international treaties, including Kyoto, Beijing and Rio, with no 
intention whatsoever of carrying out these commitments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have made those commitments without consulting Canadians, 
parliament and the provinces.  They have failed to provide 
commitments with the required scientific support.  Rather, they 
have made political decisions about matters that require 
scientific decisions.  These political decisions have amounted to 
nothing more than interference into scientific matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in a word explains the fact that the government cannot meet 
the international commitments that it makes when it comes to 
protecting our environment.  Perhaps it is too busy trying to 
garner votes and counter Canadian Alliance policies rather than 
allow scientific principles and evidence to drive the efforts to 
protect our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weak and arrogant Liberal government has allowed the 
endangered species legislation to die twice on the order paper. 
Since 1993 it has been promising Canadians that it will pass 
endangered species legislation.  What do we have after seven or 
eight years?  Another bill that it is promising to pass.  The 
government is proposing an endangered species bill without 
consulting Canadians and the scientific community.  In any event 
that is another story for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weak Liberal government lacks vision.  It has done nothing 
since 1993 in terms of initiatives on our environment and 
sustainable development.  Other countries have passed legislation 
and are way ahead.  Even the United Nations has a sustainable 
development office.  There is a worldwide race to reap the 
rewards of innovation and state of the art technology, but the 
Liberals allow Canada to be left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government expects the foundation to be in place by March 
2001.  The bill was originally introduced as a part of budget 
2000, delivered almost a year ago today.  It has been one year 
and the Liberals have still not passed the legislation.  That 
goes to show Canadians just how serious the government is about 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a year of doing nothing following the Liberal government 
budget 2000 agenda and seven or eight years since red book one, 
the government would like the bill to be passed by the House, the 
Senate and receive royal assent by March 2001.  That is when it 
would like the foundation to exist with $100 million to hand out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After doing nothing for a year the government is giving us only 
a couple of weeks to work on the legislation.  There will be no 
opportunity to have a fair debate in the House because there will 
be undemocratic time allocation to limit the debate.  The 
committee hearings will be a farce.  The witnesses before the 
committee will be set up and the opposition amendments virtually 
ignored.  The half-baked bill will be rammed through because of 
the government's parliamentary majority and its arrogant 
attitude.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House want to make some amendments before 
we could support the bill.  The amendments will not deal so much 
with the sustainable development aspects of the bill but with 
efficiency, accountability and transparency; in other words with 
the modus operandi of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill the Liberal government would appoint six 
directors and a chairman of the board of directors.  These 
appointees would appoint another eight directors and the 
appointed board of directors would appoint the auditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is to create and enhance innovation in 
technology and not patronage.  The Liberals are developing 
innovations in how to make the best use of patronage. They are 
proposing to turn the sustainable development foundation into a 
Liberal patronage pork barrel for the friends of Liberals and 
defeated Liberal candidates.  I see a hidden agenda.  If the 
modus operandi is not corrected, that is what the bill would do.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than creating and encouraging new and private funding for 
technology and innovation, taxpayers' money will go to the 
friends of the government and ultimately to a black hole, and we 
will one day see another boondoggle.  We want this to be 
corrected.  Let me again read for the Liberals a simple paragraph 
from Canadian Alliance policies: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a non-partisan civil service, an independent 
judiciary and competent leadership of government agencies, boards 
and commissions are vital in a democracy.  We will therefore 
ensure appointments to these positions are made through an open 
and accountable process based on merit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointments should not be based on patronage or defeated 
Liberal candidates or friends of Liberals or any Liberal 
connection.  We want these appointments to be made based on 
merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Surrey Central and I are dismayed.  We are so 
disappointed that the government would take such a wonderful 
initiative of supporting projects related to greenhouse gas 
reductions and improving air quality and turn the effort into 
some kind of Liberal Party payoff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government stop behaving this way and doing these 
things?  When will it evolve into the new millennium and put a 
stop to these kinds of 17th century old boys' club practices? 
When will it abandon the politics of exclusion?  When will it 
stop implementing the systems of disenfranchisement?  The 
patronage practices of the government are virtually fascist, in 
the strict political definition.  The Canadian Alliance will put 
a stop to this sort of thing when it forms the next government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a sustainable development foundation is 
something all Canadians have wanted for years and the Liberals 
are turning it into some kind of arena for political payoffs.  It 
is a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of auditing the foundation, while the foundation 
does provide an annual report each year to parliament, the 
foundation appoints its own auditor and has final approval on the 
financial reports before they are made public.  Is that not 
convenient?  While the legislation does set out rules as to who 
would be eligible to be the auditor, there is no mention of 
allowing the Auditor General of Canada access to the books of the 
foundation.  Only those auditors appointed by the Liberals would 
have access to the auditing of the books.  The Auditor General of 
Canada would be left aside.  He would not have access to these 
audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that the government does not want the Office of 
the Auditor General of Canada involved.  The Liberals have had a 
difficult ride with the outgoing auditor general.  His report 
tabled early this month was probably the most scathing indictment 
yet of this government.  Each auditor general's report on the 
mismanagement of the Liberal government is worse than the 
previous one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition wants these issues, the questions of who 
will audit the foundation and how appointments will be made to 
the foundation, to be dealt with at the committee hearings on the 
bill, which will be held shortly.  We will not allow these two 
concerns to be swept under the carpet by the Liberals.  We want 
those issues to be addressed and properly addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless there are amendments along these lines, we may have to 
oppose the bill and we do not want to have to do that.  We want 
these amendments to be incorporated so that the official 
opposition members on this side of the House can support the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me cite an example of sustainable development that I saw 
myself, an evolution of sustainable development taking place.  I 
will cite the example of Taiwan as an example of strategic and 
sustainable development, where new and private money has been 
pouring into innovation and technology. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taiwan is a small island the size of Vancouver Island, with a 
population of about 25 million people.  Sometimes I wonder; if 25 
million people lived on Vancouver Island it would probably sink. 
Taiwan is a small island with an unemployment rate of about 0.5%, 
not 5%, but half a percentage point.  That is an admirable 
record.  How did Taiwan do it?  Taiwan has accomplished that in 
large part through their sustainable development strategy, with a 
special emphasis on technology and innovation that has led to 
business development, exports and economic growth while 
protecting their precious and rather limited resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, once again we have the Liberals taking an 
initiative, one that everyone would want to support:  the 
creation of a sustainable development foundation.  However, what 
do they do?  They leave so many terms undefined.  The bill is 
vague.  They turn it into a venue for patronage payoffs and they 
close the books to the auditor general.  They want to control the 
$100 million they give to the foundation without anyone else 
finding out which Liberal Party donors receive the bulk of the 
$100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be amazing if it were not so sad.  The people of Surrey 
Central, who want to support the creation of a sustainable 
development foundation, do not want to support this bill. Rather, 
we do not have to support this bill, because of the way the 
Liberals are playing politics with it.  If the Liberals are 
prepared to fix the flaws and the corruption they have written 
into the bill, then we would be glad to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are giving the government the opportunity to have a fair 
debate, to listen to the amendments, to consult Canadians through 
parliament and to incorporate those amendments so that all 
parties can support this wonderful initiative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member says he is not fully in favour of the idea of an 
institute or a foundation like this being created, that he has 
reservations about the amount of money being used.  We are all 
concerned when we hear figures like $100 million, which is being 
allocated with a sketchy sort of mandate that we are not really 
certain about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, putting it in the context of other programs, when we 
look at the EI fund, for instance, it is showing a surplus of 
$600 million a month.  With the relative importance of the issue 
of sustainable development, would he not agree that $100 million 
toward such a necessary, timely and topical subject is money well 
spent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not also agree that his own province of Alberta should 
welcome the whole movement toward the true and genuine study of 
the issue of sustainable development as we, as a planet, try to 
wean ourselves off fossil fuels for our own future?  For many 
people there is a growing realization that we cannot exist simply 
in an economy based on oil, that there is no future in it and 
that we are soiling our own nest to the point we cannot live in 
it any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is whether he feels that $100 million would be well 
spent with a tighter mandate, a real objective or assignment, 
given to this new foundation, which would ultimately result in 
weaning our population off the burning of fossil fuels and toward 
alternative energy.  Would he be more satisfied if it had that 
kind of rigid mandate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the wonderful question.  It is a very thoughtful question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, just to correct the record, I am from B.C., not 
Alberta, although that is nearly the same neighbourhood.  From 
here in Ottawa or from the CN Tower, when we look past the Rocky 
Mountains things are not visible sometimes, but that is okay.  I 
can understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the funding, we are not debating the funding.  I 
think every reasonable Canadian realizes that we have to do a lot 
of work in innovation, technology, research and development. 
Probably it is the initial funding that is stated in the budget. 
Funding is not an issue here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues are these:  how the bill is worded, what is missing 
in the bill, and what the modus operandi is of administering 
those funds.  Is it clear?  Is it transparent?  Is accountability 
there?  Those are the factors that are more important, of course, 
particularly with the rising costs of fuel and natural gas.  It 
is becoming more important than ever before that we look for 
efficient, economical and cheap sources of energy in regard to 
fossil fuels, as the hon. member mentioned.  Of course we want to 
develop efficient resources so that taxpaying Canadians and our 
children and grandchildren have enough resources to play with, to 
utilize in industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much agree with the hon. member that we have to invest in 
technology and research and development.  That is why the topic 
of sustainable development is so important.  However, we want to 
do the right thing in the right way.  That is what we are asking 
the government:  that it do the right thing in the right way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very glad to have the opportunity to join in the debate on Bill 
C-4.  As I mentioned earlier, I believe it is probably the most 
timely and topical thing that the House of Commons could be 
dealing with.  It speaks to the very future of the human race on 
this planet.  All else really pales in comparison when we view 
what other subjects we could be debating in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 is a disappointing reference to the very pressing, 
timely and topical issue of sustainable development.  The NDP 
opposes the bill in its current format in that we believe, as I 
pointed out earlier, its mandate is vague and its funding has no 
real specifics attached to it.  We consider it a gesture to the 
subject, but it has no real and specific plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that in regard to the idea of creating a 
new foundation of this sort, the government does not really talk 
about where it would be based or what centre it would work out 
of.  It actually puts in question the future of an institution in 
my own riding, the International Institute for Sustainable 
Development.  This institute was created years ago and has had 
its funding reduced year after year, to where it is really a 
shadow of its former self.  There was a time when it had a staff 
of 140 people and its own building.  Art Hanson was the CEO.  It 
now occupies a very small office, with maybe a handful of people, 
on the third floor of an nondescript office building in the 
centre of downtown Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder about the logic and the sense of it.  It makes me 
wonder if the government has completely forgotten it already has 
an institute of sustainable development in my riding.  Maybe the 
government members do not get outside the city limits of Ottawa 
often enough to remember that such a place exists.  There is a 
growing feeling in Winnipeg that there is a real reluctance to 
decentralize the activities of Ottawa to any real degree.  There 
was a possible exception to that when the government could not 
find any other place to put a level 4 virology lab and plunked it 
down in the middle of Winnipeg.  It took away the CF-18 contract 
and gave it to Montreal and then gave us the virology lab so that 
the Ebola virus and every unsavoury thing that comes into the 
country is going to wind up in our backyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do resent any steps that might threaten the viability 
of what is left of the International Institute for Sustainable 
Development in my riding.  I am certainly not entirely thrilled 
about the idea of the creation of a new foundation which might 
put the institute in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons this whole subject is so timely and so 
topical is that it is a top of mind issue with most Canadians 
given the soaring and skyrocketing energy costs that we are all 
witnessing.  That has brought the issue home to the kitchen 
tables of the nation instead of it being an academic exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, look at the funding of $100 million to try to change the 
very way we live on this planet in terms of challenging the very 
foundation of our economy, which is the burning of fossil fuels, 
and compare that with the $1.3 billion the government threw into 
a wasteful program to try to mitigate the impact of the rising 
costs of fuel.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that $1.3 billion would take us a lot further down the 
road of sustainable development and would address in a permanent 
way the problem we have with access to fossil fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come to a day of reckoning in terms of energy.  We have 
come to the growing realization that we simply cannot run an 
economy based on oil any longer.  A number of things will not 
tolerate it anymore, not the least of which is the fact that we 
cannot continue to soil our own nest to this degree and continue 
to move forward and prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone on the planet cannot use the amount of energy that 
Canadians use.  It simply is not possible.  If the 1.3 billion 
people in China had two vehicles in the garage, an SUV and an 
outboard motor, and if all people in the world consumed the same 
level of energy as Canadians, we would need six more planets. 
There simply is not enough fossil fuel in the world for that kind 
of energy use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could not be a more pressing and more topical issue than 
to revisit the way we view our precious natural resources.  We 
must try to wean human beings away from burning hydrocarbons 
because it will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we faced with?  The one upside of skyrocketing energy 
costs is that it has forced people to revisit energy 
conservation.  When we are hit in the pocketbook we get motivated 
to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oil crisis of 1973 was the reason people switched from V-8 
to four cylinder engines.  They realized a four cylinder engine 
could push a car almost as well.  The fact that oil prices went 
through the ceiling is what pushed the new technology.  It had 
the shock effect of forcing people to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a point now where we must to conserve energy or find 
alternative energy sources.  The $1.3 billion that was thrown in 
a scattergun approach toward energy rebates should have perhaps 
gone toward the research of hydrogen as a fuel.  We are very 
close to a breakthrough where cars will burn hydrogen and not 
gasoline.  The only byproduct would be water dripping from the 
exhaust pipe.  That, frankly, would do the country and the world 
an enormous favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $1.3 billion could be spent in any number of positive ways. 
Instead, the government essentially rolled down the window and 
threw it out, hoping some of it would fall on people who would 
benefit.  That was wasteful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are hearing a figure of $100 million to cover the huge 
pluralistic issue of sustainable development, and yet the 
government put $1.3 billion into a very narrow and fixed program, 
a one time payment to offset energy costs for Canadians.  It 
really does make one wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also makes one wonder why, if the government was serious 
about sustainable development, it would not follow through on one 
of its own programs, the federal building initiative.  The 
federal government owns 68,000 buildings, most of which are 
absolute energy pigs.  They were built in an era when energy was 
not expensive.  It was cheap and plentiful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did undertake a token effort to energy retrofit 
those buildings, to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions, to 
reduce operating costs and to make indoor ambient air quality 
better so that federal public servants did not turn green when 
they tried to work eight hours at their desks.  They are being 
slowly poisoned in many ways in a bunch of sick buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those things are now possible.  The empirical evidence now 
shows we can reduce operating costs by as much as 40%.  It would 
be such a positive measure.  It would be revenue generating. 
However the federal building initiative, under the auspices of 
the Minister of Natural Resources, has renovated only a couple of 
hundred buildings.  At that rate it will be 150 years before all 
federal buildings are energy retrofitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes one wonder what the government is waiting for.  The 
energy savings from its buildings alone could pay for the 
development of new technologies that would allow Canada to become 
a world leader.  We would be a centre of excellence in energy 
conservation and sustainable development technology with just the 
energy savings from the 68,000 federal buildings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been riding this hobby horse for years and to no avail. 
In 1993 I came to Ottawa, long before I was a member of 
parliament, to appeal to the Minister of the Environment at the 
time.  I was given an energy innovator's award by NRCan, the 
federal department of energy, for the innovative idea of 
retrofitting publicly owned buildings as a pilot project, as an 
example to the private sector of what could be done.  However 
eight or nine years later in its own federal building initiative 
program the government has only done a couple of hundred 
buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question its commitment.  It is willing to throw $100 million 
at a new foundation that should blah, blah, blah, but it has a 
unique opportunity to show the world how it can be done. We live 
in a harsh northern climate.  We have massive geographical 
challenges.  We could show the world how to use energy in the 
smartest possible way.  We could show the world how to live 
comfortably and in a healthy environment without being the 
largest consumers of energy in the world, which Canadians find 
themselves being today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the first to admit that Canadians and people all around the 
globe need to embrace the concept of energy conservation and 
sustainable development in everything they do.  It should be the 
common thread through any program the government undertakes.  I 
do not believe the creation of a new foundation, which may 
jeopardize the institute that is already in existence in my 
riding, will in any way move us closer to that admirable goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were $100 million to spend, why would the government 
not restore the institute to its former stature, that of a world 
leader, research centre and source library for anyone interested 
in the whole concept of energy conservation or sustainable 
development?  Why not start a centre of excellence right in the 
centre of Canada and become world leaders so we can export the 
technology? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not have to be jobs versus the environment any more.  To 
speak this way does not mean we have to shut down industries and 
put people out of work.  We now know that it is jobs and the 
environment: jobs with the environment, jobs for the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are unbelievable entrepreneurial opportunities in the 
field of energy retrofitting or sustainable development.  There 
are now smart thermostats or boiler systems or heat pumps that 
harvest units of energy even if it is 20 below.  There is a 
difference between 20 below and 30 below.  The other 10 degrees 
of air can be harvested.  There is warmth and energy in there and 
that energy can be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not been thinking outside the box.  It is far too easy 
to start another oil well in Alberta than it is to set up an 
institute and research alternatives that will give our children a 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes think the worst thing that happened in western 
Canada was Leduc No. 1 in 1947 when they struck oil in Leduc, 
Alberta.  It was regressive.  I almost wish the world would run 
out of oil more quickly so that we still have some air left to 
breathe by the time we find alternative fuel and energy sources. 
That would be my first wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ban the internal combustion engine is a radical idea, but we 
could still move around if were burning hydrogen.  The Ballard 
fuel cell, which is being developed in B.C., is close to 
marketability.  It needs one little nudge before it replaces 
forever the internal combustion engine.  The $1.3 billion the 
government flushed down the toilet in the failed energy rebate 
program may have moved us one step closer to finding a true 
alternative and a true solution for the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The jig is up in terms of our wasteful energy use.  We can no 
longer carry on as we are carrying on.  As I said, for all people 
on the planet to live as Canadians do, we would need six more 
planets.  There are not enough resources in the world for 
everyone to be as wasteful as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go one of two roads.  We can be head in the sand 
ostriches and carry on until it is an absolute crisis, or we can 
change direction.  We can voluntarily simplify and use less 
energy and, I argue, without a reduction in the quality of life. 
People do not have to freeze in the dark to use less energy if 
they are smart.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done a great deal of research in this regard.   The best 
example and most graphic illustration the federal government 
could point to is its own buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most beautiful thing about the concept, to expand on the 
federal building initiative and its potential windfall for 
demonstrating the whole concept, is that all of the above could 
be done at no cost to the taxpayer.  There are private sector 
companies willing to pay upfront for renovation of federal 
government buildings and be paid back slowly out of the energy 
savings.  They are called ESCOs, energy services contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not do that?  What if such a company offered to renovate a 
big federal government building with operating costs of $1 
million a year by putting in state of the art mechanical 
equipment, insulating the exterior and putting in new windows and 
doors at no cost?  What if it were paid out of the energy savings 
and after over four years when the total renovation costs were 
paid the government could keep the energy savings from there on 
ever after?  Would that not be smart? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would stimulate a whole industry and put thousands of trades 
people to work.  It could use materials and mechanical equipment, 
smart thermostats and boilers that could be produced locally. 
Then we would be able to point to our federally owned buildings 
as a showcase to the world.  We could show the world how it could 
be done.  We would have the smartest, best run and best operated 
buildings in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could be shown to the private sector too.  Many property 
owners and building managers face increased fuel costs but cannot 
raise rents to their tenants.  The only way they can show a 
profit is by reducing their operating costs.  They would be very 
interested in such a concept.  If the government were a little 
more progressive or a little more action oriented instead of 
being academic about its commitment to sustainable development, 
we would see it moving on that front.  It is absolutely natural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reservations about Bill C-4.  We believe the 
government's mandate is far too soft and fuzzy.  We do not know 
what it is being challenged to do or what responsibilities it is 
being charged with.  The government talks about promoting 
technologies to address climate change.  Frankly we would like to 
know more.  There are also air quality issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is often the case, members of the NDP are frustrated at the 
composition of the board.  We are not comfortable with the way 
the foundation's board will be struck, who will be appointed and 
how, and for what terms.  The specifics of how the board will be 
structured will be the success or failure of it.  We do not want 
it to be another dumping or patronage ground for failed Liberal 
candidates.  We do not want it to be a patronage holding pattern 
type of place.  We were always frustrated by that in the past and 
would certainly speak out against any move in that direction 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very much an open ended funding arrangement.  The 
government is saying it will be $100 million to start.  What is 
it for?  How will it apply for further funding?  Will it be part 
of an annual report to parliament?  All these are unknown 
commodities and things that make the NDP very uncomfortable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is $100 million to be spent on sustainable development, 
a very worthy subject, it should be put into the International 
Institute for Sustainable Development on Portage Avenue in the 
riding of Winnipeg Centre in my province of Manitoba.  Let us 
rebuild the institute for sustainable development to what it once 
was.  That is where Canada could be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a feeling the newly struck foundation will be located 
somewhere within the capital region of Ottawa.  Instead of 
decentralizing this innovative technology, we have every reason 
to believe the architects of the bill could not find the province 
of Manitoba with both hands and a flashlight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are always frustrated, in terms of western alienation, that 
the government does not consider such things.  We feel we often 
get the raw end of the deal.  Instead of the CF-18 contract we 
get a virology lab.  Instead of getting an institute of 
sustainable development with reasonable funding, we get an 
announcement that there will be a new foundation to study 
sustainable development.  Does that mean the lights will be 
turned off once and for all in what was once a well respected 
international institution in the riding of Winnipeg Centre? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very critical of that.  At this point we will oppose Bill 
C-4 and will be voting against it.

Mr. Speaker, I highly appreciate the speech given by the hon.

has essential knowledge of the subject which I really admire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that Canada could have been a leader in sustainable

the lack of vision by the weak Liberal government that did not 
let it happen.  For the seven or eight years since it has been in 
power, its abysmal record on environmental and sustainable 
development is quite evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the point he mentioned in his speech about the technical 
part, we have to start the sustainable development somewhere or 
this initiative has to be implemented somehow. Would the hon. 
member agree that if patronage is taken out of the whole bill and 
also if the auditors, those who were appointed by the board of 
directors and report to the board of directors, and if there is a 
mechanism to restore accountability, transparency and clarity in 
the whole process, would he support the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we have made it 
quite clear.  If the original mandate was not so fuzzy and more 
clear, the reason for which the foundation was developed, if the 
composition of the board was free and clear of any possibility of 
patronage or being used as a holding pen for Liberal hacks or 
failed candidates and if the funding and accountability issues 
were more transparent and more to our liking, then we would have 
no problem with the federal government allocating $100 million to 
the topic of sustainable development. In fact, we would welcome 
that.

seemed to say that it would have been better to put the funds 
allocated for the establishment of the foundation into the 
institute for sustainable development in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member is twofold. First, does the hon.

it is my pleasure to speak today to Bill C-4, an act to establish 
a foundation to fund sustainable development technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think this is truly environment day here in the House, 
after considering the motion by my hon. colleague from Davenport, 
in which he specifically asks the government to conduct studies 
in order to get a clear idea of the impact on the environment of 
fish-farming and its industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are studying Bill C-4.  We do not know 
when but perhaps in a few days we will study the bill on threatened 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite honestly, when I read the bill, I rather supported it. The 
bill advocated a number of principles, which one cannot oppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, it is often said that it is impossible to oppose 
virtue and apple pie.  This is where we are at with this bill at 
first reading.  In other words, it permits the creation of a 
foundation which has basic funding, which would permit the 
funding of research on sustainable development, but more 
specifically, in order to work on the development of energy to 
fight climactic change and atmospheric pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read the bill, I said “Finally the government is doing 
something to respond properly, by allocating the necessary 
resources to meet international objectives on greenhouse gases”. 
I said “This is a way for the government to meet its 
international commitments, especially those pertaining to 
climatic change and the Kyoto conference”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This foundation provides financial assistance for the 
development and demonstration of new technologies to promote 
sustainable development, including technologies to address 
climate change and air quality issues.  It is a foundation which 
would operate like a non profit organization, with a chairperson, 
14 directors and 15 members, all appointed by the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers remember what happened in the case of the millennium 
scholarship fund, an endowment fund or a foundation with a 
chairperson and a number of directors that was supposedly set up 
to achieve the laudable objective of helping students pursue 
their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took a closer look, we discovered that this foundation 
was not necessarily there to meet the needs of students. The 
millennium scholarship fund was not established to meet the 
essential and critical needs of students and help them achieve 
their educational goals but, rather, to award scholarships based 
on merit. The fund had been set up so that the maple leaf could 
appear on the cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, a similar foundation is proposed. Its members will be 
appointed by the government and, more often than not, for the 
government. Under the bill, the foundation would receive an 
initial endowment of $100 million per year. Is this a realistic 
figure to achieve the objectives agreed to before the public and 
before the heads of states at the Kyoto summit? One hundred 
million dollars per year to achieve the Kyoto objectives is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had really wanted to adequately meet these 
objectives, it would not have created a foundation which, in a 
way, is a bogus foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 11 and 15 deal with the appointment and selection of 
directors and members. Clause 11 reads: 
<UL>

the following considerations:

</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the need to ensure, as far as possible— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember these words “as far as possible”. At any time, about 
half of the directors will represent persons engaged in 
research, while the other half will represent people involved in 
the business community and not for profit corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In selecting the directors we must “as far as possible” 
ensure that half of the appointees are from the research sector. 
There is no obligation to ensure that these people have the 
required knowledge, expertise and experience to make a major 
contribution that would give Canada the means of production to 
achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, clauses 11 and 15 stipulate that the appointment of 
members shall be made having regard to the following 
considerations:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, at all times, the membership must be representative 
of persons engaged in the development and demonstration of 
technologies to promote sustainable development. There is a need 
to ensure “as far as possible” that the members of the 
foundation are experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were truly honest and really wanted to make a 
serious commitment to the environment and renewable energies, 
would it have included in its bill clauses to ensure that experts 
would be appointed as far as possible? The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were truly sincere, it would have ensured that 
experts would be appointed to this foundation, not friends of the 
Liberal Party. What we want is more transparency. I am not sure 
the foundation will have all the transparency needed to ensure 
that its goals will be reached.

further $1.5 billion over five years to better meet sustainable 
development requirements. We are not opposed to a fund, we are in 
favour of a real fund with real resources to ensure that the real 
goals are met. On this side of the House we are not convinced 
that this fund will make it possible to meet these goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have reservations concerning the resources available 
to the fund? I will say honestly that I would rather be on this 
side of the House today, I would rather not be on the other side 
of the House and have to introduce a bill such as this one which 
is providing $100 million a year to deal with a fundamental issue 
requiring a major shift in terms of energy, namely renewable 
energy. We have doubts as to the government's goodwill when we 
look at the results concerning its international commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that in 1992 the federal government signed the 
Rio framework convention on climate change and the ensuing Kyoto 
protocol containing more definite commitments, namely, for 
Canada, a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012. Are 
we anywhere near achieving the Kyoto objectives? The answer is 
no. To meet these objectives we need real resources, not $100 
million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from dropping, greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 
13% in Canada. They have not dropped. 
We are not on our way to meeting the targets set by the federal 
government in Kyoto, far from it. In Canada, there has been a 
13% increase in greenhouse gas emissions and, according to the 
figures put out by the federal government and the Royal Society, 
we are far from meeting our targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report was tabled at the end of May by the Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development, who was quite critical 
of the federal government. He faulted the government for its 
failure in the fight against smog. On a more global level, he 
underlined the importance of reducing air pollution, which 
causes disease and death. Even though the government and the 
Minister of the Environment announced, yesterday and last 
Friday, a policy to help us reach that goal, we must realize 
that we are still very far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse, in terms of the financial means available to us to 
meet our targets at the international level, the insignificant 
amounts included by the federal government in its 2000 budget 
show the Liberals' lack of vision with regard to the 
environment. Just for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, 
the federal government should be spending $1.5 billion over five 
years, not $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The urgency of the situation requires a $1.5 billion investment, 
but instead, the government is planning to spend a total 
$700 million over the next four years on all environmental 
issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A $100 million investment will not be enough to help us face 
these environmental changes, and neither will the $700 million 
included in the last budget. We need $1.5 billion. Here is the 
situation: in 1997, Canada's emissions were 13% higher than in 
1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the issue of climate change, I reviewed Quebec's 
position, its performance and how we fare compared to the other 
provinces and to Canada itself. That review shows that Quebec is 
clearly performing better in that area than the federal 
government and the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have a better performance? Because we made the green 
revolution several years ago. When we look at the energy policy 
of Canada, of western Canada, with due respect to my colleagues, 
we realize the energy policy is still based on fossil fuel 
energy sources. There are three fossil fuel industries: natural 
gas, coal and oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canada is a major producer of greenhouse gas, an oil 
producer and an oil user, which mainly produces greenhouse gas. 
However, since the 1960s, Quebec has had a totally different 
energy policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been using an energy that is called renewable. 
Hydro-electricity has contributed concretely and totally to 
Quebec's economic growth. Besides, it has allowed to stop the 
production of greenhouse gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a practical application in a country, the country of 
Quebec, of the sustainable development concept. We do not put 
the sustainable development concept in a bill such as Bill C-6. 
It does not belong in a bill such as the one the minister has 
introduced today. Sustainable development calls for a practical 
application. This means economic growth and the use of our 
resources with consideration for environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Brundtland, the former prime minister of Norway, had 
defined this sustainable development concept that we are now 
applying in practical terms in Quebec. We have given ourselves 
all the tools required to achieve these environmental objectives 
without necessarily neglecting economic growth. This is what is 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, people think that a change in energy policy leads to 
reduced economic activity. Quebec is a prime example. 
A few years ago, how many homes used coal, natural gas or 
petroleum?  How many businesses and industries used them in order 
to produce consumer goods?  How many houses were heated with oil? 
A very heavy majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet today, we use another source of energy, what is termed 
renewable energy.  In the case of Quebec, it is hydroelectric 
power, electricity.  Yet the economic activity of Quebec has not 
been affected by this pro-ecology and pro-environmental move.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, Quebec's government corporation has been able 
to export energy, to the U.S. for one.  This goes to show that a 
change in energy use does not necessarily mean job losses, as 
some would have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How often we hear the comment “The petroleum industry is so 
important to Canada, and jobs connected to that industry must be 
preserved”.  I say there is a way of making a logical and 
balanced change of direction toward Canada's use of a sustainable 
energy source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to hydroelectric energy.  It is not the only type 
of renewable energy there is; there are other kinds. 
Among other things, there is solar energy, which works fairly 
well in certain countries.  Proper investments would ensure that 
this technology could be developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is wind energy as well.  This energy has been tried out in 
many countries, including Quebec and Canada.  Wind energy is used 
in Europe, among other things, as a primary source of energy, and 
not just as a secondary energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by talking about the principle underlying the 
bill.  As I was saying, I agree with the principle of the bill. 
It is impossible to oppose investment in technology that will 
mean the achievement of the objectives of sustainable 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have some doubt as to the vehicle for achieving these 
objectives, namely a foundation appointed by the government, 
with, in my opinion, insufficient funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final remark is to the effect that the foundation would not 
permit the achievement of the objectives and the environmental 
green shift.  I fear instead that it will manage to sprinkle a 
few thousand or tens of thousands of dollars about without really 
achieving its target objective, that of producing while 
respecting and protecting the environment at the same time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my 
colleague from Rosemont—Petite-Patrie on his speech. As always, 
he was very eloquent and quite clear in what he said. He has been 
working very hard on environmental issues since the last 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly noticed his concern in the matter of the 
contaminated water in Shannon, in the Quebec City area. His 
interest in these problems is obviously very high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to him carefully and I agree with him when he says 
that the proposed foundation will have no effect on what is being 
debated today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he always has an answer, I would like to ask him what he 
himself would do if he were in the government's place. What would 
he propose, while respecting jurisdictions, to meet the 
objectives and reduce greenhouse gases? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question, which basically is twofold. I do not know how long I 
still have, but to me the Shannon issue is really important. It 
is so because the government has to admit one thing. The 
contaminated lands in Shannon are located on lands under the 
jurisdiction and responsibility of the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the hon. member that on last February 6 I wrote to 
the Minister of National Defence, asking him to proceed 
immediately with the decontamination of the site and work 
together with the province in order to find a sustainable 
solution to the problem. That falls precisely within the scope 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about patching problems, but finding a solution. The 
solution involves decontamination. As for the means available to 
us, while the federal government is proposing a foundation, I 
should remind the House that Quebec does have an action plan to 
deal with climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole range of means that the Quebec government made 
available to the public—voluntary measures in some cases, and 
public information—in order to deal with the major challenge 
represented by climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the federal government's performance on the climate change 
issue in recent years, would it not be sounder and more 
transparent to transfer these $100 million to the province that 
already has an action plan and made sure to meet its greenhouse 
gas reduction targets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think that, on that issue, the Quebec government gets 
much better marks than the federal government? Let the federal 
government take that money and transfer it to Quebec, and then 
we will be able to meet targets even higher than those we have 
met so far.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is commonly known that Canada has been vilified by international 
environmentalists because it is seen as one of the main brokers 
of deals to try and get around the Kyoto protocol and the 
obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing token gestures on the part of the government to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions with its own federal buildings. 
It is also trying to encourage municipalities to energy retrofit 
its buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A $25 million fund has been put aside for green municipalities. 
Out of $25 million, $30,000 will be allocated to the city of 
Montreal to energy retrofit its municipal buildings.  Would the 
hon. member have any comment on that allocation of resources? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an eloquent example 
of the danger of this bill.  My colleague has just given an 
example, and I will document it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty thousand dollars went to the City of Montreal to retrofit 
its equipment and buildings in order to meet environmental 
objectives.  That is the danger of this type of foundation, which 
has an initial endowment of only $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I mentioned this danger in the conclusion to my speech, 
and I repeat that the danger is that this leads to a sort of 
piecemeal approach, with the result that the objectives would not 
really be met.  The member for Winnipeg Centre spoke earlier 
about the institute for climate change. In Quebec, we have an 
action plan for reaching our objectives in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be possible to recognize the work being done by the 
provincial governments or by the institutes on this issue and to 
fund these institutes or governments in order to consolidate the 
work they are doing, rather than create a foundation appointed 
by the governor in council—we do not know whom he will 
appoint—and to pour $100 million a year into it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know to whom this money will go.  We know that there 
will probably be agreements, but clearly it will be very 
difficult for us, with the foundation they want to create, to 
know with whom agreements will be reached.  It will be incredibly 
difficult.  We are talking about a foundation with $100 million 
dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague and I think that recognition should be 
given to the work done in the institute for climate change in his 
riding, and to the Government of Quebec's action plan, and that 
the federal government should improve and consolidate existing 
measures rather than create a foundation that will throw money

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
want to congratulate my colleague for Rosemont for his splendid 
work. He acts in a competent and eloquent way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell any member of the House that we need air 
and water to live, hence, the importance of environmental 
protection. It just so happens that there has been contamination 
of the water table by the Department of Transport in a 
residential area of the town of Sept-Îles. On three occasions, 
that is February 1, 2 and 5, I raised the issue.  As a matter 
of fact, I have been speaking about this issue for three 
and a half years. The Minister of Transport admitted to the fact and 
recognized his responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 14, that is quite recent, I received a document 
which I hope to be able to table tonight. In this document, the 
department of public health recommends not drinking the water in 
the Des Plages area, and this recommendation comes from Dr. 
Raynald Cloutier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we to believe in the government's credibility? Even if 
Bill C-4 contained the best clauses, does the government think 
that, as it included in its policy statements a clause based on 
the “polluter pays” principle while it was itself polluting and 
contaminating the Des Plages area—a woman says she is desperate 
because she is without water and sewer systems—we are going to 
give it credibility? According to <I>Le Soleil</I> “People are 
Desperate”.  There was also action taken by the town of 
Sept-Îles on February 12, which is also fairly recent. But I was 
not satisfied with the answer the Minister gave me in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague for Rosemont if he sees a way to solve the 
problem of the Des Plages area of Sept-Îles so that the 
Department of Transport will finally act responsibly. Does he see 
in Bill C-4 any means to avoid such situations in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent 
question. Today I make the assumption that since the House 
reconvened the federal government has been introducing 
environmental bills that intrude in provincial jurisdiction, for 
example Bill C-6 amending the International Boundary Waters 
Treaty Act, the bill respecting species at risk, and this bill 
establishing a foundation to fund sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the federal government not look after areas under federal 
jurisdiction rather than meddling in provincial areas of 
jurisdiction? Let it proceed with land decontamination in 
Shannon, at CFB Valcartier, or at the airport, in Sept-Îles. That 
is all we ask. The federal government has no say in provincial 
jurisdiction, particularly not as regards drinking water 
management. This side of the House does not need any lectures.

with great pleasure that I rise today to speak on the sustainable 
development technology foundation legislation Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many initiatives of the government, this initiative 
represents a baby step in the right direction, a glossing over of 
a very major issue with what some would describe as a cosmetic 
approach in order that the government can say that it has in fact 
done something to address the issue of sustainable development 
and climate change.  However, it is very much a baby step.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in front of me a quotation from David Boyd, a senior 
associate with the eco-research chair of environmental policy at 
the University of Victoria, in the riding of the Minister of the 
Environment.  Mr. Boyd, who is an expert on the environment, has 
said that “ in two terms the Liberals have yet to pass a single 
significant new piece of environmental legislation.  Many green 
promises from the Liberal red book remain unfulfilled”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a damning description, to have seen this level of 
demise, of two terms of Liberal government, a party that has 
historically had strong principles relative to environmental 
issues.  The principles and values of environmental policy in the 
Liberal Party is indeed unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of a sustainable development technology foundation 
should have been addressed and developed before Kyoto.  Instead 
the government's plan in terms of the Kyoto agreement was 
basically written on the back of an airplane napkin on the way to 
Kyoto.  There was no long term planning.  There was no real 
negotiation with the provinces or with industry sectors.  In fact 
it was a last minute, hastily drafted agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government was not responsible for developing, in 
advance, a long term strategy on how to meet the terms of the 
Kyoto agreement.  It was left scrambling after the Kyoto 
agreement.  This legislation is a band-aid approach to make up 
for lost time years later.  That is highly unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Too little, too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre says that it is too little, too late.  As with so 
many things, I share his views on that.  He was speaking earlier 
about some of the omissions in the legislation, including the 
fact that the government is not addressing the important 
potential of decentralization of research and policy development 
in terms of this very important area of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the death of distance as a determinant in the cost of 
telecommunications and with companies around the world 
decentralizing and putting research and policy development out in 
the field, it is the people making the decisions and researching 
the policies that are close to the people that are ultimately 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just in terms of the foundation.  That same rationale 
could be applied to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  Instead the 
government continues to fill office buildings in Ottawa and 
continues to cut down on its commitment to the regions to develop 
the sound policies close to the people ultimately affected in the 
regions.  This is again a missed opportunity by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg Centre also referred to the process 
of appointment in terms of the board members of the foundation. 
I share with him his concerns.  The government has an unfortunate 
record of cronyism when it comes to the appointment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre also referred to the habit that 
the government has of appointing failed Liberal candidates to 
senior positions.  While I share his concern, I would remind him 
that the only thing worse than a failed Liberal candidate is a 
successful Liberal candidate.  In many ways we should at least be 
thankful that there are still some failed Liberal candidates. We 
hope that we will add to their ranks in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the direction of the foundation to have a greater 
level of private sector participation, I do share the notion that 
we could do more to incorporate the private sector in the 
delivery of products that are actually beneficial to the public 
good. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the general trends in terms of medical technology or 
biotechnology.  A lot of these cutting edge technologies can 
provide immense societal gains and benefits.  Many of the 
developments are actually coming from the private sector. 
Therefore, I do support the notion of leveraging some of the 
government investment.  In this case it is a very small 
investment of $100 million into $400 million, which is a fairly 
small amount of money, but it is still positive that there is a 
leveraging effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point to another example in recent days.  It was the 
announcement on the human genome project.  One government funded 
group had spent 10 years encoding the human gene.  Another group, 
which was a private sector group, completed much of the same work 
in three years.  There are some private sector advantages 
developing these types of cutting edge technologies.  We can, 
through public policy, effect and create greater levels of 
interest in developing these societally beneficial technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some tax credits currently for research and 
development in Canada, but we could possibly develop a more 
advantageous set of tax credits to apply specifically to 
sustainable development technologies.  For instance, research 
into alternative energy sources and the whole emerging industry 
of wind generated power comes to mind.  Certainly, during 
question period we would have no shortage of mega watts coming 
from the government side of the House.  Even the House of Commons 
could potentially be powered by wind generation in such a scheme 
and perhaps some of this money may go in that direction.  That 
would be parliamentary reform that would have long term benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of private sector participation in this is going to 
become increasingly important in Canada.  Whether it is an 
environmental policy or almost any new area of technology, we can 
demonstrate to private individuals and companies in Canada that 
good environmental policy is good economics and good economic 
policy is good environmental policy.  For far too long we 
separated environmental policy and economic policy.  In failing 
to incorporate the two, we did a great disservice to both 
disciplines and to the public in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do more, such as internalize externalities of production 
at the time of production and ensure that the cost borne by 
consumers of particular products or services reflect not just the 
cost of production but the environmental cost of production, we 
would be far better served.  These are the types of regulatory 
reforms that can effect changes.  It might be actually more 
significant than that which is presented in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is very vague on how it would address the long 
term issue of sustainable development.  Again, it is only $100 
million.  A few months ago, anything dot com could have raised 
that in an IPO anywhere and those companies only took a few 
months to burn through that.  With government involvement it may 
take less time.  However, I have some real concerns about the 
scale of commitment of the federal government.  Again, it is not 
a huge commitment.  It will allow the government to point toward 
this very vague and cosmetic approach to this very serious issue 
and claim that it has taken action.  In fact, it really is not a 
significant level of commitment to such an important global 
issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the government to be more responsive to this issue 
and incorporate a more effective regime of tax based incentives 
to reward and encourage private sector development of new 
technologies for sustainable development, as well as to encourage 
consumers to make choices, whether it is in their own homes or 
the fuels that they choose for their automobiles, to be more 
sensitive to environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A positive thing that has happened in recent years is if one 
goes to a high school, speaks to a class and asks how many of the 
students feel environmental policy is of great priority, almost 
every one of them will put up their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago or fifteen years ago, if we had asked the same 
question to a group of school students probably most of them 
would not have said that.  I do not think the environment was of 
huge importance to me when I was in high school.  However, 
education has effected change in that direction and that is very 
positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now an emerging group of young adults who are 
environmentally sensitive and intrinsically interested in 
environmental issues.  They may be more responsive to tax based 
measures which encourage sustainable environmental policy and 
greater levels of sensitivity as consumers.  These Volvo 
vigilantes can make a huge impact on the future of the country, 
regardless of the car they choose to drive.  It is important that 
we recognize more creative means by which to develop approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada in so many areas, particularly in environmental policy, 
has failed to research best practices around the world of other 
jurisdictions and governments in terms of policies which apply in 
this case to environmental policy, but in so many other areas, 
whether it is in tax policy or social policy.  We could have 
tried a little harder in this case to be somewhat more creative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has almost a franchise like approach to policy 
development and the creation of these foundations.  It names a 
bunch of Liberals to the board.  Then, it sends it off to 
ultimately die a natural death and spend some money.  In some 
cases, by hook or by crook, and I do not mean crook as in the 
stuff that has been alluded to in question period over and over 
again or in a criminal reference, sometimes a positive thing will 
come out.  By and large the results have been less than 
substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we could do much better.  I was the co-chairman of 
the Progressive Conservative platform committee for the recent 
election.  All three Canadians who read that document thought it was an 
excellent document.  It was supported across the country 
by these people.  They all voted for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the Sierra Club actually recognized that platform 
for its sound environmental policies.  It also recognized the New 
Democratic Party.  If there is an area of policy that I would be 
quite proud to stand beside my colleagues in the New Democratic 
Party, but not all policies, it is the environmental policy. 
There is a level of commitment that is consistent and of 
vigilance in areas of the environment that I have a great deal of 
respect for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another area and on another topic, the Canadian Alliance of 
Students Association, not to be confused with the other Canadian 
Alliance, said that the Conservative platform was the best in 
terms of student policies and education policies. 
Those are two areas that may not be recognized widely as cornerstones of 
conservative policy, but they certainly are cornerstones of 
Progressive Conservative policies, of which we are very proud.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do more than simply institutionalize lip service to 
environmental and other important issues.  We need to work with 
the provinces to develop meaningful tax and regulatory incentives 
to encourage a greater level of commitment from all Canadians, 
from the business community and from individual citizens.  This 
is our legacy that we are leaving to future generations of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not talk just about Canadians when we talk about the 
environment because this is a global issue.  There are no borders 
when it comes to environmental policy.  The legacy we are leaving 
to future citizens of the world is a very sad legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was last week that there was another report on the 
whole global warming issue indicating that the worst fears of 
global warming are coming to fruition.  We are seeing it in many 
of the natural disasters occurring in all parts of the world. The 
fact is that we in the developed countries which have led and 
created much of the problem are better insulated to survive 
during these crises than some of the developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some real issues of equity that we as a developed 
country, as a country that has in the past been a leader in 
environmental and foreign policy, can play in a greater role than 
the size of our population would typically dictate in leading 
greater co-operation globally on environmental policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are talking about the issue of intergenerational 
equity.  When they talk about that they are talking about the 
issue of the national debt which future generations are going to 
have to pay.  That certainly is an issue of intergenerational 
equity.  People your age, Mr. Speaker, leaving that kind of equity on 
people like me, the next generation, is indeed unfair. That is a 
career limiting move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a more damning legacy and on intergenerational equity 
issue is that of the environment.  We will at some point have to 
pay off the national debt.  I would argue we should pay it off 
more quickly than some would argue.  The damage we have inflicted 
on the environment is a debt that we may not be able to ever 
repay. That is a scientific fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to become increasingly vigilant.  We have been asleep at 
the wheel for far too long on environmental policy.  That is not 
a legacy that as policymakers in the House we can afford to leave 
for future generations of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was very interested in some of the points the hon. member for 
Kings—Hants was making regarding the mindset shift that is 
necessary for industries to undertake in the way they do 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that they need to internalize externalities.  First, I 
would like him to explain that.  Second, I would like him to 
expand somewhat on the issue he raised that we need to view 
things in the way of whole costing.  In other words, if we are 
going to burn oil we need to recognize what the whole cost of 
burning that oil is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask him to comment on the fact that the real price 
of a barrel of oil is probably not $27 or whatever it is on the 
open market.  The real cost, the whole cost, can be as much as 
$150 a barrel when we factor in the price of the American 
military and keeping the Persian Gulf sea lanes open, and the 
environmental degradation and the clean up necessary when burning 
hydrocarbons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the technology is not quite there yet, would the Ballard 
fuel cell, wind energy or solar energy not render all other 
alternative sources of energy cheap by comparison?  When we look 
at the whole cost of a barrel of oil all other sources of energy 
seem like a bargain, internalizing externalities first and then 
whole costing.  Would the member like to comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we should make note that 
this is probably the first time in the history of Canadian 
parliament that a Conservative updated the lexicon of a New 
Democrat in terms of environmental phraseology, otherwise known 
as buzzwords. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the notion of internalizing the externalities, the 
externalities are those products that are produced 
unintentionally by any level of production.  To internalize those 
externalities means to incorporate in the cost of production the 
unintended production costs.  In this case, environmental costs 
are incorporated into the cost of products that the consumers 
pays at the time, also known as whole costing. I appreciate his 
update of my lexicon in areas of the environment in a more simple 
and holistic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of whole costing and addressing the total cost of 
production is difficult to do.  The methodologies for doing this 
are not easy to implement.  However, I think it is very important 
that we start doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, bad environmental policy is ultimately bad economic 
policy because both disciplines deal with the management of 
scarce resources.  Any economic argument or any pricing 
arrangement that ignores the true cost, wihtout the whole costing as put 
forth by the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre, is in fact bad 
economics.  We have to become more rational in the way that we 
allocate both environmental and otherwise economic resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure we will all be much the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5, the proposed Species at Risk Act, will enable 
countless Canadians to continue to work to protect and recover 
species and ensure that the Government of Canada can act as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite efforts to protect wildlife and plants, we continue to 
lose species at an alarming rate around the world because of 
human activity.

risk nationally. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians overwhelmingly support the protection of species at 
risk and their habitats.  From ranchers to fishermen, trappers to

for effective legislation.  Bill C-5 responds to that call with 
certainty and with conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is effective legislation that will help prevent wildlife in 
Canada from becoming extinct.  It will also provide for recovery

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 is effective legislation that will help prevent 
wildlife in Canada from becoming extinct. It will also provide 
for the recovery of species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is legislation that will achieve results where it counts 
the most: on the land and in our streams, oceans, prairies and

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline the key strengths of the bill 
before parliament today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed act will cover all birds, fish, mammals, plants or 
insects listed as being at risk nationally. These species and 
their critical habitats will be protected whether they are on 
federal, provincial, territorial or privately owned land, in the 
air or in the water. SARA will be the cornerstone in species 
protection and recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SARA will ensure that science is the first consideration in the 
recovery of species. For the first time, the Committee on the 
Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, or COSEWIC, will be 
given legal status under the Species at Risk Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>COSEWIC will continue to operate as a scientific 
body independent of the government.  It that will assess and 
classify the status of wildlife species in accordance with the 
best available scientific, community and aboriginal traditional 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SARA will provide the authority to prohibit the killing of 
endangered or threatened species and the destruction of their 
critical habitats on all lands in Canada. We will have the 
authority to provide immediate protection to species and their 
critical habitats in imminent danger. The Government of Canada 
will also have the authority to act alone when and if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under SARA, there will be a mandatory requirement for developing 
recovery strategies and action plans for endangered or threatened 
species, and management plans for species of special concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Environment must report annually to parliament 
on actions taken to recover all listed species. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possibly the strongest element of the bill is the extensive 
dialogue that has resulted in its evolution.  The proposed 
legislation reflects more than seven years of consultation with 
Canadians in all walks of life, in all parts of the country, 
including specifically ranchers, farmers, land owners, fishermen, 
aboriginal peoples, business leaders, trappers, scientists, 
academics and many other stakeholders, including thousands of 
interested Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Species at Risk Act or SARA is what it is today because of 
what we have heard over the last seven years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that Canadians want legislation in place that 
empowers individuals to take action to protect habitat. This is 
the goal of Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard that Canadians want to know that there are 
strong legal protections in place so that, if necessary, the 
government will act alone to protect species and their habitat. 
This is another key component of Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard loud and clear that the approach to species 
protection and recovery must be balanced and effective. The bill 
before us today meets these requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 incorporates a 
number of useful suggestions made by individuals and groups in 
submissions to the standing committee during its pre-study of the 
former bill C-33. These changes reflect the intent and spirit of 
the former bill, while improving its clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline some of the improvements that have been 
made in the bill we are debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular significance are the following, which will provide 
greater openness, transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new section was added, which would require that the minister 
convene, at least once every two years, a round table of persons 
interested in matters related to the protection of species at 
risk. The round table would advise the minister on these matters 
and its recommendations would be placed in the public registry. 
The minister would be required to respond within 180 days and his 
response would also be placed in the public registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The COSEWIC list will be published, unchanged, in the public 
registry. By doing this, it is given public recognition as the 
scientific list of species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other documents to be placed in the public registry would now 
also include the annual reports of COSEWIC, general status 
reports, action plans and the minister's annual reports to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry, which will be available on the Internet, will be a 
comprehensive online source of relevant documents and information 
about efforts to protect species at risk in Canada. It will give 
Canadians the opportunity to follow the development of 
regulations and orders under the Act, from the consultation phase 
to final publication in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the registry will enable anyone to track government 
action on species which have been found to be at risk following 
scientific assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes show that we have listened to Canadians. We intend 
to continue to take the advice of Canadians, and all reasonable 
suggestions to further improve Bill C-5 will be considered 
carefully as the bill progresses through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that we are debating today is only one component of the 
Government of Canada's overall strategy to protect species at 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the strategy is already producing results through 
stewardship, recovery planning and partnerships with provinces, 
territories, non-government organizations, academics, and private 
citizens. This strategy includes this legislation, the accord for 
the protection of species at risk, and the habitat stewardship 
program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Through stewardship and recovery efforts, we are taking action 
on species at risk where it matters most: on the land and in our 
streams, oceans, prairies and forests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first line of defence will be to protect habitat by 
encouraging land owners to undertake voluntary conservation 
measures, often in co-operation with other governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is providing incentives to promote 
habitat conservation, because we know this approach works on the 
ground to effectively protect species. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the new habitat stewardship program, the Government of 
Canada contributed, in the year 2000, approximately $5 million to 
over 60 partnership projects with local and regional 
organizations and committees.  Species that have benefited 
already include the Vancouver Island marmot, the marbled murrelet 
and the critically endangered eastern loggerhead shrike, a bird 
that was once distributed from Manitoba to the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach to habitat stewardship also encompasses large areas 
of land such as the Missouri Coteau landscape of southern 
Saskatchewan.  Located in the prairie pothole region of the 
province, the Missouri Coteau landscape is approximately 23,000 
square kilometres in size and includes several species at risk, 
including the piping plover, the burrowing owl, the loggerhead 
shrike, the ferruginous hawk, the northern leopard frog and the 
monarch butterfly.  The Coteau stewardship first step project 
seeks to maintain natural, restored and managed land capable of 
sustaining populations of these species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding for the habitat stewardship program is one of several 
initiatives to protect species at risk that were announced in 
budget 2000, which contained a commitment of some $90 million 
over three years and thereafter stabilized funding of $90 million 
every two years for the protection of species at risk. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 also made it easier for Canadians to donate 
ecologically sensitive lands and easements by reducing the 
capital gains from donations through the EcoGifts Program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These partnerships and incentive programs will extend habitat 
protection in all parts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our preferred approach to protecting species at risk is through 
voluntary activities by Canadians. However, there may be times 
when these do not produce the desired results. At that point, 
government action will be required, either at the federal, 
provincial or territorial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respect the authority of other governments, but we also 
expect them to bring in habitat protection measures when they are 
needed. This bill will complement existing or improved provincial 
and territorial legislation. It will not compete with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake, where voluntary measures do not work, or other 
governments are unwilling or unable to act, the federal safety 
net will be invoked. If a province does not have complementary 
legislation, the Government of Canada will act to protect 
Canada's heritage, to protect threatened or endangered species 
and their critical habitats on provincial and private lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Landowners, farmers, ranchers, trappers and others who live off 
the land or waters of Canada are among our most important 
partners, since in many areas, their land includes the habitats 
of species at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed SARA will enable compensation to be paid for losses 
suffered as a result of any extraordinary impact when it is 
necessary to prohibit destruction of critical habitat. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most difficult questions in the debate over how to 
protect species at risk is that issue of compensation.  That is 
why I asked the distinguished Dr. Peter Pearse, a professor 
emeritus at the University of British Columbia and a well known 
expert on natural resource issues, to review the issues involved 
and to provide me with advice concerning compensation under the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Pearse has done an excellent job of reviewing the issues and 
his findings will be an important contribution to the debate on 
compensation.  His recommendations are of great interest to the 
government and they will be considered very carefully as we 
develop compensation regulations in consultation with Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure hon. members that as our discussions on 
the issue of compensation progress, we will continue our 
discussions with interested Canadians.  We will keep them 
informed on this important issue. Our regulatory proposals will 
be shared on the registry in the same spirit of openness that has 
marked the development of the proposed species at risk act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anecdotal evidence on severe economic losses by landowners in 
the United States because of the American endangered species act 
has generated concern and fears in some parts of Canada.  Let me 
assure the House that the proposed Canadian species at risk act 
is fundamentally different from the American act and, I might 
add, dramatically better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The species at risk act represents a Canadian approach based on 
our own strengths and values.  While it does give the government 
the power to protect threatened or endangered species and their 
critical habitats on private land, we have gone a long way to 
meeting the concerns of landowners and other people who work on 
the land. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill recognizes the fact that in order to be effective, 
species at risk legislation must be accepted and used by the 
people on the land who make decisions affecting wildlife every 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Species protection requires a co-operative approach on the front 
lines. This does not preclude the inclusion of strong measures 
for those who would break the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasise enough the importance of partnerships in 
protecting wildlife in Canada. We are working with the provinces 
and territories, individual Canadians, conservation 
organizations, academics, industries every day to conserve and 
protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this legislation to be effective, all affected stakeholders 
must be engaged. In order to get the job done, we need 
landowners, conservation groups, and other levels of government 
working together. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal communities are especially important in efforts to 
protect species at risk since so many endangered or threatened 
species are found on aboriginal lands.  Aboriginal peoples have 
been successfully involved in efforts to develop this legislation 
and they will be involved in the species at risk act recovery 
efforts at every appropriate step.  The assessment and recovery 
processes will incorporate the wisdom of aboriginal traditional 
knowledge as well as local community knowledge. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work closely with and respect the role of wildlife 
management boards established under land claims agreements to 
ensure the protection of species at risk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, one of the improvements that has been made to the bill 
was to amend the definition of wildlife management board to 
ensure that any body authorized to perform functions in relation 
to wildlife species in a land claims agreement is covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a long history of co-operation with the provinces and 
territories on protecting species at risk in Canada. We have 
negotiated an accord to protect species at risk and have made 
significant progress on many issues under it. Because of the 
active involvement of many interested parties in this file, we 
have made remarkable progress. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples.  In 1941 there were about 16 whooping 
cranes in Canada and now there are about 200.  The swift fox has 
been successfully reintroduced along the Saskatchewan-Alberta 
border and, in fact, its status has been upgraded by COSEWIC. The 
wood bison is returning to healthier and sustainable numbers. 
From a low of about 250 animals a century ago, there are now some 
1,800 wood bison currently living in seven wild, free ranging

threatened in recognition of this progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there has been progress.  Now we must focus our efforts 
to save species still in danger, such as the right whale, the 
Oregon spotted frog and the Jefferson salamander, which was added 
by COSEWIC in November to the list of Canadian species at risk. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, as citizens and as stewards, our goal must be 
to protect species on the ground.  The proposed species at risk 
act is part of a comprehensive approach to accomplish this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all members to take an important step toward 
protecting wildlife species and their habitats across Canada by 
supporting Bill C-5.  Canadians have told us in overwhelming 
numbers that they want a law to protect species at risk and their 
habitats.  After seven years of debate, it is time to move on, 
and to focus our attention on protecting and recovering wildlife 
at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 governments across Canada agreed, through the accord 
for the protection of species at risk, to bring in species 
protection legislation in their own jurisdictions.  Many 
provinces and territories have already fulfilled this commitment. 
Now it is the time for the Parliament of Canada to live up to 
this commitment by approving Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 creates a framework for the protection of species at 
risk that will achieve results on the ground by using incentives 
as the preferred approach, backed up with strong legal 
protections that give the government of Canada the ability to act 
alone when necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is designed to work not merely in courtrooms, but where it 
counts: in the fields, forests, wetlands and open waters of 
Canada.  Effective species protection, not costly litigation, 
must be our primary goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to committee hearings on Bill C-5, where we will 
discuss the bill in detail, and hear the views of Canadians on 
how effective this bill can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to pass effective legislation, 
legislation that is needed and long overdue. I sincerely hope 
the members of the House will assist with this monumental 
responsibility. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is important for Canada's biodiversity.  I urge all 
members to give it speedy passage at second reading and I urge 
that it be voted with minimum delay for the committee stage and 
examination by the committee of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in the debate on this bill on species at 
risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle the Bloc Quebecois should be satisfied, and it is, 
that there is an endangered species act in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> My colleagues opposite just applauded. We do 
have an endangered species act in Quebec. Government members, 
including the Minister for International Trade, have just 
recognized by their applause that the matter is of vital 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our colleagues opposite are satisfied with the endangered 
species act, I will now talk about the bill on species at risk 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must first remind the House that a number of international 
conventions inevitably led to Canada introducing this 
legislation. We wish this legislation had been quite different, 
but it inevitably had to be introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three or four reasons that justified the introduction 
of this bill in the House. First, on the international level, 
one has to remember the signing of the convention on wetlands, 
which is of international importance. This convention is quite 
important since at least 30% of species in Canada live in that 
kind of habitat and land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second important reason relating to commitments made by Canada 
at the international level is the convention on international 
trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora, which 
clearly required the introduction of this type of legislation in 
each country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third reason is, of course, the convention on conservation on 
migratory species of wild fauna, but the fundamental reason 
which also led to the introduction of the act respecting 
threatened or vulnerable species in Quebec is the 1992 
convention on biodiversity. That convention stated clearly that 
countries had to introduce and bring into force legislative 
provisions to protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why introduce legislation on species at risk and why give so 
much importance to this type of legislation? I said this type of 
legislation, not necessarily this piece of legislation. 
Why? Because we have witnessed a significant reduction in 
biodiversity over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our methods of producing and consuming have significantly 
altered our ecosystems. This has resulted in a significant 
reduction in organisms living in these ecosystems, which means 
that it also has an impact on species at risk. Of course, all 
this has an impact on the food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the different changes we made in our production methods have 
had an effect on biodiversity, and this is why we had to take 
measures to protect our species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation to protect species at risk is essential. However, we 
would have liked legislation that respects certain frameworks, 
not only a legislative framework, but also a constitutional 
framework.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that four provinces already have 
endangered species legislation. They are Ontario, British 
Columbia, New Brunswick and, of course, Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provinces have passed a number of measures to identify and 
legally designate endangered species, and to implement programs 
and plans, like recovery plans, to ensure the continuity of our 
ecosystems and aquatic and plant habitats, and to ensure these 
species are not put at risk or made vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 Quebec passed its own endangered species legislation. 
This was ground breaking legislation in those days. As I said 
earlier, the convention on biodiversity was not signed until 
1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the signing of the international convention on 
biodiversity, calling for changes to legislation to protect 
endangered species, Quebec had already passed its own 
legislation, which was welcome by environmentalists and 
interested parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation was meant to be and was flexible, because it 
was respectful of property holders and landowners. Its purpose 
was to identify and legally designate endangered species, and to 
provide a number of recovery plans to protect their habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec went even further in protecting endangered species. 
Later on, Quebec took two more measures: the fishery regulations 
and an act respecting the conservation and development of 
wildlife. The goal of these three fundamental measures was to 
protect and preserve the species as well as the aquatic, plant 
and animal environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way, shape or form does the bill introduced in the House 
respect the forward looking approach taken by Quebec in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot wait to see what decision some of the members opposite 
will come to. I cannot wait to see what the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, who was a minister in 1989 under Robert 
Bourassa when the legislation was passed, will do. I cannot wait 
to see what the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, who supported 
the legislation and urged the opposition to pass it, will do. 
They have introduced, supported and defended this kind of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These federal Liberal members from Quebec are about to vote 
for a federal bill that will duplicate the Quebec legislation and 
will infringe upon areas of provincial jurisdiction concerning 
the protection of critical habitat. We will see what the federal 
members from Quebec will decide. Chances are, they will show 
their true colours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see what is going on when we will compare the two pieces 
of legislation, when we take the time to read through the bill 
the Minister of the Environment introduced a few weeks ago and 
compare it to the Quebec legislation. We will have to take into 
consideration not only the Quebec legislation on endangered 
species, but also the act respecting the conservation and 
development of wildlife and the regulations. That is when we will 
realize all the overlap there is. The first example of overlap 
deals with the identification of the species.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal act formalizes the status of COSEWIC, that is the 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. So far, 
the committee has legally identified over 340 endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone told me today that Quebec does not have a committee 
to identify these threatened plant species, I would say that this 
double net is justified. We need a double net and there is one in 
place. It is in the form of an advisory committee made up of 
scientists. It is not a phoney committee, but an advisory 
committee made up of scientists who work at identifying the 
animal and plant species that are vulnerable and threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec the advisory committee on threatened species works 
in close co-operation with COSEWIC. It works in such close 
co-operation with COSEWIC that Quebec signed a harmonization 
agreement on threatened and endangered species. The Quebec 
government signed that harmonization agreement back in 1996. At 
the time, it said “Quebec has an act and we will co-operate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is that harmonization agreement? Where is the federal 
government's pledge to respect provincial jurisdictions, to 
respect Quebec's legislation, as stated in the 1996 harmonization 
agreement? Whatever happened to that spirit of co-operation? 
Today, what we have before us is a bill that interferes in 
provincial jurisdictions. This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were told that Quebec does not have a recovery plan for 
threatened species, I would say that there is a reason for having 
a double net. 
I would say that Quebec is not doing its job and lacks 
legislation, but the fact of the matter is that Quebec has 
recovery plans.  The argument for the double net does not hold 
water.  Quebec has a recovery strategy for when a species that 
is endangered is identified and its habitat must be protected in 
order to ensure survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect is the recovery plans, as proposed by the 
federal government.  Quebec has one in its legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third aspect is compensation.  This is pure improvisation 
here.  One wonders why the federal government did not fully 
accept the recommendations of the Peter Pearse report, including 
that for 50% compensation of farmers and land owners.  There was 
none of this.  At the briefings, we asked the departmental staff 
what the principle of compensation was. 
The answer was “We are not really sure”.  This is total 
improvization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two basic reasons we are strongly opposed to this 
bill. I can assure the House that we are going to work very hard 
in committee to ensure that it does not get through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, because we believe that the entire habitat issue 
is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, because we want the federal government to keep its word 
to respect Quebec legislation, which it gave when the 
harmonization agreement on endangered species was signed in 1996.

challenge as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have an opportunity to shed some light on a very 
murky and dark issue, a dark chapter, perhaps, in the 
government's administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the RCMP announced that it will no longer be pursuing an 
investigation into the affairs surrounding the Auberge 
Grand-Mère.  What it does not say is that very little took place 
in terms of an investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that individuals we suggested it contact were not 
contacted.  The prime individual in all of this, the Prime 
Minister, was certainly not contacted by the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a quick walk through what has happened.  The Prime 
Minister and his Liberal government have stated for a long time 
that they did nothing wrong when they lobbied the Business 
Development Bank to secure a loan for a questionable business 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a loan that would improve a hotel adjacent to a golf 
course that was owned by the Prime Minister, 25% at that time. 
The golf course is linked to the hotel.  The hotel is linked to a 
bank loan.  The bank loan is linked to a president and also the 
immigration investment deal that followed a meeting in Chrétien's 
office with people he cannot remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I perhaps was not paying as close 
attention as I should, but if we are making reference to someone 
by that name who also holds an office in this Chamber at this 
time we should refer to the office, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker.  I am referring to 
the Prime Minister.  If nothing irregular happened, why did the 
Prime Minister's spokesperson, Mr. Peter Donolo, mislead the 
public in January 1999, saying that neither the government nor 
the Prime Minister were involved in the decisions made by the 
BDC?  This was reported in the <I>National Post</I> on January 25, 
1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 10, 1999, when asked if the Prime Minister or a 
member of his staff intervened with the Business Development Bank 
or any other department to obtain money for Mr. Duhaime, why did 
the Minister of Industry state that the loan decision was made by 
a vice-president and that it was not an order in council 
appointee who was appointed to determine the process?  These 
statements were later found to be false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister himself went to great lengths to write a 
letter that was sent to the <I>National Post</I>, and that date is 
November 16, 2000.  The Prime Minister contradicted himself when 
he said in that letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I...had no direct or indirect personal connection with the 
hotel...or...with the adjacent golf course. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was directly contradicted by himself in the Chamber when he 
indicated that he did speak to the Business Development Bank 
president twice and also spoke to him at 24 Sussex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many contradictions surrounding this entire issue. 
We do know some of the facts.  We know that the Prime Minister 
sold his part ownership in the Auberge Grand-Mère, just north of 
his home in the town of Shawinigan, to a personal friend, Mr. 
Duhaime.  We know that in 1993 he tried to unload those shares to 
the adjacent Grand-Mère golf course, but that was not completed. 
This is the important fact.  The transaction did not occur.  The 
shares came back to him, which he later admitted to the ethics 
counsellor in a letter to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the important time in question when the lobbying was 
occurring, when the Prime Minister was in touch with the 
president of the bank to try to secure the loan, he was still in 
possession, still a potential beneficiary of those efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After two rejections, two efforts to secure loans by Mr. 
Duhaime, he finally got his $615,000 and then went into arrears. 
During that time the decision was made to foreclose.  The 
president of the Business Development Bank later lost his job 
over that decision, we maintain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a conflict of interest in lobbying to aid this hotel, 
which would also directly aid the adjoining property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right hon. member for Calgary Centre has repeatedly raised 
questions about this issue, also about Mr. Jean Carle, who went 
directly from the PMO to the board of directors of the Business 
Development Bank.  That in and of itself, I would suggest, 
certainly creates the appearance of a conflict of interest, where 
a lot of information might be available to interested parties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, who was subject to this code as a member of 
the Pearson and Trudeau governments, said which provisions of the 
Pearson code were not too stringent for him to follow.  Why did 
he lower the bar?  Why has he refused to answer direct questions 
about this topic?  Why has he designated the Minister of Industry 
to come to his defence to help navigate these murky waters?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by stating 
there are statutory limits to what details can be provided 
concerning the member's question, since section 37 of the BDC act 
intended to protect commercial confidentiality must apply. 
Furthermore, when the member asked his question on January 31, 
2001, the Minister of Industry informed the House that the 
subject matter raised is presently before the courts and we must 
thus act accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, this does not stop us from providing the House with 
the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first fact is the Auberge Grand-Mère loan was never part of 
the circumstances surrounding Mr. Beaudoin's resignation.  Mr. 
François Beaudoin was not constructively dismissed.  He chose to 
resign rather than account to the board of directors of the BDC. 
The office of the auditor general revealed that he had awarded 
himself an unjustified annual retirement income at the age of 50 
from $169,000 and $468,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second fact is following Mr. Beaudoin's resignation, KPMG 
began an investigation which revealed that the former president 
used bank property for personal enjoyment and made a number of 
expenditures outside officially appropriate activities, in 
violation of the BDC code of conduct and the code for public 
office holders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third fact is the Auberge Grand-Mère is open and expected to 
do well.  The Auberge will benefit from increasing economic 
activity in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth fact is this project was financed in partnership with 
the Caisse Populaire and the FSTQ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth fact is members of parliament from all parties refer 
potential clients to the BDC.  They approach the BDC on behalf of 
their constituents and seek information about the bank's products 
and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth fact is the final decision as to whether or not a loan 
is made is the exclusive responsibility of the BDC.  These 
decisions are based solely on the merits of the application and 
the project to be financed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the fact is that there is no smoking gun here.  There 
is just smoke and mirrors on the part of the opposition, or, to 
use the words of the member's leader, perhaps this is just a 
fishing expedition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address a matter in which the Minister of Transport has 
dragged his feet.  For the past three and a half years that I 
have been here, he has been dragging his feet, even though we 
raised the matter repeatedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to mention two newspaper articles in order to 
show just how long ago the Minister of Transport was asked to 
settle this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Thursday, December 14, 2000, not exactly yesterday, in the daily 
<I>Le Soleil</I>, a woman wrote “We are back in the age of <I>Le temps

of imagination every day in order to wash and cook without 
putting ourselves at risk”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 5, the minister told me during Oral Question Period 
that he had assumed his responsibilities and had decided to deal 
with the matter and find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently, on February 14, an article stated “Public health 
department recommends avoiding drinking the water”.  I will 
quote one little paragraph from the article “The director of 
public health for the North Shore, Dr. Raynald Cloutier, 
recommends that the residents of the beaches area in Sept-Îles 
not drink their water.  The public is clearly at risk”. 
Dr. Cloutier added “In short, it is becoming very distressing. 
I see no solution but to connect people to the municipal water 
and sewer system”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Sept-Îles assumed its responsibilities.  For those 
not familiar with the area, there are four beaches.  If a person 
heads east, toward the airport, toward Havre-Saint-Pierre, the 
first beach is the Monaghan beach. Then there is the Ferguson 
beach, and it is followed by the Routhier and the Lévesque 
beaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one most affected was the Monaghan beach.  The water was red 
like tomato juice.  The city of Sept-Îles invested nearly 
$10 million.  A figure of $5 million was negotiated in subsidies. 
I was the municipal councillor for that area at the time. 
Five million dollars was also invested on sewage treatment.  At 
the time, this fixed the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The further east one went, the more drinkable the water was. 
Then the Department of Transport contaminated the water table 
with nitrate from the airport.  Since then, the minister has been 
giving us the same answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 28, 1998, the Sept-Îles municipal council passed a 
resolution—that is what municipal councils do—calling on 
Transport Canada to assume its responsibilities in the whole 
contaminated area by providing drinkable sources of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's answer was the same one he gave me in the 
House on February 5.  He said that the solutions proposed by 
Transport Canada to the water table contamination in the beaches 
area consisting of “an ion exchange treatment device, a reverse 
osmosis treatment device, bottled water delivery and the payment 
of a sum for the purchase of bottled water” were considered 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the House imagine the minister's reaction if he were to be 
given a bottle of water and a washcloth in his home or in one of 
the luxury hotel rooms he stays in and told that that was the 
water he was to wash with and to drink.  Would he sit still for 
that?  On April 26, 1999, the same municipal council passed 
another resolution calling for a meeting with the Minister of 
Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This meeting took place, and the Minister of Transport told the 
House on February 5 that the permanent solutions, those in the 
second “whereas” of the municipal council's resolution, would 
be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What residents therefore want and what the municipal council 
called for at its February 12 meeting, is a meeting with the 
Minister of Transport to resolve the problem once and for all. 
This is ridiculous.  The health of the public in the Sept-Îles 
Des Plages area is at stake.

affected.  Although it amounts to only 13% of the area in 
question, we do take the matter seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that all of the other problems recently 
identified in the affected area are in no way connected with 
Transport Canada's activities.  Transport Canada met recently 
with the residents concerned to outline the four options examined 
by the department.  Only three of those residents agreed to the 
installation of an ion exchanger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada is monitoring the groundwater nitrate levels 
very closely.  Recent tests show a significant decrease already 
in these levels in the beaches area.  According to experts, the 
nitrate concentrations in the groundwater can be expected to 
return to normal between 2002 and 2007. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in 2001, and the pocket of contamination can already 
been seen to be steadily receding.  Based on this finding, 
Transport Canada maintains that the proposed solutions adequately 
meet and are in proportion to the nitrate problem.  The 
installation of a piped water system is out of all proportion to 
the problem observed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada is committed to act like a good corporate 
citizen and maintain a healthy environment for the Canadian 
public.  The department is being proactive on the matter and has 
taken all appropriate corrective measures.
