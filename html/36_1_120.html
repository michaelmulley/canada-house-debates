have the honour to present, in both official languages, the 
fourth report of the Standing Committee on Transport with respect 
to the review of passenger rail services offered by VIA Rail and 
the means to revitalize this important mode of transportation 
within the context of the fiscal and environment concerns facing 
the government entitled “The Renaissance of Passenger Rail in 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing I thank committee members for their hard work in the 
short period of time they were present at meetings.  They had 
many meetings per day and per week.  In particular I thank the 
parliamentary secretary who has a lot of experience and who has 
assisted me as a new chairman of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this document will allow government to insert 
into the passenger rail system opportunities for everyone to 
contribute to this great service.

the Parliament of Canada Act with respect to the meetings of the

it briefly for the House in accordance with the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Basically it calls for the abolition 
of nuclear weapons by the year 2000 and to set forth a binding

communities with a few signatures also from northern and eastern 
Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners wish to draw the attention of this House to the 
uselessness of the proposed new gun regulations of Bill C-68. 
They draw to our attention the fact that the search and seizure 
provisions and other infringements on civil liberties included in 
Bill C-68 are an affront to law-abiding Canadians.  They 
therefore pray and call upon parliament to repeal Bill C-68 and 
all associated regulations with respect to firearms or ammunition 
and to pass new legislation designed to severely penalize the 
criminal use of any weapon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These 244 petitioners are pointing out that the section of

Speaker, this is the last petition I have.  There are 37 
signatures on this petition.  It is from citizens of Limerick and 
Assiniboia, Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that 
most Canadians understand the concept of marriage as a voluntary 
union of an unmarried male and an unmarried female and that it is 
the duty of parliament to ensure that marriage as it has always 
been known and understood in Canada is preserved and protected. 
The petitioners pray that parliament enact Bill C-225, an act to 
amend the Marriage Act and the Interpretation Act so as to define 
in the statute that a marriage can only be entered into between a 
single male and a single female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the hon. member for Cypress

am pleased to present a petition on behalf of a number of 
Canadians, including from my own riding of Mississauga South.  It 
concerns our police officers and firefighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that police officers and firefighters are required to place their 
lives at risk on a daily basis as they discharge their duties. 
When one of them loses their life in the line of duty the 
employee benefits often do not provide adequately for their 
surviving family members.  Further, the public also mourns that 
loss and wishes to recognize in a tangible way the officers who 
are killed and to assist their surviving family members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to establish a 
public safety officers compensation fund for the families of 
police officers, firefighters and all public safety officers who 
are killed in the line of duty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore seek unanimous consent to replace the last “k” with 
a “t” so the title of the act reads as follows: an act to amend 
the National Parks Act (creation of Tuktut Nogait park).

the hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment to the motion is both a minor and a major one, 
since it merely specifies that Bill C-38 makes direct reference 
to the park. The amendment only seeks to point out that the 
legislation refers to this park. I have no other points to make 
regarding this first motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second motion, nowhere in the legislation is 
reference made to the fact that the creation of this park is the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 the government cannot support. It is not because of 
the intent.  The intent is certainly in the right direction. 
However, a legal opinion has suggested that the recognition does 
not actually give the Inuvialuit settlement region any further 
guarantees or claims. There are already provisions in there with 
respect to the Western Arctic land claim, the Inuvialuit final 
agreement and the Western Arctic claims and, therefore, it is not 
appropriate to have that second reference or change.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Should the first and second motions not be debated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party member has already discussed the third motion

is Banff national park. I think we should go back to the agenda, 
that is Motions Nos 1 and 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is right. The debate is on 
Motions Nos. 1 and 2 on the <I>Order Paper</I>, which are amendments to

for allowing me the opportunity to speak to Motions Nos. 1 and 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-38 will create a new national park.  The creation of 
national parks is important.  The minister has said before that 
one of the objectives of this government is to expand the habitat 
of our national parks and we agree with that objective.  However, 
it is important for her to realize that with the expansion of the 
parks the individuals within those parks will be unable to raise 
the money to develop them because there will be no new funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will we manage to develop parks such as Tuktut Nogait?  How 
will we manage to buy the land and provide the money for the 
conservation officers, the habitat protection, the scientific 
research and the equipment that is required to be able to manage 
these parks?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should look at some of the good work that is being 
done by the World Wildlife Fund.  The World Wildlife Fund has 
utilized a basic theory in various parts of the world, including 
Central America where a number of species, including the golden 
lion tamarin, were becoming extinct.  They asked themselves “How 
do we manage to rescue these animals when we do not have very 
much money”?  They utilized the basic theory that parks have to 
pay for themselves.  They utilized the park and were able to 
generate revenues in an environmentally sound fashion.  With 
those revenues they managed to hire park staff, to do research 
and to expand the park to the surrounding areas.  They also used 
the revenues for health care, education and many other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing that they created a buffer zone around the park.  The 
people took ownership of the park themselves because they derived 
benefits from it and they saw the value of the park in their own 
lives.  Without any new funds they expanded the habitat of the 
park.  They managed to raise funds to research the flora an fauna 
within the park and saved many useful species that were becoming 
extinct.  This was accomplished without using any new revenue. 
It was extremely clever.  We need to learn from this experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not any new money, but parks have an unusual ability to 
raise funds and use the funds for expansion.  As Motion No. 1 
attests, the development of habitat is exceedingly important in 
the ability of flora and fauna to exist.  The destruction of 
flora and fauna is intimately entwined with the destruction of 
habitat.  Therefore, the expansion of habitat is exceedingly 
important in saving flora and fauna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we manage to expand and develop a park such as the one 
mentioned in Motion No. 1, or Banff, without providing new money? 
We can do that by generating revenues within the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use Banff as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banff has an ability to raise funds.  The people within Banff 
are asking for 850,000 square feet of land to be developed within 
the boundaries of the city.  They do not want to expand Banff 
into other areas.  This is exceedingly important to understand. 
They will be able to generate funds from that development. 
Within the boundaries of the park that money could be poured back 
into Banff National Park for the expansion of the habitat and the 
development of conservation initiatives.  That would give the 
conservation officers the tools they need to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest problems we have is that our conservation 
officers do not have the tools.  The argument that was put forth 
by the minister was that conservation officers are spending too 
much time on developmental work.  If we want to give conservation 
officers the necessary tools, we should use the money generated 
from the development of the park.  That money could easily be put 
back into the park as designated revenues, rather than general 
revenues, to be used for something completely different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some places in the world charge a 1% or a 2% surcharge on hotel 
accommodations and other tourist facilities.  That money is 
designated for park services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would help our threatened flora and fauna.  It would enable 
the minister to fulfil her objective in expanding habitat and 
providing funds to preserve our wilderness areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The models around the world which are used by the World Wildlife 
Fund and others can be adopted in Canada.  However, we have to 
have the political will to do that.  I hope the minister sees the 
opportunity to generate revenues within the parks which could be 
used to preserve them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am looking for a clarification.  Are we speaking about 
the strip mall in Banff National Park or are we speaking to the 
amendments that the hon. member from the Bloc has put forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thought the hon. member was 
discussing national parks in a fairly general way, but he was, in 
theory, discussing the amendments that were put forward by the 
hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis on Bill C-38, Motions Nos. 1 and 
2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for clarification, this 
does relate in particular to Motion No. 1.  We are talking about 
the development of a new park.  I hope I was presenting some 
constructive solutions that he might take to the minister that 
can be applied to the new park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, one of the threats to the parks, be it 
the park mentioned in Motion No. 1 or any other park, is the 
threat to habitat.  The threats to Banff National Park and the 
threats to Tuktut Nogait are one in the same in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would implore the minister, rather than penalizing the parks, 
to use the model of the World Wildlife Fund.  Those funds could 
be generated by a surcharge of 1% or 2% on hotel accommodations 
and other tourist facilities and that money could be directed 
back into the park for the development of habitat.  If we do not 
do that we will be in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a country are one of the leading conduits of endangered 
and threatened species from around the world.  Animal parts from 
tigers to rhinos to endangered birds are coming into Canada and 
being distributed around the world.  We are a major conduit. 
Poachers and traffickers of endangered species know this.  They 
are using our country illegally for this illicit trade that is 
destroying populations of threatened species around the world. 
Money is required to combat that.  This is a way we could 
generate the money to give our conservation officers the ability 
to preserve flora and fauna not only in our country but around 
the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
these two motions deal with the creation of Tuktut Nogait 
National Park and the effect that will have on our caribou 
calving grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that this park is being created specifically 
in the settlement region of the Inuvialuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with Motion No. 2, that the Western Arctic claim and the 
Inuvialuit final agreement should be recognized.  The Tuktut 
Nogait National Park, also known as the Bluenose National Park, 
should include the Nunavut settlement region and the Sahtu Dene 
settlement region, which is another 12,000 square kilometres of 
park.  It should be all encompassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government should not have dragged its heels in the last 
few years.  It should have been finalizing the agreement of the 
total park boundary and not just dealing with one region, the 
settlement region of the northern Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community has made specific claims.  I believe that the next 
motion will deal with the requests it has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to retaining the integrity of our national parks, I 
am sad to see that the Reform Party has taken a pro-development 
position within our national parks.  The integrity of the ecology 
of our national parks should be preserved for future generations. 
There should be sustainable development.  The species and the 
beauty of these parks should be preserved for future generations 
to enjoy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I wish to thank the secretary of state responsible 
for parks for agreeing to see me and for providing me with 
additional explanations. It helped me understand some of the 
government's arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there was the Western Arctic claim, which led, in 1984, 
as I mentioned earlier, to the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. 
This agreement states clearly—I will not read the entire 
agreement, rest assured—in paragraph 16(2) that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>16.(2) Canada and the Inuvialuit agree that the economic 
measures set out in this section should relate to and support 
achievement of the following objectives: full Inuvialuit 
participation in the northern Canadian economy; and Inuvialuit 
integration into Canadian society through development of an 
adequate level of economic self-reliance and a solid economic 
base. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the agreement the government concluded with the 
Inuvialuit in 1984.  A lot of water has flowed into the Beaufort 
Sea since then and government representatives have met with the 
Inuvialuit to try to reach an agreement on park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That agreement was concluded in 1996.  I must acknowledge that 
there were five parties involved in signing with the government. 
One of those parties now wants to reopen it and ask that 2.5% of 
the land be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the government's arguments is that acceding to this 
request from the aboriginal people would set a precedent which 
could led to a whole series of debates to discuss the borders of 
the parks that have not as yet been developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another of its arguments is that the caribou breeding grounds 
need protection.  However, if that is what the aim is, a still 
bigger park should have been created in order to protect all of 
the lands occupied by the caribou. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Caribou do not stay in one place.  They move around, and so we 
should have gone over to the Nunavut side to create a bigger 
park so as to protect all the herds.  One day, perhaps, that 
will be done, but at that time it will have to be seen as a new 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter of the caribou is an argument raised by the animal 
protection people and the associations of ecologists who have 
tried to lobby my office.  They could not understand why I did 
not accept Bill C-38 with my eyes closed.  My biggest problem is 
that I have met people who were used to seeing caribou in their 
area, but had had to have food animals brought in specially. 
Caribou had to be brought in from elsewhere because there was no 
herd in their area that year, so they would have had trouble 
finding game for food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot pretend that the caribou herd is that strong an 
argument for not taking 2.5% away from the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Restricting mining exploration is an excellent thing in itself. 
However, what I see as important is the arguments of the 
Inuvaluit themselves, who see the mining potential of the 
territory as a means of creating more lasting employment, more 
worthwhile jobs, so they may be more independent economically. 
I think it is important that subsection 16(2)(b) of the final 
agreement be a concern of the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Without prejudging the results of the vote, several parties have 
already made their position known on this motion. I hope the 
government will make a firm commitment, which will encourage the 
community to ensure they are given a chance to develop 
economically and open up alternatives to always relying on 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seems important to me to give them this economic tool and I 
very much regret that this bill had to be considered in such 
haste that we did not have an opportunity to really weigh the 
pros and cons. 
There is no environmental study showing there is any risk in 
changing the park's boundaries and none showing it would be a 
good thing either. This is very unusual for me since I was 
elected to this place, but this dilemma I am facing is making me 
feel uneasy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government moved too quickly for me to have time to 
assess the situation properly. The government will probably 
proceed with the current boundaries. Obviously, it does not need 
the opposition's support, it has a majority. Still, I really 
think that the government should commit, in this House, to 
promoting the economic development of the Inuvialuit outside the 
park. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
might start by offering some thoughts from some of the people who 
were present at the committee.  They had the same difficulties as 
the member had in wrestling with this most difficult question 
with regard to the boundaries and the requested change for the 
boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically it boils down to one thing only, a request from a 
mining company.  It is simply that.  I put a question to one of 
the witnesses who came forward in trying to find a solution that 
might be somewhat flexible and workable. The question I asked was 
is there any reason other than pure economics or the money 
generated from this mine in the park to move forward on this or 
change the boundaries. The answer was no. It was pure and simple 
mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three main points why the government cannot support 
this motion.  The first one is the integrity of the park.  The 
integrity of the park or the ecosystem within is extremely 
delicate and the boundaries of the park, agreed on some years 
ago, need to be maintained not just for our generation but for 
future generations.  To allow a chunk of land, some hundreds of 
thousands of acres, to be severed off for purely economic 
reasons, this government can simply not support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is the animals within, the calving groups of 
the bluenose caribou. They do shift but, as I mentioned earlier, 
the ecosystems are extremely delicate and to take up several 
hundred thousand acres of the mating or calving grounds of these 
animals is simply not appropriate.  These animals play a huge 
role in the overall diet of the native people within that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third reason is economics.  This process has been going on 
for 20 years.  It has involved all parties. The agreement was put 
in place I believe in 1996 and due to some new ways of testing 
for mineral resources in the latter part of 1996-97, a mining 
company found deposits within the national park itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not contingent on the mining process moving forward. 
Only 20% of the total find is within the national park. What they 
are asking for is to mine that 20%, to compromise that very 
delicate ecosystem and to compromise the bluenose caribou.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was for no other reason than economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and certainly all parties were having a 
difficult job with it because they certainly do not want to 
appear as if they are not supportive of the economics and the 
native people moving forward and having job opportunities from 
mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I bring to the House's attention that it is only 20% 
and it is important to understand that.  Based on the testing 
this is not the number one site for exploration. This was the 
third site on the priority list for exploration and thereby is 
not simply the only place they are pursuing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government simply cannot support this for the reasons 
mentioned.  It is an extremely difficult thing but when one looks 
at these three reasons it becomes very simple. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by 
speaking on Motion No. 3 put forth by my hon. colleague from 
Rimouski—Mitis.  She is a very diligent, hardworking and 
conscientious member of our committee and I totally respect the 
motion she has put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the committee were faced with a very difficult 
situation because we wanted to do what was right. That was the 
intent and I sensed that from all members of the committee. It 
was difficult to deal with this and I had to do quite a bit of 
soul searching and reflection on the representations made to the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An agreement is an agreement. There had been an agreement signed 
by all six parties involved. The agreement stated that if all six 
signatories were in agreement the agreement could be 
renegotiated.  Not all six signatories wanted it reopened.   What 
happens if, for example, the federal government comes in as one 
of the signatories and decides it wants to reopen?  Other members 
of the agreement might not be in favour of that.  An agreement is 
an agreement and unfortunately or fortunately we have to stand by 
that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague mentioned, the group that made 
representations to have this reopened stated this was done purely 
for economic reasons so that the people of the Inuvialuit region 
could derive some financial benefits from that.  I see absolutely 
nothing wrong with that.  There is 80% to 90% of the anomaly of 
the potential mineral find that falls outside the boundaries of 
the park.  This in no way will prevent these people from being 
able to earn income from this mineral find.  This is another 
reason I have trouble in supporting this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the bluenose caribou herd whose main calving 
ground falls into this area which some people would like to see 
changed or carved out of the park and I therefore have concerns 
with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we change the boundaries set forth in this park we are 
setting a dangerous precedent.  There are other parks that fall 
into this category such as Gros Morne Park as well as other parks 
and if we change the boundary for this one then we are leaving a 
lot of other parks open for renegotiation. I think that sets a 
dangerous precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to my colleague for Rimouski—Mitis, on 
behalf of my party, we cannot support this agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government speaker said, keeping the integrity of the 
Tuktut Nogait is of the utmost priority.  I also come back to the 
point that there are two additional proposed areas for this park, 
the Nunavut area and the Sahtu area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No discussion or reference has been made to these two regions 
because the bluenose herd requires the entire region for its 
protection.  The community of Paulatuk and Inuvialuit settlement 
region are compromising their lands to create this park.  There 
is no assurance that the other lands will be included in future 
park expansion with the existing bill.  There is no reference to 
this.  The speaker did not mention this at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would beg that this government make this clear to the people 
in Paulatuk who are reconsidering a new economic opportunity by 
the anomalies that have been discovered, the distance they are 
from the surface.  The anomaly inside the park is of prime 
mineral extraction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also go back to the agreement that says protecting the herd is 
most important because for generations the people of the north 
have been provided life and sustenance by this herd.  I believe 
this herd can still sustain life in the northern regions of this 
country without compromising the ecology, practices and 
traditional way of life of the people of the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has made a parks agreement with the people of 
the Inuvialuit settlement region.  The agreement includes job 
creation, training for the people and human resource development 
and also the environmental and ecological creation of eco-based 
tourism that the people of the north could benefit from.  This 
agreement gives them first opportunity to gain access into that 
sort of industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also agreements in the park legislation for creation 
of co-management to include the people in making decision on how 
the park is developed, land use decision and development within 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the question of adjusting the boundaries to gain access 
to minerals.  Our party has always spoken in favour of creating 
and keeping the integrity of the parks.  We cautioned this 
government during creation of the Cheviot mine neighbouring the 
Jasper National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other regions of the world parks also have a sphere of 
influence surrounding them for the integrity of the species and 
the ecology.  If this were taken into account in this country the 
development of Banff, the development of Jasper and also the 
mineral extraction neighbouring some of these parks would be 
scrutinized in a different light.  I think that should be done. 
A short term gain of mineral extraction and the impact it leaves 
in most cases must be taken very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being I challenge the government to include in the 
Tuktut Nogait national park all the proposed boundaries and 
clarify to the people of the north that the entire park and its 
proposed boundaries will be included. 
It would be like if we live in an urban centre and the local 
government decides to put an easement between people's properties 
it is not fair that the local government make an easement on my 
property first before it makes a total easement on all the 
properties affected.

them that the Nunavut settlement region and the Sahtu settlement 
region will also be contributing to this huge national park which 
has a better chance of keeping the integrity of the ecology and 
also the integrity of the bluenose caribou herd.

on economic development opportunities presented by the park. We

<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased today to speak on Bill C-37, an act to amend the 
Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by putting this bill in its proper context.  The 
judiciary is one of the fundamental institutions of our 
democracy. Since 1982 Canadian judges have been asked to assume 
increasingly demanding constitutional functions, determining 
issues of fundamental importance to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government recognizes that in doing their job judges in 
their decisions are not always popular.  It seems to me that this 
is inevitable given that we as legislators have given them the 
sometimes unenviable task of determining some of the most 
difficult and divisive legal, social and economic issues of our 
time.  It is for this very reason that we do not want popular 
judges.  Indeed it is and has always been of primary importance 
to all Canadians that judges are independent and free to make 
those difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the principle of judicial independence that provides the 
foundation for a strong and courageous judiciary as well as being 
a cornerstone of our democratic society, a principle clearly 
reflected in and protected by sections 96 through 100 of the 
Canadian Constitution.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981, in recognition of the importance of judicial 
independence and the unique constitutional role of the 
judiciary, Parliament provided for an independent commission to 
examine the adequacy of judges' salaries and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1997, the supreme court underscored the importance 
and necessity of the role played by such independent commissions 
in ensuring public confidence in the independence and 
impartiality of the Canadian judiciary. The supreme court gave 
the example of the federal commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its recent decision, the supreme court stressed the 
importance and necessity of the role played by such independent 
commissions in ensuring public confidence in the independence 
and impartiality of the Canadian judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key part of that decision is to require public justification 
by government for a decision not to implement, or to only 
partially implement, the recommendation of such a commission. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent triennial commission headed by David Scott heard 
from a range of organizations and individuals including all the 
provincial and territorial ministers of justice and attorneys 
general before putting forward a thoughtful and comprehensive set 
of recommendations.  This government continues to support the 
principles that led parliament to institute the judicial salary 
commission process 17 years ago.  In light of those principles 
and of the enhanced constitutional role of independent salary 
commissions following the supreme court decision, we have given 
serious consideration to all the recommendations of the Scott 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not unexpected that the issue which has evoked the 
greatest interest since the response was released and Bill C-37 
was introduced is the proposed judicial salary increases.  The 
Scott commission recommended an appropriately phased upward 
adjustment of 8.3% on the expiration of the salary freeze on 
April 1, 1997.  We have accepted this recommendation and Bill 
C-37 will implement the Scott recommendations by providing a 
phased-in increase to judicial salaries of 4.1% per year over two 
years effective April 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal is consistent with the government's view that it 
would be unreasonable for the judiciary not to share in the 
necessary economic restraint that was exercised from 1992 until 
very recently by all Canadians paid by the federal government. I 
want to express my strong agreement with a statement made by 
former Chief Justice Dickson of the Supreme Court of Canada in a 
seminal decision on the issue of financial security for judges in 
R. v Beauregard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief justice observed “Canadian judges are Canadian 
citizens and must bear their fair share of the financial burden 
of administering the country”. This view is echoed in the recent 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada where the Chief Justice 
of Canada observed “Nothing would be more damaging to the 
reputation of the judiciary and the administration of justice 
than a perception that judges were not shouldering their share of 
the burden in difficult economic times”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian judges are entitled to receive fair compensation that 
reflects both the importance of their role and the personal 
demands of their office.  In deciding what was reasonable, the 
Scott commission in my view correctly recognized that a whole 
range of factors must be considered in establishing an 
appropriate level of remuneration, including the need to ensure 
levels of compensation that attract and keep the most qualified 
candidates for judicial office.  That is what we are seeking, the 
most qualified candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 would also implement the Scott commission 
recommendation for certain pension related amendments to the 
Judges Act, including the rule of 80 which will permit retirement 
when the sum of a judge's age and years of service equals at 
least 80 and the judge has served on the bench for a minimum of 
15 years. In our view the proposed rule of 80 responds in an 
important way to the changing demographic profile of the 
judiciary.  More and more judges are being appointed at a younger 
age. I would like to add that many of these younger judges are 
women. The government has made many attempts to assure that there 
be equality on the bench for the two sexes.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current provision, although based on the rule of 80, 
requires a minimum age of 65.  A judge who retires before 65 has 
no right to a pension at all.  Therefore, a judge appointed at 
the age of 50 can retire with a pension at 65 with 15 years of 
service.  However, a judge who is appointed at 40 must serve 25 
years to receive any pension at all.  This is a situation that is 
increasingly considered unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is even more unacceptable when we consider that 
it has a particular impact on women judges who constitute the 
majority of those appointed at an early age.  The rule of 80 
would allow older, longer serving judges to retire when they feel 
they no longer wish to continue in the role.  Permitting this 
will be good for them and for the court itself as an institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Scott commission has proposed a different retirement option 
for the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada.  It recommended 
eligibility for retirement with a full pension after serving a 
minimum of 10 years on the bench. The government agrees with the 
commission that the immense workload and heavy responsibility 
inherent in membership on the supreme court justifies the 
proposed retirement provision. However, the government proposes 
to limit it to those judges who have reached the age of 65 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also makes a couple of other changes to judges pensions 
in the interest of fairness.  It will allow common-law spouses to 
receive surviving spouses' annuities.  It will give a judge who 
marries or commences a common-law relationship after retirement 
the option of receiving an actuarially reduced pension which 
continues until the judge and the spouse have both died. These 
are both common features of other pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important part of Bill C-37 is improvements to the 
judicial compensation commission process designed to reinforce 
the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the process as 
a means of further enhancing judicial independence. The Supreme 
Court of Canada in its decision of last September set out 
guidelines for such process improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be independent, commission members must enjoy 
security of tenure by being appointed for a fixed term and the 
judiciary must nominate a member.  To be objective, a commission 
must use objective criteria in coming to its recommendations. 
And to be effective, governments must deal with the commission's 
recommendations with due diligence and reasonable dispatch. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court also expressly stated that it was up to the 
executive and the legislator to define the institutional models, 
and that the administrations should be free to choose the 
procedures and provisions best suited to their own reality. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our proposed design, the length of time between commissions 
would be extended from the current three to a four year period. 
The new commission would conduct an inquiry similar to that 
conducted by previous commissions, including public hearings and 
inviting submissions from all those interested in judicial 
compensation, including all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this will be a permanent commission in the sense of having 
a mandate for a fixed period of time, the members of the 
commission would be part time only.  As a general rule, members 
will only be active during the first nine months of each four 
year period until the report is delivered. Furthermore, the 
members will only receive per diem fees for the time they are 
actually performing commission business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission would have nine months to complete its inquiry 
and submit a report to the Minister of Justice.  To provide 
flexibility, the period to report could be extended on agreement 
of the minister and the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exception to the general nine month period of activity would 
be when the minister decides to submit a matter to the commission 
for its inquiry as permitted under these proposals.  This 
provision would allow for changes to judicial compensation to be 
made where necessary between the fixed four year timeframe.  This 
is necessary in light of the new constitutional requirement 
established by the supreme court that future changes to judicial 
compensation cannot be implemented without prior consideration by 
a judicial compensation commission. 
This power to refer matters might also occasionally be used to 
have more detailed and informed consideration of particularly 
complex policy issues.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The independence of the commission would be enhanced by our 
proposal that it would have one member nominated by the judiciary 
and one nominated by the Minister of Justice.  The 
representatives of each side would in turn nominate a third 
member who would be the chair.  Members would be appointed by the 
governor in council for a fixed four year term, on good 
behaviour, removable for cause.  Terms would be renewed once on 
renomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes a proposal that the Minister of Justice 
be required to respond to a report of a salary commission.  The 
role of parliament in reviewing the commission recommendations 
has also been preserved in the continuation of the current 
requirement that the report of the Judicial Compensation and 
Benefits Commission be tabled before both houses of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted that another key element of Bill C-37 appears to 
have secured widespread support across party lines.  It provides 
for the largest ever expansion to date of unified family courts 
in Canada.  This broad support is natural and welcomed since 
unified family courts are widely recognized to be responsive to 
widespread concerns that the family law system is too slow, 
confusing and expensive and intensifies and prolongs the degree 
of family conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delay, conflict and confusion arise in large part because of 
jurisdictional overlap and the traditional emphasis on courts and 
litigation to resolve family issues. Unified family courts reduce 
these problems by enabling a single judge to hear all family 
matters under both federal and provincial law. Unified family 
courts also provide access to an array of services which promote 
durable, mutually agreeable solutions to family law disputes and 
improve the long term outcomes for children and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that being a member of the mixed committee of both 
houses on custody and access, a lot of the witnesses that came 
before the committee praised this type of move on the part of the 
government.  They encouraged the federal government to work with 
the provincial governments in ensuring that this type of system 
is available from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore very pleased that the level of funding provided 
in the 1997 budget will permit the appointment of 24 additional 
judges to unified family courts.  The cost will be $4.4 million 
ongoing to support the salary and benefits of federally appointed 
judges. Three other positions are currently available under the 
Judges Act for a total of 27 new unified family court judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unified family courts demonstrate an effective 
federal-provincial partnership to meet the needs of children and 
parents when family disputes occur, reflecting the high degree of 
interdependence in this area of law and social policy. The 
federal government provides and pays for specialized family law 
judges with complete jurisdiction.  This allows for one-stop 
shopping, less delay in costs and better understanding and 
outcomes.  The provinces use the resulting savings to provide and 
pay for an array of social services for families experiencing 
disputes which will result in reduced levels of conflict, 
mutually agreeable outcomes and better futures for families and 
children. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term, this bill will benefit children, because the 
risks of conflict will be lower and these conflicts will be 
settled more quickly. Children's needs will be better cared for, 
the results will last longer and, in terms of protection, child 
support, custody and access, the approach will be based on 
intensive and integrated services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this reflects exactly the views expressed by those 
who appeared before the joint committee of the House and the 
Senate to the members representing all political parties, and to 
the senators. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, these amendments will serve to strengthen what is 
already one of the best judicial systems in the world by 
enhancing the independence of our courts and improving access to 
justice.  The improvements to the judicial compensation process 
will ensure continued public confidence in the independence of 
our judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased judicial resources for unified family courts combined 
with provincial commitment of support services will improve the 
way our courts respond to families and children in crisis. 
That certainly is one of the priorities of the government and I 
am sure of all members of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I extend 
my appreciation for the clear and forthright manner in which the 
parliamentary secretary to the justice minister has put forward 
the program of government in the bill and the rationale that she 
has presented.  We can examine that and we can critique that, and 
I appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to debate Bill C-37 for the last time.  This is the 
third occasion I have had the opportunity to state Reform's 
opposition to the bill which grants judges an unprecedented 
salary increase within the public service of 8.3% over the next 
two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are listening or who may be reading <I>Hansard</I> 
either in paper form or on the Internet, I want to point out that 
8.3% over the next two years does not tell the whole story.  We 
have to ask 8.3% of what.  It is of the base salary judges are 
making at this time.  The average salary of federal court judges 
is approximately $140,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether this is the appropriate time to be 
taking more wealth out of the hands of the people to give our 
public servants, in this case our federal court judges, a raise 
at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet and to 
keep body and soul together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in earlier debates on this subject I think this is 
wrong.  It is the wrong time.  I often wonder about the Scott 
commission which made this recommendation to parliament and that 
representation to the justice committee when witnesses were 
called.  Mr. Scott himself appeared.  I wonder if members of that 
commission went to the people of the country, to the families 
that money will come from to grant federal court judges that kind 
of a raise.  I ask as well if members of the government have 
considered this not only in view of Bill C-37 but also in view of 
the report table that will give MPs a 2% raise, which amounts to 
about a 10% increase over the next four years.  Is this the time 
to be doing this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that it is not.  We should be asking the people who will 
pay more in taxes whether or not this is fair and whether or not 
judges and members of parliament at our salary levels can suffer 
a bit longer, perhaps another two or three years.  Perhaps we can 
see our way clear to giving the people of the country an economic 
benefit either through enhancing the economic climate of the 
country or reducing taxes to them and allowing them to take home 
more pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be wonderful if we did that first?  The Scott 
commission and the government are now asking the people of the 
country to dig deeper into their pockets to give someone making 
the pay of an MP or the pay of a judge, $140,000 on the average 
for a federal judge, more pay so that they can take home a 
greater benefit.  There is something wrong with this, and I just 
want to give some statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further I express my gratitude to the House and 
to the government for accepting my amendment to Bill C-37 that 
was supported and passed earlier this week.  As a result every 
four years the standing committee on justice will have the 
opportunity to review the report of a commission on judges' 
salaries and benefits.

will be able to call witnesses from the public to see whether any 
increase recommended by the commission to be established by the 
bill is fair, to see what are the economic conditions of families 
and people of Canada at the time, and to see whether there is a 
proper balance between the need for more take home pay by judges 
and the plight of Canadian families.  We must remember that it is 
reported that one child in every five is living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Scott commission consider that?  Did the commissioners 
realize that by asking for this kind of pay raise for federal 
court judges they would be taking money from the families of 
those children who are reported to be living in poverty?  They 
are living in poverty while our judges are taking home a minimum 
of $140,000 a year on average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong. I understand the need to attract the 
best in the legal community to the bench.  Surely there are top 
legal minds out there who are prepared to serve their country and 
its people and to show the leadership we so desperately need in 
this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A poll in July 1997 showed that 52% of Canadians had little 
faith in their courts, in their judges.  Why is that?  The people 
are saying to us, to the courts and to other Canadians that they 
are dissatisfied with the leadership being shown in some of the 
decisions being made by judges, which indicates very clearly that 
some decisions are not being made in the best interest of the 
majority of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they pleased to be taxed more?  Are they pleased that the 
power of the state is being used to take more money from people 
including families whose children are reported to be living in 
poverty in order that judges might have more take home pay?  This 
is the wrong time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agreed with my Bloc colleague on the committee when he pointed 
out that it was not the right time.  Should we not wait until we 
see the heads of families taking home more income than they are 
now before we begin to give ourselves and judges a raise?  There 
is no question in my mind.  If the government would take the 
proper economic course we would not be far from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has balanced the budget mainly on the backs of 
taxpayers.  We are now in a position where we might be able to 
offer tax relief and debt reduction and to give our children and 
grandchildren hope that one day they will be able to take more of 
their dollar home.  Fifty per cent of every dollar the average 
Canadian earns is taken by taxes in one form or another, and now 
the Scott commission and the government are asking that they take 
less home.  Why?  It is be cause we must have a pay raise of 10% 
over the next four years and the judges must have a pay raise of 
very close to 10% over two years, compounded as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some statistics.  According to an Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> article on June 10, family incomes are still 
dropping.  As a result Canadians need to stretch the family 
budget more to keep a roof over their heads.  The reason is that 
while housing costs eased during the first half of this decade 
family incomes declined even more.  That nudged the proportion of 
Canadians who spend at least 30% of their income on shelter and 
thus potentially face problems covering their housing costs to 
one in four households or almost 2.8 million households.  These 
are the people the government and the Scott commission are asking 
to pay a little more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  First, the judges want more money.  We have to make sure 
they take home more pay even though the people of Canada will not 
be able to take home to their families more pay to provide for 
their children and their needs in the areas of clothing, food and 
shelter. 
We spend more on taxes in Canada than we do on those three items. 
We are the highest taxed country in the G-7.  Why?  Is it not 
because of decisions such as this?  Is it not because of 
legislation such as this?  Through the force of law we are to 
take more money from these people.  I do not think that is right.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The findings I referred to were released by Statistics Canada 
and were derived from the 1996 census.  An additional 
<I>Citizen</I> article on the same date also revealed that more 
and more two parent families had two parents in the workforce in 
1996 while at the same time the number of children left at home 
was increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada reported that the overall lower incomes among 
Canadians in 1996 is the reason both parents were being forced 
into the labour market.  Is that not wonderful, while judges and 
MPs will be taking home more money?  How can we go back to our 
constituents and argue that?  How can we do that?  How can we say 
to those folks that we know they are struggling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency is facing a drought.  I received a call from a 
rancher out in the Byemoor area of my constituency who said they 
were finished if it did not rain.  They will have to sell off 
their herds.  Their cattle are being moved out to the grasslands 
now because there is no grass.  We are saying to them that is 
their problem but we need more money from them.  Why?  It is 
because we want to have more take home pay and we want the judges 
to have the same.  How can we do that?  I cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand as the opposition to cry out against it.  Although 
there are good things in the bill to which I will come that we 
could support, we cannot support a bill that will do this to the 
people of Canada.  We just cannot do it.  How can we look in the 
mirror and say this is fair?  How can we do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected representatives of the people we are required to 
justify this to the source of our authority, the people who 
elected us, the people we represent.  We represent everyone in 
our constituency, even those who voted against us.  We have a 
duty to stand on guard to protect the economic viability of their 
farming and ranching operations.  Some of them take home meagre 
pays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I raised four children.  I have young twin sons who 
are in the labour force now.  The tax return of one son showed 
that he made $14,000 working at just above minimum wage.  He had 
to pay with taxes and deductions almost $2,000. The bill is 
saying that Spencer Ramsay will be required to pay more. Why?  It 
is because judges want to take home more pay and members of 
parliament want to take home more pay.  He will have to provide 
that for us through the force of law and if he does not we will 
take him to court.  We have ways of dealing with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with this story.  There is something 
wrong when we do this to our own people and then we cry— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We can sell Stornoway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  We could deal with that and we could 
deal with a lot of other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking specifically about a bill that is designed on the 
surface to look good.  Judges do a tough job and are required to 
interpret the law.  They have studied long and hard and were 
found worthy to be appointed to august positions of 
responsibility.  However, when we compare their lifestyle with 
the lifestyle of one out of every five children reported to be 
living in poverty surely we can tough it out a bit longer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the judges can go another year or so.  Hopefully the 
economy will provide an upturn for them so that the wealth we tax 
from them will not be in as great a proportion as it is today. 
Surely we can do that. As members of parliament, we should be 
able to do that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, our judges need decent courts.  They need decent facilities 
to function in, as we do.  The people do not begrudge that but we 
are not talking about that in this case. We are talking about our 
take home pay.  Really we are saying taxpayers are going to have 
to take home less pay because we want to take home more.  How can 
we say that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We confuse the issue.  We mix it up with legal jargon and we put 
it in a bill.  We have a commission look at it.  It makes its 
recommendations.  Then we do not go beneath that to look at what 
it has been looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just say this is the recommendation by the commission. Its 
members have looked at it.  We have assigned them and we have 
appointed them to do the job.  That is it.  We are going to take 
their recommendations and go forward.  The bottom line always is 
where does the wealth come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments do not create wealth.  They only take it from people 
who do.  We must do it in a balanced and fair way.  I do not 
think most of our judges are selfish people, not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many of them are saying a raise would be nice, but let's 
consider everything, consider the people who are going to have to 
pay for their raise, how are they doing? I am sure they would say 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not involving them directly.  It would be hard, I 
understand, perhaps to do that.  Nevertheless, when we look at a 
$17,000 pay raise over two years for some of our federal court 
judges, when my children and the children who are now entering 
the labour market take home $14,000 after labouring for a year at 
just above minimum wage and our judges are going to take $17,000 
more home in the next two years and we as MPs over the next four 
are going to take home another $5,000, I can suffer a little 
longer.  I think the judges can as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out what we can support in this bill, the 
appointment of additional family court judges to the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this speaks of certainly a social if not a moral 
condition existing within our country where we need more judges 
in family court to deal with the increased workload, the backlog 
of cases coming forward, we can support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think individuals who require the services of a court 
and the wisdom of a judge to decide the legalities of their 
precarious situations or any situation that might demand the 
scrutiny of a court should have to wait and wait. In the criminal 
court in B.C. I understand there are over 40,000 cases 
backlogged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support this bill because of the financial burden it is 
going to place on our taxpayers.  I think at times when we have 
to provide greater services in needed areas, we can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have to ask the people to sacrifice more, it has to be in 
those areas and not to provide judges and MPs with more take home 
pay.  We cannot do that.  If we can, then I am missing something 
in this whole debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can say to my son and all our sons and daughters who are 
out there entering the labour force and making minimum or just 
above minimum wage that we are going to take more from them to 
give someone making $140,000 a year more take home pay, I cannot 
argue that. 
I cannot debate that with them because I will be on their side 
saying it is not fair because it is not fair and it is not right.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest threat to the economic stability of the family and 
the individual is the unlimited power of the state to take, to 
tax away their wealth which they create.  That is the greatest 
threat.  Since I have been in this House since 1993 we have seen 
the continued erosion of the take home pay of our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the average family's disposable income has dropped by 
some $2,500.  That is probably the minimum.  We just go blindly 
on because the minister has brought in a bill.  We are going to 
pass this and suffer the consequences.  Who is going to suffer? 
Not the judges and not the MPs.  We are not going to suffer but 
our sons and daughters will, our children will and our 
grandchildren will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we getting to?  Are we going to take more and more out 
of the economy and away from the families?  Are we going to see 
the number of children living in poverty increase because of 
this?  This bill is just a symptom where people are saying they 
want more and we are going to have to give more. We are saying 
that to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support this bill, although there are parts of it that 
I can support.  Not unlike the report tabled in the House on this 
benefit package, there are some things there that I can support, 
others I cannot.  I cannot support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this area I want to touch on something that is extremely 
important.  It is the motivation for this bill.  This bill was 
motivated as a result of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision 
on the Alberta case and the P.E.I. case where those governments 
were attempting to roll back the salaries of judges because of 
the economic conditions existing in those provinces.  They were 
trying to get their spending under control and so the judges 
fought that and took it to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada has simply decided that all 
governments in this land, including the federal government, must 
set up a commission which will at the federal level at least 
every four years examine the need for increased benefits to the 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most alarming part of that decision is that it has been 
inferred that any unwarranted interference by the government, 
unwarranted in the eyes of the courts, interference in the pay 
and benefits of the judges, can be considered an interference 
with the judicial independence of the court.  I say that is a 
grave decision because of what it means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that if in dire circumstances we want to reduce as a 
government the tax burden on the people of this country and roll 
back the salaries of the civil servants, including MPs and 
judges, the courts alone can say we cannot do that because that 
constitutes in their judgment an interference in the judicial 
independence of the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the dissenting opinion of Judge La Forest that the 
Parliament of Canada and the governments of the provinces do have 
that right and that it does not constitute an interference in the 
judicial independence of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spinoff effect of that is if this thinking and rationale are 
to be accepted by this parliament, what it means directly or 
indirectly is the courts impinging on the power of parliament to 
tax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are saying is that we cannot reduce taxes to lower 
pay.  We must maintain the taxation rate or increase it.  That is 
an encroachment on the supremacy of this parliament in the area 
of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I would like to see the people of Canada have the power 
to encroach on parliament's power to tax, if the courts are going 
to do that then I think we are moving to the edge of a slippery 
slope.  As this bill goes forward and as this parliament accepts 
that decision and the consequences of that decision we will see 
where this eventually leads this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so important that we maintain the division of powers 
between the executive and the judiciary.  Do we not see the 
disintegration of the division of powers between our judiciary 
and the executive or the Parliament of Canada in some of these 
decisions, particularly this one?  Where is it going to stop? How 
do we stop it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we intervene? This bill does not intervene.  This 
parliament is accepting and embracing it.  I hope the upper 
chamber, the chamber of sombre second thought, will click in and 
take a look at this because it is obvious we cannot stop it here. 
We have not even looked at that aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had two hearings before our standing committee with two sets 
of witnesses where we could not even broach that question because 
it was outside the realm of this bill.  It motivated the bill. It 
directly related to this bill because this is what spawned the 
bill.  That decision created the need for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Government of Canada prepared to hold back a minute to 
question whether it is prepared to accept the consequences of 
this decision?  Are we prepared to accept an encroachment on our 
right of taxation?  Are we prepared to accept that the Supreme 
Court of Canada appears to have read into the charter of rights 
of freedoms this whole question of judicial independence being 
interfered with by the Governments of Canada and the provinces? 
If they decide they cannot give a raise or they have to roll back 
pay, if this in a subjective way is not agreed to by the courts 
of this land, that is what we are looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gravity of that is yet to come and yet we are seeing that. 
If we see the collapse of the division of powers in this country 
what are the consequences of that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did our parliamentary system evolve from?  It evolved from 
the divine rule of kings.  When we saw the split and division 
that occurred between those who create the law and those who 
interpret and enforce the law, that created the basis for a 
democracy.  When we see the collapse of that then what are we 
going back to?  Are we going back to the divine rule of kings 
where we are going to exclude the division of powers and the 
groups that represent the competing responsibilities in this 
country?  Are we going to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that this bill is heading us in that direction.  In fact, 
I see the judicial activism in this bill loud and clear.  The 
warnings are there.  As the official opposition we are putting 
that warning on the record and have expressed that concern in 
committee.

conclusion or change my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite members who might have an interest in this particular 
area of the bill to address it, to add their experience, 
knowledge and wisdom to this particular question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we seeing in this country an erosion of the division of 
powers between our executive and our judiciary?  If we are, what 
can we do about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great concerns about the bill.  Earlier I spoke about it 
being the wrong time to give judges and others, including 
ourselves, a pay raise, when families are struggling to make ends 
meet.  I recognize the need for us to suffer a little longer with 
them until the economy turns around and we can grant them greater 
take home pay through cuts in taxes and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to be working for them.  If we deserve a pay 
raise, why do we not ask them?  If we have done our job well and 
they are taking more pay home and doing well, and if there are no 
longer families and children living in poverty, at that point we 
could ask, if we are doing a good job and working very long 
hours, do we deserve a 2% raise?  Do the judges deserve a 4.5% or 
4.3% raise over each of the next two years?  I think questioning 
that would be fair.  Right now it is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is heading in the wrong direction.  The timing is 
wrong.  I hope I hear from some of my colleagues in the House.  I 
respect their opinions and always have in this area.  I hope this 
area might be addressed.  Are we witnessing a disintegration of 
the division of powers between the judiciary and the state?  If 
we are, is it a good thing or a bad thing?  Or am I seeing 
something in this bill that does not exist?  I will leave it at 
that and wait with anticipation to hear from some of my learned 
colleagues who will be speaking to this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning we are considering Bill C-37, an act to amend the Judges 
Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think 
the first question we should ask is why, today, we are at this 
point. We are at third reading of a bill concerning judges' 
salaries, Bill C-37.  I think I should first provide a bit of 
background first and take a look at the constitutional context 
of the whole matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada in a 
reference on the pay of provincial court judges in Prince Edward 
Island, determined the constitutional requirements the 
legislator must abide by in establishing judges' pay. 
The court stipulated that the independence of the court system, 
as protected by the Constitution, involved the establishment of 
an independent and objective commission with sway over decisions 
on judges' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial and federal attorneys general asked the supreme 
court to stay the effects of the decision to enable them to meet 
the constitutional requirements.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court acted on this request in its decision.  On 
February 10, the court decided to stay the effect of its 
decision from September 18, 1997 until September 18, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justices of the supreme court sent us, the lawmakers, the 
following message “Change the law to comply with our recent 
decision, and we will give you time to do it, that is, one year, 
until September 18, 1998”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since time flies—here we are at the end of the session—the 
House must consider this legislation and its amendments and act 
on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government amendments we have before us, however, are not 
necessarily what I would have liked to see.  As it stands, the 
supreme court ruling calls for the creation of an independent 
commission, nothing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clear from reading the 
ruling.  It calls for the creation of an independent commission, 
period.  The government party is not right in saying that it is 
merely giving effect to a supreme court ruling with its salary 
increases.  Naturally, I will come back to the government's 
salary increases for judges during my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court ruling is not to be interpreted as a 
requirement to increase judges' salaries.  To respect the 
constitutional imperatives imposed by the court in the 
reference,  parliament is not obliged to go along with the Scott 
commission recommendation to increase judges' salaries. 
At the very outside, parliament should undertake to set up an 
independent commission that can influence, but not dictate, 
judges' salaries.  Here again, it is very important to look at 
the supreme court ruling, to understand it and to compare it to 
the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice was not obliged—and I choose my words 
deliberately—to include an 8.2% salary increase over two years 
for federal judges in order to meet the constitutional 
requirements set down by the supreme court.  Clause 5 of the 
bill we are now studying, Bill C-37, which contains the salary 
increase provision, threatens the whole bill, in my view.  This 
is unfortunate because the bill contains some very good 
elements, such as the creation of permanent judicial 
compensation and benefits commissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois considers that the government is far 
exceeding the conditions set by the supreme court in proposing a 
salary increase of 4.1% per year for two years.  The government 
used a false claim of unconstitutionality to justify a salary 
increase that was not required by the supreme court in the 
reference on judges' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While only one clause in the bill being considered poses a 
problem, we cannot support the bill.  The Bloc Quebecois is 
entitled to demand rigour from the government in the drafting of 
its bills and the avoidance of unjustified discrepancies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is immediately clear from the bill that the government has 
gone much farther than the justices of the supreme court asked 
it to. 
If we add up all the increases proposed in the Scott report and 
those authorized by government for the statutory increases 
provided under the Judges Act, passage of the bill will give the 
judges an increase of 12.4%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As it appears that the government has been preparing this one 
for a long long time, the bill is likely to be passed intact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While clause 5 of the bill refers to a salary increase of 4.1% a 
year for two years, the federal judges will be entitled to an 
increase of over 12% retroactive to April 1, 1997, if the bill 
is passed by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we add indexing of 2.1% on April 1, 1997 and 2.08% on April 
1, 1998 to the 8.02% provided by the bill, the total is an 
increase of exactly 12.38% that will be given the judges.  An 
increase of 12.8% just calculating the increases provided under 
the law and Bill C-37. 
It is simple math. Just add 4.1 twice, plus 2.08, plus 2.1%. We 
must add up all these increases to understand that, 
retroactively, this makes a total increase of 12.38%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any accountant and reasonable person who looks into the matter 
will tell you that the combined effect of these individual 
increases is an overall increase of more than 12.38% because 
increases are all one over another. Factor in retroactivity and 
we have been told by accountants that it is actually closer to 
13%. That does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a the matter of fact, under Bill C-37, if passed, a superior 
court judge will earn approximately $175,800 a year.  The chief 
justice of the Supreme Court of Canada will see his salary 
increase from an attractive $208,200 to a lovely $225,700. I do 
not think these can be considered middle class incomes. 
Yet, the government is granting judges a salary increase of 
approximately 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me digress for a moment. At present, it is clear that the 
government across the way is not even able to come to an 
agreement with his own employees. Our pay clerks at the House of 
Commons did not get even a small salary increase, only crumbs 
off the table of the rich.  They have to fight with their 
employer, and the pay office. They have to fight with the 
government, the Board of Internal Economy, just to get what they 
are owed, to maintain salaries similar to those paid elsewhere 
in government. They cannot get a small increase and adequate 
recognition for the work they do. 
The government over there will be giving about $25,000 in pay 
raises to senior justices, and $20,000 to the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These judges perform very useful work, I am sure, but I also 
believe that certain government employees do extremely necessary 
work, including the pay clerks, who are currently involved in a 
dispute with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the judges' raises in particular in Bill C-37, the 
Bloc Quebecois cannot honestly understand how the government can 
commit to a pay raise of 12.4% for federal judges, when we know 
that the attack on the deficit, and the subsequent budget 
surplus, are being achieved on the backs of the least well off. 
The incomes of those most in need are being cut, and those with 
high incomes are being given increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not capable of competing with the lucrative 
private job market. 
That is one of the arguments that has been raised.  We are told 
that, if we want to have competent judges, we have to pay them 
properly.  I agree, but I think that, at some point, there has 
to be a limit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Scott, the head of the commission that looked into judges' 
benefits in 1995, told the justice committee that the government 
ought to raise the pay of federal judges if it hoped to attract 
the best candidates from the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, the lists of candidates for judgeships are full to 
overflowing.  The Judicial Council will attest to the fact that 
there is no shortage of applicants.  Lots of people are queuing 
up to get judicial appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, however, the government has set itself the objective of 
going after the top-flight lawyers in the major law firms, the 
4.1% increase yearly for two years will not make any difference 
to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a lawyer emeritus decides to make the leap to a judgeship, 
he or she does so for the professional prestige, not just for 
the money.  Despite the salary freeze of recent years, the 
federal courts have excellent magistrates at this time. Let me 
take this opportunity to congratulate and thank them for the 
excellent work they do in all the courts in Canada, particularly 
the provincial courts in Quebec, the superior court and the 
court of appeal. I congratulate them on their excellent work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not do that excellent work because of the pay.  They do 
excellent work because they have the qualifications and 
qualities required, they have good judgment, they are 
professionals, and I congratulate them. 
Again, it is not because we are giving them a 4.1% raise over 
two years that they will do an even greater job. Judges will 
continue to work the way they have been since they were 
appointed to the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that the government decided to opt for a 
strategy similar to that used by major professional sports 
teams, which are prepared to raise the stakes in order to 
attract the best athletes? If so, the government should find a 
new approach, because it is not in a financial position to 
compete with private law firms. We all know that some brilliant 
lawyers in some big private firms make a lot more than $200,000 
per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this does not necessarily mean that a lawyer who earns 
$150,000 in a private firm is not as good as one who makes 
$250,000 or $300,000. This is not how lawyers are rated. 
But the government seems to think so. I do not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know judges who used to work for legal aid, a government 
service. I know some who used to be crown attorneys and who are 
now excellent judges. These people did not earn $250,000 or 
$300,000 per year, yet they are very good judges because they 
believe in their profession and in the justice system. They are 
good, but they were not paid like brilliant lawyers in big law 
firms around the country, including in Montreal and in other 
major centres. Yet, they do a great job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard all sorts of things about the review of Bill C-37. At the 
risk of offending some people, I say that anyone who works for 
his or her country—for Quebec or for Canada—must be considered 
a public servant. The salary of that person is paid by Canadians 
through their taxes. 
Senior public servants, secretaries of state, ministers, the 
Prime Minister and others are all paid with taxpayers' money, 
which means they are at the service of the public and the state. 
Judges—and this may upset some people—are also at the service 
of the state, since it is the people who pay the judges' 
salaries through their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep that in mind when we give a raise or when we pay a 
salary to someone who works for the state.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the people working for the government, in Canada, 
specifically the professionals, including the Prime Minister, 
the ministers and all the members of this House, the judges are 
the best paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In considering the salary of judges, we have to think what an 
individual might earn in a liberal profession of similar scope. 
The Bloc Quebecois agrees with all those who say that judges 
perform very important functions and should be held in esteem in 
our society because of their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is not starting a war against the judges.  On 
the contrary, it is simply raising the choice the government has 
made, which, in our opinion, is not the right one. 
So the judges are the best paid in the professional category in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article on May 13, the <I>Toronto Star</I> informed us that our 
judges earn an average of $126,000 a year.  That is more than 
medical specialists and lawyers earn.  Medical specialists earn 
about $123,000 and lawyers in private practice, an average of 
$81,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have a question for you.  Should judges earn more 
than medical specialists?  Which is more important in society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the question is an easy one to answer or that, at least, 
it raises other questions.  Is this the way we should look at 
it?  Maybe not.  Maybe we should not be comparing the salaries 
of judges and doctors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make, however, is that a medical specialist 
is every bit as important to society as a good judge.  Why give 
an astronomical increase to judges and not to medical 
specialists?  At some point, we have to stop and think.  Is the 
increase too high?  I think the government did not give it 
enough thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that bothers me a little bit about this bill is 
that they are trying to conceal the fact that it is retroactive. 
It is retroactive to April 1997.  Why should there be 
retroactive compensation for the salary freeze of recent years? 
That is the reason we are being given.  It is not retroactive, 
but it goes back to April 1, 1997 because judges' salaries have 
been frozen in recent years.  Either it is retroactive, or it is 
not.  If the government wants to compensate them for a freeze, 
they should be compensated for what they lost, and not more.  In 
response to the minister, therefore, indexing would have been 
enough. 
But the government is giving more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 Scott commission's report on judges' salaries and 
benefits proposed an 8% increase as compensation for the ground 
they lost in recent years.  The Minister of Justice probably 
based the 8.2% increase mentioned in clause 8 of Bill C-37 on 
this figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As even certain Liberals on the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights have said during hearings, this catch-up policy 
is unacceptable.  When salaries are frozen, it is because the 
public purse cannot keep pace with the consumer price index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 
salary freeze does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with a promise 
of an increase when the situation has improved. 
We are barely out of a budgetary crisis—a look at Canada's 
deficit makes it plain we are not yet out of the woods—and one of 
the ways this was done was by making the most disadvantaged 
members of society foot the bill, and the government is 
preparing to spend money retroactively by increasing judges' 
salaries and indexing them as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public service salaries also dropped during the period when 
indexing was frozen.  Members also had their salaries frozen for 
five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the freeze was lifted, if one could call it that, the 1% or 
2% indexation was restored, but there was never any question of 
raising salaries to compensate for the money lost because of the 
freeze.  Why should we give judges special treatment?  Whey 
should they be treated differently than other government 
professionals or salaried workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the least well off are the ones who have had 
to bear the brunt of the fight against the deficit, as I have 
already pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now. the government is making those same people pay for the 
judges' salary increases. 
Those in greatest need get cuts, and those with what I consider 
respectable salaries are given an increase that works out to 
around 13%, when all the raises are combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is flying, but I would like to quickly remind people of the 
cuts to social transfers.  The government over there cut 
billions in transfer payments.  The eligibility criteria for 
employment insurance, formerly unemployment insurance, have been 
tightened up.  In fact, judging by the effect on the public, it 
ought to be called poverty insurance. The government will be 
taking billions from the pockets of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the Minister of Finance has a bit of money to play 
around with, he wants to give it to the most well-off in salary 
increases. 
I think that both an individual and a collective contribution 
are required here. The Minister of Finance is digging into the 
employment insurance fund to solve his budget problems, and 
everybody knows it.  I think the Bloc Quebecois has done 
excellent work on this. It has alerted the public to this 
extremely important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already referred to transfer payments.  It must be kept 
in mind that the amount the federal government transfers for 
health has been cut back terribly.  This week we heard the 
minister boasting that the cut was only $42 billion, rather than 
$48 billion.  Forty-some billion is a really big amount. 
I am not saying he was right or wrong.  I am simply saying that 
he made these cuts on the backs of the most disadvantaged and 
vulnerable in our society, and on the backs of the sick; so he 
should not turn around and give the money he cut to the 
wealthiest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public remembers that the same people always pay.  We have 
to conclude, in the case of Bill C-37, that the rich are not 
treated like the poor and disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants us to agree and approve a bill awarding an 
increase like this.  The government is accusing us of failing to 
honour the Supreme Court decision.  That is not true.  We want 
to comply with it. 
We are simply saying that the government is going well beyond 
the Supreme Court decision, because there was no mention of what 
sort of increase we should give the judges in that decision. The 
Supreme Court said “Set up an independent commission”.  We could 
simply have limited the scope of the bill to establishing the 
commission sought by the justices of the Supreme Court of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, judges too, in my opinion, should make budget 
sacrifices.  Ask the man in the street.  I am sure you will find 
that they agree with the Bloc Quebecois that judges, ministers, 
Prime Ministers and the like should contribute equally to the 
effort to eliminate the budget deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those opposite often criticize what goes on in the Quebec 
National Assembly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bouchard and his government could probably teach the members 
across the way something about making budgetary sacrifices, 
because that is what they have done in Quebec City, the premier 
included.  Judges also did their part.  The government reduced 
its payroll by 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would it be any different here?  If the federal government 
is taking in too much in taxes and no longer knows what to do 
with all the money, it could perhaps turn it over to the 
provinces so that they could use it as they saw fit, for their 
own objectives, to reduce their own deficits and ultimately 
lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the federal government is providing increasingly fewer 
services to the public, if it no longer knows what to do with 
the money, it should get out of a lot of areas and leave the 
taxes for provincial governments, including the Government of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that all members of our society must work collectively 
to put our fiscal house back in order, and federal judges are no 
exception.  An increase in the salary of federal judges during a 
period of cutbacks would, in our view, further undermine the 
public's confidence in the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to cite Mr. Justice Lamer himself, whose 
opinion can be found in the reference on judges' remuneration. 
It will help the members opposite in their reflections. 
In the supreme court ruling, Judge Lamer said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that the guarantee of a minimum acceptable 
level of judicial remuneration is not a device to shield the 
courts from the effects of deficit reduction.  Nothing would be 
more damaging to the reputation of the judiciary and the 
administration of justice than a perception that judges were not 
shouldering their share of the burden in difficult economic 
times. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could not be stated more clearly.  Even the supreme court 
judges, in their ruling, told the Parliament of Canada that it 
should not give them salary increases because it would be 
prejudicial to the public's perception of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely believe that an increase that is close to 18% and 
that is retroactive to April 1, 1997 is ill-advised, and that it 
will not achieve the specific goal of increasing the public's 
confidence in the judiciary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me pleasure to rise to speak to Bill C-37, an act 
respecting changes to the Judges Act, changes to salaries with 
respect to eligibility for annuity, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my comments by indicating, as has been done by some 
other speakers, particularly my colleague in the Bloc Quebecois, 
that there are some good things in this bill.  I have indicated 
that in previous addresses to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the creation of the unified family court in provinces in 
this country is an important step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, I 
am honoured to serve on the Special Joint Committee on Child 
Custody and Access.  I would say that one of the difficulties in 
sitting on that committee is that it sits at the same time as the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the frustrations that both the parliamentary 
secretary and myself have had in trying to make both meetings. 
However, at the meetings we have attended, it has been clear that 
many individuals who have come before that committee have had 
experiences in provincial courts dealing with the issues of 
custody and access, and perhaps matrimonial property if the court 
has the jurisdiction to do that.  In some provinces it may and in 
some provinces it may not.  Then they find themselves before a 
superior court dealing with the federal legislation of divorce 
and a whole range of matters that have already been dealt with 
which have to be re-adjudicated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The movement toward a unified family court is a good move.  Were 
it not for other aspects of this bill, my party would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the special joint committee on child custody and 
access, I mentioned the difficulty that the parliamentary 
secretary and I had in attending those meetings.  That has been 
compounded by the fact that, like her, I have constituency work 
to do and voters to be answerable to.  They are the most 
important reason we are here today and they are the most 
important priority for myself and for other elected members of 
this House.  Unlike certain colleagues in the Senate who have a 
lot more time because they do not have constituents to answer to 
and they are only on one committee, we have had to divide our 
time between the many responsibilities that we have as elected 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill moves in the direction of providing annuities and 
benefits to the surviving spouses of the judiciary.  It provides 
a mechanism for the division of property for the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment was suggested by a member of my party to change the 
definition of spouse in the act.  I will read the definition: 
“A surviving spouse, in relation to a judge, includes a person 
of the opposite sex who has cohabitated with the judge—”.  In 
recent court rulings of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and in 
other human rights cases there is some question as to whether or 
not the definition of spouse, which is an older definition in the 
act, will hold up to judicial scrutiny at some point down the 
road.  It seems that we could have gone further and taken out the 
heterosexual nature of the definition of spouse in the act and 
saved it from litigation at some point down the road.  However, 
that amendment was not deemed important enough to be brought 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the good aspects of this legislation that are 
worthy of consideration.  At the same time there are important 
areas that could have been addressed by the Minister of Justice 
in bringing forward amendments to the Judges Act that have not 
been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will deal with the formation of the committee that 
reviews judicial salaries.  I have said before and I say again 
that I think that committee could have been expanded.  I 
appreciate that the Minister of Justice used a model from 
arbitration, where a member is nominated by the judiciary, a 
member is nominated by the government and a third party is 
nominated by both individuals.  However, we could have expanded 
that committee.  We could have included a member of the Canadian 
Bar Association.  No one knows better how much work the judiciary 
does than the lawyers who appear before the courts on a regular 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the judiciary in this country are exemplary.  Some go 
beyond the call of duty.  They work late nights.  They accept 
responsibilities.  When cases fall through, they go looking for 
other cases to deal with their workload.  At the same time, we 
know there are members of the judiciary who are not as 
hardworking as others.  As parliament continues to play an 
increasing role in certain areas, some members of the judiciary 
have simply retreated from making decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, consider the results of Bill C-41 which brought 
into existence the maintenance tables that the judiciary now uses 
upon divorce.  There was a time when the responsibility of the 
judge upon divorce was to inquire as to what the means and the 
needs of the parties were, whether the children were provided 
for, what special circumstances families had to take into 
account.  Today many of the judiciary simply ensure that the 
guidelines are imposed.  They say they have no responsibility to 
make further inquiries.  They have abandoned that work. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will again refer to the Divorce Act where in many cases the 
plan is put forward by the children.  We heard on the special 
joint committee on child custody and access repeated calls for 
parenting plans to be put forward by parents of children upon 
divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases it is left up to the lawyers to negotiate that and 
to ensure that there is a checklist for the judiciary.  The 
judiciary simply checks things off in the way a clerk might. They 
say “Well, you haven't filled in all the blanks, so take the 
divorce papers back and when the lawyers do all the work bring it 
back to me and I'll sign on the dotted line”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear that type of thing the bill falls short of what 
might have been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the committee could have been expanded, as I have 
indicated, to include members of the bar association and to 
perhaps include a member from the Canadian Union of Public 
Employees.  The Canadian Union of Public Employees represents 
public servants in this country who are paid by the taxpayer in 
the same way that the judiciary is.  Why not have someone sitting 
on that committee on judicial salaries who understands what other 
public employees across this country are dealing with in terms of 
their own expenses and costs of living? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned by both my colleague in the Bloc and the 
member for Crowfoot that the people who work in the court system, 
the people who work in the protonotary's office, the people who 
work in the deeds office and the people who sit at the feet of 
the judges transcribing what goes on in the courtroom have 
suffered as a result of the government's emphasis on deficit 
reduction, have suffered roll-backs and freezes at both the 
provincial and federal levels.  It would have been very 
interesting to have a representative of the Canadian Union of 
Public Employees sit on the judicial salaries commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure to expand the committee is a flaw in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think, and this has been the crux of many comments from 
other individuals, that the size of the increase in pay at this 
point in time for the judiciary is one that we have to question. 
The estimates and the figures we have been given range from 8.4%, 
I believe from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice, to well over 13% from the hon. member in the Bloc 
Quebecois.  Either figure at this point in time we have to 
question, given the nature of what people in this country have 
gone through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, given the fact of what we have seen in this country 
under the current economic policies, the gap between the wealthy 
and the poor continues to increase.  That ought to give us pause 
for concern as we move to increasing the take home income of some 
of the wealthiest people in the country by either 8% or 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that I do not think the judiciary ought to be well 
paid.  It is not that I do not think the judiciary has a 
difficult and important job to do.  However, at a time when those 
who work in the court system and those who appear before the 
courts are suffering, it is unacceptable that we give such a high 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my hon. colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough in 
the House today.  He and I walked a picket line in Halifax.  I 
must say that it was not a situation he was most comfortable with 
or used to.  I had to give him a few lessons on where to turn and 
how to hold his sign, but he passed with flying colours. It was a 
sight to be seen.  I think our picture appeared on the front page 
of the daily news.  I am sure that Conservatives across that 
province will take great comfort in the fact that the 
Conservatives are now walking the picket lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on a more serious note, we walked that line with the 
crown attorneys for the province of Nova Scotia.  We walked that 
line with the crown prosecutors in the province of Nova Scotia 
who were forced onto the street because they had been struggling 
with pay reductions and increased workloads and simply could not 
handle it any more.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal aid lawyers appear before the judiciary on the most 
serious matters every day, the most serious criminal matters, the 
most serious family issues that come before the courts on the 
questions of custody and access.  They defend people who are 
charged with the most heinous crimes.  The crown prosecutors 
prosecute those crimes to ensure justice is done.  They have not 
had a pay increase. In fact they have had services and incomes 
slashed in the last four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to section 41 in the Judges Act.  I find this most 
interesting especially at this point in time.  There is a section 
which allows and authorizes the court to pay for conference 
allowances, reasonable travel and other expenses actually 
incurred by the judiciary in travelling to conferences.  As I 
have said I do not oppose that.  I think it is important that 
judges attend conferences and that they understand and have an 
opportunity to explore the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in my own province the travel budget for legal aid 
lawyers, and I am sure it is the same for any crown prosecutor, 
to travel to a conference to further educate themselves has been 
cut to the point where they cannot go.  It is impossible.  They 
have been told “We may pay for the registration fee but you pay 
for the travel allowance.  You pay for your accommodations.  You 
clear your schedule and find a lawyer who will cover for you.  If 
you can accomplish all of that, you can go”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understanding the importance of continuing legal education, we 
have made provisions for the judiciary to have their reasonable 
expenses met.  So what are we doing?  We are creating a situation 
where the judiciary sitting on the bench will be even more 
critical of the lawyers who appear before them because the 
lawyers cannot afford to go to the same conferences to be as up 
to date on the law as they should be.  How does that advance the 
interests of justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the money is available for the judiciary, then we have to 
make it available for other programs.  If it is not available for 
the other programs, then it is the wrong time to advance for the 
judiciary a pay increase of the magnitude which we have before 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few other important points to make.  My colleague 
the member for Crowfoot from the Reform Party has raised some 
interesting issues on the question of the supreme court case 
which resulted in the creation of this commission and judicial 
independence.  He and I have discussed the issue before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that we see an increasing role for the judiciary 
at the expense of the supremacy of parliament. I would point out 
that the supremacy of parliament requires checks and balances and 
always has.  The idea that the British parliamentary system is 
one that has always met the needs of its population is one that 
is open to historical scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that on the very issue of universal suffrage, the 
Parliament of England refused to grant universal suffrage time 
after time after time up until the turn of the century.  It was 
the charterists in England who I think first brought before the 
House of Commons in the late 1860s or early 1870s a petition of 
1.6 million names of workers who asked for the right to vote and 
were turned down. They came back a second time with another 
petition and were turned down.  They came back a third time with 
a petition containing I think five million names and were turned 
down.  Had it not been for the labour movement and the 
organization of workers in England and in other countries in 
Europe, the sovereign House of Commons in England would not have 
granted universal suffrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the right to vote and the freedom from discrimination can 
be challenged in the supreme court of this country and other 
courts at the provincial level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had England had that charter of rights and an activist court, 
then the check on the supremacy of parliament may have provided 
for universal suffrage much earlier.  I say that not to say 
parliament should not be supreme, but until we have real and 
radical changes to the way in which we make laws in this country, 
we have to have a check on this very House.  The check has to be 
more than the opposition of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the laws are made in this country is clearly available 
for anyone who wants to read a political science book.  The 
cabinet and 20 people in the front rows of this House determine 
what the law will be.  Let us look at Bill C-37.  They determine 
what the changes are to be in the legislation.  It is presented 
to the House.  There is an airing of different views.  It is 
presented to committee and committee at times can make 
recommendations and amendments. Realistically at the end of the 
day the majority of the government members because of party 
discipline will vote in favour of the legislation.  The 
opposition members may vote against it, but the legislation will 
pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask ourselves where is the check on the supreme power of 
parliament?  The check is not in the Senate.  I found it 
interesting to hear the hon. member for Crowfoot mention the 
house of sober second thought where he hopes this bill will be 
examined.  I find it interesting to hear the Reform Party speak 
in favour of the Senate that way.  It will not be realistically 
challenged because the government also has a majority in the 
Senate.  It will not be checked by the governor general.  The 
only check on the power of this House and on the legislation put 
forward by the government is the judiciary.  The judiciary does 
play an important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, because the bill has not gone as far as I would 
like it to, we cannot support it.  I do not want that to be seen 
as casting a bad light on the judiciary.  Given the economic 
times, given the fact that the bill did not go as far as we like, 
and I have not touched on the method of judicial appointment 
which could have been included in this bill and is an important 
factor, but given those situations and given the fact that my 
time is running out, I say to the House that we will not be 
supporting the legislation because it is a missed opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member says he cannot support this 
particular bill.  I find that quite disappointing given the fact 
that it goes very far in ensuring that judicial independence and 
impartiality.  They are critical to public confidence in the 
judiciary and by extension to our justice system and are enhanced 
by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of judges pensions is very important. Anyone who 
has looked into the whole issue of judicial impartiality and 
independence would know that their financial independence is a 
very crucial issue to being able to act independently, being able 
to act with impartiality and not having to worry about financial 
considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it rather disappointing that the member does not 
support this bill because of the whole issue of the adjustments 
of the judges salaries.  Those salaries need to be brought in 
line with today's world.  This legislation goes a significant way 
in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the fact that he has debated this issue for 
quite a few minutes now, I do not understand why he cannot 
support this bill given the fact that it does go a long way to 
ensuring public confidence in our justice system by ensuring 
financial independence of the judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to talk about the issue of the unified family 
courts which is very important as well.  We know that there are 
barriers to women in the legal profession to gain access to our 
judiciary precisely because of what I would call our archaic 
rules and conditions for judges pensions.  I do not know if the 
government would call it that, but I would call it that being 
someone who is part of the legal profession. 
Personally I would have a very difficult time if anyone had ever 
considered me to be qualified to be a judge to accept an 
appointment because of those archaic rules simply on the issue of 
the pensions and not even talking about the issue of the 
salaries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear a little bit more from the member on that. 
I am trying to understand your opposition to this legislation. 
The NDP is a party that is known or prides itself, justly or 
unjustly, on being for social justice, on ensuring that all 
segments of our society receive adequate justice in all spheres, 
especially social justice, as does this government.  I would like 
to hear a little bit more from you on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just before the hon. 
member for Sydney—Victoria responds, may I remind all hon. 
members to please address each other through the Chair so as to 
not allow the Chair to feel left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize most 
sincerely and humbly.  I would never want you to feel left out. 
You are an integral part of this entire process and a necessary 
part of this process.  I apologize most humbly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Actually it is the 
Chair that is the integral part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  That is simply one member's opinion.  I would like that 
on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her questions. I think she raises some good points. I want to 
address as many of them as I can in the time allotted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one I would talk about is salaries and the issue of 
pensions for women and the lack of women judiciary in the 
country.  This is an important issue.  As a practising lawyer 
married to my spouse who is a practising lawyer at Nova Scotia 
legal aid, I say to the member that if she thinks that the rules 
for pensions are arcane for the judiciary, she should see what 
some of pension plans for the legal aid lawyers or crown 
prosecutors look like. In some cases they are a substantial bar 
to appointing women to the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go beyond that and this ties into the next point the 
member made and that is public confidence in the judiciary. I 
believe the member would concur with me that the reality is that 
part of the reason we do not have as many women on the bench or 
that we do not have as representative a bench as we should have 
is that the appointment of the judiciary in this country has for 
a long time been a reward for political favouritism.  That is the 
reality and we may as well say it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go through the annals and point to the members of the 
judiciary who have been appointed not because they were the best 
lawyers or because they had the best minds, but because they 
collected enough money for the right political party at the time. 
That is a historical reality we have to correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about public opinion and public confidence in the 
courts it is not enough until we amend the way the judiciary is 
appointed.  I agree with the Minister of Justice in that I am not 
in favour of an elected judiciary in this country but the kind of 
method of appointment that there is south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say there was a missed opportunity, at the same time I 
think we could have looked at ways of improving the methodology 
of the appointment of the judiciary to take into account the 
needs of women lawyers and minorities and to ensure that the 
bench was better represented and that the public had confidence 
in the method of appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with political appointees is that even if the 
appointee has been involved in politics and would be a good 
judge, and there are some of those, they wear the disrespect of 
those who everybody in small communities particularly know climb 
their way to the judiciary because of political favouritism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has asked for clarification on the reason I do 
not support the bill.  First of all on just those narrow issues, 
it does not go far enough to help public confidence in the 
judiciary. 
It does not go far enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that the NDP has always been a party that is proud to 
ensure that people are properly compensated.  That is why I 
belong to it. At a time when the government has told us all and 
sent a message across the country that we cannot afford some of 
the essential things that we as Canadians have always believed 
were important, to turn around now and say that we have money to 
increase judiciary salaries by 8% or 13% and not provide money 
for legal aid and not provide more money for the crown 
prosecutors is why I cannot support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the beginning I do not mind the judges making money so 
long as every other service is increased proportionately or more 
so where the need is greatest.  That has always been our strength 
as a party in terms of social justice, in terms of making sure 
that the resources are fairly distributed.  Because they are not 
we cannot support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House and speak today on 
this bill as well.  It is always an honour to follow the hon. 
member for Sydney—Victoria who pointed out that he and I did 
partake in a protest of sorts in Nova Scotia some time ago. 
Although I am not prepared to proclaim complete solidarity with 
the hon. member on political grounds, I guess it is not only 
politics but professions and personal contacts that sometimes 
make strange bedfellows as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning my attention now to the legislation before the House, it 
is a piece of legislation that we have seen has invoked a great 
deal of passion and a great deal of provocative commentary within 
the House of Commons and to some extent a great deal of righteous 
indignation on the part of some.  Much of that I think arises 
from the issue of the salary increase itself and the fact that 
judges, as a result of this legislation, will be receiving a 
significant increase in remuneration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important as well to focus on the role of judges 
and the important task they are charged to perform. Although Bill 
C-37 does address a lot of other issues such as the commission of 
salaries and benefits and unified family courts, I think we have 
to put the salary question in perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had an opportunity throughout today's debate and earlier 
to talk about the important question of the separation of powers 
in our society.  I indicated in earlier remarks and reiterate 
that judicial independence is definitely the cornerstone of our 
democracy.  There is no question that we in parliament may not 
always agree with what the courts decide, and there are numerous 
examples I can think of.  The most recent perhaps is the Feeney 
decision.  Parliament has since come to grips with that issue. 
The broader issue is that there is another body out there, a 
check on what takes place in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This body is armed with the charter. The charter has been the 
subject of much debate in recent years. Parliament once elected, 
and the important difference being the election of the members of 
parliament as opposed to the appointment of judges, can at times 
be heavy handed.  Majority governments in particular have a 
tendency after several years in power or successive mandates to 
perhaps embark on heavy handed measures which the judiciary may 
be called on to check.  I think that is a very important balance 
that has to be struck. It cannot be stated often enough or with 
enough vehemence the importance of having our judiciary 
independent of the elected body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, 1997 the Supreme Court of Canada released a key 
decision that related to the constitutional requirements of 
financial security of judges.  That decision reinforced the 
principle of judicial independence and it outlined broad 
constitutional requirements for the determination of judicial 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of an independent, objective and effective 
commission is what makes recommendations on aspects of judicial 
compensation, salaries and benefits possible.  This arm's length 
body, independent of the judiciary, independent of parliament, I 
think is an important step that this piece of legislation does 
bring about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be independent, commission members must be appointed for a 
fixed term and the judiciary must nominate one of the members, 
and to be objective the commission must also use objective 
criteria to come to its decisions.  To be effective, the 
government must deal with the recommendations of the commission 
with due diligence and reasonable dispatch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 creates a body that will in effect set up a commission 
for any future changes with respect to remuneration.  I will be 
the first to admit that timing in life seems to be everything and 
the timing of this bill is something that does lead to questions 
from the opposition, questions from the governing side as well, 
as to why this piece of legislation is coming through when it is 
coming through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perception out there among the Canadian population may be is 
this a priority, is this something that should be happening now. 
Without casting aspersion on the bill, I do cast aspersion on the 
decision making and the priority setting of this government in 
the timing of this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments brought about by Bill C-37 that will, 
following the supreme court decision, improve the independence 
and objectivity and effectiveness of salary and benefit 
remuneration process must be viewed in a positive light.  Bill 
C-37 will also implement the Scott commission's recommendations. 
The Scott commission recommended that judges' salaries be 
gradually increased from 8.3% from the date which the salary 
freeze was lifted, April 1, 1997, and bring about a gradual 
process rather than a lump sum process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the supreme court decision in Beauregard: “Canadian judges 
are Canadian citizens and must bear their fair share of financial 
burden of administering the country”.  Although judges' salaries 
will be increased as a result of this piece of legislation, they 
will obviously be in a tax bracket which will see a significant 
portion of that salary returned to government, as all Canadians 
in their various tax brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly share the view echoed in the recent supreme court 
decision that judicial compensation is a necessary thing when it 
comes to placing the importance and the significance of the role 
judges play.  I quote from that decision again: “Nothing could 
be more damaging for the reputation of the judiciary and the 
administration of justice than a perception that judges are not 
shouldering their share of the burden in difficult economic 
times”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing is always questionable. That is perhaps what has led 
to some of the animosity about when this salary increase is going 
to be effective.  We cannot blind ourselves to the fact that the 
important role of judges leads to the necessity for making this 
an attractive job financially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been discussed at the justice committee and it has been 
raised here in debate that if we are to have individuals willing 
to give up the practice of law and become appointed and take on 
that task, there has to be compensation that is at least 
attractive enough to, in some cases I suggest, result in a pay 
cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that what we are talking about here is a salary in excess 
of $100,000, which is certainly a great deal of money when one 
considers the average salary of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In to Toronto as opposed to New Glasgow, Nova Scotia there is a 
difference in the salary range. But the suggestion is if we are 
to have the best and the brightest leave the practice of law and 
take on the role of a judge, we have to be able to compensate 
them in a fair way that is at least going to be on par or perhaps 
in the ballpark of what they were making in private practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In deciding what was reasonable, the Scott commission recognized 
that a complex range of factors had to be considered in 
establishing an appropriate level of remuneration and that 
included the need to ensure that levels of compensation did 
attract the most qualified candidates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings in the standing committee I asked on 
numerous occasions of different witnesses appearing on this issue 
if salary was an important factor for lawyers in the decision to 
accept or refuse a judicial appointment.  Each and every time, 
sometimes reluctantly, the answer was yes.  It was an important 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can no longer let qualified and excellent private 
practitioners refuse judicial appointments due to salary alone. 
If we need to improve the quality of our tribunals and judicial 
appointments, and certainly this is something we want and strive 
to do, I believe we cannot simply ignore that salary and 
compensation is an important factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Salaries may very well be one factor but certainly the quality 
and the process in making those selections is equally important. 
Although it is somewhat off the topic of this bill, certainly 
what we want to do is ensure that we do have a process in place 
that enables input from the various levels of society that are 
going to be most affected by judicial appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep in mind some of the comments made by previous speakers 
about judges.  I am troubled with the perception the Reform Party 
would leave with the Canadian public on the issue.  I am not here 
to say that all judges are infallible and that decisions are not 
sometimes bizarre and difficult to understand and stretch the 
bounds of comprehension.  That is one of the human qualities 
every judge has.  We in this House have bad days too.  It happens 
on occasion that a judge makes a terrible decision and that the 
following day with some circumspect and perhaps a different 
outlook he or she may have made a completely different decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need to engage in what I saw taking place during the 
debate on this topic that judges themselves are being personally 
attacked, much in the same way that we see senators personally 
attacked.  It would seem that judges, when they do not 
religiously follow the Reform Party line, can be denounced as 
elites.  They are denounced as undemocratic and they are 
described, quoting the words of the hon. member from Wild Rose on 
March 30, 1998, as greedy little parasitic fraternities that 
exist across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion that goes a long way to further undermine public 
confidence in the judiciary.  It does not add anything to the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A basic respect has to exist and this type of personal scathing 
attack should not occur here or anywhere for that matter.  It 
happens far too often.  I think it bears repeating that this is 
not going to further this debate in any way.  There are always 
those in every profession of whom we will be less than proud but 
judges, like all professions, are for the majority a number of 
hardworking professional and committed people who are in the 
pursuit of justice.  That is what is important.  They do a very 
necessary job and at times a very stressful and morally taxing 
job. We have to try to avoid that type of talk when we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of provincial governments across Canada that 
have already reacted to the supreme court's decision of 
increasing judges' salaries.  In most cases retroactive 
adjustments would also have to be made to remedy previous salary 
cuts and freezes.  For the reasons I have outlined, the 
Conservative Party does not oppose these amendments to the Judges 
Act to increase the salaries by 4.1% for two years, effective 
April 1.  It is proportionate and we believe it is not a bad 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old expression that you get what you pay for does apply in 
this instance.  The bill also provides for new rules in 
establishing an independent commission for the responsibility of 
reviewing salaries and benefits every four years for judges. 
These rules do not ensure in any certain way that the system will 
be perfect. 
However I suggest it goes in the right direction in ensuring that 
it will be equitable and reflect reality in Canadian society.  A 
four year review seems like a reasonable period of time.  The 
Conservative Party of Canada has concerns that we must always 
emphasize there will be changes.  New proposals may arise.  New 
circumstances may come to light.  A four year review process is a 
necessary step.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we must also ensure that the commission will 
be held accountable to parliament and that the process is as 
transparent as possible.  While three members on the commission 
is a good idea, there will be an appointment by the Minister of 
Justice, another from the judiciary and the third one by the 
first two appointees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One suggestion would be that perhaps the third person should be 
selected from the bar society.  I believe it was the hon. member 
for Sydney—Victoria that made the suggestion.  It is a good 
suggestion and one that we would support.  It would approve 
accountability and transparency.  Another suggestion might be 
that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights have a 
hand in making that appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for a commission that would report every four 
years.  The report would be presented by the Minister of Justice 
who in return would bring it to the House and table it here. This 
improves accountability.  It improves input and the process 
itself is elevated as a result.  It is certainly a way of doing 
what the government often talks about and that is having more 
transparency.  I question whether that is happening to the extent 
that it could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another suggestion would be that the commission could be held 
accountable directly to parliament.  Like the human rights 
commission which reports directly to the House of Commons and not 
through the minister, this commission could report directly to 
the House and therefore be held more accountable.  It would also 
allow the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to 
review the report in a more significant way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, with respect to this element of the bill and these 
amendments pertaining to salary, we see them as positive 
improvements that perhaps could have been brought about in a 
different way.  The timing could have been different, but I 
believe it is the beginning of a recognition that in the justice 
system there is a need for more resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not disagree with the suggestion about other segments of 
the justice system like legal aid and crown prosecutors who are 
presently toiling in Nova Scotia under less than ideal 
conditions.  There is a need to improve the situation of 
frontline police officers.  There is a need to have more 
children's aid societies and more programs aimed at preventing 
crime.  However I believe this is a start.  Perhaps it is the top 
end when it comes to judges but it is a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a very important segment of Bill C-37 which deals 
with the unified family court.  Bill C-37 supports the creation 
and expansion of the unified family court across the country. The 
Conservative Party supports the model of a unified family court 
in part because it allows one judge to resolve all family court 
issues: issues relating to separation, divorce and custody 
access.  This reduces complexity and delay when its comes to the 
court.  This is a problem that many encounter in the court system 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would create a system which would ensure that matters are 
presided over by experts in the area, judges who have an 
expertise particularly in the area of family matters which can 
become very complex and emotionally driven.  I see it as a 
positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unified family court offers services which include information 
on family law, educational programs on the effects of separation 
on children, home studies, referrals to counselling and other 
community services, information on alternatives to litigation, 
and access to services that include mediation and supervised 
visits to homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are areas that we should be focusing on.  The bill is a 
step toward improving our system in family courts.  Because these 
services would be available under one roof, public access would 
be improved as a result.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective of the children involved, better long term 
plans can be expected from these changes; lower levels of 
conflict; quicker resolutions; greater focus on the impact on 
children; and increased durability of outcomes with emphasis on 
integrated services, an intense approach to child protection, 
child support, custody and access.  All these things are viewed 
positively by the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 will also appoint 27 new federal judges for the 
unified family court in four provinces, eight in the province of 
Nova Scotia.  We welcome these additions.  These amendments will 
permit the governments and the provinces to improve legal 
services available to families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the pension itself, Bill C-37 provides for changes to 
the criteria of the supreme court that allow retirement with a 
full pension.  Judges will now have to be 65 or older and have to 
accomplish at least 10 years of service on the bench prior to 
their retirement.  The Conservative Party does not have 
difficulty with that change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we are encouraged generally that these amendments 
have been brought about in good faith although we question the 
timing.  We believe there could be other improvements as they 
pertain to the accountability and transparency of the salary and 
benefits commission.  As a whole we support the bill.  We are 
ready to support it because we believe it is a good thing.  The 
bill will bring about some of the changes that we have had the 
opportunity to discuss.  We are thankful for the opportunity to 
do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his excellent remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bill comes before parliament that deals with the 
remuneration of public figures it serves the very useful purpose 
of giving us the opportunity to examine the roles of those public 
figures.  It is very much in the public interest that we do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member alluded to some of the earlier debates on the bill 
and mentioned that the Reform Party had made some disparaging 
remarks about the behaviour of judges and their quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw to his attention that this attitude of questioning the 
discretion of judges is not something that is exclusive to the 
Reform Party.  It is a very worrisome trend that exists generally 
in society today, on this side of the House and in the justice 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is how far we go in giving discretion to judges.  As 
the member mentioned, the law and the interpretation of the law 
and the issues it deals with are very human issues. Traditionally 
in common law we have relied on the judges to use their good 
judgment, their experience of life and their compassion to 
interpret the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there seems to have been a very alarming trend 
over recent years to withdraw some of the discretionary powers of 
judges.  A perfect example is the whole concept of minimum 
sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is question and comment period.  I was hoping to offer the 
member some comments which I think are very important and 
directly arise from his remarks.  A number of private members' 
bills were before the House in the previous sitting that dealt 
with minimum sentences for drunk driving.  We had quite a sharp 
debate here and I spoke on that occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that while we want to protect victims rights and 
that kind of thing we must allow the judges compassion to deal 
with cases in which perhaps even no sentence at all or no jail 
term at all is appropriate because sometimes there are rare 
instances like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member's benefit I refer to another bill that passed 
through the House in the last parliament, Bill C-46, the access 
to records legislation.  It is now before the supreme court on a 
challenge.  I do not want to refer to the charter challenge that 
Bill C-46 is now encountering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was relevant in that bill was that it limited the 
discretion of judges to request the records of therapists in 
sexual assault cases.  Judges already had the power to hear from 
the accused, to look at the records and to determine whether the 
records were relevant. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-46 seriously curtailed the judge's discretion to seek 
records by citing certain conditions the judge would have to take 
into account before he could request those records from 
therapists on behalf of the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of restriction on a judge's ability to interpret the 
law and to act equally on the side of the person making the 
accusation and more important the defendant causes some concern. 
We must never hobble a judge's discretion to use his discretion. 
I feel there is an alarming trend particularly in victims rights 
cases and cases involving sexual assault, drunk driving and 
alimony.  These are areas in which the opportunities for judges 
to exercise discretion were limited by bills in the last 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on that?  I believe it is a very 
serious problem to restrict the opportunity of judges to do their 
job.  One reason we want to pay judges well is to get the most 
talented individuals possible who will exercise the best 
discretion possible.  We must give those judges that discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his commentary.  His remarks reflect a great deal of insight 
into this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of mandatory minimum sentences which 
he raised, I tend to agree that judges need to exercise 
discretion.  That is what they do.  They exercise discretion 
daily.  The scope, breadth and effect of decisions are sometimes 
staggering.  The effect they can have on the everyday lives of 
Canadians and of those affected can be very far reaching. However 
there is a time and place for some limitations on that and those 
would be imposed by mandatory minimum sentences in the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that increasing victims rights does not 
necessarily mean decreasing the right of the accused to be 
presumed innocent.  I do not think it is necessarily a 
proportionate counter to say that any increase in victims rights 
will result in a decrease in the rights of the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use as an example the discretion of a judge to use conditional 
sentences in the area of serious sexual assaults or crimes of 
violence.  There is a need for parliament in that instance to 
place some restrictions on the discretion of a judge to use a 
conditional sentence for those types of crime.  I do not think 
that was the intent of parliament when conditional sentences were 
introduced into the Criminal Code.  As is the case with the law, 
a growing tree moves in different directions.  I believe that 
provision of the code has been misinterpreted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impaired driving legislation was another example that was cited 
by the hon. member.  Once again I believe there is a need for 
changes to the provisions of the Criminal Code as they pertain to 
impaired driving.  There is a need to improve the level of 
accountability that impaired drivers suffer to their peril when 
they decide to get behind the steering wheel of a car and 
potentially put people's lives in jeopardy.  If that means upping 
the ante or improving the provisions of the Criminal Code for 
sentencing I would encourage those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also spoke of the discretion judges can exercise in ordering 
therapy or mandatory treatment for offenders.  That is something 
we should be encouraging, not trying to limit by imposing 
mandatory use of those provisions in the sentencing provisions of 
the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly a need for more discussion in this area.  I 
look forward, as I am sure the hon. member does, to trying to 
improve our justice system and working diligently in that 
direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, over the last few weeks it has occurred to me that the 
record of debate on this bill is less fulsome than perhaps it 
should be. There are some issues that I think should be outlined 
for the record for Canadians and for that other class of citizens 
we do not see too much in the political arena, the judges.  Yes, 
they are all citizens and generally all active civic 
participants.  They care a great deal about what happens in our 
communities, in our courts, in our parliaments and in our 
legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of their handicaps as a group is precisely that we in our 
society legally and in many other ways set judges aside because 
we want them to be and appear to be impartial.  We want them to 
be wise and experienced and to bring that with them to the bench 
when they are appointed. But after they get to the bench they are 
relatively pigeon-holed, set aside, relatively secluded and 
unable to generally engage in public debate or in community or 
political discourse which is the source of the problem that 
originally gave rise to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in 
the Beauregard case and one other court application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not a decision that changed the course of Canadian 
history but I believe it could be called a landmark because for 
the first time the court set down what it believed was the proper 
constitutional framework for the other parts of government in 
Canada to deal with the judiciary as an administrative wing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians all realize our judges are paid from the public purse. 
Somewhere in the public service in Ottawa and in each of the 
provincial capitals cheques are cranked out, as they are for all 
public servants, and judges are paid an amount.  However, judges 
do not have a union or a collective agreement.  I think there was 
some reference earlier today to crown attorneys in the province 
of Nova Scotia walking a picket line.  Judges do not walk picket 
lines either, at least the last time I looked, and they do not do 
it for the reasons I outlined earlier, which is that legally and 
socially our judges are asked to set themselves aside and 
maintain their impartiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That impartiality is a two sided coin.  What happened over the 
last few years were a few occasions of governments, not 
necessarily legislatures but administrative governments, making 
changes to the levels of compensation of judges in various 
provinces.  Some of the judges in these provinces took exception 
to the process that was used.  When they did, which they could 
not do publicly, there was a disagreement over who was in charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judges maintained the position that stated there should be a 
continuing and ongoing process so that everyone, the judges, the 
governments and the legislatures, will know what the process is 
for dealing with matters of compensation, pay and benefits and 
working conditions of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada has given guidance to all 
governments in Canada, including the Government of Canada, and 
guidance to the parliaments and legislatures in Canada as to what 
this process should be.  I do not see how any Canadian or 
parliamentarian in the House could object to their being a 
process that was in place and continued to operate for that 
purpose.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was important that the supreme court do that because 
governments are prone to do from time to time, and we in this 
House on both sides know about this phenomenon, taking their 
piece of the power pie and using it the way they feel is best 
with or without the guidance of legislatures and parliaments, in 
this case perhaps without the consultation with the judicial 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That process is in place. We have to keep in mind that our 
judges do not have an outlet, a mechanism, an ombudsman, a method 
of dealing with the issues that deal with the administration of 
their pay and benefits.  The court has said there must be a 
process. That process in part involves what previously was a 
three year commission.  Every three years a commission would look 
at the issues of pay and benefits and report back to the 
respective government.  In this case it is the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces did not have this mechanism.  Now based on the 
supreme court decision that process will be required to be in 
place.  We in this House have taken advantage of that decision 
and have decided to refine or modify the current process. We do 
have a process for federal judges.  The changes are modest. The 
commission will do its work every four years rather than every 
three years.  There are some fine tuning provisions regarding how 
the individuals on the commission are selected and how they will 
be remunerated for the period of time they spend on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the compelling political issues surrounding the existence 
of a commission and the process has been raised by the member for 
Crowfoot.  He seems to be asking whether parliament must be 
subservient to whatever is in this commission report, whether 
parliament must rubber stamp what is in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to read the supreme court decision which 
is there for our guidance.  It has stated there must be a process 
and the process should not be interfered with by other forces. 
When the commission makes its report it should be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is does a government, does a parliament, does a 
legislature have to adopt comprehensively every element of the 
report.  I do not think that is what the supreme court said.  But 
it certainly did say that if a parliament or a legislature or a 
government were to proceed in a direction other than that which 
was provided for in the report, then it must have good reasons 
that apply to the country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do make reference to the provision of the supreme court 
decision that says judges cannot shield themselves from the 
economic circumstances that other Canadians must endure.  They 
have to shoulder their fair share of what the country is or is 
not into economically.  I am quite sure all judges endorse that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a frustration on the part of some parliamentarians and 
some suggestion perhaps that somehow parliament, because the 
supreme court says we must proceed this way, has lost control. 
This is not the case.  When this measure is voted on, not all 
members of parliament will vote in favour of the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that manifests very clearly that it is not wrong or 
improper to not follow what the report says.  The courts do say, 
and I support this, that if the report is not to be followed the 
reasons should be rational, clear and relate to the circumstances 
that apply to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other underlying themes of this legislation is the 
process by which we set judges' salaries.  I know there is an 
underlying principle and I hope Canadians accept it.  In 
selecting compensation levels for judges our goal is to pay 
amounts that will attract the best and the brightest to the 
judiciary.  I accept that it is not our goal to simply attract 
judges.  We must attract the best available people, the best 
candidates to be judges.  It is difficult to make comparisons 
with other professions such as a surgeon.  We want people who 
would not simply open the owners manual and go through the manual 
as to how one does a heart operation.  We want people who not 
only know the manual and the specs but who are extremely capable, 
intellectually capable, well rounded people who understand all 
the elements that go into judicial decisions and dispute 
resolutions in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make sure we have the best.  To do anything other 
than that is penny wise and pound foolish.  If we pay low amounts 
for judges we run the risk that we will not get the best.  If we 
do not have the best making judicial decisions this will, more 
than anything else, undermine the confidence of Canadians in our 
Canadian judiciary and our justice system.  The judges are the 
focal point of that system.   They are the fulcrum on which the 
whole system turns.  If judges are not good at what they do our 
judicial system will suffer.  We do have a good one in Canada. We 
have one of the best in the world.  People come from all over the 
world to take a look at how we run things in Canada.  We want to 
keep it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must address the level of increase for judges.  The commission 
did its very best to isolate what it felt was the appropriate 
compensation level for judges of the calibre and level that we 
are dealing with in our courts.  Historically, going back 10, 20, 
30 years, there was a benchmark established.  It was a rough 
benchmark.  Some judges thought it was a good idea.  Others did 
not.  We did not have Gallup do a poll with the judges to figure 
these things out.  We have to make these judgments in this House. 
The benchmark was one that set judges' salaries at a level 
equivalent to the level of the civil service category called 
DM-3. I think that means deputy minister three.  It would be the 
third level of deputy minister.  That is one of the highest 
levels of the deputy minister compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years the DM-3 level has gone up.  Judges' 
salaries were frozen back in the early 1990s along with almost 
all other public servants and members of parliament.  There was 
some drift.  Now the DM-3 level of compensation has gone up and 
the compensation level of the judges has stayed.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Scott Commission has addressed this and in its own way has 
pointed out the percentage levels by which we should be 
increasing the judges' salaries to get back to the benchmark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because some judges have rejected the concept of judges being in 
the same category as public servants, I think the Scott 
Commission report did not pay a lot of attention to that direct 
linkage and it looked at other reasons to provide the increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put on the record what the increase is.  It is the 
equivalent, over a two year period, of roughly 4%, plus 4%, plus 
2% relative to the cost of living, plus 2% relative to the cost 
of living.  If this bill is adopted those increases would be the 
ones that would be applicable to judges' salaries and they would 
be retroactive to last year and would move up into 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally I had a problem with the way the Scott Commission 
report was worded.  It might have been interpreted by some to 
suggest that what the judges were doing was simply catching up 
from where they were before the salary freezes were imposed 
across the federal public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis, as a member of parliament, I would have fully 
rejected the proposal.  I am not accepting that judges or anyone 
else in the federal public service should have what has become 
known as “catch up”.  I did not buy it.  Because some of the 
percentage increases I have just referred to were the equivalent 
of the remuneration lost during the period of the salary freezes, 
I was very cautious about the recommendations.  But at the 
justice committee hearings it became clear that what the Scott 
Commission was trying to do was to place judges back in the 
ballpark of the DM-3 level where they have been for many years. 
It was not catch up for the salary lost through the freeze 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am more comfortable with that now.  The only missing item in 
the circumstances at play now is that we need a better 
understanding among parliamentarians of the process that is at 
play so that the next time a commission report comes up it will 
not be necessary for parliamentarians to stand and say “How can 
one court of unelected judges be dictating to Canada's sovereign 
Parliament what it must legislate?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of suggestion reflects a misunderstanding of the 
process recommended by the supreme court.  I do not quite know 
how to bring parliamentarians to a better understanding of that. 
I am sure the supreme court judgement would make boring bedtime 
reading, but I do commend it to those who have an interest in the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least, just to put things in perspective a bit, I 
note that the member for Crowfoot is an active member of the 
justice committee.  His remarks earlier referred to the dollar 
amounts of the increases and how there were still pockets of 
poverty and people in Canada in difficult economic circumstances, 
all of which is true and all of which this House continues to 
recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was indicating that a large dollar amount is involved.  I 
just want to say that if the increases are the equivalent of 
$10,000 or $15,000, the last time I looked at the tax rates there 
is a consolation prize for the taxpayers because about half of 
the increases will come back in income tax deductions from the 
judges' cheques.  That is true for all Canadians, not just 
judges. 
I suppose the point I am making is, let us not be too distracted 
by the numbers and let us make the best decision consistent with 
the supreme court and the needs of our judicial community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I asked a question of an earlier speaker with respect to 
the growing trend in legislation to limit the discretion of 
judges.  The member who just spoke was in the Chamber at that 
time and heard my question.  I wonder if he would like to share 
with us some of his thoughts on this whole question of limiting 
the discretion of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue put forward by the 
hon. member is one that is not amenable to easy debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we give discretion to our judges in dispute 
resolution or resolving issues is because we the lawmakers are 
unable to organize, set out and nail down with precision how 
every dispute should be resolved.  It is simply impossible for 
the House to sit in judgment and settle disputes between citizens 
as the Lord Chancellor of the Exchequer used to do for the king 
or as the king himself used to do centuries ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges are sometimes uncomfortable if the laws do not set out a 
proper framework.  I have often read judgments where judges point 
out that the area they are dealing with is one that should be 
addressed by legislators and structured a bit better to give 
better direction to judges and those who are organizing their 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand we have a group in society which suggests that 
judges have too much discretion, too much power, which, being 
unelected, they should not have.  There are others, and I think I 
am in the second group, who say that if there is too much 
discretion, if we fail to structure it properly in our laws, then 
it is our job to make sure we do it right.  That is an ongoing 
process in society and I think we are doing reasonably well in 
this parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly to Bill C-37, an 
act to amend the Judges Act.  I know we will be breaking for 
votes in several minutes and I will therefore summarize my 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, first of all, to commend the hon. member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River for his thoughtful remarks.  He spent a 
great deal of time and attention on this issue and I share many 
of his concerns about the question of judicial compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish at the outset to associate myself with the remarks 
of my hon. colleague from Crowfoot whom I think eloquently 
expressed the inappropriateness of parliament granting a de facto 
10% compensation increase to members of the federal judiciary 
over the next two years at a time when Canadians have suffered 
from a reduction in their after tax disposable income over the 
past two decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurs to me that parliament's principal obligation is to 
promote the interests of all Canadians and not small groups of 
Canadians.  It seems to me that until all Canadians have seen 
some increase in their disposable income and an increased 
standard of living, we ought not to be using our power to 
increase the disposable after tax income of a particular discrete 
elite in our society such as judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that we are now debating Bill C-37 and 
this afternoon we are going to be very briefly debating Bill 
C-47, which applies to compensation increases for members of this 
House.  One cannot comment on the judges bill without taking note 
of the fact that we will be voting on our own pay increase this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I will not have an opportunity to speak to that 
bill because of a motion that was granted by unanimous consent of 
this place to limit debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Scott commission on the increase in federal judges' salaries 
recommended this 10% increase and the government has taken that 
recommendation in the sense that it has legislated it in Bill 
C-37.  I find it very interesting that there is a double 
standard.  Bill C-47, concerning MPs' compensation, which we will 
be debating and voting on this afternoon, has been brought before 
this place without consideration being given to the report of 
another independent commission, the Blais commission, which was 
established following the last general election to review and 
make recommendations on the compensation paid to 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurs to me that we are creating another double standard. 
Canadians have shrinking disposable incomes because of high taxes 
and we are proposing an increase in pay for judges.  We are also 
creating a double standard when we accept the binding 
recommendations of one commission on compensation, the Scott 
commission, but on the other hand ignore the recommendations of 
the Blais commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very serious problem with this process which I would 
like to put on the record.  I feel that the Blais commission, 
like the Scott commission, did good work and was sincere in its 
recommendations, which I thought were very thoughtful and 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, the commission recommended full transparency 
in MP compensation.  It recommended scrapping the tax free 
expense allowance and replacing it with a proportionate amount of 
taxable income so that MPs alone could no longer exempt 
themselves from the tax laws that we impose on other Canadians. 
It recommended no net increase in actual compensation, contrary 
to the recommendations of the Scott commission for judges, and it 
recommended reform of the members' pension plan.  It also 
recommended an increase in the housing allowance available to 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, I thought these were sensible recommendations 
which respected the need for a single standard of compensation 
for all Canadians.  We ought not to choose one particular group 
of people, in particular ourselves, to exempt ourselves from the 
laws that apply to the rest of Canadians, as we do by exempting 
one-third of our income from the Income Tax Act.  We ought to 
follow the same guideline when it comes to our retirement 
allowances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Scott commission came down with its report, the 
government said “Fine.  Everything is well.  We will go ahead 
without even a review of a parliamentary committee and legislate 
this 10% increase”.  When the Blais commission came down with 
its report, suddenly there was a huge clamour among government 
MPs who said that they rejected its recommendations.  I do not 
suspect all of them did, but certainly some did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote, for instance, the hon. member for Mississauga Centre 
who in the February 9 edition of the <I>The Hill Times</I> said 
with respect to the recommendation of the Blais commission that 
we eliminate the tax free expense allowance and gross up the 
taxable salaries “If we are going to get nailed, at least we 
want to get nailed for a reason and see it in the wallet. Screw 
the Blais report”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that very difficult to swallow, coming from a member of 
the government which legislated the Scott commission report.  We 
did not say, in the words of that hon. member, “Screw the Scott 
commission report”—excuse me, Mr. Speaker, but I am quoting 
another member—but we did with respect to the Blais commission 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put this on the record and say that I object to 
the process by which our own compensation has been handled.  I 
think the process that is contemplated in Bill C-37 is far more 
appropriate, where an independent commission would make the 
decisions and recommendations.  Although I disagree with the 
recommendations of the Scott commission and will vote against the 
bill because of them, I do think that we need to take these 
decisions out of our own hands, particularly where there is a 
conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we will at some point in this place revise the 
manner in which we change our own compensation so that it is an 
arm's length process which will not be compromised by an inherent 
conflict of interest.

Speaker, next week Canadians pay tribute to the tremendous 
contribution of the federal Public Service of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the pain associated with downsizing in recent years, it 
is important during Canada's post-deficit period that we openly 
express the tremendous pride we feel for our public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a crossroads in our history as the role and direction 
of governments around the world are being re-evaluated.  Our 
public service is known as one of the best in the world.  All 
Canadians benefit from the many services it delivers, which makes 
Canada the number one country in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I wish to thank our public servants for their dedicated 
quality service and their commitment to finding better ways to 
improve Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Sunday, June 21, is Father's Day.  It is also the day for 
Canada's first ever run for prostate cancer research in Victoria, 
B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volunteers have been working for months to organize and promote 
this event and have even managed to attract the sponsorship of 
major corporations like CIBC, a company which also supports 
breast cancer research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently very few people were talking about prostate 
cancer even though one man in eight will be struck with the 
disease during his lifetime.  As a result prostate cancer 
research has struggled to attract research funding, just 
one-twentieth of the money going to breast cancer research and 
less than one-hundredth of the money going to AIDS research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for governments to begin distributing their research 
funding in a more equitable manner and to catch up with public 
awareness about prostate cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to the Victoria, B.C., organizers of Canada's 
first ever run for prostate cancer research.  They have overcome 
enormous obstacles to help raise awareness of a very serious 
disease.

recognize the honourable Michael Starr. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mike Starr was born in northern Ontario in 1910.  He served as 
mayor of Oshawa and his other public activities covered three 
pages in his bio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He became minister of labour in 1957 in the Diefenbaker 
government, but, as a I say at home, even the most illustrious 
among us sometimes has a shortcoming.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mike Starr served in a Tory government but his work in 
anti-discrimination and fair labour laws would have qualified him 
to be a Liberal, maybe even NDP.  Now he is an ardent supporter 
of the Reform Party which of course assures that his candidate in 
Oshawa will continue to lose.

I rise today to congratulate a young constituent in my riding of

</I></B></P><P align=left>Saeed Baghbani is just 14 years old but he has already reached 
the pinnacle in the Canadian karate world. In 1997 Saeed became 
the Ontario karate champion and on May 6, 1998 Saeed went on to 
win the gold medal in the Canadian national karate competition. 
Saeed will now go on to represent Canada at the Pan American 
Games which will be held in September 1998 in Argentina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these impressive accomplishments, Saeed has been 
selected as the best athlete for 1997-98 at Wexford Collegiate 
Institute in Scarborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate Saeed on his terrific accomplishments and 
wish him well with the upcoming games in September.  This young 
man represents the great things that our youth can achieve with 
the proper support and encouragement.  It is exactly the 
environment that our government is striving to create for young 
Canadians now and in the next millennium.

need a complete one with equality and effectiveness”.

tension is running very high in the maritimes, the Magdalen

Atlantic groundfish strategy comes to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have been telling the Minister of Human Resources 
Development for months now that things are going badly and that 
a tragedy is in the offing, how is it that we are now one day 
from the end of the session and are still being told that

closely, when nothing concrete has yet been done for the victims 
of these federal government decisions?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

enormously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have met with people from the communities and we know that 
many of them are finding the situation extremely difficult. 
Some people are living with terrible uncertainty.  That is why 
the issue must be handled very carefully.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
rather than speaking through his officials, as the member puts 
it, he should be going to see the people on the Magdalen 
Islands.  Perhaps they will teach him something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister at least give us an undertaking by tomorrow, 
when the session is expected to end, that he will either put in

still wants to keep people in a state of dependency.  Two or 
three years down the road, it will be the same impossible 
situation all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking to the future, and what we are interested in is a 
genuine restructuring, if that is what is required.

very much aware of the fact that these people are facing 
considerable uncertainty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that at stake here is not just 
families' survival, but the preservation of the future of these

that, if he does not help these people, they will have no choice 
but to leave?

want to do in partnership with the provinces—which I hope will 
work with us on this—is to create jobs in these communities so 
that people will have something to do other than wait for the 
fish to return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Atlantic communities must learn to live with a much 
reduced fishing industry, a situation which unfortunately is 
unlikely to change any time soon.  This is why we have to make 
structural changes to the economy.

wanting to keep fishers in a state of dependency because we are 
asking the government to help them.

amend the Parliament of Canada Act, which I had the honour of

Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs which was 
tabled on Wednesday, June 3 in response to the Blais commission 
report on MPs compensation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the commission so aptly put it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An MP is someone who serves the public, and therefore must not

By the same token, no one should be forced to experience 
financial hardship after winning an election. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that compensation and benefits must be reasonable, 
realistic given what is expected from MPs in practical terms, 
and in line with general trends in society—or at least not lag 
too far behind. However, we are seriously lagging in this 
respect.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the chair of the committee, the hon. 
member for Peterborough, and the members of that committee for 
their report.  The report is a reasonable response to a complex 
and even more sensitive issue.  Interestingly, it seems like 
everyone in the media finds this issue to be more important than 
many other areas of government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
to seek the unanimous consent of the House for the second reading 
to be discharged and this bill, an act to amend the Parliament of 
Canada Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and 
the Salaries Act, to be withdrawn as it does not reflect the 
priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is not a point of order, but does the 
hon. member have unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it had been up to now a 
non-partisan response that addresses concern expressed by all 
parties.  This bill is an example of parliament coming together 
to act on what is a sensitive issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of the key provisions of the bill.  It is 
straightforward.  It simply implements the committee's report 
which was adopted by the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two key elements to the bill.  First, an increase of 
2% to the salaries of MPs and senators will come into effect on 
January 1, 1998 and will be payable annually on January 1 for 
the duration of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This increase would apply to the sessional allowance and to all 
other allowances.  It would replace the cost of living 
adjustment, which would have been approximately 1% this year. 
In other words, this amount is not in addition to it, but 
replaces it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 2% increase is modest and it is also reasonable in the context 
of increases in the private sector, parliamentarians in other 
countries and the public service.  I would like to speak to that 
in committee of the whole if some members intend to raise it 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private sector wage settlements were 2.2% in February 1998 and 
recent public service settlements have averaged over 2%.  MPs 
have not had a remuneration increase other than a partial cost of 
living adjustment since 1980, and since 1991 nothing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 the sessional indemnity of a member of the House was 
120% of the average salary of a high school principal.  In 1996 
it was 75% of the salary of a high school principal.  I see some 
former educators who are members of the House and I am sure they 
know all about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 a Canadian MP ranked 9th in a survey of remuneration, 
below Japan, the United States, France, Germany, the U.K., 
Australia, Norway, New Zealand and several other countries.  The 
Blais commission report noted that a Canadian parliamentarian's 
salary in October 1997 was 37% that of a U.S. congressman.  If we 
include the tax free provision it is in the order of 58%. 
Everyone knows that American legislators get a whole number of 
things in addition. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second element of this bill provides that members who chose 
to not participate in the pension plan in the last parliament 
may join within the next 90 days. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those members who choose not to opt back in there would be a 
supplementary severance allowance and I believe that this is 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House who retire at 55 years of age or over and 
who are not entitled to a pension would receive an additional one 
month of remuneration for every year of service up to a maximum 
of 12 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who are under 55 and retire would receive the 
supplementary severance when they turn 55, just like MPs who 
participate in the pension would receive it at age 55.  I also 
believe that this is fair. 
This provision is also very similar to the severance package that 
exists in the Ontario Legislature.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides for a small increase allowance for the 
Speaker of the other place and the Speaker pro tempore in the 
other place. This was recommendation by the Blais commission 
report. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not always be guided solely by what the media have to 
say.  However, you will permit me to read a few quotes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>La Presse</I> said “The average income of MPs is an income many 
professions, middle managers in the private sector, senior 
public officials and unionized employees in certain specialized 
jobs would find ridiculous”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read other quotes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Toronto <I>Star</I>: “It is the right time for a modest 
increase in parliamentary salaries. A 2% a year increase over 
four years is reasonable”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, from <I>La Presse</I> again, and I quote “In the interest of 
democracy, MPs' salaries must be increased”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last July the Blais commission was appointed.  It made its 
report which was tabled last January and which was referred to a 
committee.  The committee reported on June 3.  The House voted on 
the report earlier and now the bill is before us. I commend it to 
all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I seek the unanimous consent of the House to have a recorded 
division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I do apologize to some extent for some of the things being said 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the few times in the House that members will find 
me dedicating a speech.  I have done so on a number of occasions 
where I thought that an individual or individuals have deserved 
such a speech to be dedicated to them.  I therefore dedicate this 
speech to my colleagues in the Reform Party who have had the 
intestinal fortitude to stand up for what they believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is those principled individuals who took it on themselves to 
opt out of the gold plated MP pension plan who got the 
alternative pension placed before the House today.  Tomorrow who 
knows, perhaps we will have convinced all members of the House 
that this alternative, which could be turned into an RRSP type 
plan, will be the only plan in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be sure that we have a clear position on the issue of pay and 
pensions, I want to go through this and make it absolutely clear 
where we are coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great difficulties we have with the legislation 
placed before us is the omnibus characteristics of the bill. 
Having read this final version before me for the first time last 
night, I expressed great concern for the complexities that exist 
within it.  Let me give some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the bill are issues such as numerous adjustments for the 
Senate which are not part of the MP pay and benefits issues. This 
bill contains issues about tax free allowances, about issues of 
pay increases to MPs and a substantial issue to some of us here 
on this side of the House of an alternative pension plan in terms 
of RRSP to the three parties that have opted out of the gold 
plated pension plan.  All these issues are contained in this 
omnibus bill.  It is quite inappropriate that we deal with it all 
in one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these and more in one bill cover three other acts.  It makes 
it extremely difficult for Canadians to determine what MPs are 
for and what they are against.  To make it very clear I am going 
to do the best I can to express our position on each and every 
issue, while at the same time knowing full well that the Reform 
Party may be outvoted on those issues we are against in any 
event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a moment about the incidental expense 
allowance.  It is necessary to give Canadians the confidence that 
all pay and allowances paid to members of parliament are up front 
and clearly visible at all times. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadian payroll income is taxable.  Reform Party MPs feel 
no exception should be made for federal members of parliament. We 
do not support any proposal that will continue to hide taxable 
income.  MPs currently receive a non-taxable allowance of 
$21,400.  There is not reason whatsoever that this should not be 
grossed up and included in the annual salary of $64,800 and 
taxed.  There is no problem at all.  It amounts to the same 
amount of money but then it becomes clearly visible for all to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about MP salaries.  The Blais commission 
report recommended no increase at this time or at least until 
such time as RCMP, military and civil service receive increases. 
Although MPs have not received a pay raise since 1991, we feel 
there is still no great rush for this.  We agreed with the Blais 
commission report that raises are not necessary now and we have 
no particular desire to change our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Higher priorities, such as an alternative MP pension plan, have 
more merit and would positively affect all Canadians through 
lower taxpayer paid pension costs. Therefore we cannot support a 
proposal with a pay increase; $64,800 plus a non-taxable 
incidental expense allowance of $21,400 is not considered a low 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will spend a bit of time on this because, as most people know 
in Canada, it is a very near and dear issue to us. It must be 
crystal clear that Reform MPs did not ask to have this option put 
into this bill.  We do not support the inclusion of this clause. 
It is ironic that such a clause ends up in legislation.  We know 
there are three parties in this House that did opt out of the 
plan.  It is also ironic that no reporters have been after the 
other parties to find out who is opting in.  It seems they have 
been asking us.  I will address that in a few minutes. I am not 
aware of any Reformers in this caucus to date who have indicated 
precisely to me that they are in.  They have time to think about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been reported that Reform is opting in.  Such comments 
have been made by groups like the national citizens coalition.  I 
wonder about things like bias, prejudice, poor reporting or other 
political machines trying to take the heat off themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to influence all my colleagues about the current MP 
pension plan.  I have had a fair bit of experience in designing 
pension plans. This is truly the most convoluted, inequitable, 
unreasonable plan of its kind in North America.  Within the plan 
exists separate benefits and rules for 263 of 301 MPs elected 
prior to 1993.  It also includes rules for MPs elected after 
1993.  There are rules for people who have opted out, for members 
who leave the House of Commons after six years who are younger 
than 55, and members who have been elected twice but who have 
broken service periods.  The plan for 263 people is so convoluted 
it escapes any rational actuarial assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year alone $584,000 had to go into this plan to keep it 
viable.  The contributions MPs make, excluding those who have 
opted out, amounts to 9% of payroll.  Yet the government 
contributes a whopping 37.5%.  Meanwhile those 38 remaining 
Reform MPs who have opted out receive no pension whatsoever and 
to date have saved the Canadian taxpayers $3.5 million, for which 
I applaud my colleagues.  All these situations clearly reflect 
that government is continuing to allow such convoluted conditions 
to exist.  Any actuary in this country would agree that it cannot 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We constantly ask ourselves why the media and a few other 
Canadians out there want Reformers to expose some form of 
weakness and not back in rather than go to those who are already 
in asking why they will not opt out. Reform MPs have been 
negotiating for an alternative pension plan for a long time. This 
has been a long term plan and is in line with our party's 
longstanding policy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to quote that policy to the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the provision of pensions for MPs only 
if those pensions are no more generous than private sector norms 
and meet all requirements for a registered plan under the Income 
Tax Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a longstanding policy, but it is so rational that most 
private sector employers say “What else is there?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now apparent that perhaps other MPs in this House reject 
the position of not abandoning the rich MP pension plan for an 
alternative RRSP type payout.  I do not think that is because 
they think it is right, but because an alternative pension plan 
would establish a reasonable, responsible precedent for all MPs. 
The Canadian public would expect MPs then to enroll in the new, 
more reasonable, alternative plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just see for a moment what Reformers established in this 
omnibus bill as far as an alternative pension.  It may be called 
a severance pay, but in effect it amounts to approximately $6,067 
per year given to a member to purchase an RRSP.  This is well 
within the tax limits of the Income Tax Act and is fairly common 
in private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleagues and I had not opted out of the MP pension plan 
there would have been no changes in 1994 which resulted in a 20% 
decrease in contributions.  If we do not establish this beachhead 
for an alternative, then there will be no goal posts established 
so that we can encourage those in the old plan to feel 
comfortable with an eventual RRSP alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me compare this alternative plan to a similar plan recently 
designed for members of the legislature in British Columbia.  In 
the plan which is before us today is a deferred payment amount 
approximately equal to $6,067 per year, which is the employer's 
share of an RRSP in effect, which our members would have to 
purchase.  I provided a calculation in my notes, but I will not 
go through it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of this could be taxable to members of this House.  The 
employee, or the member in this case, would match this if they 
wanted the maximum allowable limit in an RRSP.  So we would have 
an employer's portion and an employee's portion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be called a severance, but it is clearly the 
alternative pension plan we have insisted upon since 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my colleagues in obtaining what they were looking 
for in the first place.  I also congratulate them for having the 
stamina to stay with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is within the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look for a moment at what B.C. MLAs receive.  The B.C. 
MLAs adopted a citizens panel report in 1997.  That report 
eliminated the gold plated legislative pension plan for MLAs. The 
employer, the B.C. government, matches 9% of the MLA's salary, 
which equates to approximately $7,300 per annum.  This is based 
on a salary of $69,900.  That is approximately $1,000 per year 
more than the alternative plan in Bill C-47. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder why we are committed to retroactively changing 
the MP pension plan when we become government?  I do not think 
so.  In the meantime, 38 Reform MPs have a difficult option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all is considered, this bill will likely pass because we 59 
members in opposition cannot carry the day.  We hope this 
alternative pension plan will encourage all members of this House 
to seriously look at eliminating such flawed legislation as the 
MP pension and rejuvenate the confidence of the Canadian people 
by providing a simple payment for RRSPs which will ultimately 
provide a monthly income upon retirement of approximately $500 
after serving two terms versus $2,200 indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all I have to say regarding the pension.  I think I 
speak for my colleagues when I say that our commitment, our 
resolution to try to change the system does not stop here today, 
it continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk a bit about Senate remuneration.  The Blais 
commission report recommended changes to Senate salaries.  The 
Reform Party will have no part whatsoever in accommodating the 
Senate until such time as that institution takes responsibility 
for itself through Senate elections.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why it is necessary for the House of Commons 
to initiate legislation that provides any remuneration to that 
organization when, in fact, that organization can initiate its 
own through a Senate bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Senate were operating properly and Canadians were 
convinced of its effectiveness, perhaps one way out of the 
difficulties politicians have in legislating increases for 
themselves would be to have the Senate review the House of 
Commons and the House of Commons to review the Senate.  However, 
that is not to be and that is for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally and overall, the 1998 pay pension benefits issue is 
still inequitable.  It still lacks credibility with taxpayers and 
is not supported by Reform Party members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these undesirable changes are implemented by virtue of a 
majority vote, Reform MPs, like all of my colleagues who would 
vote against this, must accept the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is reprehensible, quite frankly, that MPs in the 
first place must vote on increases for themselves.  A better 
process must be put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came to Ottawa.  We opted out of the gold plated pension 
plan.  Most of the 1993 Reform MPs, by the way, have donated 10% 
of their salaries at one time or another.  I only have to look to 
my left to my colleague from Edmonton North to say that we all 
understand the difficulties some have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we been successful?  I do not know.  Things have not 
changed yet, but we are still trying to develop alternative 
pension plans, trying to make do, trying to get the system 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one day my colleagues will look at this pension plan and 
say “Yes, there are other ways of doing it”.  Until then we 
will work toward something better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to address one other issue that has come up 
recently.  Some have asked why there is no standing vote in this 
House.  From my perspective, Canadians will have the Reform 
Party's position from exactly what I said here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Votes on division are commonplace in this institution.  The 
billions of dollars passed on division on Tuesday night are but 
one example of how that system works.  It is not perfect and 
perhaps it needs change.  But then again, I am not government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very important point is that our position is on the record 
for all to see.  I thank those who have listened and those who 
will understand what these dedicated people behind me have tried 
to do over the years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-47 and to explain the Bloc Quebecois' 
position on this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments will deal with five issues related to the bill, 
which, as pointed out in the summary, primarily seeks to 
increase the salaries and allowances payable to 
parliamentarians, to permit members of the House of Commons to 
be again subject to the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act, and to provide for the payment of a 
supplementary severance allowance to members of the House of 
Commons to whom the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act does not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill. First, we oppose the 
2% salary increase. 
Let me be clear. The Bloc feels that the increase is justified. 
There is no doubt in our minds that members of Parliament 
deserve this 2% raise. Considering the quality of their work, 
not to mention the number of hours worked, we are absolutely 
convinced that the increase can be justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also no doubt in our minds that this raise would help 
attract quality candidates to this place. Therefore, why do we 
oppose this 2% increase? There are three basic reasons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT76"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT76"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540
<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we were aware of the pay situation before we came 
here.  We knew what the salary was, what the allowances were, 
what expenditures would be reimbursed, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We accepted those conditions because we were coming here in a 
very specific context.  We knew we were not here for very long. 
Thus we do not feel all that much concerned about changes to the 
working conditions of MPs because, as you know, we hope to no 
longer be MPs because we will have our sovereign Quebec. 
We do, however, plan to be here for as long as the people of 
Quebec wants us to be here defending them, and as long as 
sovereignty has not been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thing that forces us to refuse and oppose the 2% pay 
increase, however, is the situation in Quebec.  Quebec is 
experiencing a great many budget cuts at this time.  There are 
many restrictions of all kinds, and the premier of Quebec has 
called upon everyone to make sacrifices in order to attain zero 
deficit.  He has even asked government employees to accept a 6% 
salary cut.  We therefore feel that we must show solidarity with 
the people of Quebec and we cannot support this call for a 
salary increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the severance allowance, that is an amendment that 
slipped past us during the 35th parliament.  The bill will 
correct this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the reforms made to the MPs pension plan in the last 
parliament, we have in a way created a new category of member, 
those who would be eligible for pension when no longer MPs, who 
have six or more years of service, but the bill we passed in 
1994 calls for them not to collect pensions until age 55.  That 
was an important change made to the act in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all of us are aware, moreover, MPs are not entitled to 
employment insurance.  Let us consider the example of a former 
MP, a 40 year-old father of three, who is eligible for pension at 
age 55.  He has no other job. 
So he will receive a six months' severance package. I think it 
is perfectly legitimate, in most cases, for employers to agree 
with their employees who are leaving their jobs and give them 
conditions like this one, that is, severance pay to enable the 
member to find another job and to try to earn a living, since he 
still has a number of good years ahead of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major change in this bill is the right to rejoin the pension 
fund.  Of course we agree that our colleagues may do so.  The 
surprising part is that anyone was allowed to leave it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have seen throughout my career, whenever a pension is 
provided for a group of workers, no one can join or leave the 
pension fund whenever it suits them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came here.  We knew the conditions.  We knew there was a 
group pension fund. I think the first mistake we made was to 
allow people to leave the pension plan.  That was a mistake, in 
my opinion.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is usual for everyone to have the same pension plan and for 
all MPs to be on the same footing in terms of the plan.  I 
consider that basic justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since in the future it will no longer be possible to leave the 
plan, we are making an excellent decision today in order to 
avoid having undue political pressure force people to leave the 
pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides a special severance allowance for those not 
contributing to the pension plan and not taking advantage of the 
90 days they have to decide whether or not to rejoin the pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, in this country we are very democratic.  We do not 
force our colleagues who opted out of the pension fund in 1994 
to opt back in; we give them 90 days to think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who decide not to contribute to our pension plan—but it is 
very clear that this will be their last chance—will receive, at 
age 55, an amount more or less equivalent to the portion of the 
premium paid by the government to the MPs' pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, members pay half and the government pays the 
other half.  The portion not paid by the government, if the 
member is not contributing to the pension fund, will be paid to 
him or her as a premium at age 55.  There are provisions for 
death or other exceptions, of course but, in principle, payment 
is made when the member turns 55.  What will be the amount of 
this premium?  It will be the equivalent of one month's salary 
for every year worked, up to a maximum of 12 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth point I wish to make, and the second reason for our 
opposition to this bill, involves the Senate.  This bill also 
contains provisions applying to the Senate.  The Bloc Quebecois' 
opposition to the part of the bill dealing with the Senate is 
not intended in any way as a comment on the nature or the 
quality of the work done by those who sit in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opposition is based not on this but on the logic peculiar to 
our political party.  We do not want a Senate.  We want to see 
it abolished.  It would therefore be difficult to endorse any 
measure that would improve working conditions for a group of 
individuals that one sees no need for.  Once again, this is not 
a judgment of the work they do in the other chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sums up briefly what we think are the main features of 
interest in the bill, as well as the two reasons we will be 
voting against it, those being the 2% salary increase and the 
provisions for the other chamber.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will begin by saying that I do not think there is ever a good 
time or comfortable time in which to deal with the kind of 
legislation we are dealing with this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to be here for a number of years and 
I have seen these kinds of issues dealt with before.  I know some 
of the pitfalls that present themselves to members of parliament 
on the occasion of this kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it is an opportunity for us to be overly critical of each 
other.  It is an opportunity for the public to be overly critical 
of us.  It is an opportunity for various forms of temptation, 
various forms of self-righteousness and grandstanding of one kind 
or another. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all need to resist the temptation for the sake of parliament, 
for the sake of our relationships with each other and for the 
sake of not bringing into disrepute the reputation of this place 
or of members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an opportunity for people to misrepresent, sometimes 
deliberately and sometimes unintentionally, what is going on when 
we come to these kinds of deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues in the Reform Party have experienced that 
over the last while. As we have come to this point in time many 
unfair things have been said about them and many things have been 
alleged about them in the media.  I say welcome to the club.  I 
have had all kinds of things alleged about me over the years with 
respect to this issue that have been very unfair, as have members 
of parliament in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only think of the way in which it is often said that 
members of parliament after only six years are entitled to a full 
pension.  Not so.  After six years we are only entitled to 
six-fifteenths times 75% of the average of the best five years. I 
agree that is a pension, but oftentimes if we look in the media 
we get the impression that members get a full pension when they 
leave after six years.  I do not know how many times I have had 
to correct that perception about the MP pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another perception is the tendency on the part of those who are 
critical of the plan to add up everything a member would receive 
from now, at whatever particular age, to age 75 and give the 
impression that somehow an MP would receive this in the form of 
one lump sum or one cheque upon leaving the House of Commons 
instead of annual instalments of about $48,000 in the case of a 
full pension to age 75 and beyond if the member lives beyond 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes there is a great deal of manipulation of facts to 
create an impression that is much more negative than the actual 
facts demand.  If people want to be critics of the current 
pension, I would submit that there are things to be said about it 
which are true.  I am only objecting to the things that are said 
about it which are untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues have had the experience of seeing how 
easily this sort of thing is picked up and run with on the part 
of people whose only agenda, it seems, is to make members of 
parliament or politicians look bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no good time to do this.  On the other hand, given the 
way the system works now, there is no other way to do it except 
for members of parliament to deal with it themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the question of process.  The NDP has 
advocated in the House for years and years that this process be 
taken out of the hands of members of parliament.  The Reform 
Party House leader said this in his speech.  I want him to know 
that we have been saying this for a long time.  We agree but it 
has not been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until it is done we will be in the dilemma in which we find 
ourselves today.  Either nothing will be done or we will do 
things that need to be done.  Some of us will agree with some of 
it and others will disagree with some of it, but all of us will 
feel a bit uncomfortable.  I think we should be lifted out of 
this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to have statutory reviews of MPs pay and 
benefits after every election.  That is not an independent 
review.  I am not saying the members who were appointed were not 
independent minded, but it is within the political class that it 
is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former members of parliament are appointed to review the pay of 
members of parliament.  I do not think that goes far enough in 
terms of establishing both independence and some form of binding 
recommendations that could come forward from the independent 
commission that would be set up if the NDP were to have its way. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  We can set up all the independent commissions we like, but 
if in the end members of parliament have to decide to implement 
or not to implement the independently arrived at recommendations 
we are right back to where we started from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has often happened in the past when people have looked at 
MPs' pay and benefits is that they come back with a 
recommendation that we be paid a heck of a lot more than we are 
being paid.  Then members of parliament have to say, because of 
the sensitivity of the matter, we cannot accept that 
recommendation and we are right back to where we started from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to have some kind of independent review and 
recommendation we need to have what goes with it, a mechanism for 
automatic legislation or implementation of those recommendations 
without it having to come to the floor of the House of Commons 
and without our being put in the position that we are in today 
and every other day that we have to deal with this kind of 
legislation.  That has been the longstanding recommendation of 
the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the details of what we have before us, we are 
not one of those parties which has members who have opted out of 
the pension plan.  Therefore we have no self-interest either 
individually or collectively in either the opting in provision or 
in the supplementary severance.  We support this because we see 
it as an opportunity to address the situation that some of the 
members who have opted out of the plan find themselves in, a 
situation which they can either address through accessing the 
supplementary severance or, if they so choose, opting back into 
the plan.  That is up to individual members and we leave it at 
that.  It did not affect any of our members in any way 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition House leader kept referring to the three parties 
that had opted out of the plan.  I do not think that is quite an 
accurate way to describe it.  No parties opted out of the plan. 
Every party in the House has people in the plan and three parties 
in the House have individual members outside the plan.  The 
Reform Party has more than any other party.  The Liberals and the 
Bloc have a few.   It is not really a question of parties; it is 
a question of individuals in parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to indicate what we are not saying when we indicate 
our concern about the raise.  I would be moved to defend the 
raise against certain kinds of criticisms.  I have been here 
before when I once opposed a raise.  I found myself eventually 
defending it because I was offended by the kinds of criticisms 
offered about parliament, about members of parliament and about 
my colleagues who had supported the raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found myself at that time ending up defending the raise 
because of the unreasonable and vicious kinds of things that were 
said about members of parliament who decided they needed a raise 
after a long period of time in which there had been none, the 
situation we find ourselves in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make clear that our concern about the raise had more 
to do with timing than with substance.  We felt, and I think this 
was reflected to some degree in the Blais report, that if we were 
to get a raise of 2% we would have preferred that it happen after 
everyone else in the public sector had received a raise in that 
range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not an option that is before us today.  We have before 
us the option of dealing with the legislation today.  We do not 
choose when these things will be dealt with.  However that was 
one of the concerns we had and we do have a reasonable hope that 
others in the public sector, as the government House leader said, 
will get a raise in that range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, these are some of the things I wanted to put on 
the record.  We think it should be dealt with in an independent 
and binding way. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We regret that is somehow not able to happen, but it is 
certainly something that we will continue to work for in this 
parliament and in subsequent parliaments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate and pleased 
as well to gain further insight from the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members such as he who have been in this place a long time 
have different perspectives on this issue from a new member of 
parliament.  That is the case with many of the members in the 
Progressive Conservative Party. We are here for the first time, a 
year as of June 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is some important insight to be gained from 
members such as he who have indicated yes on the 2% raise in 
terms of merit, in terms of whether it is deserved.  The hon. 
member has said he would defend that position.  I would agree 
with that and the Progressive Conservative Party takes that 
stance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is an issue of timing.  With respect to that, the 
Progressive Conservative Party has taken the stance that given 
the sustained high level of unemployment in this country, given 
the average salary of the average Canadian, we do not feel this 
is the time to implement such a raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the other element of Bill C-47, the element that 
would pertain mainly to the official opposition, the Reform 
Party, once again when one looks at merit those members should be 
treated no different from any other member of Parliament.  In 
essence we feel they should be welcome back into the pension plan 
in whatever form they choose, whether the severance type of 
arrangement or the regular pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is important that sanctimony be left at the door and 
that it should also be left out of the press releases.  We all 
need to be a little prudent as to what we say not only here on 
the floor but at home in our constituencies.  When I return to 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough I am sure I am going to receive 
questions about this.  Every individual member is going to be 
forced to have a gut check.  They are going to be forced to check 
their conscience and decide what they choose to do if this raise 
is passed through the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at the bigger picture as to what MPs receive in 
terms of remuneration and the work done here, one has to take a 
wider view and see what salaries are paid in other professions, 
doctors, lawyers, professional athletes, professional 
entertainers and heads of corporations.  One has to make a 
comparison in those areas when looking at this increase.  I am 
sure there is going to be a great deal of scrutiny about it in 
the coming days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly an element of sensitivity about Bill C-47, 
but the discussion that has taken place here today and the 
opportunity that members and parties have had to put their 
perspective forward is an important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I indicate that we are not supporting the legislation 
because we cannot pick and choose elements of the bill we want to 
see implemented and what elements we do not want to see 
implemented.  We find ourselves in the position of not supporting 
it wholeheartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political angling and the reality of what is going to occur 
is important.  I hope a lesson was learned in all this.  A lesson 
in process may have been absorbed.  There has been a great deal 
of criticism about a perceived gold plated pension by the Reform 
Party and a great deal of political hay was made out of that 
characterization over the years.  Reformers now find themselves 
in the official opposition status. They have moved forward in 
their political aspirations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but notice in the remarks of the House leader 
of the Reform Party the reference to when they achieve 
government.  Pipe dream is the word that comes to mind.  If the 
Leader of the Opposition chooses to take clothing allowances, 
housing allowances like Stornoway, a car allowance, all those 
things, while in opposition, one can only shudder to think what 
would happen if he were ever to achieve his aspirations of the 
prime minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to engage in partisan remarks but that is on the 
record observation.  Bill C-47 has been brought to the floor and 
I guess the timing is suspect with but a day remaining.  It was a 
government priority to bring this bill forward and that has to be 
questioned in terms of why we would bring this to the House of 
Commons on the day before it closes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We choose not to support the legislation and yet we are going to 
be subject to criticism too because there is no opting out 
provision.  The hypocrisy is there for all to see.  We can choose 
not to support it yet we will be the beneficiaries of it. Those 
will be the glaring remarks in the editorials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no option.  It is a piece of legislation that allows us 
no option but to take the raise.  There should not be different 
levels of members of parliament, those who are receiving a 
certain set pay compared to what other members of parliament 
receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been reference made to what individuals may 
choose to do with that 2% increase accrued over the life of this 
parliament.  I do not think here in the House of Commons or in 
the media is the place to talk about what individual members 
choose to do with it, whether they choose to put a percentage of 
their salary into a certain charity or name those charities. 
That is an individual choice every member is going to be forced 
to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity is there for Canadians to judge for themselves 
as they will and to choose how to react to this and ultimately 
come the general election they will choose to make this a large 
issue or a small issue.  In the grand scheme of things, it is not 
a major issue for most Canadians.  More important issues will 
come to the floor, one would hope, on the national agenda and 
then we can earn our pay, so to speak.  Canadians can then judge 
for themselves what members have earned their pay.  Those results 
will no doubt be seen at the time of the next general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing of this is suspect and it also comes in very close 
proximity to Bill C-37 which would also raise the salaries of 
judges.  I am sure there is an inevitable comparison that will be 
made again between the decision of this government to bring 
forward those types of legislative initiatives so close to the 
end of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Conservative Party all I can say is that we did 
not ask for it and we did not anticipate it.  The members of this 
party did not run with the expectation that we would be receiving 
an increased salary.  We also did not feel it was a priority at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 4.11 p.m., pursuant to order

<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
clause 6, section 9, refers to the interest which would be 
payable or will accrue on the amount of the supplementary 
severance allowance from the time a person becomes entitled to it 
until the time it is paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister to clarify what interest rate would be 
accruing on that entitlement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, initially the clause in question 
was drafted somewhat differently.  It was not clear as to whether 
there was a provision for interest should a person for instance 
who has opted of the pension system leave at age 51.  The person 
would then draw the amount not at 51 but at 55, the same as a 
member of parliament who is contributing to the pension system 
would unless the person is grandfathered into the former system 
and receive benefits at age 55.  Both systems are parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference is the following. A person who receives a pension 
obviously receives it for some time, unless of course they pass 
on before they start receiving the benefits.  In receiving the 
benefits there are adjustment periodically.  Arguably that is a 
form of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of someone who receives the benefit of the 
supplementary severance it was silent in the bill.  For greater 
certainty the words that are there were added and the reference 
is “shall accrue on the amount of the supplementary severance 
allowance from the time the person becomes entitled to it”, in 
other words the day the person ceases to be an MP, “to the time 
it is paid”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does one establish the rate?  I am told that this is the 
normal form, what is referred to as the crown rate.  It is the 
same rate applied if someone has money otherwise owing to him or 
her from the crown. 
For example, it could be an income tax reimbursement that is 
overdue or some other similar benefit.  It is not a higher rate 
of interest, it is almost a nominal one, but one which exists in 
law at the present time and recognized in the form in which it is 
in the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the minister 
could enlighten the House as to what the present crown rate 
would be.  Is he aware of that figure at the moment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, the rate is adjusted 
periodically, but the crown rate I am told, as of very recently, 
possibly even the one which applies today, is 5%.  It is the same 
rate payable by government for other deferred payments.  So 
whatever the rate is for a deferred payment, as I indicated 
earlier, it would be the same.  At the present time it is in the 
area of 5%. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, 
I am wondering if the minister could talk a bit more about the 
severance allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 301 members of the House and it appears that the 
remuneration of many members is different.  It is not a level 
playing field.  It is unequal.  Having the severance allowance, 
or a golden handshake, makes the situation even worse because 
different members of the House of Commons would receive different 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister when he anticipates the government will 
equalize all remuneration for every member of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, when we discuss this 
whole area of a level playing field, it is rather interesting for 
members of parliament because our functions are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It depends on the area of the country in which we pay income 
tax, for instance, or other kinds of charges on our salaries. 
There could be at least 12 different kinds across the country. 
Each one of us generally pays taxes in the province in which we 
live.  I think very few members choose to pay income taxes in 
Ontario if they are not from Ontario, although they could, I 
suppose, if they had two residences, one here and one in their 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that there is an uneven playing field 
at the best of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that when the committee was studying the report that 
was one of the problems involved in the so-called gross up of the 
income of members of parliament.  The Blais commission had 
arrived at a formula that worked something like this.  It assumed 
a rate of gross up to arrive at the same net benefit as people 
living in Ontario with two or three dependants and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if a member lives in a province which has a higher 
tax rate than Ontario, for example, B.C., Newfoundland or Quebec, 
they would have to gross up the salary a larger amount to arrive 
at the same net benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, to illustrate a few complications in that regard, 
some members of parliament already make a different salary than 
others.  Some of us in this Chamber represent very large rural 
ridings.  I think there are 10 or 12 members in that category in 
the Northwest Territories and I believe there is one in British 
Columbia.  I see my colleague across the way nodding.  He is one 
of them.  Those members already make a larger salary. If one was 
to calculate a grossing up amount, that person would 
automatically end up with less salary if the law of averages was 
used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brought the following proposition to the minds of many.  We 
would have had a gross up which, at least in appearance, would 
have been a salary increase, with many members of parliament 
going home with a substantial decrease in income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that was one of the reasons the committee that looked 
into this issue decided that was not a particularly wise way of 
doing it and abandoned that plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said previously, we still have a number of people with 
different incomes.  Right now, for instance, I believe that I pay 
something like $10,000 a year in premiums for the MP pension 
plan.  There are those out there who write articles and 
publications and so on, who insinuate, by their silence and 
sometimes otherwise, that this pension is free.  But my income is 
$10,000 a year less than some other members of this House because 
I opted into the plan.  Naturally, the benefit comes later 
because I get a pension.  The reverse is also true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the various salaries that exist now.  To say that we 
have a condition whereby there will be various levels of income, 
yes that is true.  It is going to be true with several different 
kinds of retirement plans.  But that is true at the moment, even 
before the passage of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Chairman, we are almost there, but not 
quite.  We talked about tax rates in different provinces. 
However, I am specifically referring to clause 6, the severance 
allowance which is being offered.  I am talking about the 
equality offered there in comparison to the MP pension plan 
currently in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my memory serves me correctly, regardless of whether a person 
works for Eaton's or the Bay, in Nova Scotia, in Calgary or 
wherever in this country, they participate in the same pension 
plan.  It is an actuarial requirement.  It is actuarially 
required that every employee participate in the same plan. But in 
the House of Commons there is this inequality that we have 
designed for ourselves, where we have different members paying 
different amounts and receiving different benefits.  It is a very 
small plan.  There are only 301 members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put it to the minister again.  To make it an 
actuarially sound plan, would it not be better to bring in a plan 
by which all members of parliament would receive a pension plan 
that is comparable to the private sector?  At the same time as 
being comparable, it would level the playing field for all 
members of the House of Commons so that we would not have the 
situation where we have 301 members and probably five or six 
different categories of pension benefits available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, if anyone thinks that we 
could have a pension plan which would be the same for every MP 
under any kind of scheme, that is unachievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By definition, the tenure here is different for everybody.  We 
are obviously subject to the democratic rule.  Some members are 
elected at 45 and finish at 55.  We have a colleague in this 
Chamber who was elected for his first term at the age of 69 and 
is now in his second term.  We had a colleague who resigned in 
1993 when he was 82.  We have a colleague in this House right now 
who was elected at age 22 or 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole variety of these things at any time.  This is 
not a conventional employer, nor are we conventional employees. 
That is the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparable to the private sector is an interesting thought. 
What about executives in the private sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have referred to the present plan for members of parliament 
as being generous and gold plated.  However, I do not believe it 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read from page 139 of the Blais commission report which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension plan for Members of Parliament, while appearing to be 
generous, is not necessarily out of line with public and private 
sector plans that recognize the impact of mid-career hire aspects 
of the career path of their senior employees. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from the Blais commission report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing about the plan is that the Chief Actuary of 
Canada, in and around 1990 when there was controversy about the 
plan, published a report in which he talked about assuming an 
equal employer-employee contribution.  That does not exist in any 
public sector plan because we do not vest the money in a 
particular fund.  We do now for the new contributions to CPP that 
this government brought forward, but that is a new beginning in 
that regard.  Other plans are not like that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would argue that the superannuation plan has a second 
component which has that feature.  But generally it does not. 
There is an unfunded liability because the premiums are not 
invested in various schemes that generate interest dividends and 
other forms of income.  That is true of public sector plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 I believe it was, the chief actuary said that he 
believed this plan was just as solvable as one in the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should everyone be in the plan?  Yes.  That is my position. 
When people opted out of the plan two years ago, I remember 
making passionate speeches in this House to my opponents telling 
them they should stay in.  That is what I said at the time and I 
have not changed my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone thinks today that I will accuse them of being 
hypocritical if they decide to opt into the pension plan, no, I 
will not.  I refuse to participate in that dialogue.  I have to 
be consistent with what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I said four years ago that it was wrong to opt out of the 
pension plan, surely I have to say now that it is right to opt 
in.  Otherwise it would not be very logical and I would be 
quickly reminded of that not only by people opposite in this 
House, but also by the media and by the public generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is wrong.  I think it is right.  I said so 
before and I stand by what I said.  I am the first to say that 
what is offered to MPs overall, as the Blais commission report 
recognized, is not onerous. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, dealing with clause 6 of Bill C-47, I was wondering 
about subclause (6) which deals with the eligibility for this new 
supplementary severance allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that under the existing Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act when an MP reaches the age of 
55 they qualify for the MP pension.  In fact, there is a phase-in 
period of one year, from 54 to 55, built into the act.  When they 
qualify for the MP pension, they no longer qualify for the 
standard six-month severance that all members of parliament 
qualify for, regardless of whether they are in or out of the 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. minister could clarify for us, under clause 
6, whether those MPs who are not in the MP pension plan who reach 
age 55 will qualify for the six-month standard severance, plus 
the additional supplementary severance allowance at the time they 
retire, or when they are not re-elected, if they are 55 or over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, here we are getting into 
an area that is a little complicated.  For MPs who are in the 
plan, we had a difficulty.  I am talking about the MPs who are in 
the plan, not the ones who were grandfathered.  An MP who is in 
the plan qualifies for a pension at age 55.  Say that MP was 
defeated at age 52.  Because the MP had six years of service, they 
would be pensionable.  Therefore, they would no longer qualify 
for the severance.  But, of course, the MP did not get a pension 
because he or she was not 55, so they ended up getting neither. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is as a result of the change that we made in the pension 
plan some four years ago to place the threshold at age 55.  At 
that time a companion change should have been made to the 
severance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What there will be now is a phase-out to ensure that someone 
does not resign at age 54 years, 11 months and 29 days in order 
to collect both.  There would be a phase-out for people in the 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an MP ceases to be an MP and is out of the plan—and I 
understand there are some 48 at the present time—the MP in 
question would receive, if the person is less than 55, six months 
severance and, at age 55, the supplementary severance plus the 
interest at the crown rate that I described a moment ago in 
answer to a question from the member for Vancouver North.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that answers that scenario.  I do not know if there 
are any other scenarios possible.  I guess there is always the 
one of the MP, like myself, who is in the plan and has 
contributions at both the old system, the grandfathered one, and 
the new one.  Because I would be collecting a pension right now, 
of course I would not get a severance at all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Chairman, I have a comment and then a question.  In terms of some 
of the concerns that have been raised by my colleagues that there 
is a sort of multilayered pension, I would say that in part this 
is due to the fact that a minority of members of parliament asked 
that there be different provisions.  Those requests were 
respected by the Prime Minister in 1994.  Subsequently when other 
changes were made it was necessary to respect that certain other 
members had been in the old plan for so long that it would have 
been quite unfair to try to fit them in to the new conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not unusual even in the private sector. Looking at a lot 
of major companies that have existed for a long time, there are 
employees who belong to one plan and employees who belong to 
another arrangement of the same plan because they began much 
later than those other employees.  From my own experience, my own 
family in the CNR, there was the 1958 plan and then there was a 
plan that existed before 1958 and I think some changes came after 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think if the record is searched there would be other examples 
in the private sector where this is done, not because people have 
some kind of urge for complexity, but just because as changes 
happen, the welfare of those who have already invested a certain 
period of time in the existing plan has to be respected, 
otherwise they would be treated quite unfairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the government House leader has to do not so 
much with this legislation but with other amendments to the MPs 
pension act that have been sought in the past by my colleague 
from Burnaby—Douglas.  Could the government House leader tell me 
if it is the government's intention, obviously not today and not 
in the context of this legislation but at some other point, to 
bring in legislation that would respect the decision taken in the 
Rosenberg case and amend the MPs pension allowances act to 
provide for benefits to same sex spouses?  Is it the intention of 
the government to do that at some point or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, there has been at least 
this one court decision, the Rosenberg case that has been 
referred to.  At the moment I am sorry that I do not know whether 
or not it is the intention of the government to appeal this case. 
I do not have knowledge of that at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I should limit my comments to say that certainly it is 
my feeling that any rules that apply eventually in the case of 
civil servants generally in regard to survivors benefits should 
be at least in principle similar when applied to members of 
parliament.  I believe for instance the rules we use now for 
spouse and so on for the members of parliament plan is identical 
or a mirror image of the ones utilized in the public service. 
Thinking of it rationally, if there are changes in the future, my 
belief is that they should respect the fact that whatever rules 
apply in regard to survivors benefits in the public service 
generally should equally apply to this particular plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I want to confirm an issue 
that my colleague brought up here on the severance. 
If an individual who is 60 years old had opted out of the plan 
originally, he would receive six months severance plus one 
additional month's severance for each year of service. I would 
like that confirmed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria L:</B>  Mr. Chairman, that is precisely it. 
If the MP in question had 12 years or more of service, the 
individual would in fact receive 18 months of severance.  The 
supplementary severance, to repeat what I said, is identical as 
far as I know to the one in the Ontario legislature that is in 
existence for its members who have opted out of the pension plan. 
That is basically where the idea came from.  I reason it to be 
very similar. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Chairman, 
the government House leader in response to an earlier question 
said that MPs in the current standard defined benefit plan make 
financial contributions of up to $10,000 a year.  That is true. I 
am one of the people to whom he refers who in the past has 
written articles about this. I have never denied the fact that 
contributions are paid and that they are substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the plan as continued through lack of amendment 
in this bill is that it provides benefits much, much greater than 
the contributions.  In fact the benefits paid to an average 
member out of the defined benefit plan are some 3.8 times greater 
than the total average member's contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader also spoke about a recommendation of 
the Blais commission which would have eliminated the provision in 
the Income Tax Act which allows members of parliament to shelter 
a third of their de facto income from taxation.  I think this is 
an outrageous double standard that we impose on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader also said that the committee which 
discussed the report of the Blais commission decided that this 
would be inequitable in terms of its treatment of people in 
different provinces.  I take a rather different view of why the 
Blais commission's recommendations were not adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer in particular to a statement made by the hon. member for 
Mississauga Centre, the government caucus chair, who on February 
9 was quoted by the <I>Hill Times</I> as saying with respect to 
the recommendation to gross up the salary and replacement of the 
tax-free expense allowance that “if we are going to get nailed 
at least we want to get nailed for a reason and see it in the 
wallet”.  She furthermore said that the government should 
“screw the Blais report”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. government House leader think that portrays a 
constructive attitude to the report of an independent commission? 
Does he not think that the bill before us today would be more 
credible with the public were it to have reflected the binding 
recommendations of an independent commission?  Does he not in 
other words think that this process should be changed so that it 
is an independent one and that we are not put into a possible 
conflict of interest position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Chairman, I think there are 
basically three questions in there.  The first one is the 
statement that benefits are greater than the contributions.  Of 
course.  It is a pension.  The benefits coming out of the plan 
are by definition and that is true of any pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is different with this case is there is no assumed income 
on the matched employer-employee contributions and that is why it 
is not calculated.  Take the matched employer-employee 
contribution and assume to it a normal form of income and as far 
back as 1990 the chief actuary said it was sound.  But we have to 
make that assumption because most investments do bring in income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the largest owners of shares in banks today are pension 
plans. The Ontario teachers pension plan for instance owns a lot 
of shares of many of the large banks in this country and the 
pension fund is doing quite well.  That is true.  I recognize 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of what an hon. member may or many not have said 
about the Blais commission report, I have not cast stones on 
anyone in this House for any element of what is in this bill, 
across the way to my own colleagues or otherwise.  I will not do 
so. 
I think this package is reasonable overall.  Even if there is 
some provocation, I will not participate in that.  I want to end 
this debate in the tone which I think is right and which I 
believe I have demonstrated through the process.  I will not take 
part in that.

I believe that this issue has been thoroughly debated.

offered to appoint. Ultimately the Prime Minister appoints all 
commissions but I was asked to appoint such a commission 
immediately after I became Minister of State and Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons. 
It was my duty to do so pursuant to the Parliament of Canada Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the people who served on the Blais Commission did a 
very good job.  I thank Commissioner Blais, Dr. Jérôme-Forget and 
Mr. Ray Speaker.  All three of them have worked very hard at 
producing this document.  The bill we have before us today in 
large measure, although not exactly, reflects the recommendations 
they provided to us.  Again I thank them.  I believe they did a 
good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated in speeches in the House before, I have been 
around Parliament Hill for a very long time.  I came here on 
October 25, 1966.  I started from the most junior ranks of this 
place and have had the opportunity of meeting truly great 
Canadians who were called upon by their constituents to serve in 
this place.  I probably had the occasion of meeting more than 
perhaps many in this room.  I have had the opportunity of knowing 
members of parliament both as a staffer looking upon those 
almighty and powerful people who are parliamentarians and as a 
parliamentarian myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And learned the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Yes, I have learned the truth.  We are 
the leaders of the country.  That is the truth and I make no 
apologies for it.  This is a very noble profession and outside of 
being called to represent one's fellow people in religious 
offices it is the highest calling in the land.  This is what I 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. John Diefenbaker, I happen to think, was a great Canadian. 
He was not of my party but a great Canadian nonetheless. I met 
him on many occasions as a staffer on the Hill.  He said it well 
when he said that there was in his view no greater honour and no 
greater privilege, and let us not forget the second part, than to 
serve in the House.  I believe that to be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe the House should be designed and should function 
in such a way as to attract people from all across the country 
and all walks of life.  A doctor should be able to be a MP.  Some 
are.  People from the agricultural community should be MPs.  Some 
are.  People from finance and people from the teaching profession 
should be able to be MPs.  Yes, a busboy in the parliamentary 
restaurant should also aspire some day to be a member of 
parliament, and one did.  As a matter of fact I believe I am the 
only servant of the House of Commons ever to have been elected in 
the history of Canada.  That is okay.  Every Canadian should be 
able to aspire to come here.  That is a principle of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my pet hobbies is the study of history.  The great Reform 
Act of 1832 in Great Britain talked about the shortcomings of 
democracy in Britain at the time.  Let me summarize what the two 
main ones were.  One was that the franchise was too small.  Not 
enough people in Britain had the right to vote.  That was 
undemocratic.  It had to be widened so people could participate. 
A second thing was wrong at the time.  Daniel Patrick O'Connell, 
the liberator of Ireland, had been elected to the British House 
of Commons, the first Roman Catholic ever to get there.  The only 
reason he got there was that he was rich.  No one else could. 
Members of parliament were not paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second element of the great Reform Act that is important to 
me and that I want to bring to the attention of the House is that 
people were demonstrating for their members of parliament to have 
a salary so that people like themselves could serve in the 
highest court of their land, the parliament of their country. 
I am proud that I am able to do that in this country in spite of 
the fact that I am not rich and probably never will be.  I am 
proud of the fact that people who are rich can also be here along 
with me, all of us together.

sometimes we have to take a bit of heat when we go in front of

before the summer recess, I would also like to thank my

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to try to convince my colleagues in the House, those 
on the other side in particular, to have a look at the current MP 
pension plan.  I listened to government House leader who was 
getting a little excited about the fact that he has the right to 
stand and encourage pay raises and that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others in the House have an equal amount of passion in why pay 
raises should not be.  The fact that they are in an omnibus bill 
we have to vote for one thing and another.  They may not like one 
thing that is in there for one party or another and we may 
equally not like some other things.  I think all of us in the 
House understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell members opposite that if they want to heckle I am 
in a good mood for it.  I think they had better keep peace over 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the current MP pension plan.  I would like 
my colleagues to listen for a few minutes about why I believe 
that what has to occur in the House is some form of independent 
actuary or some consulting firm, not a full-blown inquiry but 
some form of assessment of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this is required is that there are about 263 members 
currently involved in the plan.  There are those who were elected 
prior to 1993 who have 5% of their salary each year going into 
the fund.  There were some changes relevant to that plan in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened was at that time in 1994 a number of members from 
all three parties opted out of the plan because they did not like 
it.  Also at that time more changes were made to the plan, that 
is those elected subsequent to 1993 now receive 4% of their 
salary a year, and some other changes.  That gives pre-1993, 
post-1993 and those who have opted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also others in the House—and one of my colleagues is 
involved in that regard—who are elected at this time and had 
been members of parliament at some other time in the past.  They 
have broken service for which basically there has not been any 
arrangements made.  There have to be some rules for that as well. 
That is the fourth kind.  Then there are those MPs who are less 
than age 55, may retire under the post-1993 plan and now are able 
to get a severance.  That is different from the other plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have five situations.  As one of my colleagues said we have 
another situation where we have severance which will ultimately 
end up in an RRSP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a total of 301 people with the most 
convoluted pension plan I have ever seen in my life, and I can 
tell the House I have seen a lot of them.  For the benefit of all 
concerned I am not asking at this point that members opt out of 
the plan.  I am asking that the House consider some kind of 
avenue where a real actuarial firm—no political appointments but 
real people out there—looks at the plan and makes some 
recommendations that maybe everybody can live with: the taxpayer, 
the general public, the average worker, those who have opted out 
and those who want to opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is such a convoluted exercise that something must be done. It 
will not go away.  It is true we have established something here 
today.  For my colleagues to have RRSPs to get them through later 
life is a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the concept that the B.C. government has come up 
with, it is quite similar to what we have designed today except 
that the government says it is taking 9% of the pay and putting 
it into RRSPs and the member contributes equally. That is exactly 
where we are headed.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a natural process to go through.  What we are 
looking at here is an evolution of a pension plan that just got 
under the back side of the taxpayers so much that it forces 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have seen an acceptance by others in this House to 
understand that a pension of some form is needed.  Perhaps with 
the wishes of my colleagues we acknowledge that it is not needed 
to the extent that it is given to some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people have given up dollars out of this.  We accept 
that on this side.  I take exception to the Conservative member 
who took shots at us for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need something reasonable. We do not expect to gorge off the 
public.  If this were just a flash in the pan from 1993, that 
would be different but it is not. Our members who were elected in 
1997 want the plan changed as well.  They are sitting here hoping 
that there is some agreement ultimately to change this plan. 
They are embarrassed by being in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately something has to give.  I think the members of this 
House would be well advised before we turn this into another 
fight again to at least have a look at it.  We are not asking 
them to opt out.  We are asking them to have a look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our position.  That is where we are at.  From here on in 
we hope we look at a government and an institution that look 
after their members in the same way private industry looks after 
its members. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to join with the government House leader in 
thanking the members of the Blais commission for the work they 
did and the report they produced to guide parliamentarians in 
the proposed legislation, which we now have before us, that is, 
Bill C-47. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that my colleague, the member for Rimouski—Mitis, 
expressed very eloquently the Bloc Quebecois' position with 
respect to the bill on MPs' remuneration.  She put the reasons 
very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They boil down to the following two points:  Bloc Quebecois 
members are opposed to the 2% salary increase for MPs and to any 
increase in senators' pay, given our view that the Senate is an 
institution that is already wasting close to $50 million of 
Canadian taxpayers' money.  There is therefore no need to throw 
good money after bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But so that there is no misunderstanding about the Bloc 
Quebecois' position, I would like to refer to an article by 
Pierre Gravel that appeared in the June 8 edition of <I>La Presse</I> 
under a very insidious, in my view, heading: “Pretendin”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this right off as a psychological projection, since Mr. 
Gravel takes the liberty of expressing several opinions on what 
parliamentarians really think, without bothering to find out 
what truly motivates them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc's opposition to this bill is real.  While we agree with 
many of the provisions, there are two we cannot agree with.  My 
colleague made this point earlier very well.  It is not because 
we do not think parliamentarians do not deserve a decent salary 
or a pay increase. 
It is simply that, at the start of our mandate, recently 
elected, knowing the conditions of the position we wanted to 
occupy, it is a bit strange for us to be arranging for such an 
increase.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two quotes from Mr. Gravel: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members, when they sit in opposition, make the pretence of 
opposing an increase, knowing full well that they will get it 
anyway. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concluded by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would better serve their cause by stopping the pretence of 
not wanting it, when they are all dreaming of it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I meant when I talked about psychological 
projection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying, at the beginning of my speech, that this 
opposition is real.  Mr. Gravel's quote, however, refers to 
something else. 
He basically said “They oppose it, knowing full well it will 
apply to everyone”.  The bill before us also allows us to 
correct something we did a few months ago, when we allowed some 
members to withdraw from the MP pension plan and others to 
remain within. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, and logically, when Parliament passes legislation 
concerning the remuneration of MPs, if it passes, it applies to 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find Mr. Gravel's allusion rather insidious. 
In the same vein, he refers to our colleague from Abitibi as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal Guy St-Julien, from Abitibi, refused to cash the cheque 
for a tiny salary increase of under 1% last January, and 
promises to do the same again. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gravel holds our colleague from Abitibi up as a sort of 
model MP, probably forgetting that, on several occasions, our 
colleague from Abitibi exhibited behaviour and actions that were 
somewhat unworthy of this venerable institution in which we sit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, he refers to “this case which at least has the merit 
of consistency”—our colleague from Abitibi with the merit of 
consistency!  Does Mr. Gravel recall that the hon. member for 
Abitibi sat with Brian Mulroney, under the Conservative banner, 
at the time of Meech and Charlottetown, a period of great 
conciliation with Quebec, and now sits under the Liberal banner 
with Jean Chrétien and his plan B, which is all about a hard 
line with Quebec?  As far as consistency is concerned, he could 
find a better example! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference was also made to a minority report by the parties in 
opposition. 
He writes, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a House of Commons committee report recommending improved pay 
for MPs stirred up protest from representatives of the Reform 
Party, the Bloc, the NDP and the Conservative Party. The 
opposition spokespersons deemed it indecent to vote raises like 
this for themselves when what was more important was to “look 
out for Canadians first”, starting with the public servants, 
whose salaries are lagging far behind. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what minority report Mr. Gravel is referring to, 
as far as the Bloc Quebecois is concerned, because the Bloc's 
minority reported stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with its public position on this, the Bloc Quebecois 
is opposed to recommendations 1 and 3 in the report with respect 
to the 2% raise in the parliamentary allowance, the expense 
allowance and the additional special duty allowance for MPs, 
where applicable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over all, then, this is a report I would describe as modest, 
very succinct and to-the-point, very moderate in its wording. 
This does not correspond at all with the impression Mr. Gravel 
has of the Bloc Quebecois position.  He continues by lumping 
together issues such as the 2% increase, the increase from 
$6,000 to $12,000, and so on. 
I repeat that the Bloc Quebecois' opposition applies only to the 
2% increase. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the $6,000 to $12,000, which is not part of the 
legislation before us and which was already approved by the 
Board of Internal Economy, I would point out that the Bloc 
Quebecois did not oppose this increase, because it is normal 
that the housing allowance, which was set some years ago and 
never amended, should be increased at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any enterprise that requires its representatives to travel 
provides a housing allowance and per diems. 
It is entirely normal that parliamentarians be entitled to such 
an allowance and that it be indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for the pension plan. As I said earlier, we agree 
that members who opted out in recent years should now be allowed 
to opt back in under conditions set out in the bill.  We also 
agree with the provision regarding the departure allowance. It 
is well known that the minimum standards for any professional 
job include a departure allowance.  We are therefore in favour 
of this allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply say that, in my view, and with all due respect for 
Mr. Gravel, whom I generally find to be a completely 
professional editorial writer, this editorial was based on 
incomplete and erroneous information. 
I think I have made that clear today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pick up on Mr. Gravel's conclusion, and then I 
will conclude myself with a paraphrase of his introduction.  Is 
there anything more annoying than journalists and editorial 
writers who shed crocodile tears over the bad reputation MPs 
enjoy with the public, when they often contribute to that bad 
reputation through their writing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore invite Mr. Gravel to reflect on this conclusion and 
I also invite parliamentarians to acknowledge that, of course, 
the job needs to be properly paid, not just on its own merits, 
but also in order to attract quality candidates for the good of 
the institution, as has already been said. 
But we must not lose sight of the fact that this increase was 
proposed just after we were elected to this House, that we were 
aware of the conditions when we decided to run in the election, 
and that we felt the salary was quite appropriate at the time. 
Consequently, in our opinion, there is no need to change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be kept in mind, as far as the Bloc Quebecois 
position is concerned, that we feel it is most inappropriate to 
increase the pay of the members of the other place. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the debate this afternoon has been conducted with appropriate the 
tone and in the appropriate manner.  As I said earlier, this is a 
difficult thing.  I wish it did not go with the territory.  I 
wish we could have a process in which these kinds of decisions 
were removed from us.  I do not agree with the government House 
leader that there would be something wrong with taking this out 
of our hands, but that is a legitimate point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say it goes with the territory I am reminded of once 
being in a bookstore and looking through a collection of old 
newspaper stories somebody had put together on the occasion of 
the anniversary of something.  When I was flipping through I 
noticed that in 1905 the headlines read “MPs give 
themselves—”.  So we might take some comfort from the fact 
that plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose and that this has 
always been a matter of some controversy, at least as far back as 
93 years ago and probably before that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say something with respect to something the House 
leader of the official opposition said about the fact that there 
are so many different categories.  I understand his concern but 
if the House leader of the official opposition were to get his 
way surely, and I do not speak against this in principle, there 
would be more categories.  Unless all the people who are in the 
plan now in various stages were to be dealt with in an incredibly 
unfair way, the investment that they have made in the particular 
plans would somehow have to be recognized.  We would then have 
another category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the Reform Party were to form the government and bring 
in its own plan, unless it was going to act in a way that it 
would otherwise condemn in every other aspect of human life it 
would have to take some account of the reality of individuals and 
their participation in the existing plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am saying is that there is no way to escape complexities. 
If an entirely new plan were brought in and you were to 
recognize, as you should in some way, the participation of people 
in the past and in the present in pre-existing plans, you would 
have to wait until everybody in all those other plans died off 
and then presumably you would only have one plan for everyone. 
That would take a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we should be against complexity in principle.  I 
think that where fairness demands complexity then complexity it 
is.  Simplicity in itself is not a virtue when it comes to these 
kinds of things.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-227, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (income deferral from 
forced destruction of livestock or natural disaster), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to present my private 
members' bill.  It would appear it is the last private members' 
bill of this spring session of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is actually quite a simple issue.  It is an attempt to 
correct a strange anomaly in the Income Tax Act. I would have 
real trouble understanding how any members of this House could 
reasonably object to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in recent years Canadians across this country have 
suffered devastating emotional, psychological and financial 
impacts of natural disasters with huge costs and losses of both 
property and peace of mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers who are individuals with the most intimate professional 
and personal ties to the land oftentimes compose the group that 
is most severely affected by these natural disasters.  Over the 
past three years, farmers across the country have suffered 
serious losses due to the disastrous flooding of major river 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extensive national media coverage familiarized most Canadians 
with the Saguenay flood in Quebec and the Red River flood in 
Manitoba.  However, fewer Canadians were aware of the flooding 
that took place in northern Alberta and certainly in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During these periods of flooding my constituency office was 
bombarded with calls from distressed farmers in dire need of 
assistance.  Many have been forced to sell their cattle as they 
were unable to feed them due to destruction of their feed crops. 
These same constituents were concerned that they would be unable 
to make ends meet that year let alone make enough headway to be 
back on their feet by the following year. The constituents' calls 
I received are what gave rise to this bill being discussed here 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would allow farmers to defer for one year all income 
from the sale or destruction of livestock given that the sale was 
necessitated by a shortage of feed due to a natural disaster. 
This bill would also allow farmers to defer income from 
compensation they receive from Agriculture Canada in the case of 
forced destruction of livestock because of infectious disease 
such as anthrax. This deferment of income tax would lessen the 
immediate financial burden on farmers, giving them time to repair 
damage to their farms or to rebuild their stock of farm animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Bill C-227 is non-votable.  However, I am hoping 
that the discussion today will raise awareness in this House of 
the positive changes that could and should be made to aid those 
farmers adversely affected by natural occurrences beyond their 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this bill I am not asking that the government introduce 
an entirely new element to the Income Tax Act.  Currently the act 
does allow for deferment of income from the sale of livestock but 
for some curious reason only in the event of drought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill simply aims to remove the inequity by extending that 
same consideration to all farmers forced to sell or destroy 
livestock due to natural disasters, infection or disease. 
Therefore acceptance of the principles of this bill would simply 
mean recognition of the need to close the gaps in existing 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I am appalled that such gaps were allowed to exist in 
the first place.  Surely if insufficient moisture preventing the 
growth of crops to feed livestock is sufficient reason to defer 
income from the sale of the animals, then excessive moisture that 
destroys the crops needed to feed the animals is also sufficient 
reason to defer income from the sale of animals.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases the farmers are forced to sell their livestock 
because of natural occurrences beyond their control.  In one case 
the natural occurrence is drought, while in the other it is 
flooding.  In both cases the farmers would benefit from income 
tax deferral which would give them time to recover from whatever 
disaster has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the many phone calls I received both during and 
after the northern Alberta floods, I also received an abundance 
of letters.  One letter written by a constituent on behalf of the 
farmers in the Kinuso area detailed the financial minefield faced 
by farmers on flooded lands.  This constituent described their 
situation as a vicious circle of high cost and low returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the northern Alberta floods the vicious circle went 
something like this.  Excessive moisture due to heavy rains and 
excessive flooding drastically reduced the amount of hay that 
farmers were able to bale and what they were able to bale was in 
very poor condition.  If any crop was harvested at all or if any 
hay was baled, it was only enough to supplement the feed that had 
to be brought in from elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time farmers were faced with exorbitantly high prices for 
feed because of the shortage of feed in the area and unusually 
low prices for cattle simply because there was an excess of 
cattle forced onto the market by the forced sell off. The 
constituent's letter describes the situation as a triple whammy: 
no local feed, high prices for imported feed and very low cattle 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers were faced with a situation in which they could not 
afford to feed their livestock, but if they sold it, they would 
receive such low prices that they would not be able to replace 
their livestock for the same price at a later date.  Of course, a 
substantial amount of that income that they received from the 
sale of livestock would then be claimed by the tax man, leaving 
them even less to replace the cattle with in another year after 
the natural disaster had passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the farmers were taxed on the pittance they received for 
the sale of their livestock, the additional financial burden of 
taxation was unbearable to many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All farmers are affected by natural disasters but it is the 
young farmers who are financially destroyed.  Unlike the more 
established farmers, they do not have something to fall back on. 
Oftentimes they have invested all that they have into a small 
farming business, only to see it swept away by some merciless 
flood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately taxing these young farmers on their income from the 
forced sale of livestock is unduly harsh when they do not have a 
financial safety net to fall back on.  The immediate spike of 
income that is generated through the forced sale of livestock in 
many cases makes the same young farmers ineligible for existing 
safety nets that are there for financial disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of this bill would be especially helpful to those 
farmers who are just beginning and who are desperately struggling 
to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hopeful that all members of this House will see the value 
of this bill, although I am uncertain of the response from the 
opposite side of the House, given their horrendous track record 
in regard to meeting western farmers' needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any other economic group in this country were to suffer the 
level of discrimination that the western Canadian farmers have 
had to suffer over the last number of decades in this country, 
there would simply be blood in the streets.  That may be a harsh 
statement, but that is not an exaggeration. One only has to look 
back in Canadian history to the Winnipeg strike or some of the 
protests by the aboriginal community. When other groups found 
themselves backed into a corner, they took drastic action to 
right that wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at the record, the western Canadian farmers 
certainly have suffered some real injustices in this country. If 
we look back at the Crow rate, the subsidized freight rate that 
was introduced in this country, it was not to help the western 
Canadian farmers, but to help the central Canadian feedlot 
operators to move feed grain from the plains of western Canada to 
southern Ontario to feed cattle.  At the same time, the western 
Canadian farmers had to simply turn around and pay the full rate 
for manufactured goods returning west from central Ontario. 
If that is not discrimination I do not know what is.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think of many other examples. We have been debating the 
issue of the Canadian Wheat Board in this House for some months. 
It was not created to benefit the western Canadian farmer.  It 
was created originally to produce wheat to ship to Britain to 
help the war effort.  Western Canadian farmers were again asked 
to contribute billions of dollars to the war effort, more than 
what the manufacturing workers of central Canada were asked to 
contribute.  I could go on and on with different examples where 
that discrimination exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of the unfairness of some of these things the 
government could move quickly to deal with this issue and bring 
some fairness.  I am not terribly optimistic that will happen. In 
conjunction with the issue of the flooding in northern Alberta I 
asked this House through private member's Motion No. 11 to 
provide the same kind of disaster relief for the farmers whose 
property and farms were destroyed in the flooding simply to give 
those farmers the same level of disaster relief that farmers in 
Ontario and Quebec were granted because of the ice storm and the 
flooding.  I think the reaction from the other side of the House 
was an insult.  A simple request for some fairness and equality 
was simply turned down without even a moment's consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion would have guaranteed that the part time farmers who 
intended to become full time farmers but who were forced to seek 
off farm employment to build farm equity financial assistance in 
the event of a natural disaster.  It is unfortunate that after 
the motion was debated, the government quickly and with very 
little thoughtful consideration voted it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I experienced additional disappointment earlier this year when I 
received a phone call from a constituent who was faced with 
extreme financial hardship and simply felt he had no place to 
turn.  Through no fault of his own because of heavy flooding and 
heavy rains over the last couple of years in our part of northern 
Alberta this farmer had been forced to go two consecutive years 
without being able to harvest a crop.  This put the farmer in 
real financial hardship.  He was unable to meet his commitment to 
the Farm Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that under those circumstances a crown 
corporation like the Farm Credit Corporation could show this 
individual some compassion and some consideration.  But no, that 
was not possible.  It simply evicted this man and his family and 
they were out on the street. It is the height of cruelty in such 
a situation to treat him like that after he had faced that kind 
of hardship and psychological bombardment while at the same time 
not two miles away, Alberta Pacific Pulp Mill was unable to meet 
its obligations under a contract with the Alberta government and 
it turned around and negotiated a settlement to forgive some $250 
million worth of interest on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely if this government can afford things like the $1.5 
billion subsidized loan to China to buy Candu reactors or the 
several hundred million dollars in farm aid to Indonesia, it 
should certainly be able to show some compassion for these 
western Canadian farmers who through no fault of their own have 
found themselves in financial trouble.  It simply does not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This individual not only lost his farm but his home.  He was 
dealt with very callously by representatives of the Farm Credit 
Corporation.  In spite of appeals I made to the minister and to 
farm credit head offices, they had no time to look at the 
situation.

those members opposite, to give serious consideration to this 
bill.  Although not votable by choice of the committee 
responsible to make that decision, it is my hope that this 
discussion has highlighted the gaps in the existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also my hope that the government will take advantage of 
this excellent opportunity to pursue greater fairness not only 
for the flood victims in my riding but for all farmers across 
this country forced to sell or destroy livestock as a result of 
disease or natural disaster. 
<P><A NAME="LINK291"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this private member's bill 
endeavours to extend the current one year tax deferral for income 
from forced destruction of livestock to other amounts paid to 
farmers with respect to natural disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Athabasca in proposing this wishes to ease 
the financial burden on farmers whose property is damaged or lost 
through a capricious act of nature.  I applaud my colleague for 
his initiative in this regard.  It is important as we all 
witnessed during the recent ice storm that lives and livelihood 
disrupted by natural emergencies be quickly restored. I also 
agree that governments have a crucial role to play in the 
rebuilding process that follows devastation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out, however, that while I support in 
principle the spirit of this proposed amendment, it is flawed in 
two very important respects.  The proposal before us today is 
inconsistent with existing tax deferral provisions for farmers. 
In addition, the proposal fails from a technical perspective 
because it fully identifies neither the amounts to be deferred 
nor the circumstances whereby deferral would take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Income Tax Act allows farmers to defer for tax purposes 
amounts received with respect to livestock in two important 
circumstances, forced destruction under statutory authority and 
in the case of widespread drought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment attempts to build on the current one year 
tax deferral for income from the forced destruction of farm 
animals.  The government from time to time orders the destruction 
of livestock known or suspected to carry various diseases in 
order to prevent the spread of illness to other animals or 
humans.  Farmers may defer the inclusion in income of amounts 
paid by the government as compensation for the slaughter of 
diseased animals and need only report these amounts in the year 
following the year of animal loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax treatment is proper because the government recognizes 
that the disposal of livestock was involuntary on the farmer's 
part.  In addition, depending on the timing of government action, 
farmers may not have sufficient time to replenish livestock 
before the end of the year.  To maintain tax neutrality affected 
farmers are allowed to defer the proceeds to the next taxation 
year and offset it by deducting the cost of animal replacement as 
it takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The phrase “under statutory authority” in this regard is both 
clear and necessary.  For income deferral to occur the government 
must be responsible for the timing of animal destruction as well 
as for the associated compensation.  Unless these conditions are 
satisfied no special tax treatment is allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment, on the other hand, would extend this 
special tax treatment to amounts paid with respect to a natural 
disaster under statutory authority.  The use of the phrase 
“under statutory authority” in this context is confusing and 
inappropriate.  Unlike the case of diseased livestock, the 
government does not order property destroyed through a natural 
disaster and does not compensate farmers in this regard under 
statutory authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tax deferral is also provided to farmers for livestock sales 
associated with a prolonged drought.  However, for special 
treatment to take place affected farmers must carry on business 
in a prescribed drought region as determined jointly by the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, relief is only extended to farmers whose herd is 
reduced by a specific magnitude throughout a taxation year and 
only a portion of income from the sale of livestock is eligible 
for deferral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conditions were put in place through consultations with 
affected farm groups and agriculture Canada to ensure that relief 
is granted for widespread drought and not for localized cases.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the proposed amendment includes no similar threshold 
even though droughts are also natural disasters.  Thus the 
amendment is inconsistent with the current tax policy in this 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the current income deferral mechanisms are limited to 
livestock only where the proposed amendment is not. The proposal 
therefore represents a fundamental departure from previous policy 
and is not simply an extension of the current provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned that the intent of this amendment providing 
tax relief to farmers hit hard by nature is not fully realized by 
the proposed language.  To begin, the proposal does not make 
clear which amounts are to benefit from special tax treatment. 
Amounts with respect to a natural disaster could include payments 
from numerous sources such as governments, insurance companies 
and other individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payments could also be made for a variety of purposes such as 
replacement of inventory, recovery of capital assets or even 
protective measures against future catastrophes.  Some of these 
amounts should perhaps qualify for tax relief but others 
decidedly should not.  Under the proposal all such payments could 
potentially qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the meaning of natural disaster is not anywhere 
defined by this amendment.  When we say disaster we normally 
refer to a sudden calamitous event resulting in great damage, 
loss or destruction.  But for the purposes of tax law this does 
not suffice.  In extending special tax treatment we must be very 
specific to ensure that relief is provided only where warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that farmers already receive favourable 
tax treatment in Canada.  For example, farmers may elect to 
report income and expenses on a cash basis rather than on an 
accrual basis as in most other businesses.  Farmers are also 
eligible for the $500,000 lifetime capital gains exemption for 
farm property. They may be able to defer proceeds from the sale 
of a farm property through a 10 year capital gains reserve and 
are in fact exempt from making quarterly tax instalments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe everyone present here today will agree that victims of 
natural disasters deserve the federal government's and the 
nation's full support and empathy in reconstructing their homes 
and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I also believe that all levels of government already 
play a significant and constructive part in the process of 
restoration.  The proposed amendment despite its good intentions 
is not consistent with current tax policy and does not 
effectively address the difficulties faced by affected farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for bringing this issue forward. As he 
mentioned in his opening remarks, perhaps the discussion will 
shed some additional light on how we may find some other type of 
vehicle to address the concerns that the hon. member has brought 
forward. I reiterate that the amendment is not consistent with 
current tax policy and does not effectively address the 
difficulties that may be faced by affected farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to the attention of the House that although I do once 
again thank the member for bringing forward this issue, I must 
suggest that this proposal not be adopted by the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-227, an act to amend the Income Tax 
Act regarding income deferral for farmers who must sell or 
destroy livestock in the case of a natural disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Athabasca for taking the 
time to investigate the Income Tax Act and to isolate some of the 
problems that farmers encounter when natural disasters occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In congratulating him I certainly would not want to agree with 
him about his comments and would want to disassociate myself with 
the comments he made about the Canadian Wheat Board.  If he 
wanted to refer to the Crowsnest Pass freight rate agreement and 
the dissolution of the Crow benefit a few years ago, he would be 
on firmer ground and enjoy more support from this caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would allow farmers to defer income for 12 months if 
they have to sell off livestock or destroy livestock because of a 
natural disaster. This would give the farmer time to rebuild his 
or her livestock once that natural disaster was over. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT103"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT103"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in a case where Agriculture Canada orders livestock 
to be destroyed, any taxation on compensation would not be 
included in the farmer's taxes for a 12 month period.  Again, 
this would give the farmer time to rebuild once the disease had 
been eradicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill before us, Bill C-227, the hon. member is referring 
specifically to the aftermath of a flood in the Lesser Slave Lake 
area, but the bill would clearly apply to other areas where 
natural disaster has occurred.  We think of the Red River flood, 
the Saguenay flood and the ice storms in eastern Ontario and 
Quebec of last winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disaster financial assistance arrangements have been in 
place for some time.  I believe they have been in place for 28 
years.  The program provides assistance when disaster strikes. It 
works, accordingly, that the federal government may be requested 
by a provincial government to help out financially. This 
assistance is provided through the disaster financial assistance 
arrangements and the payments help those governments to meet the 
basic costs involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This financial assistance arrangement has been in place, as I 
say, for almost three decades and is administered under 
guidelines ensuring that federal financial assistance is provided 
in a fair and equitable way across Canada.  The amount of this 
federal compensation is determined by a formula based on 
provincial population and other criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to the ice storm of 1998, despite the existence 
of the arrangements under DFAA, problems did occur.  I know that 
we received calls and letters from the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture following that severe ice storm and we were told that 
the provisions of the DFAA applied to some situations but not to 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federation told me that federal and provincial legislation 
covered capital losses but not the loss of income.  For example, 
if a farmer had to throw out milk because the truck could not get 
to the yard to pick it up, he or she was compensated.  On the 
other hand, trees in a farm orchard which were injured or 
stressed from the storm meant that the farmer was not compensated 
for lost productivity resulting from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there were problems with the definition of farmer 
for purposes of compensation.  Many people who are forced to work 
off farm to support their operations were then considered to be 
hobby farmers and not eligible for assistance under the DFAA, 
although I think eventually there was an exception made for 
farmers affected by the ice storm and so-called hobby farmers 
were included back in January and February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that off farm work has become the exception, not the 
rule, and that farmers work to subsidize their operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for a more detailed look at the DFAA as it 
relates to the loss of income and who is eligible for 
compensation.  I know that the bill of the hon. member for 
Athabasca relates to the Income Tax Act, but what we are talking 
about is a measure of protection for the income of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any discussion of protecting farm income must also take into 
account the government's lack of support for the agriculture and 
agri-food sector.  The support has declined drastically 
throughout this decade.  It stood at $6 billion in 1991 and it 
had been reduced to less than $2 billion by 1997, a decline of $4 
billion, and this year's budget confirmed even further cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers and other rural dwellers have sacrificed enormously in 
the fight against the deficit.  One might well ask what the 
agriculture minister is doing to represent the interests of rural 
Canadians at the cabinet table.  We believe the government is 
doing too little rather than too much to support farmers facing 
difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer briefly to an opposed vote in the supplementary 
estimates printed recently in the Order and Notice Papers.  I 
would have liked to have spoken to this the other day, but time 
allocation did not permit it, so I will make reference to it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It involves the member for Prince George—Peace River, who was 
opposed to the federal department of agriculture spending $13.8 
million on crop reinsurance for Saskatchewan.  I want to go 
through this because I think it was perhaps a shortsighted, mean 
spirited approach.  I just want to give a little bit of history 
to back up the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1980s the provincial Conservative government of 
Saskatchewan set up a number of farm insurance programs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT104"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT104"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1805

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that there was a serious drought in 
Saskatchewan at that time and indeed some action was needed. 
Ottawa got involved.  It was probably one of those late night 
phone calls between then Premier Devine and then Prime Minister 
Mulroney.  In any event, they hastily devised ad hoc programs and 
carried so much debt that they drove the cost of farmers' 
premiums through the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the 1991 provincial election in Saskatchewan, the 
incoming government moved to remedy the situation.  The federal 
and provincial governments both wrote off a portion of the debt 
in these programs to put them on a sound financial footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan made a payment to do away with the debt and Ottawa 
did the same.  As I understand it, the money involved in this 
vote is to be used for that purpose, namely, to retire a debt 
that was driving premiums not only up for farmers but out of 
sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I cannot understand why the member for Prince 
George—Peace River would want to prevent this money from going 
to Saskatchewan farmers and I am sure the farmers in that 
province would not understand it either.  I notice in passing 
that the member for Prince George—Peace River has asked the 
minister of agriculture on several occasions over this session to 
provide assistance to farmers in the Peace River area where crops 
had been lost due to rain and flooding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have spoken out in this House, urging the minister of 
agriculture to do more to help the farmers in Peace River.  So I 
am disappointed that the Reform Party member who wants assistance 
for Peace River farmers would ask that Ottawa turn its back on 
farmers in Saskatchewan.  It seems to me that it is yet another 
example of that party picking and choosing who it is going to 
support and who it is not.  I am sure this will not go unnoticed 
by farmers in my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I congratulate the hon. member for Athabasca for 
his private member's bill and assure him of my support for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-227, moved by the member for Athabasca, is similar to 
Motion No. 11 that was moved by the hon. member some time ago. 
This bill is an effort to provide equality and fairness for 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will allow farmers to defer income for one year if the 
farmer has to sell off livestock or destroy it because of a 
natural disaster, in the case of floods, drought, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of a natural disaster, if the farmer must sell 
livestock because their feed has been destroyed or for any other 
reason, the taxes on the income received from the sale will be 
deferred for one year.  This will give the farmer time to rebuild 
the livestock once the natural disaster has passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of an Agriculture Canada order to destroy livestock, 
any taxation on compensation would not be included in the 
farmer's taxes for one year.  Again, this will give the farmer 
time to rebuild the livestock once the disease has been 
eradicated.  This money is not taxed in the case of drought, so 
it should logically be extended to include livestock affected by 
other natural disasters and forced destruction of livestock for 
other health reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the aftermath of the ice storm of January 1998 there is a 
great need to re-evaluate the income support mechanism in the 
agricultural sector.  When a natural disaster occurs, whether it 
be the floods of Manitoba, the Saguenay, northern Alberta, or 
last summer's drought in Nova Scotia, it is most often farmers 
who are hit the hardest financially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the federal government to take a more proactive 
rather than reactive stance and start developing policies that 
benefit producers in good times and in bad times.  In saying 
that, it is important that we emphasize the word consistency when 
we talk about disaster assistance.  Without consistency in the 
delivery of assistance programs for farmers it would only create 
division between farmers across this great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go on any further, I would like to state for the record 
that when the Progressive Conservative government was in power 
between 1984 and 1989 support for our farmers was greater than 
ever before.  Crop and income insurance totalled $21.7 billion, 
about $4 billion a year.  Grains and oilseed farmers hurt by the 
1988 drought received $850 million in emergency assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also the Progressive Conservative government that in 
January 1991 brought in a new generation of farm safety net 
programs that farmers could count on.  They were aimed at 
boosting farm income.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important programs, which continues to exist to 
this day, the net income stabilization account, replaced ad hoc 
programs and put in place help for farmers in all regions of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us clearly demonstrates the need for us to 
re-evaluate our income protection system for farmers.  Although 
government officials might say that weather conditions are never 
the same, disaster assistance is not the same either.  I would 
suggest that this is where the problem lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be consistency in determining the level of 
assistance.  It should not simply be based on the amount of 
publicity a natural disaster gets.  This consistency must be 
applied to circumstances from coast to coast.  Ad hoc programs 
provide for ad hoc solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the environmental and climatic changes that this world is 
undergoing, it is vital now, more than ever, to monitor these 
issues on an ongoing basis and develop consistent policies that 
would help farmers deal with these changes both financially and 
realistically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention that the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris, our party's agriculture critic, has a private 
member's bill, Bill C-387, which addresses the problem of 
consistency.  The hon. member's bill would establish a national 
committee to develop policies and procedures to ensure 
co-ordination in the delivery of programs by governments in the 
case of agricultural losses or disasters created by weather or 
pests, to co-ordinate the delivery of information, assistance, 
relief and compensation and to study the compliance of such 
programs with the WTO requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee would consist of a membership of up to 21 members. 
Three would be nominated by the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.  One member would be nominated by each provincial 
agriculture minister.  Five members would be representatives of 
farmers and would be nominated by such organizations representing 
farmers.  Three members would be representatives of industry 
related to agriculture products and would be nominated by such 
organizations representing that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee would monitor situations on an ongoing basis and 
discuss what income protection measures would be available to 
farmers in the event of disasters or unusual conditions caused by 
weather or pests, taking into account crop insurance, flood and 
drought protection programs and NISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the PC Party will support this bill.  I hope 
the hon. member for Athabasca will also support my colleague's 
bill when it comes before the House.  Unfortunately, Bill C-227 
is not votable.  It is important that all provinces from coast to 
coast have input and share ideas on income protection for the 
farming community.  This bill clearly shows that there is a much 
larger problem.  The main problem is the need for consistency in 
all financial arrangements between the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments.  What is needed is for the federal 
government to show leadership on this issue and ensure that 
equity and fairness is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, now that we know the House will rise tomorrow for 
the summer recess, I wish all members of parliament, including 
you, Mr. Speaker, a very nice summer vacation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Athabasca, as the mover of the bill, has the last five minutes to 
sum up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
expected the response that I received from the government. 
Nonetheless, I am still very disappointed with it.  We can always 
find ways around the issue.  We can always find flaws in the 
bill.  My intention was to raise the issue of fairness and 
equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the government, as imperfect as my bill is, to 
address the issue and to make an effort, through the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, the Minister of Finance, or whomever 
would be appropriate, to bring some fairness to the issue so that 
those livestock producers who have to sell off livestock the same 
as they would in a drought or in a flood situation would be able 
to retain that income in the following year to replace that 
livestock.

Speaker, I rise as a private member on a point of order to seek 
unanimous consent.  I feel very awkward after what just occurred 
two seconds ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October I submitted a private member's bill dealing with 
the access to information bill which proposed a great number of 
amendments to the legislation.  I received support from all 
parties.  There were representations from the Bloc, the Reform 
Party, the Conservatives and the NDP.  I received seconders from 
all opposition parties and seconders to a total of 113 on the 
government backbenches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately in the time since then I have had many 
representations on my bill.  A lot of people looked at it and 
made suggestions.  They have noticed some flaws and some 
technical difficulties in a few areas which maybe I did not think 
out very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize here it is still at first reading; it has not been 
picked.  If it ever does get to be read in second reading I would 
not want debate to be deflected on the flaws.  I would hope the 
debate would deal with the good points of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would request unanimous consent of the House to 
substitute the text, which I will forthwith table, for the text 
submitted last October and that the said bill keep its number, 
which is Bill C-264, and standing on the order paper as there is 
no change in title.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 4, I asked the Minister of Transport what game he was 
playing. 
I asked him why, in his response to the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi on June 2, he neglected to mention that the Quebec 
Minister of Transport had formally invited him to discuss a new 
strategic highway improvement program agreement, particularly 
for highway 175, at the meeting of the transport ministers in 
Edmonton? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter dated May 27 and faxed the day before the Edmonton

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new agreement strikes me as necessary in order to continue and 
complete projects begun under the strategic highway improvement

Transport for Canada, when he neglects to mention the existence 
of this letter or its contents, and claims Minister Brassard did 
not mention highway 175 to him in Edmonton?  The least one can 
say is that his words are not very transparent, and hide his 
inability to act on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear, however, is that Quebec is prepared to negotiate 
a new SHIP agreement.  The Government of Quebec will, in 
December 1998, table the conclusion to an opportunity study for 
a divided four-lane highway in the Laurentian wildlife sanctuary, 
which includes a section on funding possibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what the minister has said, are we to conclude that, if the 
Government of Quebec decides to go ahead with a four-lane 
highway, the federal government is prepared to fund its share of 
the project?

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term, the people of Quebec and more particularly 
the people in my riding would like to know whether the minister 
is prepared to start new negotiations for a new SHIP agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the following questions for the minister.  First, I would 
like to know whether he convinced his cabinet colleagues to 
increase funding for the national highway system, as his 
provincial counterparts have asked, or whether, on the contrary, 
he was turned down. Second, if cabinet is open to his request, 
would the minister tell me when he intends to give his officials 
the go-ahead to begin bipartite negotiations to conclude a new 
SHIP agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are clear and precise questions.  I ask the parliamentary 
secretary to answer my questions directly, because, like me, the 
people in the riding of Jonquière want to know whether the 
federal government is prepared to invest in repairing the roads 
in Quebec and thus return the millions of dollars it collected 
with its 1.5 cent tax on gasoline.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first 
of all let me thank the hon. member for Jonquière for her 
interest in the national highway system.  I apologize for reading 
this reply in English but if I were to read it in French, it 
would take too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has recognized for some time that a 
significant additional effort will be required to maintain and 
upgrade Canada's national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister stated in response to this question on June 4, 
the minister of transport for Quebec did not raise the question 
of funding for highway 175 during the Edmonton meeting, but he 
did raise the matter shortly afterward. Also he raised the 
subject of this highway in a letter dated May 27 in a broader 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada officials are presently looking at all the 
issues that were raised in the letter and the minister will be 
responding to that letter in the near future.  In the meantime, 
the federal government will continue to work closely with all 
provinces, including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we succeed in developing a new funding program for the 
national highway system, highway 175 will undoubtedly be eligible 
for funding by the federal government if the Government of Quebec 
also agreed that it was a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to convey my regards to my friends in 
Jonquière.  I greatly enjoyed the month that I spent there.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
