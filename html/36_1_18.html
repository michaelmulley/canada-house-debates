</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in 1975 four rail tanks containing 340 tons of toxic 
chlorine fell off a barge during a storm on the lower west coast 
and have never been located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May when I requested a summer 1997 search, the Minister of 
the Environment assured me that the fisheries minister has prime 
responsibility for this issue.  No search was initiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that 12 months ago a proven salvage operator in B.C. 
approached the federal government with a proposal to find the 
tanks for the sum of $30,000.  This risk free offer was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clock is ticking on a potential lethal chlorine gas escape 
22 years after the sinking.  People living along the Strait of 
Georgia want the minister to stop sitting on his hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister think spending this $30,000 is somehow 
unimportant?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, questions 
about Canadian identity and unity have been debated for decades, 
but such debates have little relevance to the daily lives of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reality in our lives is that at this time of year our 
children are heading back to ice rinks to play a game ingrained 
in our identity.  It is fall and therefore it must be the start 
of hockey season.  Clearly hockey is Canada's great unifying 
force.  We have all just been reminded of the enormous pride we 
felt at Team Canada's great victory in 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In backyard rinks and community arenas, people are lacing up 
their skates to take part in a Canadian tradition. Therefore it 
is appropriate to thank the dedicated families and volunteers who 
facilitate Canada's game, for they are the torch bearers of an 
integral part of Canadian identity, unity, heritage and pride: 
the game of hockey.

the late Dorothy Lam was the wife of the first Chinese born 
Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, David Lam, and a most 
gracious chatelaine in her own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She will also be remembered in British Columbia as the driving 
force behind the David and Dorothy Lam Foundation which directed 
millions of dollars to universities and to cultural and 
charitable initiatives in B.C., including the remarkable Sun Yat 
Sen Garden in the centre of downtown Vancouver, in whose 
classical Chinese architectural design, as well as in the 
planning and financing, she was a main inspiration.

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the hon. member for Vaudreuil made the following statement “Quebec 
is not as open to the minority rights of anglophones as Ontario, 
Manitoba or New Brunswick are to francophones”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this statement not only did the hon. member for Vaudreuil 
expose his ignorance and prejudices publicly, but he also echoed 
the government line, for all of its leading lights denigrate Quebec 
society, its tolerance, its democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today reality is so distorted that the Quebec Liberal MPs firmly 
believe that francophone Canadians are better treated than English 
speaking ones by their provincial government.  The reverse is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than getting all indignant about the insulting words of 
his colleague yesterday, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
ought, as should the Prime Minister and the President of Treasury 
Board moreover, confess to the same attitude, for he is directly—

communication and creativity, science and technology, and 
environmental entrepreneurship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 12 winners of the award will form a group called the Polaris 
Network.  They will be provided with a group web site and will 
receive computer training.  Over a period of one year, the 12 
members of this network will share their experiences and their 
expertise.  They will work together to inspire others to get 
actively involved in building healthier environments in their 
communities and regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of the House to encourage young Canadians to 
apply for this award.

go out to the family and friends of Donna Lee Hallett.  She was 
brutally murdered, bludgeoned to death, in 1993. Now, four years 
later, her murderer was sentenced to two years. Adding to their 
pain and grief, the bereaved must now also bear the anger of 
having her murderer go virtually unpunished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge, in trying to justify the sentence, said that the 
murderer was entitled to 10 years of credit for the four years he 
served in custody. Stephen Schwalm brutally murdered a 
defenceless woman in cold blood and in return he gets four years 
of free room and board in the Edmonton Remand Centre followed by 
two years in jail. Then he goes free.

Speaker, I was pleased to be part of the Canadian delegation of 
NATO parliamentarians meeting in Romania last week which passed 
the following resolution:  “Whereas more than 110 million 
anti-personnel land mines are placed in 65 nations around the 
world, aware that existing de-mining efforts and techniques clear 
fewer than 100,000 per year while 2 million to 5 million are laid 
yearly, the assembly urges member governments and 
parliamentarians to the North Atlantic Alliance to sign, ratify 
and implement a comprehensive ban on the production, stockpiling, 
transfer and use of anti-personnel land mines and to devote 
additional resources to the development of technologies intended 
to improve the efficiency of de-mining efforts and ensure they 
are rapidly made available to nations suffering the effects of 
the large scale use of land mines”.  This passed at NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to add my sincere compliments to the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs for all he has done and to the Prime

pornography been desensitized to the personhood and dignity of

criminals nevertheless develop a contaminated view of human

“incur costs”.  The Conference Board of Canada estimates that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
disastrous effects of the finance minister's mistake in slashing 
$1.2 billion out of health care this year becomes more and more 
evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are shocked to learn that the federal government is 
now the lowest contributor among major health care funders. The 
latest figures reveal that the federal government used to pay 35% 
of health care costs with individuals paying 24%.  Today as a 
result of Liberal cuts those numbers are reversed with 
individuals forced to pay over 31%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the finance minister admit that his excessive cuts are 
leading us directly to two tier American style health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the House will be well aware that the government is already 
committed to establishing a $12.5 billion floor for the cash 
transfer to the provinces beginning next year.  In doing so we 
are acting on the recommendation of the National Forum on Health 
that spent two years looking into the needs of the Canadian 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look across the country we see many provinces that have 
surpluses, that have money in the bank.  If they see the need for 
further investment in health care, it is entirely open to those 
provinces to make those investments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
National Forum on Health said that cuts were coming too far and 
too fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are paying a terrible price for the finance minister's 
cuts to health care.  They are paying with their health and they 
are paying with their pocketbooks.  Canadians are right to be 
worried that health care will not be there for them when they 
need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister agree to correct his mistake and 
cancel this year's reckless and irresponsible cut of another $1.2 
billion out of health care for Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the Minister of Health outlined very clearly, the 
fact is that the way the set-up was occurring and because of the 
increase in tax points to the provinces the cash was going down. 
It was going down far below $12.5 billion, far below $11 billion, 
far below $8 billion and far below $6 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the matter of the agreement between France and Canada on child

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six years ago James Mills was murdered while in his own cell at 
the Renous correctional facility in New Brunswick. Corrections 
Canada officials came in, removed the body, cleaned up the cell, 
then called the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that, for six years Mr. Mills has been haunted by 
the loss of his son.  He has been trying to get answers.  He has 
been trying to get justice, and he deserves it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister, on behalf of the Mills family, take charge of 
this situation, find a resolution for it and give the Mills 
family a little piece of mind?

he feels about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is aware, I believe, that arrangements have been made 
for the commissioner of corrections to visit the region, to meet

</I></B></P><P align=left>After six years of investigation, two recommendations by the 
RCMP, will the minister tell Mr. Mills why no charges have been 
laid and what they are doing to get charges laid against the

These are the firms that export to markets broader than their own

hon. members are aware that the give and take of question period 
is rather accelerated these days.  Most members seem to think 
this is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also with the acceleration many times we do not always have a 
chance to reflect upon the words we use.  Sometimes words are 
used in the course of the question period which border on being 
unparliamentary.  When that is the case I usually caution hon. 
members to be very judicious in their choice of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the chair I try to hear as much as I can and to see to it 
that debate is carried on in an orderly fashion.  Whereas some 
words are borderline in my view and I use words like judicious 
and cautious, there are some words that we cannot accept.  Many 
times these words are used in the heat of battle and after 
reflection we find that perhaps we could have had a better choice 
of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this question period, probably because there was not enough 
time to react or to think, one of our members used words which in 
my view were unparliamentary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</b> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise again on three separate questions of privilege 
arising from the question of privilege that I raised yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday when I raised my question of privilege the table 
officers failed to follow the procedure of the House according to 
Beauchesne's.  Citation 116 of <I>Beauchesne's Parliamentary 
Rules and Forms</I>, sixth edition, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should a question of privilege be based on published material, 
the article in question must be submitted and read at the Table. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I asked:  “I have a copy of this memorandum for the 
Speaker. Does he want the article read now?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am quoting from the blues because the official 
<I>Hansard</I> record does not record my asking you this question 
or your response.  You responded, and again I quote from the 
blues, “I would like to have the article brought to”, and so 
on. Neither my question nor your response were included in the 
Commons <I>Debates</I> for October 21, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question of privilege is to ask that the official 
record of this House be amended to include my question and your 
response.  I cannot defend my rights and privileges as a member 
in this House if the record does not accurately reflect what both 
you and I said in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question of privilege relates to the fact that the 
memorandum which was delivered to you was not read as the 
procedures of this House say it must be done.  I will not go into 
all the details here.  I can explain it to you later. The record 
shows that you accepted that my question was in fact a question 
of privilege and only your ruling was held in abeyance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Speaker:</b>  I will review the blues and <I>Hansard</I>. I 
will review all of the tapes and the television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not say that you had a question of privilege, nor did I 
intend to convey that. Because of what went on yesterday I 
asked—and you seem to agree—that I would hold in abeyance any 
action on this particular point of privilege until I had more 
information which was going to be forthcoming from the Board of 
Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the points that you have brought up I will review 
<I>Hansard</I> and the tapes, and if corrections are necessary I 
will look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as having a point of privilege at this point, I have not 
made a decision as yet.  I will make my decision when I get more 
information. With respect to what you are bringing up now, if you 
want me to rule on those points, being points of privilege, I 
will do so.

that Bill C-5, an act respecting cooperatives, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand in the House 
today to make some comments at the second reading stage of the 
Canada co-operatives act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will help federally incorporated co-operatives to grow 
and prosper here in our new competitive economic environment. As 
members will know, I have been involved in the business of 
farming all of my life.  In my new role as minister of the crown 
I wear a number of hats, including one with the word “co-op” on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives have made a tremendous contribution to Canada's 
economic and social development and we must ensure that they 
continue to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express my appreciation to the Minister of Industry and his 
departmental officials who were instrumental in shaping the 
co-operative legislation before us today.  Officials in our 
respective departments worked closely in developing policy for 
this legislation.  They worked very closely as well with the 
Canadian Co-operatives Association and Conseil canadien de la 
Co-opération.  These two organizations played a key role in the 
development of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from personal experience the importance of co-ops to the 
lifeblood of the country.  Four out of ten Canadians are members 
of co-operatives, including credit unions and caisse populaires. 
Co-operatives are an important vehicle for community based 
economic development.  They are locally based and provide 
services locally.  With so many co-operatives located in rural 
communities, the co-operative sector has a very significant role 
to play in maintaining and enhancing the quality of rural life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives emerged first in rural communities in response to 
an inadequate supply of goods and services at affordable prices. 
Agricultural producers used the co-operative model to market and 
process their production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stimulated by European immigrants, co-operative creameries were 
founded and formed by dairy farmers in the maritimes, Quebec and 
Ontario in the 1870s and 1880s.  Co-operatives have been around 
for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada the first co-operatives were formed at the 
beginning of the century by agricultural producers influenced by 
American co-operative leaders.  Today the biggest non-financial 
co-operatives in Canada in terms of revenues are agricultural 
co-operatives.  In 1996 eight of them had revenues greater than 
$1 billion.  It has been estimated that co-operatives account for 
47% of the market share for poultry, 57% for milk and 59% for 
grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With industrialization people from rural communities across 
Canada moved to urban areas and brought with them to the urban 
areas their institutions including co-operatives.  Today a 
majority of co-operatives are located in urban areas.  These 
include housing co-operatives and credit unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over all Canada's 10,000 co-ops employ about 136,000 people, 
with total assets of more than $155 billion.  Co-operatives are a 
potent force across a wide range of economic sectors from 
agriculture and fishing to housing, to retailing, to public 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many co-operatives are governed by provincial law, but 50 
co-operatives under federal jurisdiction conduct business in more 
than one province and are among the largest co-operatives in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grassroots partnership inherent in co-operatives can play a 
major part in achieving genuine lasting economic growth in our 
cities and in our rural communities.  Co-ops are major economic 
engines in Canada with the top 50 co-operatives increasing their 
workforce by 5% in 1995.  The co-operative movement reaches into 
every sector of the Canadian economy.  Consumer co-operatives, 
mainly retail enterprises, had more than three million members 
and $6.4 billion in revenue in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more important the co-operative movement is tightly 
woven into the social fabric of the country.  For example, 
service co-operatives are a growing part of Canadian communities 
in the areas of child care, housing, health, community 
development, fine arts and cultural services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worker co-operatives, mainly small and medium size enterprises, 
are becoming well established and give Canadians more control 
over their jobs and an opportunity to open viable businesses.  In 
some cases they have helped keep business ventures alive in the 
face of closures or layoffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is aboriginal co-operatives which have played an 
important role in the economic development of native communities. 
With more than 20,000 members they are the second largest source 
of employment in the north after government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before the House today provides co-operatives 
with the tools they need to continue their long history of 
contributing to the economic and social make-up of Canada.  Under 
the revamped legislation co-operatives would be given a 
modernized framework similar to the legislation governing other 
federal corporate and financial institutions and eliminating 
needless red tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, incorporation procedures would provide for an 
approach closer to the Canada Business Corporations Act.  Under 
this new co-operative legislation, however, enterprises would 
have to certify that they operate on a co-operative bases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives will be better equipped to compete with other 
businesses by having more flexibility in the make-up of their 
boards of directors.  They will also have new opportunities to 
raise capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new legislation a co-op will be able to issue 
investment shares to non-members.  This will allow co-operatives 
better access to equity financing while maintaining control of 
co-operatives in the hands of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting co-operatives on an equal footing with business 
corporations through modernized corporate governance rules 
requires a strengthening of co-operative principles in the 
legislation.  Co-operatives unite voluntarily and pool their 
resources in pursuit of common economic interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They embrace co-operative principles which centre around 
concepts of democratic control, equality, equity, education and 
concern for community.  The decisions of co-operatives reflect 
the interest of the communities in which they operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These essential features will be strengthened and enshrined by 
reinforcing the requirement that a co-operative must be organized 
and operated on a co-operative basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives are a powerful form of business organization which 
contributes in a very significant way to economic growth, job 
creation and prosperity of communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modernized legislation will equip these co-operatives with the 
legislative and regulatory authority needed to take advantage of 
options designed to strengthen their ability to prosper and grow 
in an evolving economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives have already made an important contribution to 
rural Canada and to the economic renewal of our rural 
communities.  This is a key priority of the government, a 
commitment we have been delivering on since we took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are helping rural Canadians access information technologies 
and the information needed to develop a vibrant, self-reliant and 
innovative business sector.  In part this is to provide rural 
Canada with the tools it needs to take greater charge of its 
future.  A new Canadian co-operatives act is another important 
tool to help make that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives will continue to play an important role in 
promoting jobs and growth in the future as they have in the past. 
For my part I intend to be a strong and effective voice for the 
co-operatives sector in the federal cabinet and to do all that I 
can do within my department and my jurisdiction to help position 
this sector for sustained growth into the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  Before we resume 
debate, by agreement the House leaders made it possible for the 
hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre to speak next.  We 
would then go back to the regular rotation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  In the spirit of co-operation the 
member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre will have the normal 
allocation of time that he would have if he was in his normal 
place of rotation, which would be 20 and 10.  The spokespersons 
for the official opposition and the Bloc would retain their 40 
minute allocation in their usual rotation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  The Chair thanks the 
the government whip for clarifying the situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very please to say a few words about Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite fitting that we were speaking about co-ops.  In the 
spirit of co-operation I express my appreciation to the Reform 
Party, the Bloc Quebecois and the Liberal Party for allowing me 
to speak first due to a prior commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also express my appreciation to the leader of the New 
Democratic Party for assigning me the critic areas of small 
business, western economic diversification and co-ops.  All these 
areas are of great interest to me.  I have been a business person 
and a member of the co-op and credit union movement for 27 or 28 
years.  That is a long time for a young person like me.  Of 
course I joined the credit union and co-operative movement many 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5, an act respecting co-operatives, is the reincarnation 
of Bill C-91, tabled in March this year, which died on the order 
paper with the dissolution of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Its reintroduction this fall marks another accomplishment in a 
very active year for the co-op movement in Canada, one in which 
we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Canadian Co-Operative 
Association founded by the former Co-operative College of Canada, 
which was very prominent in the province of Saskatchewan, and the 
Co-operative Union of Canada on September 24, 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also this spring in the Saskatchewan budget the NDP government 
of Roy Romanow announced significant new resources and a new 
focus on co-op economic development after some months of 
consultation and work with the co-op movement in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer in Vancouver the World Council of Credit Unions 
recognized the Canadian Co-operative Association for its 
outstanding work in assisting in the development of credit unions 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister stated, 14 million Canadians are members of a 
co-op, a credit union or a caisse populaire. Some 10,000 co-ops 
in Canada employ about 135,000 workers often in regions of the 
country or economic sectors that have been ignored by the 
traditional market economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some producer and marketing co-operatives have been very 
successful.  Some 17 of the top 500 revenue producing companies 
in Canada are registered as co-ops.  In 1995, 617,000 people 
belonged to agricultural co-ops alone.  They are very significant 
players in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These 617,000 people in agricultural co-ops generated $16 
billion in sales and handled 40% of total farm cash receipts in 
the areas of grains, oilseeds, dairy products, eggs and poultry, 
livestock, fruits and vegetables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-ops also make a contribution to their communities inspired by 
unique needs identified in the far corners of our country.  Many 
members will acknowledge, as we do in Saskatchewan, that the 
co-op sector is one of the three major engines which drive our 
economy:  the private sector, the public sector and the co-op 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always used the co-op sector in western Canada and other 
parts of the country as an instrument to achieve economic 
objectives where the private and the public sectors have failed 
or were not interested in pursuing those objectives in those 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud that we are dealing with the issue today and 
providing the co-ops in many ways with the modern instruments and 
utensils they require to meet the modern challenges facing us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise some examples of co-ops.  The Co-op Radio in Restigouche 
provides radio service in French for Acadians and local 
employment for northern New Brunswick.  A co-op named Imagine 
That, an artists' marketing co-op in Duncan, B.C., helps local 
artisans sell their work to the growing tourist markets on 
Vancouver Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arctic co-operatives work to meet the challenges of a remote 
economy and marketplace that exist north of the 60th parallel. 
The Mountain Equipment Co-op, started by a group of university 
students, has grown into a successful and popular consumer retail 
co-op operating in four of the country's largest cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prairie Dog Alternative News in my home town of Regina is 
providing an alternative voice to the mainstream media.  Its 
ownership is growing more concentrated by the year.  We are very 
pleased to see that alternative prosper in Regina, Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the two provinces where co-ops have been most at home is 
my home province of Saskatchewan.  The other is Quebec.  The 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool founded by farmers in 1924 has grown into 
one of the largest grain handlers and agricultural co-ops in the 
entire world with annual sales in 1996 of $3 billion and gross 
revenues in the order of $4.24 billion, up from $2.8 billion just 
two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool is the largest co-op in Canada, 
followed by Federated Co-ops in Saskatoon.  The Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool is also the biggest corporation by sales in the 
province of Saskatchewan and the 35th largest company by revenue 
in the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the extent to which the co-op sector contributes to 
economic development in our country may be unappreciated by the 
general population.  As one of the three engines it is a very key 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution of the co-op sector has always been well 
understood in my home province of Saskatchewan and has certainly 
been appreciated by the New Democratic Party and our predecessor, 
the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular I extend our congratulations on the occasion of 
National Co-op Week held just last week and International Credit 
Union Day held on October 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 represents quite an accomplishment for the co-op sector 
in Canada and puts it on the leading edge internationally.  In 
1996 the Canadian Co-operative Association, in co-operation with 
the conseil canadien de la coopération, presented a model bill to 
the federal government intended to update federal legislation 
regulating co-ops. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Co-operative Associations Act, 1970 is thus 
receiving its first overhaul in almost 30 years and the resulting 
statute will in all likelihood serve as a model for coming 
changes in provincial statutory regimes for the co-op sector in 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two main thrusts of the bill are to offer some 
flexible financial alternatives to co-operatives so they can 
continue to operate successfully in the modern competitive global 
marketplace and at the same time to provide work to 
strengthen the cornerstone of the co-op sector's vitality, which 
of course is the rights of its individual members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal statute applies to non-financial co-ops operating in 
more than one province. Only 51 of the 7,300 non-financial co-ops 
in Canada are affected, but some of them are the largest in the 
country.  It modernizes the regulatory framework for 
incorporation, structure and organization of co-ops and permits 
co-ops to issue investment equity for the first time in order to 
tap new resources and new sources of capital.  It also 
incorporates the revamped 1995 International Co-operative 
Alliance statement of co-operative principles into an updated 
definition of what makes an organization a co-op under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, a number of requirements have been modified to 
modernize the corporate statute law for co-operatives that are 
federally registered, and this complies with the Corporations Act 
in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As spokesperson for co-ops in the NDP I met with a number of 
officials with respect to this issue, Industry Canada, the 
co-operative secretariat at agriculture Canada.  I have had 
consultations with the Canadian Co-operative Association, with 
prairie pools, with Federated Co-ops of Saskatchewan, with the 
president of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Leroy Larson, 
representatives of the Alberta Wheat Pool and the Sherwood Co-op, 
among many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some sectors of the co-op movement, in particular in 
Atlantic Canada and some of the smaller co-ops in Saskatchewan, 
are not in full support of this bill.  The differences exist 
between the smaller co-ops that support the traditional service 
to members co-op model and the larger co-ops that support the 
business model of co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill is referred to committee, which we support, these 
issues have to be vetted, discussed and heard by the committee 
members.  The NDP requests of the minister that the committee 
invite witnesses from both viewpoints so that we can understand 
more fully the differences they have with respect to this bill. 
No doubt we will hear more detailed views at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the vitality and maturity 
of the co-op sector of our economy and to recognize the active 
contribution co-op employees and members make to our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus I am pleased to 
offer support for referring this bill to committee for further 
review. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I address Bill C-5 I would like to encourage all occupants 
of the chair to continue to maintain the decorum that we have had 
in the House and continue to set the high standard that you are. 
I would even encourage you to elevate this standard as need be. 
So please pass those comments on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand Bill C-5 this bill was actually prompted by the 
co-operative associations themselves. They recognized the need 
for change in its industry.  They recognized the need to be 
increasingly competitive.  They are competing against larger 
entities with smaller management hierarchies, with less 
bureaucracy. They are competing with large entities that are very 
customer focused and front line driven.  They have to achieve 
some measure of increased efficiency if they are to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also realized they needed access to investment, investment 
dollars and capital.  They also realized that in order to 
eliminate some of their redundancies in their operations they had 
to amalgamate, consolidate and knit themselves together so they 
could be more efficient to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operatives through all of this were dealing with reality. 
I want to speak about dealing with reality for a minute.  I would 
really like to encourage our government today to take a lesson 
from what the co-operatives have been doing and start dealing 
with reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the finance minister toured the country celebrating 
that soon we would have a balanced budget. It is wonderful to 
celebrate that, but it has been more than 27 years coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He presents it as if we are there, we have arrived, everything 
has been done.  He is not dealing with reality.  We have 
a $600 billion debt in this county and many of us do not realize 
it but we are sitting on an interest rate time bomb that could go 
off at any minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember a day in Canada when interest rates were almost 
20%.  When they came back down to 12%, we all breathed a sigh of 
relief.  We have a debt that has an interest rate of around 7% or 
8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the likelihood of those interest rates going down is 
very small.  The potential for them to go up is real.  I read 
recently that there is already pressure to move in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are celebrating almost having a balanced budget and yet 
we are sitting on an interest rate time bomb that could blow away 
that balanced budget in a second and we will never see the days 
of surplus.  But we are not dealing with reality.  We are 
celebrating an almost balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much is the interest on a $600 billion debt?  It is $45 
billion a year.  How much is that?  I cannot conceive of that 
much money but let us put it into perspective so that Canadians 
can understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk so much about the importance of secondary education. 
Forty-five billion dollars would pay for 4 million young people 
to go through a four year degree program.  That is how much that 
is and we pay that out in interest every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the need for health care.  There is a lot of talk 
from the other side of the House about how we do not want two 
tier health care.  The best way to achieve that is to make sure 
there is a very strong basic health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-five billion dollars in interest on this huge debt, if we 
did not have to pay that, that amount of money would pay for 
every hospital in Canada including the ones that are being forced 
to close to operate for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how much this is costing us, yet do we have a government 
that is dealing with reality like the co-ops are?  No, we get a 
throne speech with 29 new spending initiatives. I heard lately it 
is 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are crying out for less government, not more 
government.  We are asking the government across the floor to 
hear this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else that the co-operatives demonstrated. 
They demonstrated they have the ability to plan for the future. 
They realize that they need to gain capital so that they can 
build a secure future for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should allow Canadians the same privilege. Again 
I do not see it listening.  Instead, what do we get?  We get a 
Canada pension plan that has been there for 30 years that people 
have been paying into for 30 years.  Where is the money? Nobody 
seems to know where it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money that goes into that plan by young people and people 
working today is the same money that goes out of that plan to 
people who are collecting.  It is a flowthrough system. There is 
no pot of money available.  There is a $560 billion unfunded 
liability there.  It is a flowthrough system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are even losing faith in this system.  For all the 
great rhetoric we are getting from across the floor, a recent 
study done in <I>Maclean's</I> magazine showed that 66% of 
Canadians said this program will not be there when they need it. 
They have lost faith in this program.  What is the government's 
answer?  Its answer is to give us more of a plan that did not 
work, not just a bit more but 73% more. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will go from taking 5.85% from our cheques to 9.9%, 
effectively 10%.  That is a 73% increase in a plan that has 
proven to not work.  That is the largest tax increase we have 
seen. That is 10% off the income of every Canadian, your money 
flowing into a system that does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What troubles me about this on top of everything else is that 
the young people of our country who have become trained and are 
eager to work and build a future for themselves are faced with 
16% to 17% unemployment.  We have a government that increases 
payroll taxes by 73%, further shortcircuiting the chance for 
these young Canadians to build a future in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an answer for us.  The answer is another 
government appointed investment board to manage the money that is 
contributed.  If it is consistent with the track record of most 
government appointed investment boards, I can see why Canadians 
do not have much faith in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that should be asked by the members on the opposite 
side is whose money is this. This money is earned by Canadians. 
It is not a tax.  It is meant to be there when they need it at 
retirement age.  Let them own it and manage it.  Within 
successful private financial institutions that are professionals 
at managing money, they cannot do worse than the government has 
done in the last 30 years.  It is not possible to do worse than 
that.  Even modest evaluations with conservative interest rates 
prove out that there is a three to fourfold greater benefit 
derived by going through private institutions than going through 
a government run investment board, taking the critical moneys 
that Canadians earn and further shortcircuiting the hopes of our 
young people to obtain a job in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of Canadians owning their own investment plan, 
owning their own pension plan, having title to it, is not 
something radical or unheard of.  This concept is being applied 
around the world with outstanding success.  Countries and 
governments are allowing their citizens to plan for their future, 
like the co-operatives are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government to allow Canadians to do the same 
thing instead of going back to a plan that does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another dimension of the co-operatives bill. The 
co-operative management group had the foresight to implement 
measures with this bill that will protect it and allow it to 
survive in the long term.  That seems like a reasonable thing for 
Canadians to expect from their government. That is continually 
what the government says it wants to do and yet we continue to be 
faced with too much government, too much intrusion in our lives, 
huge debt and huge interest rates, as I have spoken to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the highest tax to GDP ratio of any of the G-7 
countries, and the government comes back with 29 new spending 
initiatives on top of all that.  Even as I speak it in this House 
I am overwhelmed again with the facts.  Surely the light is going 
to come on one of these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten per cent off every paycheque of every Canadian, another 
government appointed board, the litany goes on and on.  Behind 
all this, as we are celebrating a balanced budget finally 
wrestled to the ground, there are some facts to be looked at.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The $7.5 billion that went toward balancing the budget was 
actually a surplus paid into the unemployment insurance program. 
It is not really savings.  It is intended for a totally different 
purpose but has gone off somewhere else.  It is misleading 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth unemployment rate is 16.5%.  Today I was at a 
presentation for some gentlemen who were receiving the Order of 
Canada.  I had the opportunity to talk to one senior scientist 
being recognized about his son who had recently graduated with an 
honours engineering degree and sought work in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard the story.  Members know where I am going and 
where he went.  He left Canada to get a real job, not a 
government job, because he could not get one here.  This 
passionate Canadian who received the Order of Canada was hurt 
that his own son could not apply what he had learned in Canada. 
Brain drain to the max, and it is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not more government we need.  Canadians are burdened with 
government, taxes and all that comes with them.  They are 
carrying a heavy load.  Canadians are a stoic bunch.  We tend not 
to be complainers.  We tend to buck up and do it. We have a 
government that continues to take another brick and put it on top 
of the load.  It continues to weigh us down one more brick at a 
time, one more brick at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to depress everybody here although this is a 
depressing topic.  I want to give Canadians some hope and to 
inspire members across the floor.  There is a bright note in all 
this.  The government actually listened to the co-operatives when 
they came forward and said what they needed.  The government 
actually listened and put together the bill.  That proves to me 
when the heart is willing and they really want to do it Liberals 
can listen.  They allowed co-ops to plan for their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the members of my party I am earnestly requesting the 
government to do the same for Canadians.  It should deal with 
reality and the realities of the debt.  It should allow Canadians 
to plan for the future and to keep the money they have earned. It 
is their money.  Let us emphasize that.  It should set us on the 
road to long term viability and allow for an environment where 
young people can hope for real employment in their own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want more tax and spend governments.  They want 
a government that does a few key, important things well for less 
cost instead of a lot of things poorly at great expense.  It is 
simple.  That is what they are pleading for and demanding.  It 
should stop crushing them with the weight of government adding 
bricks to the load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has demonstrated that it can listen.  It should 
now listen to Canadians, listen and deal with reality.  We have 
waited too long.  It is almost too late.   It is a critical time. 
We have a window of opportunity today to make changes but it is 
only here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to deal with the realities 
and capitalize on the window of opportunity.  Whatever we do let 
us not miss it or future generations will judge us and indict us.

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</b>  Mr. Speaker, may I 
congratulate you on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to speak on the second reading of Bill C-5, 
Bill C-91 in the last Parliament.  This is a bill which completely 
revises the federal legislation on  co-operatives, at the request of 
the Canadian Council for Co-operatives and its francophone 
counterpart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by pointing out that only 50 
co-operatives are registered under federal charter.  A large number 
of these, however, are extremely important ones, which specialize 
in the production and distribution of grain. 
In Quebec, and I think it is important to point this out, there are 
only six federally chartered co-operatives, which are of different 
sizes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people may wonder what we in Quebec have to say about 
this bill. The same thing, basically, as the representatives of 
other parts of Canada, because this bill, while affecting only a 
few co-operatives directly, can affect the entire Quebec co-operative 
movement indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there is a Conseil québécois des co-opératives, which 
is part of the Conseil francophone and which, after some 
negotiations I would say, gave its support to the reform proposed 
by the Canadian Council. I must point out that, on Bill C-91, some 
of the demands by the Quebec council were accepted, while others 
were not.  Nevertheless, the Conseil endorsed the bill on behalf of 
its entire membership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, as the NDP member pointed out, while the bill does not directly 
affect co-operatives, it creates problems for a number of them—and I 
will try to explain why—in terms of its possible influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may wonder why it was necessary to review, to modernize the 
federal legislation on co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the provincial government just modernized the 
co-operatives act. The same thing is being done in Canada and it has also 
been done in recent years in other countries where co-ops are important 
institutions. Why? Because of the changes affecting markets, because of 
globalization and the stiff competition often faced by co-ops, 
particularly those that are key players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, these key players include the Nutrinor agri-food coop, 
which is fairly big but not as big as Agropur, the 53rd largest business 
in Quebec, and much smaller than La Co-opérative fédérée de Québec, which 
ranks 19th among the province's businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill does not deal with financial coops, I take this 
opportunity to say that the Mouvement Desjardins would be number one in 
Quebec, with assets of $82 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses located in Quebec and governed by a federal charter must 
have some leeway to face new market conditions.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we can understand that in doing so co-operatives sometimes 
give rise to vigorous debate among their members, among the various 
types of co-operatives, because some people wonder whether, through 
better financing, by a turning profit in a co-operative fashion and 
selling shares on a market, that is, a sort of stock, whether they are 
not selling their soul. This debate goes on among the big co-operatives 
and between them and others operating in the service industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be pointed out, because the criticism I will make is in 
the context of full support for the bill. However, during committee 
work, we will express concerns, and move amendments on a number of 
specific points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives, I must point out, are vital in Quebec. When we look 
at Canada's history we see they are vital in western Canada as well and 
that their emergence showed the producers were taking control of their 
future rather than leave it to capitalist development, which, at the 
time, was largely unregulated. It is therefore a means of taking of 
control and the sign of an economy more collectively oriented and yet a 
strong market player. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, this truth goes hand in hand with the fact that 
co-operatives have given Quebeckers control over a large part of their 
economy. 
When we put this in a historical context, it takes on proportions even 
broader than those in the west of Canada, because there is not only the 
context of social ownership, but also of Quebec ownership as opposed to 
foreign ownership. This explains the importance we give to having rules 
for the co-operative movement and consolidated legislation that 
underscores these principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are various types of co-operatives. Some may be threatened 
by the new principles appearing in Bill C-5. In addition to 
grain, meat or agricultural production co-operatives, which bring 
producers together, there are also family investment 
co-operatives, student co-operatives—and there are many 
flourishing ones in Quebec as young people learn to build 
financial strength by using their purchasing power—and there are 
increasing numbers of co-operatives in new areas as well. 
There are some in the Montreal area, and no doubt elsewhere, in the 
new field of electronics; one will be known as “La Puce”, another 
will make it possible to offer Internet sites to all community 
organizations in the Montreal area with large servers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore an area of high activity as far as sectors in 
the new economy are concerned, but the service sector is also 
represented, with housing and consumer co-operatives.  Finally, I 
have not mentioned workers' co-operatives, which also operate on 
different principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So these various kinds of co-operative operate on co-operative 
principles having to do with the various aspects of pooling capital 
and, in the case of workers, pooling the activities of an 
enterprise supplying work.  Therefore, even if the new principles 
in Bill C-5 do not affect them directly, they may be a cause of 
concern for these different kinds of co-operative that wish to 
continue to operate on a co-operative basis.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having done a little research, I must point out that, in the 
various countries modernizing  co-operative legislation, there are 
three approaches.  The first is to go with values, but this poses 
a problem because it depends on the kind of  co-operative involved. 
The second approach is to be pragmatic, but this raises concerns, 
and I am be inclined to think that Bill C-5 falls into this 
category.  The third approach is systemic and tries to respect the 
inherent logic behind the various co-operative principles as 
implemented in co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the stumbling blocks in Bill C-5? 
Once again, I repeat that, overall, the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Conseil québécois des co-opératives are in agreement with the bill 
as it stands.  But a few problems remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the major stumbling block, and I will conclude 
with this, is that this bill, the Canada Co-operatives Act, is 
modelled on the Canada Business Corporations Act.  This raises a 
structural problem, because a  co-operative is community owned.  A 
member of a  co-operative does not own a share in the  co-operative 
that he may sell as he wishes to whom he wishes.  One cannot 
therefore say that one is going to buy a share in a  co-operative and 
be a member of the  co-operative.  That is not how it works. 
If  co-operatives are successful, it is because they let it be known that 
they intend to be consumer, producer or worker  co-operatives, so they 
issue shares, which is why people then meet to achieve a common purpose 
stated in their bylaws. That is what co-operative officials' performance 
for instance is assessed against by their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operative members hold shares that they can sell back to the 
cooperative and the co-operative only. They are not free to sell their 
shares to whomsoever they wish; it is up to the co-operative to decide 
who will be allowed to join. This is a far cry from a business 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the entire legislation is modelled on the Canada Business 
Corporations Act, it is understandable that, even if an effort was made 
to adapt the spirit of the law, the corporations act sometimes shows 
through. 
As I said, I do realize that the intent was to update the Canada 
Cooperatives Act and enable co-operatives to secure new capital on the 
market, without interfering with the spirit of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this is the first major flaw, as far as I could see—I 
perused this very thick bill and checked also with others and these are 
the problems we found—in fact, the Conseil québécois des co-opératives 
even had a question about this—under the charter, co-operatives are 
not required by law to disclose for what purpose they were established. 
This is a very serious problem because, for one thing, how can members 
be asked to use the services provided by their co-operative if these can 
change?

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt there is room for improvement.  An improvement that 
could, one might say, be made fairly easily.  The reasons for the 
refusal to do so remain to be seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains some worrisome elements. For example 
clause 4, where once again the spirit is really that of a 
corporation, where control is defined as going to the person with 
control of 50% of the votes.  In my opinion, one shared by all 
those I spoke to about this, this is incompatible with the 
co-operative spirit.  This ia one example, but I will not go through 
the entire bill because it is a very long one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before Bill C-91, fears were expressed concerning the proposal 
made by the minister of the time, to the effect that co-operatives 
in Quebec, as in the other provinces, could choose to be registered 
under either a Quebec or a federal charter.  This problem has been 
corrected in this bill, and a co-operative must, in order to be 
federally chartered, carry out business in more than one province 
and have offices in more than one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows me to say that, given the rapidly changing 
markets, co-operatives can make acquisitions and find themselves in 
a position to be able to use the federal charter, hence the 
importance of taking the necessary time to study the wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two clauses that are the most serious grounds for concern 
are, however, those which deal with reserve splitting during the 
lifetime of a co-operative.  This is, one might say, hard to 
understand.  It could open the door to all sorts of abuse. 
I know that the response will be that this bill is an enabling one. 
That means that the co-operatives are not obliged to use all of the 
clauses, except that the bill, or the act, cannot be a sort of 
self-serve affair, either, where one helps oneself to the elements 
one wants; it cannot be like that without a real danger of moving 
away from the co-operative spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the answer may be “But the co-operative movement 
itself will protect the co-operative spirit”.  But it is hard to 
create the conditions that would allow that to be changed and then 
to say that it is up to the co-operative movement to do what has to 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important provision stipulates that only two thirds of the 
board will be made up of members, which could mean that 20%, if not 
more, of the board's membership would have investment shares. The danger 
would then be that decisions would not be made by members but by—shall 
we say—major investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another provision of the bill seeks to counter such an effect, but 
it remains to be seen whether it is adequate. In fact, the principle 
underlying the whole notion of co-operatives is that members must have 
control over major decisions, and that co-operatives must know what their 
mandate is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has its work cut out. Hopefully, it will have the 
time required to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that the legislation must be updated. Quebec has done it. 
I imagine the other provinces have also done it or will do it. Other 
countries have done it. It is not an easy task, given the rapid changes 
occurring in the market and the very stiff competition major 
co-operatives must face. Still, we should not throw the baby out with the 
bath water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear those who can help us deal with the issue, we will 
have to make sure the bill does not weaken but strengthens the 
co-operative movement, which is so greatly needed in Quebec and in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that co-operativess, as well as the Conseil 
québécois, as well as various professors—there are two chairs on 
co-operation in Montreal—will be pleased to provide advice to us, as 
they did when the Quebec government updated its legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some previous experience with co-operatives in Canada. I 
am a former director of the second largest credit union in

example of Canadian co-operatives. It was the very first credit 
union in Canada to be placed for public trading on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 is a legislative proposal prompted by a request from 
the Canadian Cooperatives Association to the federal government

Canada. The association made specific recommendations as to what 
it needed in the bill.  Bill C-5 contains the recommendations 
which the industry requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 will modernize the legislation affecting co-operatives

and responsibilities of directors.  It addresses the governance 
of the board of directors.  As a former co-operative director, I 
can assure the House that this section of the bill, in 
particular, is a very welcome measure. Under Bill C-5 the 
standards that apply to directors under the Canadian Business 
Corporations Act will now apply to co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also gives co-operatives access to the modern and 
flexible legislative tools such as the right to amalgamate, which 
is very important in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the people I represent, I can declare that this is 
a rare occasion.  My colleagues in the Reform Party, veterans of 
the previous Parliament, have assured me that it is a rare 
experience to find ourselves on the side of the House supporting 
a successful event accompanied by the lame side of the House, the 
government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the hon. member for Edmonton North, formerly the member for 
Beaver River, who is our most experienced team member admits that 
by working closely with Canadians and listening to the concerns 
of affected parties, the Liberals got it right this time just for 
a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention the deputy leader of the Reform Party because as a new 
member of Parliament representing a brand new constituency, she 
has taken the time to explain to me, a rookie MP from British 
Columbia, that she can remember very few times in the House when 
she could cast her vote in support of a Tory or Liberal 
government initiative. We rely on her sage wisdom. She has seen 
almost every flat footed, maniac antic of Tory and Liberal 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has seen hundreds of millions of dollars go to Bombardier in 
Quebec. Bombardier always remembers the Tories or the Liberals at 
election time, of course, depending on which party is most likely 
to win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has seen Liberal and Tory cabinet ministers, MPs and party 
hacks brought up on all kinds of charges of bad behaviour, 
questionable conduct and things that extend to criminal acts and 
RCMP investigations.  Surely, it must have been our deputy leader 
who coined the phrase, Liberal-Tory, same old story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These days in question period she is trying to find out how the 
current Liberal government has rigged it so that 70% of the 
companies that get hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts 
from the Canadian International Development Agency are the same 
companies that give hundreds of thousands of dollars to the 
Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine, companies that get CIDA contracts are 70 times more 
likely to have given money to the Liberal Party of Canada than 
any other company.  A group of companies directed by former 
Liberal cabinet minister, Marc Lalonde, has donated a whopping 
$80,000 to the Liberals in the last two years and the payoff is 
$80 million in CIDA contracts. This situation is unacceptable and 
almost unbelievable.

a surprise, we are looking into this matter.  This is a matter 
for accountability.  I refer to this simply because we are amazed 
and surprised how this bill is presented and quoted by them.  I 
will go to my debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party whip, the hon. member from Fraser Valley, has 
researched this same sort of behaviour by the Liberals which I 
mentioned earlier.  I believe that there is a need to mention 
this because it is pertinent and important here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He found that a Montreal accounting firm that gave $87,000 to 
the Liberals over the past few years has received $20 million in 
contracts from CIDA.  I suppose that the true reason that the 
Liberals have it right this time with respect to Bill C-5 is that 
somebody else wrote this bill for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have, in fact, very little to do with this bill. 
That is the reason my colleague from the other side has pointed 
out, because they have to do very little to this bill, that it is 
not written by them.  It is given to them by the co-operative 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would guess that most of the Liberal backbenchers, especially 
the neglected, lonely and largely unknown members from Ontario 
may not have even read Bill C-5.  Liberal MPs who are not in the 
cabinet do not have to read this bill because they are told by 
their Liberal Party whip how they are supposed to cast their 
vote, how to behave in committee and what to say in the media and 
to their constituents.  Their whip does all those things for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good constituents of Surrey Central know that, as their 
member of Parliament, I am free to vote the will of my 
constituents.  My constituents tell me, not my party whip, how to 
cast the vote of Surrey Central in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I point out that this legislation was written for the 
Liberals by the co-operatives in Canada to modernize the current 
definition of co-operative basis, improve the governance rules, 
increase financing possibilities, amalgamation and other 
flexibilities needed by many of Canada's co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, my constituents and I are glad to be of some service 
and assistance to the more than 10,000 co-operatives operating in 
Canada by casting the vote Surrey Central has in this House in 
favour of approving the passage of this Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most sectors of the Canadian economy have co-operatives. 
Co-operatives have been a very successful component in our 
economy.  In fact, many co-operatives are non-financial 
co-operatives.  These co-operatives serve many sectors of our 
economy, including agriculture, consumers, fishing, forestry, 
health, child care, housing and community development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest amount of co-operatives in Canada exist in the 
agriculture sector.  These co-operatives include marketing 
co-operatives as well as those involved in supply, production and 
services.

Canadian co-operatives have over 14.1 million members, which is 
about half of the population of this wonderful country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we are anxious to support anything 
which will help Canadians continue to be employed.  We want to do 
everything we can to create jobs.  We want to ensure fair 
treatment of the small business community and our co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 will assist in ensuring a level playing field for our 
co-operatives to be competitive in the business industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting an initiative that will modernize and assist the 
work of co-operatives in Canada, Bill C-5 will do something to 
help overtaxed Canadians who are struggling to find jobs. The 
Liberal Party has done nothing to create jobs for unemployed 
Canadians; however, it has killed jobs with taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The billions of dollars the Liberals have spent on 
infrastructure—which is the wrong approach since the Liberals 
have no vision—have failed to change the unemployment rate in 
Canada since 1993.  For 86 consecutive months Canada's 
unemployment rate has been hovering at about 9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative movement in Canada now reaches most sectors of 
the Canadian economy.  Canadians co-operatives compete head to 
head with national and international businesses and corporations. 
It is important that the federal government support this 
movement, particularly with the globalization of businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports measures to ensure the successful 
operation of the marketplace, including promoting competition. 
We recognize private sector investment as an important source of 
capital for Canadian businesses, unlike the Liberals, who have 
been patting themselves on their backs day after day, even in 
question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the private sector is the key to job creation in 
Canada.  Small and medium size firms in Canada could create more 
jobs if they were not taxed to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most jobs in Canada are created by small business.  That is not 
what the Liberals believe.  They continue to spend hard earned 
tax dollars on public make-work programs which provide few short 
term jobs.  Ask any Liberal on the other side and he or she will 
put you to sleep rambling on about what the Liberal government 
has done to create jobs for Canadians.  Any Liberal spin doctor 
can give you a seemingly endless litany of things the Liberals 
have done to create jobs, but we know that the Liberals just do 
not have it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments do not create jobs.  People create jobs.  Our small 
businesses and entrepreneurs create jobs, but they cannot do that 
when the smiling Minister of Finance cripples their businesses 
with taxes.  How can they do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have reduced the deficit by increasing taxes.  They 
have frozen the unemployment rate since they took over the reins 
of the federal government from the Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 is a good bill because it addresses the needs of the 
private sector.  Canada's private sector is in the best position 
to determine what it needs to be competitive.  For once, we have 
the Liberals allowing the federal government to respond to the 
needs of the private sector.  It is a miracle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, but it appears that the Liberals are allowing us 
to have a debate on Bill C-5.  We were only allowed to debate 
Bill C-2, which was the largest tax increase in Canadian history, 
for a very brief time, less than seven hours.  Following that the 
Liberals only allowed one day, a couple of hours, for Bill C-10 
to be debated in the House.  It was another tax grab.  That we 
are allowed to debate Bill C-5 is another miracle.  I hope that I 
will continue to see such miracles in this House for all bills 
which come before the House in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House give a clear warning to the 
Liberals that we do not want debate on any bill to be suddenly 
cancelled, particularly those which dig deep into the pockets of 
Canadians.

Never before in the history of our country has any government 
shut down a commission of judicial inquiry.  The Liberals did. 
The Somalia inquiry was only two-thirds of the way through its 
work when the Liberals shut it down.  The inquiry was very close 
to analysing events at the department of defence that took place 
under the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-10, the bill that only saw the light of this House for a 
matter of a few short hours before the Liberals shut down debate, 
we saw that the Liberals cannot even do something as simple as 
negotiate a tax treaty with another country without trying to 
figure out a way to squeeze more money out of the already 
overtaxed Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income tax take has been rising steadily in this country.  The 
Liberals are balancing the budget on the backs of Canadian 
taxpayers.  Canadians know that the average family's purchasing

revenues have increased significantly since the Liberals have 
been in power.

Besides, if we start dealing with what the Reform Party has done wrong,

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</b>  Yes, Madam Speaker, I appreciate that 
but on the other side, I have to justify why we are supporting 
this bill.  What we have seen in the past on the other side is 
why we have to mention these things.  These are bitter truths.  I 
am not making up these figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has just introduced the largest tax hike in 
Canada, a 73% increase in CPP premiums, that will cost $10 
billion to the Canadian taxpayers.  Those are the reasons why we 
have to mention these things.  They are the ones who are not 
creating jobs.  On this side of the House we have to say these 
things because we will support any motion or bill that will 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize what I have been saying, Canadians want our federal 
government to be effective and efficient in terms of leading our 
nation to prosperity.  Bill C-5 is a lesson for the Liberals.  If 
they do their work honestly and well then everyone in this House 
can give their support to such work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals are pork-barreling, when they are handing out 
patronage appointments, when they turn their backs on the victims 
of crime, when they hide their heads in the sand like ostriches

private sector to be competitive in the global economy, we will 
hold the government's feet to the fire.

I am casting my vote in support of Bill C-5 and the strengthening 
of co-operatives in Canada.

with respect to what he was saying and, of course, in typical 
Reform fashion, preaching the politics of fear and the politics 
of doom and gloom.  It struck me, that wonderful picture we saw 
in the paper today of Frederik Eaton with the Leader of the 
Opposition, whether or not that was the kind of thing they were 
discussing last night at the fund-raising dinner held in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, the government has created over the course of

</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have to do, which the hon. member should do sometime, is 
look at the evidence.  The evidence indicates that we have the 
lowest interest rates that we have had for 30 years, housing 
starts are up, growth is up and consumer sales are up. The 
government has done a very good job, unlike what the member 
opposite would lead Canadians to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was most intrigued by his statement with respect to how he 
reflects his constituents.  I wonder if he could lay out 
precisely for the House how he goes about scientifically taking 
the pulse of what his constituents tell him to say on any given 
issue.  I would be interested in hearing whether he polls, 
whether he has town hall meetings, what he does to ensure that 
all the people in his riding have their voices heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to answer 
the hon. member's question.  He did not read Bill C-5.  He has no 
concrete question to ask on the bill so he is asking a question 
on what he believes he has been doing on the other side when his 
whip tells him to vote in support of the bill or against the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we keep completely in touch with our 
constituents.  We meet with them frequently.  We have a free 
right to vote on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sent a survey to my constituents asking for their views on

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member from Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today on the occasion of second reading to the proposed 
legislation regarding the Canada co-operatives act.  This bill 
marks another step in this government's effort to provide modern 
up to date framework laws that establish fair and efficient 
marketplace rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past we have passed legislation to modernize and 
streamline laws from bankruptcy, insolvency to copyright.  These 
framework laws are an important part of Industry Canada's 
contribution to the government's jobs and growth agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us deals with non-financial co-operatives. 
Financial co-ops or credit unions were reformed in the last 
parliament with the passage of the Co-operative Credit 
Associations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of Canada's co-operatives can be found when we look at 
the kinds of principles they instil in their members and their 
communities, principles such as democratic control and concern 
for their members, principles such as community development and 
education for the young.  For the better part of this century 
co-operatives have prospered in Canada as an alternative form to 
business enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In communities across Canada co-operatives have proven that it 
is possible to flourish in a market economy with principles that 
emphasize community participation, democratic equality and 
co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, it is true that even though co-ops are a unique 
and distinctive form of business organization they nevertheless 
compete in a market economy against business corporations.  For 
example, retail co-operatives compete against the Canadian Tires, 
the Loblaws, the Wal-Marts, the Price Clubs and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Survival in this marketplace depends on innovation and 
flexibility.  It depends on getting the best advice from board 
members who are knowledgeable of the business world.  In this 
environment co-operatives have been competing for years with 
their hands tied behind their backs because the marketplace 
framework laws governing these organizations restrict their 
freedom to make some choices needed to respond to changing 
demands, to changing competition and to changing markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These co-operative associations work closely with their members. 
They discuss their draft model act within the co-operative 
movement.  When they have a draft bill ready they approach the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, responsible for 
co-operatives, and the Minister of Industry, responsible for 
marketplace framework laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good way of preparing legislation, working 
co-operatively with organizations and the government in 
partnership to make things happen. 
I hope we see more of these examples in the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada had to assure itself that the draft legislation 
met the requirements of the contemporary marketplace framework 
laws.  The bill before us governs co-operatives that are 
incorporated federally.  Most non-financial co-operatives are 
incorporated in the province in which they do business.  This 
means the bill before us today affects only a small portion of 
non-financial co-operatives in Canada.  But the relatively small 
number of businesses affected directly by this bill should not 
detract from the importance of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill creates a Canada co-operatives act that provides 
co-operatives with the same flexibility now enjoyed by federally 
incorporated businesses.  However, it still maintains the key 
co-operative principles essential in any co-operative 
legislation.  It leaves the choice to adopt the new business 
oriented measures in the hands of the membership, the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help co-operatives compete more effectively in the 
marketplace, the bill provides more flexibility to recruit 
directors from outside the membership.  At least two-thirds of 
directors of the co-operative have to be members or 
representatives of those members of co-operatives, corporations 
or entities. One-third of the board can be from outside.  If the 
co-op issues investment shares, members will decide on that.  In 
each case it is the members who decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, this bill enables the co-operatives to draw on 
the expertise of those who can help guide the co-operative 
whether or not they are members of the co-operative themselves. 
At the same time, however, the members themselves continue to make 
the fundamental decisions that set the rules for the co-op. These 
include the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, the right to 
make proposals at any annual meeting and the ability to request 
special meetings of the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this bill gives co-operatives the best of both worlds. 
It continues to promote the distinctive features of co-operatives 
that have made them such an important force in Canada's economy. 
At the same it provides a modern, flexible, business type set of 
tools to allow co-ops to compete against other forms of business 
on a level playing field.  I hope hon. members will join me in 
supporting this bill.

rise today to speak on a bill that is so important for the health and 
prosperity of the Canadian economy, especially as far as rural and 
remote communities are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about co-operatives in sectors like agriculture, 
fisheries and forestry, co-operatives providing energy to remote 
communities and serving aboriginal communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of 1995 there were over 617,000 members of agricultural 
co-operatives in Canada.  These co-ops were responsible for 
almost $16.3 billion in sales.  Types of co-ops in the 
agricultural sector include marketing co-ops which account for 
34% of the membership and realize 73% of the revenue.  They are 
responsible for marketing some 57% of the market share in dairy 
products, 59% in the grains and oilseed sector and 47% in the 
poultry and egg sector.

in Canada. It is represented in the yogurt and fresh deserts sector by 
Ultima Foods Inc., a company co-owned by Agropur and Agrifoods 
International Co-operative Limited, of British Columbia. In 1995, 
Agropur's sales figure exceeded $1 billion. It has 4,500 members and 
2,200 employees.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agricultural co-ops also include those involved in production 
and services.  One of the most successful producer co-ops is the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the largest co-op in Canada.  It was 
formed by farmers in 1924 to handle their wheat harvest.  It has 
come a long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 it had annual sales of almost $3 billion and handled 60% 
of the total grain movement in the province.  In recent years it 
has successfully diversified into valued added processing, bakery 
supply and manufacturing, fertilizer manufacturing, an ethanol 
plant, biotechnology development and a host of other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the impact of co-operatives in the energy sector in 
Alberta.  At one time the rural electrification program carried 
out by co-operatives in Alberta accounted for almost 90% of the 
electricity supplied to the province's farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those co-ops are fewer in number today.  Many of them have sold 
their assets and responsibilities to power companies, but even 
while the number of co-ops in Alberta's electricity grid is 
decreasing the importance of natural gas co-ops to supply Alberta 
farms is increasing.  In 1995 these co-operatives accounted for 
over 54% of the total sales of energy co-operatives in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer co-operatives are also having an influence on the 
rural economy.  Federated Co-operatives Limited, a federally 
regulated co-operative, is the second largest Canadian co-operative 
in terms of revenue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 it earned $2.1 billion in sales.  It is a supply, 
production and services co-operative that provides retail co-ops 
with food, petroleum, seed, hardware and building products, crop 
supplies, livestock feed and family fashions.  It also provides a 
number of support services such as training, as well as computer, 
audit, advertising, legal and communication services.  It owns 
the Consumers Co-operative Refineries Limited of Regina, seven 
feed plants, a plywood plant, a sawmill and the Grocery People 
Limited retail chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fishery sector co-operatives have managed through the 
tough times since the 1992 cod moratorium.  Their strength lies 
in their people.  During tough times these people stand together 
behind their co-op.  We have a situation, for example, where 
despite the moratorium there are still over 9,000 members of 
fishing co-operatives.  We can find a number of success stories 
in the fishing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Prince Edward Island the Tignish Fisheries Co-operative 
Limited has be canning lobster since 1925.  It has 250 employees 
and in 1995 had $14 million in sales.  As production moves from 
canning to specialty packaging the co-op expects that it will 
need to hire more people and keep them working longer. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forestry co-operatives are enjoying phenomenal success.  Their 
membership has increased by more than 63% between 1985 and 1995, 
and their revenue has gone up 247%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are doing particularly well in Quebec.  In the 
Saguenay—Lac-St-Jean region, for instance, the Co-opérative 
forestière Laterrière-Saint-Honoré has a payroll of some $5.4 
million and sales of $30 million.  It is involved in forest 
management, logging, and production of seedlings, as well as 
sawmill and planing operations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the important place that 
co-operatives have in the economy of aboriginal communities.  By 
1995 there were 76 aboriginal co-operatives in Canada.  They are 
especially strong in the Northwest Territories and northern 
Quebec.  In fact these co-operatives have more than 20,000 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives are big business for the rural economy and in 
communities far from urban centres without losing sight of the 
community values that led to their creation in the first place. 
They are big businesses that pursue the interest of their members 
as a whole.  They are big businesses that have shown Canadians 
another way to operate in a market economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future of co-operatives in Canada is integral to the future 
of the economy in rural and remote areas.  The bill before us 
gives these organizations the tools they need to keep on 
contributing to the economic growth of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative movement has a long and distinguished history 
of helping people in smaller communities.  It goes back 150 years 
to when the first modern co-op was formed by the weavers of the 
village of Rochdale in Britain. 
By the turn of the century there were thousands of co-operatives 
throughout Europe and a growing co-op movement in Canada.  The 
movement gained momentum with the birth of the prairie wheat 
pools at the beginning of this century.

co-operatives must evolve in turn.  The Canadian Co-operative 
Association and the Conseil canadien de la co-opération submitted 
the model legislation, which includes the amendments they would 
like to see incorporated in the draft bill.  The Minister of 
Industry and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food have 
examined it carefully and have circulated a working document 
containing their analysis. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the best tradition of the co-operative movement this bill 
comes from the people.  It is not a top down statute designed by 
government departments to remedy perceived problems.  It is a 
bill created by the very people who know best what they need to 
maintain a healthy and vibrant co-op movement for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the bill is entirely in keeping with the 
government's own stated aims and objectives.  I see the bill as a 
key element in the government's commitment to strengthen the 
rural economy.  It is a commitment we made in the Speech from the 
Throne when the government made the economic renewal of rural 
Canada a priority for this session of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said it would address the problems facing rural 
Canadians in a way that is tailored to their needs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives them these tools.  I urge the House to pass it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, everyone is 
interested in co-operatives.  I have a particular interest in them, 
since there are agricultural co-operatives in my riding.  Naturally, 
many of my constituents are members of caisses populaires, and even 
the weekly newspaper in my riding belongs to a co-operative with 
several hundred members.  This weekly owns the riding's radio 
station, CKNU FM, at 100.9, which broadcasts news about the 
Portneuf area from Quebec City to Trois-Rivières. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So you will understand that, when the topic of co-operatives 
comes up, I am not just interested but very much involved because 
it is a topic of importance not just in my region but in Quebec 
and, as I can see, in Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other speakers for the Bloc Quebecois mentioned earlier, we 
are going to support this bill in principle.  There are certain 
provisions that worry us, however, and I would like to ask our hon. 
colleague on the government side why, in the case of housing 
co-operatives, for example, the procedures for dissolution are 
different from those of other co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the reason for these differences?  Could she clarify 
this for us?  I await her reply. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Susan Whelan:</b>   Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives are associations of individuals who work together, 
volunteer and pool their resources.  There are many differences 
among the different types of co-ops.  As I said earlier co-ops 
are found in fishing, agriculture, housing and community 
development initiatives.  They all have slight differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member is aware there are differences for 
co-ops because they serve different purposes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member made a very eloquent speech on 
co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very interested in her views on something happening today 
that will have a negative effect on the ability of Canadians to 
create jobs: the CPP premium hike that will take place by the 
beginning of next year. 
This hike will almost double the premiums on CPP payments 
Canadians from coast to coast will have to pay.  It will double 
the premiums of those who are independently employed and 
employable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  A number of discussions this afternoon 
have gone totally away from the subject at hand, Bill C-5 and 
co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for your direction, Mr. Speaker.  I think it would be good 
in debate if we stuck to the topic of Bill C-5 and co-operatives 
rather than go all the way around the world to all those other 
things that have absolutely no relevancy to co-operatives and 
associations that worked so hard with the government to get the 
legislation to where it is today.  I ask for your assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  The hon. member is 
quite correct.  We have to keep the debate relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in trying to figure out, as were other members, 
how the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca would weave his 
comments into a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give the remaining time to the hon. member for Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Susan Whelan:</b>  Mr. Speaker, Department of Finance 
officials have been consulted on Bill C-5.  They have indicated 
that there are no foreseeable tax implications for co-operatives 
under the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure why the hon. member would go off on another issue, 
but there are no tax implications in the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a real honour to represent the people of St. John's West. This 
is my first speech in the House, after having asked a couple of 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although having represented a riding called Ferryland, part of 
St. John's West, in the Newfoundland legislature for about 17 
years I am pretty reluctant to call my first speech a maiden 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the people from the constituency of St. John's West for 
giving me this tremendous honour.  It is a real honour for anyone 
to come here and serve the people of Canada.  I am very grateful 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be a little remiss if I did not also thank the wonderful 
team I had who helped me put together my campaign which was very 
successful in getting me to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow I will be making a real speech about some Newfoundland 
issues.  Just so that people understand, one of the duties of 
parliamentarians besides representing their own constituents is 
to be a critic of certain industries and certain portfolios in 
government.  My critic responsibility is industry where the 
co-operative legislation lies.  Thus today I will debate the bill 
on co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 is a good piece of legislation.  It will be supported 
by all colleagues in the Conservative caucus.  It is a piece of 
legislation that has evolved after much discussion with many of 
the principals and parties involved, many levels of government, 
and the associations of co-operatives both in Quebec and in the 
rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not very often that we will see such a large degree of 
co-operation in the House of Commons.  Co-operatives involve 
people organizing around a common goal, usually not for profit 
but rather for the economic benefit of their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might point out in my first chance to speak in the House of 
Commons the purpose of Canada in the beginning: a group of people 
organizing together for common goals where everybody works for 
the good of everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short period of time I have been here I have seen that 
some of us have forgotten that principle of Canada, the principle 
of co-operation, the principle of a co-operative, the idea we 
should work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now all broken down into the regions of Canada and each 
region seems to lose some of its empathy and compatibility with 
the rest of Canada.  That is most unfortunate and something that 
simply should not be allowed to continue in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives come from the grassroots movement.  As such 
ordinary people are trying to make their ordinary lives a little 
better by organizing in certain elements which we now call 
co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives are also in many ways leaders in our community in 
environmental issues.  They think the economies they are involved 
with must be sustainable and must not do any damage to the 
environment. 
As such I want to commend many of the co-operatives in this 
country for taking a very progressive leadership role on the 
environment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many co-operatives—I presume all co-operatives—are committed 
to Canadian economic prosperity.  They do this through links with 
other international co-operative associations and in doing so 
they are able to participate in worldwide trade and many 
marketing ventures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing research on Bill C-5 I found the role which 
co-operatives have played in Canada to be absolutely amazing. It 
started back in the 1800s with the Mutual Farm Insurance Company. 
By the late 1800s farmers wanted to have the same security in 
producing and marketing their products as successful large 
businesses.  The farmers decided it was in their best interests 
to band together to gain better control over the marketing of 
their products and purchases.  Today agricultural co-operatives 
play a major role in the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with my colleague from 
Brandon—Souris, who will elaborate on and emphasize the 
importance of agricultural co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agricultural co-ops supply 36% of fertilizer and chemical sales. 
They have over 221,000 members and employ 18,000 people full 
time.  That is something which I, coming from Newfoundland, would 
not have understood if I was not the critic responsible for 
debating Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also many fishery and forestry co-operatives.  I was 
involved with a fishery co-operative in the small town of Petty 
Harbour, Newfoundland, where fishermen had real difficulty in 
marketing and selling their product.  They formed their own 
co-operative.  Although they ran into the same difficulties which 
all of the Newfoundland fishing companies ran into, they 
certainly showed that if people in small communities want to pool 
their resources and work together then success stories can 
evolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many consumer co-operatives in Canada.  In 1995 there 
were 582 consumer co-operatives, with almost three million 
members.  In 1995 there were also 28 health care co-operatives 
that generated $268.3 million in revenue and had over 316,000 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are child care co-operatives that involve either day care 
or nursery school services.  In 1995 there were 437 day care and 
nursery school co-ops in Canada.  Where would all those children 
receive their day care and nursery schooling if these co-ops were 
not in place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives in many areas play a very major role in our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also housing co-operatives.  The number of housing 
co-operatives has been on the rise since the mid-1970s. In 1995 
there were 1,946 housing co-ops across the country, with over 
107,000 members.  When I was campaigning in St. John's West I 
encountered people who were members of a housing co-op.  They 
were very upset that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 
the agency which had funded their co-op, seemed to have classed 
them in with social housing, which is a different kind of 
housing, and was becoming reluctant to get further involved in 
co-op housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to the participants of the project which I visited that 
day.  They are very soundly proud of having co-op housing, which 
was funded through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are workers co-operatives, which reflects the need for 
people to have more control over their own employment.  In 1995 
there were 225 of these co-operatives, with about 14,000 members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, there are more than 7,000 non-financial 
co-operatives operating in Canada, with over 4.5 million members. 
Therefore it is important that we examine Bill C-5 to see exactly 
what it means because it affects so many Canadians in so many 
different ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our role in the House is to do what we are doing today. Although 
I said that Bill C-5 is an excellent bill, and there has been a 
lot of discussion, there are still small parts of it which we 
want to discuss.  I am sure we can do that in committee at a 
future time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the principle of a co-operative is to function outside a 
market economy, it must nonetheless respond to the same pressures 
and logic of that market.  Therefore competition compels 
co-operatives to adopt the operating style and environment of the 
market oriented firms which dominate our economy.  This point has 
fueled the necessity for change in this legislative environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also why the proposed changes in Bill C-5 mirror some of 
the existing rights for businesses which are granted under the 
Canada Business Corporations Act.  Thus it is called enabling 
legislation.  Powers are expanded and existing rules are 
clarified, but no co-operative is forced to change the way it 
currently operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the provinces have been updating their co-operative 
legislation over the years, there have been no changes to 
modernize the framework of the federal legislation since its 
inception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals put forward by all of the co-operative 
associations, both in Quebec and in Canada, were based on 
consultations with both memberships. 
As previously mentioned, the most notable feature was that the 
changes would more closely align the Canada Co-operatives 
Association Act with the Canada Business Corporation Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to get these changes moving forward, adding more 
flexibility, more competitiveness and the principle of using 
surplus funds to allow members to access additional funds for 
expansion.  Finally the principle of education is also 
emphasized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an important principle in this bill which reduces 
ministerial authority, which is always good in legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that Bill C-5 is not a controversial 
bill.  Agreement between all parties was slow.  It took over five 
years to develop.  I believe a reasonable compromise was reached. 
Overall this bill is a positive step in bringing co-operatives 
into the 21st century by making them more flexible, more 
efficient and more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in Bill C-5 are wide scale adjustments but I am 
confident the overall co-op membership of some 4.5 million 
Canadians will benefit greatly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I want to take the opportunity 
to congratulate the member for St. John's West on his maiden 
speech.  As he said, he has had much practice before, but I would 
like to welcome him to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to welcome him to the industry committee.  Although 
his title might be industry critic, I know that there are many 
items that we can work on in co-operation.  I would also like to 
thank him for sticking to the topic of Bill C-5 and 
co-operatives, like the Bloc and the NDP but unlike the official 
opposition who went off topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important when we are talking about a bill like Bill C-5 
that we do stick to the topic and put our best foot forward at 
all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentary secretary I would like to ask the member 
whether he has had a chance to discuss with the co-operatives in 
his area and surrounding areas the improvements that have been 
suggested in Bill C-5 and how will it benefit his area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Charlie Power:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously in Newfoundland we do not have the same degree of 
co-operatives as there are in western Canada.  We do have several 
very successful fishing co-ops, one being Fogo Island co-op which 
has been in existence for many years and has been a model for 
many of the smaller co-ops in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Newfoundland Teachers Credit Union of which I was a 
member for many of my earlier years when I was teaching.  It is a 
very successful credit union and it gives excellent services to 
the people of St. John's West and to Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we might have missed in Newfoundland was a 
greater degree of co-operation and the co-operatives which could 
have resulted from that.  I mentioned the Petty Harbour co-op. 
The community was catching lots of fish in the early 80s, but had 
no means to sell that fish, no means to process it.  Through the 
leadership of people like Mike Hearn and Tom Best in that 
community they ran a pretty successful co-op for a period of 
time, but then ran into fishery problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives in Newfoundland could play a much greater role. 
One of the greatest problems we have in Newfoundland is finding 
access to capital for small business.  The Canadian banking 
establishment does not aggressively get involved in the 
Newfoundland business community.  Maybe co-operatives could play 
an active role there as well.  I hope to see it grow over the 
years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I also 
support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the hon. member that back in Saint John, New 
Brunswick we have a lot of co-operative housing.  Under CMHC it 
has been very successful.  I hope that members of the government 
will take a look at that program.  My understanding is that CMHC 
is cutting back on the program and cutting out co-op housing.  We 
have over 700 families looking for housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member if he will do some work for us on that 
because he has stated there is a need.  We see the need as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Charlie Power:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted to 
check with Canada Mortgage and Housing officials to see exactly 
where their program now stands.  I know that during the election 
campaign in St. John's West it was of great concern to some 
persons who were in co-op housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to members opposite that it is an excellent program.  It 
probably does not really cost the Government of Canada any money 
because the money gets repaid.  I just hope it continues to put 
some emphasis on those types of programs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate your recognizing me to speak as my colleague has 
shared his time.  I have 10 minutes, although I would like to 
hear the hon. member from across the way.  I am sure I can stay 
in the House and hear his words of wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleague will not ask as many questions of me as she 
did of my colleague from St. John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected, not that many months ago, I said that 
when good legislation was put forward by the government I would 
make sure that I congratulated them and that I would speak 
positively on positive legislation. Coming from Manitoba and 
western Canada, the birth place of co-operatives, I stand today 
to say that this legislation is very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wherever I walk in my community or in my constituency I 
constantly see examples of co-operatives, whether they are 
agricultural co-operatives, housing co-operatives or a media 
co-op which has been developed within the constituency of 
Brandon—Souris.  Being the birth place of co-ops, I appreciate 
that legislation from the 1970s is being updated to the 1990s and 
into the 21st century so that co-operatives can compete in a very 
competitive age that we have currently with the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also say that I will not stray, as has been mentioned 
earlier.  I am not prepared to stand up here and talk about 
issues such as Stornoway or hypocrisy or things of that nature. I 
would like to speak to the very positive nature of the 
legislation put forward, as did my colleague from St. John's 
West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all recognize, co-operatives really are the grassroots of 
industry and commerce.  It started in western Canada in the late 
1880s and in fact was put forward because individuals wanted to 
work together.  They wanted to, as the name suggests, co-operate 
with one another, put their resources, assets and abilities 
together so that they could, in a non-profit way, make sure that 
they had opportunities to compete with the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the late 1800s, the farmers were the ones who wished to make 
sure that they took up this opportunity in agriculture.  In the 
FP-500 ranking in 1995, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool does $2.7 
billion worth of business in western Canada.  The Alberta Wheat 
Pool does $1.5 billion worth of business.  The Manitoba Pool 
Elevators does $744 million.  These are 1995 figures.  I can 
assure members that the numbers are much larger in 1997 numbers, 
to the point where the Manitoba Pool Elevators have shown a 
record profit.  When I use the term profit, it is profit that 
goes back to the owners of that particular co-operative which in 
fact are the members of that co-operative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also say that we have, by example, in western Canada one 
of the co-operatives that is vying constantly for first place 
with that of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and that is the 
Federated Co-operatives.  They are a wholesaler.  They make sure 
that they supply retail to these other co-operatives and are 
extremely successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have co-operatives, as my hon. colleague has said, in 
the Atlantic provinces.  They have the Co-op Atlantic.  I have to 
say that simply because I sit beside the hon. member for Saint 
John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</b>  You had better believe it or you won't 
be able to sit at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b> Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of the 1970 Canada Cooperatives Association 
Act were based on provincial legislation dating back to the 
early 20th century.  While the provinces have been constantly 
updating their co-operative acts, as provinces normally are ahead 
of the federal government, it is about time the federal 
government caught up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commented and complimented the government on bringing this 
legislation forward and I continue to do so, but I should also 
say that it was done through the co-operation of the Canadian 
Cooperatives Association.  It was the co-operatives themselves 
who wanted to bring forward legislation that was going to allow 
them to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it rather interesting and rather appropriate that 
national co-op week was held October 12 to October 18.  Members 
were not in the House during that period, which is unfortunate. 
The theme of national co-op week this year was co-operation now 
more than ever.  I believe sincerely that theme in itself speaks 
also to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation allows a number of things.  First and foremost, 
it allows the ability to capitalize in a different fashion from 
what they have been allowed to do in the past.  They now have the 
ability to go public, to sell shares in corporations, which they 
never had before.  It allows them to capitalize 
so they can expand and put more assets back into the 
co-operative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation requires two-thirds or more of the membership to 
make changes to a co-operative.  That is very important.  You 
must be flexible in today's global economy to be able to deal 
with the issues that are going to face the co-operatives not only 
now but in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one minor issue that we will be able to discuss at 
committee, members' dissenting rights.  I will not get into the 
detail now but there are some obvious issues that have to be 
dealt with in terms of dissenting rights.  The question is not 
whether members should have the ability to dissent, because they 
should.  They are members of a co-operative and have every right 
to do so.  The legislation speaks to a timeframe, and that 
timeframe is a period of five years to pay out dissenters of 
their equity in the co-op. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of co-ops want to merge, which they did not have the 
ability to do under the old legislation.  Now I am sure they 
would like to in order to compete with the major corporate 
structure.  In dissenting rights I think timeframe has to be 
dealt with.  It has to be talked out in committee and perhaps an 
extension of the timeframe could be arranged.  Instead of five 
years perhaps there could be an extension of years so co-ops will 
not be dealt with adversely if they have dissenters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill attempts to balance member rights with corporate 
directorate.  It also allows the directors now on the co-ops to 
have a 20% non-membership make-up, which again is very important 
to bring in new ideas, new people and new capital to the co-op 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides for alternate dispute resolution assistance from the 
federal government with regard to grievances between co-operatives 
and their members.  Again, it is very positive to have that 
dispute settling mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 makes changes to the rules governing a corporation.  It 
permits co-operatives to incorporate provided they operate on a 
co-operative basis, again very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 introduced the concept of natural persons when 
describing co-operatives.  As a result they are awarded the same 
rights and privileges as natural persons.  This is instead of 
detailing the various rights, powers, privileges individually. It 
also is in keeping with the same rights now awarded to business 
corporations and mirrors the powers some province already offer 
co-operatives, a harmonization of legislation from provinces to 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 makes changes to the rules governing the issue of 
shares, which is very important.  The conditions of issuing 
membership shares are set out in the corporation charter.  Bill 
C-5 will permit co-operatives with share capital to issue 
investment shares to their members and to the public.  This is 
provided the members have agreed to do so and have set out the 
rules in the charter bylaws.  Traditionally co-ops have looked 
only to their members to finance their operations.  This is 
probably the most important aspect of the legislation that has 
been put forward. It is very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government along with the Canadian Cooperatives Association 
has put forward an excellent piece of legislation.  It is 
important that we do allow co-operatives, people working with 
people in order to make it better for co-operatives, to compete 
in today's global economy and global society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay—Nipigon, Lib.):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for allowing me to ask a question of my 
colleague from Brandon—Souris.  His most fortunate experience 
since coming to the House has been that he is fortunate enough to 
sit beside the member for Saint John. I am sure that if he pays 
attention he will find much wisdom in his seat mate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of co-operative housing, in the area he 
represents and in the area in Saskatchewan, as we heard earlier 
from the spokesperson for the New Democratic Party, and the 
federal involvement in co-operative housing has really been a 
success story in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only relate my own parochial and personal interest 
inasmuch as we have several co-operative housing ventures in the 
area I represent in Thunder Bay, one being the Castlegreen 
co-operative housing venture.  I have visited Castlegreen on many 
occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to express exactly what I see when I drive into 
Castlegreen.  First there is the pride of ownership among all the 
residents.  It is about the best well kept area in the whole of 
our community of Thunder Bay.  They have the community spirit 
that I do not see in any other communities.  It is due to the 
residents who live there.  It is interesting because many people 
who live in this co-operative housing area are physically 
challenged.  Although they are physically challenged they 
participate in all the activities that go on in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member for Brandon—Souris is on the Sask 
wheat pool that he mentioned, as did the member who spoke for the 
NDP.  I have a concern about the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, it 
being one of the largest co-operatives referred to.  I read in 
the last while that it became a member of the Toronto Stock 
Exchange and is selling its stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member could explain how it can be a co-operative 
and be a corporation selling shares on a public exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I met 
with the executive of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool on a number of 
occasions.  It has a number of subsidiary companies, one which 
is referred to as AgPro which has a number of retail enterprises 
developed into its whole co-operative structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what I spoke about, allowing co-operatives to 
compete in the global economy and in the economy that we have 
developed today in this great country of ours. The Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool has gone public. It has sold shares.  They are 
non-voting shares.  It is allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about dissenting rights. They have in the province of 
Saskatchewan dissenting rights.  Those members of the 
co-operative who do not wish to be part of that co-operative 
based on a share structure can with their equity get out of that 
particular corporation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not happen, quite frankly, because the members of that 
co-operative found that the direction they were heading in with the 
share offering they made was quite successful.  The dollars 
generated from that share offering were used to capitalize the 
co-operative to compete further against other member 
co-operatives, the Manitoba and Alberta pools, as well as the 
private sector. They were able to put up sufficient assets to 
compete with the private sector.  So it has been very positive 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will allow the same thing to happen with any 
co-operative if it wishes to take that step. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for 
Brandon—Souris for his comments and especially for staying 
focused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In various areas of the country there are small and large 
co-operatives. There has been some concern that there may be some 
problems there and also some work to be done in committee.  Has 
the member had any feedback or any comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small co-operatives can stay exactly where they are, but it 
does not limit the other co-operatives from doing some of the 
things the member just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I can honestly say that I 
have had very little if any opposition to this legislation coming 
from small or large co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area where I did have some concern with was how the private 
sector would deal with the legislation.  I have made inquiries 
and quite frankly the private sector is not opposed to the 
co-operative legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to speak in support of the new Canada co-operatives act and right 
off the bat I would like to say that I am absolutely delighted 
with the tenor of this afternoon's debate. The comments in large 
part are very supportive and positive about this bill. That 
speaks well of the government's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government consulted widely before the introduction 
of the bill.  It seems that the government has done its work 
well, has listened to the people in the co-operative movement.  I 
think it has done a good job in drafting the bill. I am quite 
sure that if anything significant has been overlooked it will be 
caught at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-ops can be found in many important sectors of the Canadian 
economy. They will be found in agriculture and forestry, in 
retailing and health care, in housing in most cities right across 
the country. These co-ops provide benefits for their members and 
contribute significantly to Canada's economic development and 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some sectors of the economy they increase the competition 
while in other sectors they provide services not otherwise 
available to members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a mentality that goes along with co-op membership. 
Co-op members are often people who prefer the distribution of 
wealth on the basis of effort rather than on capital. They place 
a priority on meeting the needs of the community.  Members have 
found they can pool their physical efforts and capital resources 
to create an effective service they would not have otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a co-operative the capital is often invested, not for an 
expected return on investments or dividends but rather often 
invested for the purpose of providing goods and services at 
reasonable costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A co-operative does not usually make a dividend on the basis of the 
amount of money someone has invested.  Rather it distributes its 
surpluses on the basis of patronage within the co-operative 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By pooling their resources in a co-operative, members reduce 
their individual risks.  The co-operative structure provides a 
limited liability to its members.  They cannot lose on bankruptcy 
more than their share of the investment in the co-operative. 
This helps enable the service to be as efficient and co-operative 
as an incorporated business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally a co-operative gives each member one vote in 
conducting its affairs.  It does not generally allow proxy 
voting. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative structure can increase the efficiency of 
capital markets by increasing competition.  It promotes a certain 
amount of risk taking, innovation and economic growth that might 
not otherwise happen.  Co-operatives are different.  They 
contribute to the Canadian economy because of those differences. 
They enable Canadians to participate in the growth of the economy 
in an alternative way to the other corporate structures that 
dominate the rest of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time most co-operatives are run like businesses. 
They charge members a price for services.  They return some of 
the profit to members.  Indeed some of the larger co-operatives 
are integrated both vertically and horizontally.  Some have joint 
ventures with corporations.  Some even own corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September I had the pleasure of spending three days with 
executives of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool in Regina and 
Saskatoon.  I also visited their terminal facilities in 
Vancouver.  What I found was a very smooth running, highly 
professional and aggressive organization.  If all Canadians could 
gain an appreciation of Sask pool the way I did I think most 
people would come away believing that this is a smart 
organization.  It really hums along.  It is doing well for all 
its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many co-operatives are not very small.  Sask pool is one and I 
will mention more about that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1996 <I>Financial Post</I> listing of the top 500 
companies in Canada, 17 non-financial co-ops were listed. 
According to analysis by the Co-operative Secretariat of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, seven of these had revenues of 
over $1 billion.  The largest is the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, 
number 54 in the top 500.  It is incorporated in the province of 
Saskatchewan.  Two federally incorporated co-ops are the next 
largest.  Federated Co-operatives Limited ranked number 75, with 
revenues of over $2.1 billion, and XCAN Grain Pool Limited 
ranked 85th, with revenues of over $1.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other major federally incorporated co-ops include Agrifoods 
International Cooperative Ltd., Co-op Atlantic, Western 
Co-operative Fertilizers Ltd. and Interprovincial Cooperative 
Ltd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These co-operatives compete directly with business corporations, 
whether Canadian or foreign.  They need the flexibility and 
certainty of good marketplace framework laws so they can respond 
to the changes of and competition in the domestic and global 
economies.  They need the flexibility of good marketplace 
framework laws to enhance growth and create more jobs for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was first introduced in 1970, 27 years ago, the Canada 
Co-operative Associations Act was the first national legislation 
specifically developed for co-operatives.  It was modelled 
primarily on the Canada Corporations Act, the federal law 
regulating business corporations at the time.  Business corporate 
law has been revised substantially since 1970 but the Canada 
Co-operative Associations Act has not been amended significantly 
since it was first passed.  In the meantime co-operatives have 
continued to change and evolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial legislation regarding co-operatives has continued to 
change and evolve as provincial governments update their 
legislation.  The result is that the co-operative sector has come 
to the federal government to inform us that the current federal 
act is no longer suitable to meet the business needs of Canadian 
co-operatives, not for today and certainly not for the future.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example of that.  Some co-operatives find the 
present act to be very restrictive with regard to access to 
capital sources and corporate arrangements.  As a result, some 
co-operatives have had to seek special legislation to obtain an 
acceptable corporate statute law for their operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This method of legislative reform is expensive.  It is 
inefficient and does not result in changes that are available to 
all co-operatives right across the co-op spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 strengthens and clarifies the corporate governance 
rules relating to co-operatives.  It enhances the ability of 
co-operatives to carry out business fairly, efficiently and 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives are a powerful form of business organization. They 
contribute greatly to the growth, jobs and prosperity of many 
communities right across Canada.  Modernized legislation will 
ensure that co-operatives have the legislative and regulatory 
environment to achieve their full potential in contributing to 
the wealth of the country in both rural and urban Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The users of co-operative legislation, the co-operative sector, 
told us it needed changes to the act.  The Canadian Co-operative 
Association, in association with le Conseil canadien de la 
coopération, has spent several years developing draft model 
legislation.  The associations went to the co-operative movement 
to discuss this draft model.  They built a consensus.  Then they 
came to the federal government and in effect said what needed to 
be changed and the way they thought it should be done. They were 
explicit and we tried to respond to their suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative movement had another opportunity to provide 
input along with all Canadians who were concerned about effective 
marketplace framework laws for co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada released a 
consultation paper in September 1996, a little more than a year 
ago.  They invited all parties who were interested to submit 
comments or suggestions.  The paper presented a number of key 
suggestions as guidelines.  They helped solicit comments on the 
suitability of the proposals as well as stimulated discussion 
about what should be included in the new federal co-operative 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing I would like to review some great co-op success 
stories.  There are a number of them.  They are not all federally 
incorporated co-operatives.  For example, Agropur is Canada's 
largest fine cheese and whey manufacturer and distributor.  It 
operates in the yogurt and fresh desert sector through Ultima 
Foods Inc., a company co-owned with Agrifoods International 
Co-operative Ltd. from British Columbia.  In 1995 Agropur had 
sales of over $1 billion and 4,500 members and 2,200 employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fogo Island Co-operative Society Limited was formed in 1967 
to salvage the economy in Fogo Island, Newfoundland.  By 1994 the 
co-op had grown to 1,234 members and 500 employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta electricity and gas distribution co-operatives have 
been quite successful.  At one time the rural electrification 
program carried out by co-operatives in Alberta accounted for 
about 90% of the electricity supplied to Alberta farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years as depreciated assets have had to be replaced 
many of these co-operatives have sold their remaining assets and 
responsibilities to power companies, resulting in a decline in 
the number of co-operatives in this sector during the past 
decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime natural gas co-ops increasingly supply the rural 
areas of Alberta.  In 1995 these co-ops accounted for over 54% of 
the total sales of energy co-operatives in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on listing a number of other success stories. 
There are a lot of them out there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-op movement is very successful.  We can all be very proud 
of what has taken place in that field.  We expect further 
successes in the future.  I am sure when the bill ultimately 
becomes law will contribute to further successes in the co-op 
movement.

members of a co-op and show their support through actual 
financial support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave that aside for a moment.  The Manitoba Pool 
Elevators has a grain terminal at the end of a rail line owned by 
the CPR which runs up to the town of Arborg.  This line is 
currently in the process of being abandoned.  At some point it 
will be offered for sale to the federal government.  I am not

done.  The ultimate users of the line are the co-op members in 
that district.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to acknowledge the management and staff of the 
Fédération des caisses populaires de la région de la Mauricie, who do an 
extraordinary job in regional development, and to the management and 
staff of each of the caisses populaires in the riding of Trois-Rivières, 
which do a most effective job in their areas.  In fact, I would say they 
make our constituents throughout the area feel more secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The caisses populaires and the Mouvement Desjardins form one of our 
major institutions, along with other major co-operatives, such as Agropur 
or the Coopérative fédérée de Québec, which are booming and continually 
growing both at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are of course other kinds of co-operatives—housing, 
consumer protection and worker co-operatives—with new ones being 
developed all the time, particularly in the area of the new economy 
where Quebeckers are in the forefront technologically through their 
co-operative movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mouvement Desjardins is a jewel in Quebec's economic crown. We 
might well ask where Quebec would be economically if there were no 
Mouvement Desjardins. 
As proof, I have two accounts, which recently came to my attention, one 
personal and the other more a collective experience. The collective one 
is contained in the account of Mr. Ricardo Petrella, who spoke recently 
at a conference in Quebec City on social democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a European academic, a humanist, a thinker, a renowned 
philosopher and president of the club of Lisbon, he expressed the hope 
that the Mouvement Desjardins would not only continue to grow but that 
the Quebec co-operative movement, which is exemplary, would also continue 
to grow. However, he encouraged the management of the Mouvement 
Desjardins—and I urge them to heed his advice—to retain its truly 
co-operative quality in the face of the current trend to focus more on 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the words of a credible individual, who is looking at the 
Mouvement Desjardins from outside and considers Quebeckers to be in an 
enviable position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another person who had good things to say was the British 
consul posted to Montreal, whom I recently had the honour to host 
in my riding.  As he was going past the building of the Fédération 
des caisses populaires Desjardins, which I mentioned earlier, he 
interrupted me to say:  “Yes, I know the Mouvement Desjardins.  It 
is one of the very fine achievements of the Quebec people and is 
known internationally”.  The consul, Mr. Rawlinson, praised it 
highly, and without prompting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mouvement Desjardins has an international presence, 
particularly in developing countries in Africa, where, as in 
Quebec, the co-operative approach has helped give people more 
control over their destinies.  One might well wonder what would 
have become of these people in Africa, and in Quebec, if they had 
not had the good sense, and the backing of the Mouvement Desjardins 
and its human resources, to take charge of their destiny by means 
of co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to draw your attention to some 
reservations that the Bloc Quebecois has about certain clauses, 
particularly clause 3 regarding the purpose of the co-operative, 
which could have been confusing.  I will read it rapidly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. (1) The purposes of this Act are 
(a) to set out the law applicable to the business endeavours 
of persons who have associated themselves in a democratic 
manner to carry on a common purpose; and 
(b) to advance the cause of uniformity of co-operative business 
law in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) No co-operative may be incorporated under this Act unless 
(a) it will carry on its undertaking in two or more provinces; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents a victory by the co-operative movement, because 
the government initially intended to drop this clause, present in 
the earlier bill, which could have resulted in confusion in 
communities faced with both federally and provincially incorporated 
co-operatives for the same product.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, in any case, it appears that this way was not desirable, 
and fortunately it appears that the government understood the message 
sent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, there is a word in clause 3 that poses a threat, in 
our opinion, and that word is “uniformity”. Uniformity, in the mouth of 
the federal government, means a lot of things. It can mean hegemony and 
centralization as we saw in the case of the securities commission and in 
the case of health care, where the government withdrew in financial 
terms but wanted to maintain national standards. 
We also saw it with the rumours of the federal government wanting to set 
up income collection agencies for the country as a whole, eliminating 
departments of revenue, including that of Quebec. Therefore, when a word 
like “uniformity” is used, it is cause for concern or at least for 
finding out the political will behind its use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 122 on distribution at dissolution contains a broad 
principle, which provides that the remaining property of a co-operative 
is to be distributed among the members. There are, however, two 
exceptions to this. One appears in clause 354 on housing co-operatives 
and the other appears in clause 361 on worker co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of housing co-operatives, without any explanation, the 
clause provides that any remaining property is to be distributed to 
other housing co-operatives rather than to members. 
There is no explanation. Perhaps this could be explained in committee 
soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 361 on worker co-operatives provides that, rather than apply 
the general principle, at least 20% of the remaining property is to be 
distributed to another co-operative or a charitable entity before any 
distribution is made to members. Here again things seem a bit arbitrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no explanation for the double standards, where two types 
of major co-operatives, housing and worker co-operatives, are treated 
differently from what is provided for in the general principle applied 
to co-operatives on distribution at dissolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude on this point by saying that the co-operative movement 
serves as a sort of insurance for people against the neo-liberal current 
in which people are increasingly divided, singled out and where 
individualism counts most, where governments are subjugated and where 
the social safety net is increasingly in jeopardy. The co-operative 
approach is doubtless the way to the future for people, who will learn 
to work together to develop solidarity from day one in their own 
community recognizing that mutual support and not the need to dominate 
is the way to success and to greater social justice.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEALTH 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</b> Mr. 
Speaker, on October 6 I posed a question to the Minister of 
Health as a follow-up to a number of other questions pertaining 
to the cuts to the drug and food research labs in the health 
protection branch of the Department of Health.  These cuts took 
place on the sly, in secret.  They were not presented to 
parliament, not presented publicly, but done in the dead of 
summer by the Minister of Health at the very time he was 
announcing publicly that cuts were over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the cuts were carried out in July, which I might add were 
not announced publicly contrary to the minister's statement on 
September 24 when he suggested he was placing a moratorium on the 
whole area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information about the cuts and the news of the devastation 
to our health protection branch came about as a result of 
conscientious scientists who are concerned about the health and 
safety of the drug and food supply of Canadians.  It came about 
as a result of public pressure and as the result of political 
outcry.  It also came about as a result of good in depth research 
by the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of this Parliament the minister succumbed 
somewhat to that pressure and announced a moratorium on some of 
the cuts and proposed changes.  Today, one month later, the 
Minister of Health puts out a release announcing that he would do 
what he said he would do on September 24, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will probably come as no surprise to members of the House 
that our concerns are still as relevant, as serious and as deep 
rooted as they ever were.  Despite this announcement Canadians 
remain deeply concerned.  Let me give four quick reasons for that 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in terms of this decision and on every decision of 
crucial importance to Canadians the government has operated on 
the basis of a very secretive, very undemocratic and almost 
despotic approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, for three to four months the government caused a great 
deal of uncertainty and instability to reign over the health 
protection branch.  That uncertainty was demoralizing to 
scientists and upsetting to those who value the work they are 
doing and want to contribute to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the drug research lab remains closed.  There has been no 
attempt by the government to address that issue.  It is of deep 
importance to the health and safety of Canadians on matters 
pertaining to drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we are still left with a very large question.  Is the 
announcement today but a temporary reprieve from a much longer 
term, very deep rooted agenda to move toward privatization and 
deregulation in the health protection branch as a whole? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by referring to a document from the department which 
outlines proposals to look at cost saving measures, privatization 
and ways to reduce the liability of the department, all contrary 
to the original purpose of the health protection branch and 
contrary to the very significant role performed by the drug and 
food research labs.  Certainly it is contrary to the intent and 
spirit of the Food and Drug Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remain concerned and I look forward to the government 
addressing these issues on an urgent basis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the member's attempts, 
grudgingly as they were, to recognize that the minister makes 
decisions on the basis of good, sound evidence, data, careful 
study and analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well I am glad that she acknowledged the minister announced 
today the reinstatement of the majority of the 24 projects in the 
food programs branch initially slated for termination last July. 
All these projects will be restarted with the exception of five 
that would require the use of research animals part way through 
the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The projects involving the use of research monkeys will be 
considered by the Royal Society of Canada as part of its study in 
the animal research division.  They will also be submitted to a 
science advisory board. 
The board will be appointed shortly by the Minister of Health to 
provide him with the expert advice on how Health Canada's 
protection program can be strengthened.

moratorium also re-establishes the projects and programs in other 
sectors of the health protection program and ensures their continuance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These announcements underscore the Minister of Health's 
commitment that his bottom line is the health and safety of 
Canadians.  The moratorium stabilizes the health protection 
program to ensure that a three-year project to review and 
strengthen the science and regulatory capacity of the health 
protection program is as comprehensive as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public must be reassured that its health and safety 
is of paramount importance and that the scientific capacity of 
the health protection program remains strong.

branch has some 1,300 scientists and professional personnel.  The 
moratorium and the scientific review will further strengthen this

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, on 
October 10 I asked a very specific question of the Minister of 
Health.  The minister chose to answer a question that was not 
asked. Today I wish to put my question to the minister again and 
trust that the response will address the question asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the report of auditor general some alarming facts were 
reported in the chapter on aboriginal health.  In the years 
between 1986 and 1996 many accounts of prescription drug abuse 
were reported among aboriginal people.  I was amazed to read that 
the Department of Health has known about this for 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For background I would like to review part of minister's 
response to a very specific question.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true this problem has been known for 10 years. Throughout 
that time the health department has worked with provincial 
authorities and with the First Nations to address the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of this year, December 31, we will have in place 
technology across the country to help pharmacists detect abuse 
and reduce the problem the member refers to. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is nice.  Here are the facts of a real tragedy.  The report 
of the auditor general shows that in one three-month period 
15,000 aboriginal people went to three or more pharmacies, 1,600 
obtained more than 15 drugs and over 700 people had 50 
prescriptions or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 10 years a very serious health problem, purported to have 
caused deaths, has been neglected by those charged with the 
responsibility for the care of Canada's aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is not what wonderful things the government is going 
to do to solve the problem. My question is very clear and I would 
like a clear answer in response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the minister identified those in his department responsible 
for overlooking this very serious matter for 10 years and what, 
if any, disciplinary actions or legal sanctions have been taken 
or are contemplated by his department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member wants 
some indication of what has been happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reiterate what was said in the House on October 10. 
Specifically, Health Canada has been working on this problem for 
a number of years and now has in place, in over 50% of the 
pharmacies across the country, a state of the art point of sale 
adjudication system.  By the end of this calendar year this 
system will be in place in all pharmacies.  It will eliminate 
most of the problems identified by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the drug utilization review report has been 
developed which allows Health Canada to identify potential abuse 
situations for physicians, pharmacists and clients.  This system 
ensures that all those involved can be alerted and that 
appropriate follow-up action initiated to address situations 
where abuse is identified.  In fact, that abuse occurs in a very 
limited number of cases.  When one looks at the statistics in the 
auditor general's report, it would appear that some 98% of the 
time First Nations utilize non-insured health benefits drug 
programs in an appropriate fashion.  No one wishes to condone any 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada continues to develop advanced systems, technology 
and an appropriate review processes to ensure that all those who 
are involved are aware and alerted to the issues of abuse. It 
must be clearly understood that addressing these problems is a 
joint responsibility of Health Canada, physicians, pharmacists, 
provincial licensing bodies and First Nations communities.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be unfortunate to stigmatize First Nations citizens as 
being the problem when it comes to the issue of prescription drug 
abuse.  Without the diligent co-operation of providers and 
practitioners, this problem will not be completely resolved. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department's staff worked with the first nations to ensure they 
better understand the scope of the problem so strategies may be 
developed to resolve matters in the community itself. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize this is a complex problem.  Abuse exists but it does 
so in a very small percentage of cases.  Simply designing a 
system, no matter how advanced, will only produce maximum results 
if all the various jurisdictions collaborate to create an 
environment where there is zero tolerance and zero opportunity 
for abuse.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for this second opportunity to talk about the multilateral 
agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any international agreement on investment, once achieved, will 
take us another step further down the road toward globalization 
of all economic activity.  Some people view this as a positive 
step but I do not perceive either a broad knowledge of this 
agreement or a broad consensus on its value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While among the business elite it is politically correct to see 
free trade of any kind as a good thing, some Canadians remain 
unconvinced.  For example, those who lost their good 
manufacturing jobs south of the border feel bruised by the free 
trade agreement of 1989 and the NAFTA of 1994.  Naturally they 
are worried about further steps toward globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that group there is a larger group of Canadians.  This 
group feels that all the repercussions of NAFTA have not yet been 
felt and that the collection and analysis of data on its effects 
have not been presented to them.  They remember what was promised 
if they took the leap of faith and went for free trade on this 
continent.  They were promised free access to the large market to 
the south. That access and the resulting increase in business was 
supposed to give us economies of scale, improve our productivity 
and thereby make us more competitive in the new global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaders in the steel industry tell me that the promised access 
on a level playing field to U.S. markets is still blocked by 
irritants based on American law.  So certainly in one of our 
primary industries the current agreement with the U.S. and Mexico 
did not deliver the promised access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that the key to competitiveness and success in the 
global marketplace is productivity.  Has Canadian productivity 
increased as a result of NAFTA?  Two respected columnists in two 
different newspapers have said no.  Before free trade, Canadian 
productivity was under 10% less than American productivity, but 
today Canadian productivity is 20% less than American 
productivity. I am aware that exports and investment are both up 
but most economists agree that it is due to our low Canadian 
dollar and our low interest rates, not free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is supposed to bring in one set of rules to replace the 
multitude of agreements in place today.  As a medium sized 
economy, a rules based system should work to Canada's advantage. 
But that is only true if the rules represent our values, our 
mixed economy and our business culture, not the cutthroat values 
of the unregulated marketplace held up by some as the best 
environment for business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians are worried about the impact of the further 
globalization represented by the MAI.  Canadians agreed to the 
free trade agreement as a leap of faith.  They agreed to NAFTA 
accompanied by definitions of subsidy and dumping, definitions 
that have not yet been agreed upon.  I do not believe Canadians 
are willing to buy another deal arranged behind closed doors, 
then delivered as an unamendable package to be fast tracked 
through Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is the minister going to ensure that all interested 
Canadians are made aware of the controversial aspects of MAI and 
have an opportunity to express their opinions before the MAI 
package emerges from the negotiations now under way in Europe? 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, if Canada has 
learned any lesson in the last 10 years, it is that having rules 
for trade and for interactions between countries have been to 
Canada's benefit.  I should point out that the free trade 
agreement with the United States, which is 10 years old this 
year, has actually resulted in a doubling of trade with the 
United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the advantages when we have ground rules is that we have 
dispute settling mechanisms.  It is true that not every 
transaction is 100% and entirely smooth, but to have rules in 
place has proven to be a benefit to the country, perhaps because 
of our smaller size and that we do not have to participate in the 
jungle of international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been very forward in trying to put together 
an international multilateral agreement on investment.  The 
negotiations have been taking place for the last three or four 
years.  However it must go on record that negotiators are still 
at the point where they are negotiating what it is they want to 
negotiate.  Those negotiations will not begin until next January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put in place a very comprehensive 
consultative process committed to ensuring the opportunity for 
full public discussion on the proposed MAI.  It was initiated at 
the same time that MAI negotiations commenced in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial officials are now consulted through regular meetings.

intensifying and will continue to do so until an agreement is 
reached.
