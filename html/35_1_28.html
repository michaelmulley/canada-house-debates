<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BLACKHISTORYMONTH">BLACK HISTORY MONTH</A></H3>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize February as Black History Month.
<P>
	The celebration of Black History Month is a focal point of 
pride for black Canadians whose presence in Canada can be 
traced to at least 1605 when Mattieu Da Costa accompanied 
Samuel de Champlain as an interpreter to Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Since that time, politicians, writers, artists, educators, 
historians and many others have added to the social, cultural and 
economic fabric of Canadian life.
<P>
	This is most definitely the case in Nova Scotia where there are 
many prominent citizens of Afro-Canadian origin whose work 
affects many Nova Scotians and Canadians. Wayne Adams, 
Nova Scotia's first Afro-Canadian MLA and cabinet minister, 
Maxine Tynes, prominent poet and writer, Joan Jones, a recent 
recipient of the Pearson Award, Dr. Carey Best and Slyvia and 
Marie Hamilton are just a few Nova Scotians of African origin 
whose contributions have been recognized by their peers.
<P>
	Black History Month pays homage to the essential 
contribution of black people and their collective history to the 
fabric of Canadian life. Let us pay tribute to this vital part of 
Canadian heritage, not only during February but throughout the 
year.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, again 
Quebecer Myriam Bédard gladdened our hearts today in 
Lillehammer, when she won a second gold medal for the 
biathlon, a first for an athlete from Quebec and Canada. The 
Bloc Quebecois hopes that this second brilliant performance by 
Ms. Bédard will convince everyone without exception of her 
tremendous talent.
<P>
	However, I am appalled by those who, to quote journalist J.V. 
Dufresne ``ooze contempt and envy where Quebec is 
concerned''. Ms. Bédard has already shown she was able to 
overcome all the problems caused by Biathlon Canada. With her 
courage and determination, this young woman has made her 
dreams come true and has met the highest standards of her sport. 
She is a shining example for all Quebecers.
<P>
	Myriam, on behalf of the people of the riding of Charlesbourg 
and all Quebecers, we offer you our admiration and 
congratulations.

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
heels of the winter Olympics there will be a world class sporting 
event in the riding I represent, Yellowhead, in Alberta.
<P>
	From March 10 to 13, the town of Hinton will be hosting the 
world cup biathlon races at Athabasca Nordic Centre. The 
biathlon, which is a sport combining cross country skiing and 
rifle shooting, will bring an estimated $2 million in spending to 
our country.
<P>
	Twenty-one countries and 238 coaches and athletes, many of 
whom are now competing in the winter Olympics, will be in 
Hinton for the world cup. The proud people of Hinton will have 
two local athletes to cheer on. Kevin Quintilio and Nicole 
Bressard, who belong to the Hinton Nordic Skiers Club, are 
world class biathletes who will make not only the people of 
Hinton proud but the people of Canada proud as well.
<P>
	I thank all the participating countries for flags received. May I 
ask all members to join me in cheering on Canada's national 
team.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I received Valentine's Day 
messages. One particular message was of great interest because 
it asked us all together to remove this pernicious bill that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1718"> 1718 </A></B>
<P>
prevents students from enjoying a six-month grace free period 
after graduation to find a job.
<P>
	This particular bill removes $35 million from the pockets of 
students.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask that together we try to improve access to 
post-secondary education for all Canadians and improve the 
Canada student loans program. Let us show how much education 
means to us.

	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, though we live in difficult times, the Winter Olympics 
remain a symbol of nations gathering under one flag, the flag of 
universal brotherhood and peace.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am very proud that a constituent from my riding of 
Restigouche-Chaleur, Allain Roy, is representing not only 
Canada but northern New Brunswick at the XVII Winter 
Olympic Games.
<P>
	Allain is competing in Lillehammer with Canada's national

rise at this moment to make an urgent appeal on behalf of the 
metro Toronto Daily Bread Food Bank.
<P>
	It has been brought to my attention that the food bank has been 
enduring difficult times this winter. Currently there is only a 
three week supply of food. It needs at least seven more weeks 
worth of inventory in order to sustain itself until the Easter food 
drive.
<P>
	Food banks serve approximately 160,000 children and adults 
per month. With public donations on the decline the food bank is 
finding it increasingly difficult to meet such high demand.
<P>
	Traditionally Canadians have understood the importance of 
groups and organizations which provide assistance to those 
individuals less fortunate.
<P>
	In keeping with this tradition, I call on my colleagues from the 
metro Toronto area to ensure their food bank is not forgotten and 
to encourage all the residents of their respective ridings to 
provide all possible donations for the continued survival of such 
a worthy cause.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr.

<P>
	The budget brought down yesterday by the government was 
met with deep disappointment in all quarters. Many critics today 
say how disappointed they are with this lax attitude. Moreover, 
the government is launching an unprecedented attack against the 
unemployed by taking over $5 billion from their benefits, while 
the budget contains no specific new job creation measure.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us why his government chose to 
attack the unemployed rather than federal government spending 
and administrative duplication and overlap?

<B><A NAME="1721"> 1721 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will simply quote the 
record of the Leader of the Opposition when he was in the 
Mulroney government.
<P>
	The GST, a tax on the middle class, an end to universal 
pensions for our seniors-that is the Leader of the Opposition's 
doing and he dares tell us about unemployment insurance. The 
last thing he did as minister was to take $3 billion from the 
unemployment insurance fund. He is in no position to criticize 
us as we are stuck with the problems he created.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in other words, the government is telling us that they 
are no worse than the Conservatives, a party which I left with 
pleasure.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The question is, how dare this government 
make the poor unemployed victims of the present neglect bear 
the burden of the public spending fiasco, not only by cutting 
unemployment insurance but also by not providing any concrete 
new job creation measure, thus going back on its sacred election 
promise to restore hope and dignity to the unemployed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition left the 
Conservative Party, he left the Liberal Party and he left the 
Union Nationale. When will he leave the Bloc Quebecois?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> So we have done nothing for 
the unemployed? The infrastructure program, which should 
create between 50,000 and 60,000 jobs in Canada; the 
residential rehabilitation assistance program, which was 
abolished by his former government; the home ownership 
program, which was to end on March 1, has been extended 
again; a youth service corps to help our young people; new 
apprenticeship programs. And he still has the effrontery to tell 
us that we are doing nothing. We are creating jobs, we are 
getting the economy on track, and we will do it, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me say how surprised I am at the vehemence with 
which the minister attacks the Conservatives, since his budget is 
identical to the one they presented. It is a budget which no 
Conservative still in that party-and there are fewer and fewer 
of them-would renounce today.
<P>
	I must say that I find something profoundly indecent in this 
budget, since the Minister of Finance is an accomplice of fiscal 
unfairness. On the one hand, he takes more than $5 billion over 
three years from the poorest people, and on the other, he lets the 
wealthiest people in this country put billions into family trusts 
and earn income from them without paying tax.
<P>
	I ask the minister, who voted with us in the Bloc Quebecois 
last year against the extension of this undue privilege, to tell us 
how he can preach fiscal fairness today when he supports such a 
double standard policy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, at least we are entitled to some 
consistency. His finance critic suggested referring the question 
of family trusts to the Auditor General. Since we believe that 
members of this House should assume their responsibilities, we 
referred it to the finance committee for study. We will look into 
it. We took his advice. So instead of asking me this question, he 
sould ask his friend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in the budget which he brought down yesterday-if we can still 
call what is left of it a budget-the Minister of Finance 
projected a record deficit of nearly $40 billion. Considering how 
accurate Finance Department forecasts are, it is possible that the 
deficit could be much higher than $40 billion. In fact, in the 
1992 budget, revenues were overestimated by $11 billion, and in 
the 1993 budget, by $10 billion. A slight discrepancy, would you 
not agree. In point of fact, for the past two years at least, 
government revenues have been declining, while the 
underground economy has been thriving. Consequently, tax 
revenue forecasts have been completely thrown off.
<P>
	How can we take the Minister of Finance seriously? How are 
we supposed to take a stand-up comic seriously when he 
announces an already record deficit of nearly $40 billion, given 
that he arrived at this figure by overestimating revenues, like his 
predecessors, when in fact he knows full well that for several 
years now, tax revenues have not been growing at the same rate 
as the economy.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I hope that the answers will be as brief as the 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that the critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois did not have a chance to read the document because 
he was in too much of a hurry to ask his questions. However, if 
he were to look on page 53, he would find a very clear 
explanation of some of the special factors which combined to 
dampen budgetary revenues this year. When we exclude these 
factors from our calculation, it becomes very clear that we can 
forecast a real increase of 3 per. cent or a nominal  increase of 4 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1722"> 1722 </A></B>
<P>
per cent. This is in line with the forecasts of the vast majority of 
the country's economists.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
does the minister not agree that a record deficit of more than $40 
billion would undermine the confidence of investors and 
taxpayers and jeopardize a lasting recovery on the economic and 
employment fronts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are fully cognizant of the problems 
associated with the deficits we inherited. That is why our targets 
are very clear: $39.7 billion, $32.7 billion and $25 billion. And 
we will reach these targets, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is also for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The budget presented by the minister yesterday will add $100 
billion to the federal debt over the next three years. Many 
members on this side of the House are deeply concerned that the 
budget simply does not address the deficit and debt problem.
<P>
	If this House, through its committees or the consideration of 
estimates, were to put forward further proposals for further 
reducing the deficit in 1994-95, would the minister be open to 
adopting such proposals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, at a recent meeting of the finance 
committee in response to an invitation from the member's 
seatmate, I said very clearly that we would be delighted to sit 
down with them and look at whatever constructive suggestions 
members opposite have.
<P>
	I also said they should be based on current financial numbers. 
They should not be based on the financial numbers presently 
used by members of the party opposite which through no fault of 
their own are some six months out of date. They should also be 
based on responsible economic forecasts, not inflated forecasts 
such as was the case with the economic platform of the party 
opposite in the election campaign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for part of his answer. My supplementary 
question is for the same minister.
<P>
	The minister's budget bears some resemblance to the first 
Clinton budget in the United States which also included a new 
spending package combined with a cost-cutting package. When 
the Clinton budget got to Congress it scrapped the new spending 
proposals and applied the savings to the deficit to the benefit of 
the American economy.
<P>
	Would the minister be willing to scrap or at least defer for a 
year or two his new spending proposals of $1.7 billion so as to 
get greater cost and deficit reduction in 1994-95?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all a substantial portion of that 
spending is the infrastructure program which has been signed by 
all of the provinces. That program has been tremendously 
welcomed by all of the provinces and the municipalities. Along 
with our other measures it is going to lead to a substantial 
amount of job creation.
<P>
	I am sure the member opposite understands the absolute 
importance of job creation at this stage of the fragile nature of 
our economy. That is what we are committed to do. That is what 
our budget is going to deliver. That is why those spending 
proposals, which are all a bit modest, are going to lead to 
substantial job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary question for the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	The budget is completely silent on strengthening the ability of 
Parliament to control government overspending. Can the 
minister tell the House whether he favours strengthening 
Parliament's ability to control overspending through the 
passage of sunset clauses, spending limits, freer votes on 
estimates and other measures of that kind?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member looks at the deficit 
projections we have made he will see they are substantially 
below the limits that would have been established by the current 
spending control limits. In fact we have gone far beyond them. It 
really demonstrates a government that has political will and 
conviction can do a great deal more than some kind of an 
artificial standard which in fact the previous government sought 
to get around.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	In terms of the role of Parliament the member had an 
opportunity to read what I said yesterday in the budget speech. 
We are opening up the process completely. The finance 
committee of the House is to play a very important role.
<P>
	We said that we were going to lay before the finance 
committee our projections for the next budget, the proposals 
that we would consider within the next budget, our spending 
plans, and that they would be subject to more detailed 
investigation by a committee of the House than has ever been 
done in the history of the Parliament of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1723"> 1723 </A></B>
<P>
	We were prepared in the House to have a unique debate on the 
budget before we brought it down and sought from the members 
of the House their comments. In terms of estimates, the 
controlling of spending and the examination of the budget, we 
are not only prepared to co-operate with members of the House 
but we are most desirous of doing so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Finance. Instead of 
dealing with the real problem, the high level of government 
spending, and eliminating costly duplication, the government 
says it intends to cut $7.5 million from social programs, mainly 
by reducing unemployment insurance. Like its predecessor, this 
government is trying to get the deficit down at the expense of the 
unemployed and senior citizens.
<P>
	Why is the minister putting the bite on the unemployed, 
although he criticized the previous government every time it 
reduced benefits under the unemployment insurance program? 
What has become of those high-sounding principles, Mr. 
Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, if we look at what we did about 
unemployment insurance, first, we raised the level for the 
neediest in our society from 57 per cent to 60 per cent, which 
applies, for instance, to mothers who are heads of single parent 
families and families who have their elderly parents living with 
them. I think it is clear that this measure is targeted to those who 
need it most. We are freeing up money for training because we 
really want people to be able to work and not go on 
unemployment insurance. Furthermore, because of these 
measures, we were able to reduce unemployment insurance 
premiums from $3.07 to $3.00, which will create a lot of 
employment in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary. Oddly enough, the minister is reversing 
measures that they themselves introduced. Since the minister is 
so proud of getting at the wealthy in his budget, would he say 
that a senior citizen with an annual income of $26,000 is 
wealthy, to justify a clawback of $200 million from 800,000 
senior citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, when we looked at the problem we had 
with the deficit and we conducted much needed consultations 
across this country, senior citizens we met told us that everyone 
should share the burden. So if we look at what we did in this 
case, seniors must have an income of $49,000 or $50,000 to lose 
the age credit. This age measure affects a mere 5 per cent of 
senior Canadians. It does not affect 75 per cent of them, and the 
remaining 20 per cent are hardly affected at all. Only 5 per cent 
will be affected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is also for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In the pre-budget discussions the minister promised the 
House that he would provide complete and realistic financial 
information in the budget papers.
<P>
	The notable absence in the budget papers is full financial data 
for the third fiscal year 1996-97 where he was to attain his 3 per 
cent GDP target. We do not have economic projections from the 
department. We do not have a summary statement of 
transactions and many tables were incomplete. Will he provide 
the information from the Department of Finance and table it in 
the House immediately?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we made it very clear that this was a 
two-stage budget and that we were providing financial 
projections for each of those two years.
<P>
	On the other hand we did provide full financial information 
for the third year, tracing the effect of the expenditure cuts that 
were taken in this year. That tracing demonstrates that we will 
arrive at the $25 billion figure or the 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	All the information the member requires is in there. The only 
thing that is not in there is the projection of economic growth. 
The reason we did not do that is that we did not want to fall into 
the same mistake the previous government did, that is projecting 
so far out and making promises on the basis of illusory growth 
that we are not able to keep.
<P>
	The fact is that we provided full information in terms of 
tracing the cuts we have made in this budget, cuts which are to 
bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP in three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> I have a 
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. That is an interesting 
answer. I agree there are tracings of the third year in the budget, 
but there are no economic projections or detailed third year data 
for any of the tables.
<P>
	Will the minister admit-and I know he will want to consider 
carefully this answer-that if he provides realistic economic 
projections, combined with the data in the budget, it will show 
that from this budget the deficit will in fact not go below $30 
billion in the third year and will remain close to 4 per cent of 
GDP?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite would take a 
look at the document underneath the charts, he would see there 
is a very clear statement after tracing the decisions taken in this 
particular budget through to the third year that a level of growth 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1724"> 1724 </A></B>
<P>
in the  third year similar to that which is occurring in the second 
year will give us the 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	The answer to his question is quite the opposite. Absolutely, 
with that level of growth we will attain the 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Wealthy families can use family trusts to avoid paying tax on 
billions of dollars. It was a Liberal government, in 1972, that 
created this unacceptable system. Just last year, the Liberals 
voted against the continuation of these trusts proposed by the 
Conservative government. But, as we discovered yesterday, the 
wealthy family lobby has won.
<P>
	How can the minister justify digging even deeper into the 
pockets of the unemployed and the poorest of the poor when he 
will not even touch the privileges granted to the wealthiest? Will 
the minister admit that he caved in to the pressures of wealthy 
families and party friends?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec): </B>Not at all, Mr. Speaker. All we did was do what his 
party's finance critic had suggested when he said that, given the 
complexity of the issue, it should be referred to the finance 
committee. That is on the record, by the way, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, either the minister misheard our suggestion or he does 
not want to admit to having heard it. His logic is somewhat 
twisted. He tells us that, when it comes to taxing the rich, we 
have to look into the matter for one year. On the other hand, 
taxing the poor can be done immediately. That he can do.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the minister that, in 1987, 
when the economy was flourishing, over 90,000 Canadian 
businesses which had made in excess of $27 billion in profits did 
not pay a cent in taxes, and the Liberals denounced that fact.
<P>
	Why does the minister refuse to accept the principle of 
minimum corporate income tax that the Liberals talked about 
when they were in opposition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is already a minimum tax on the 
income of major companies. We are levying it on banks, 
insurance companies, all major companies. It already exists. I 
wish I could say it did not exist, so that I could then levy the tax, 
but what can I say, it already exists.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Second, in our budget, we have changed the private 
corporations taxation system for the exact reasons cited by the 
hon. member. I am sorry, but perhaps we could pursue this 
discussion tomorrow, after the hon. member has had the chance 
to read through the budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
also for the Minister of Finance. On page 58 of the budget plan 
the minister indicated that the Spending Control Act would not 
exist after 1995-96.
<P>
	Would the minister consider extending that act just on the 
basis it could be a benchmark or a target for the government that 
would recognize the goodwill of the government in keeping the 
deficit or the expenditure pattern below the level expected here?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Spending Control Act put in place 
by the previous government is a reasonably ineffective piece of 
legislation in that it permitted borrowing from one year to the 
other year, going back and going forward. It allowed 
governments to engage in a fair amount of accounting 
tomfoolery.
<P>
	When we take a look at the deficit projections we have made 
and at the spending projections we have made which by the third 
year, to respond to the member, will have us spending lower than 
this year, from our point of view it is very clear our spending 
targets are substantially lower than anything that would be 
contained in the Spending Control Act. That is why we are not 
going to extend it.
<P>
	As the Deputy Prime Minister has said, why do we need a 
benchmark; we are in the process of hitting home runs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
minister consider bringing in a tougher Spending Control Act? 
Would the minister commit the government to rethink current 
expenditure projections and introduce this fall a minibudget 
outlining expenditure reduction targets for the next three fiscal 
years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have already indicated we are quite 
prepared-in fact we plan to meet with the finance committee 
with a full set of projections in terms of next year and all our 
proposals-to spend as much time and go into as much detail as 
members opposite want on each and every spending item and on 
each and every item contained within those sets of projections.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1725"> 1725 </A></B>
<P>
	In terms of the question as to whether we are going to bring in 
a minibudget this fall, the answer is no because we are going to 
hit the targets set in the budget laid before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. I will start by quoting 
him: ``The unemployment insurance changes being proposed in 
this budget, estimated at $5.5 billion, must be seen as interim 
measures until the full social security reform, estimated at 
around $7.5 billion, is in place''.
<P>
	He went on to say: ``That reform will lead to further 
significant reductions in unemployment insurance 
expenditures''.
<P>
	How can the minister reconcile the beginning of consultations 
on social program reform with the extensive-$7.5 billion-and 
definite measures announced yesterday?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just want to give my friend a 
rest.
<P>
	I would be very happy to answer the hon. member because I 
think the logic is very clear. We have announced in the budget a 
clear stimulant for job creation. By reducing the premiums on 
the unemployment insurance rate we will be putting in place the 
creation and maintenance of over 40,000 jobs in the country. 
That is what we were elected to do. It is the beginning of a real 
changeover as to how we can go from a system which would 
rather have people on UI than have people in jobs.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	I ask the hon. member to now commit himself, the party and 
all Canadians to help redesign the programs of unemployment 
insurance, the Canada assistance plan, employment, training 
and education so that the start we made yesterday can be 
continued throughout the next year and we can have a brand new 
system of employment and social security so that we can get 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question. How can this government, which 
raised unemployment insurance premiums in January, be the 
same one now telling us that it will create jobs by maintaining 
them at that level and reducing them next year by the same 
amount?
<P>
	My question is this: Is it not indecent to make the unemployed 
pay for the government's inability to manage its own affairs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. member of 
what she said on January 19 in the House of Commons when she 
was very upset about the fact that unemployment insurance 
premiums were too high. She said at that time: ``Don't raise 
them''. We have gone one better, we have brought them down.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member that not only did we bring 
them down for the next two years, but if we continue on this path 
of reform we will bring them down even further and create even 
more jobs for Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the hon. Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	In our short period in office Canadians have been happy to see 
that this government lives up to its promises and commitments. 
During the election we as a party promised repeatedly to 
reinstate the interest free portion of Canada's cash advance 
programs under the Advance Payments for Crops Act.
<P>
	Can the minister inform the House when the government is 
going to eliminate the interest charges on the first $50,000 of 
advance payments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question.
<P>
	I fully acknowledge the good policy ideas on agriculture 
which were contained in our red book during last fall's election 
and which enjoy a great amount of support among farmers and 
farm organizations in this country, including the proposals 
having to do with cash advances referred to in the hon. 
member's question.
<P>
	I am indeed anxious to proceed with improvements in our 
agricultural cash advance system subject to only one thing, and 
that is I want to solicit and receive the advice and 
recommendations of major farm organizations in this country. I 
would like them to confirm to me their concurrence that the $50 
million to $75 million that we might spend on cash advances in 
any particular fiscal year is in their judgment the highest and 
best possible use for those funds, bearing in mind that the 
overall pot of money for agricultural programs is limited and we 
must set our priorities.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	For the last 25 years Parliament's annual review of the 
estimates has led to a total reduction in government expendi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1726"> 1726 </A></B>
<P>
tures of one-millionth of one per cent. Clearly the system has 
not been allowed to work. It has been 20  years since the 
government last accepted a recommendation to reduce 
expenditures.
<P>
	Therefore, I ask the Minister of Finance if he is prepared to 
accept recommendations from committees to reduce the 
estimates, thereby allowing Parliament to do its job.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no government that is more 
desirous of having Parliament participate in the righting of the 
financial problems of this country.
<P>
	The answer to the member is an unequivocal yes. If 
parliamentary committees come up with suggestions that enable 
us to improve the financial conditions or the financial 
administration of this country, you can rest assured that the 
government will respond very favourably to any such 
recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to 
the budget tabled yesterday, the government plans to spend $163 
billion this coming year.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Finance now telling us that because he is 
committed to deficit reduction he is prepared to accept 
reductions as recommended by the committees to the main 
estimates as they will soon be tabled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is perhaps the same question 
and therefore I would give exactly the same answer. The answer 
is yes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the budget 
tabled yesterday, the Minister of Finance decided to freeze 
transfers to the provinces to save $500 million in 1995 and $1.5 
billion in 1996. A quick calculation shows that the Quebec 
government would thus lose about $600 million over two years.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the Minister of Finance has decided 
to follow his predecessors' strategies and shift part of his deficit 
directly onto the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the answer to the question is absolutely 
not. First of all, we should say that when we signed our 
equalization project with the provinces a month and a half ago, 
we were very generous with the provinces and certainly with 
Quebec.
<P>
	Second, what we did this time around is that, instead of 
cutting, we decided to freeze for two years. We will declare a 
moratorium, a period during which the Minister of Human 
Resources can work with the provinces to really save money on 
both sides. We hope that, with the social security reform led by 
the minister, this will not cost the provinces or the provincial 
governments anything. I had discussions with the provincial 
finance  ministers, including the Quebec finance minister, and 
this approach was quite popular.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, by directly 
raising the number of provincially-supported welfare recipients 
through unemployment insurance cuts while reducing transfers 
to the provinces, by saving $2 billion on the backs of the 
provinces, does the Minister of Finance not agree that he is 
crippling the provincial governments, which will soon be forced 
to make further cuts at the expense of the poorest Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as part of our new literacy 
program we are going to recommend that members opposite 
start reading the budget more carefully because they clearly 
have not read the full details.
<P>
	In the budget is an $800 million special fund to work with the 
provinces to develop a program to get the chronically 
unemployed back to work, $800 million to help the people most 
in need to get them back to work and back in the workforce.
<P>
	It is about time that members of the opposition began to 
recognize it is time for a real change so we can get Canadians 
back to work.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development.
<P>
	On Monday in the House the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development stated that the Sawridge band of 
northern Alberta is probably one of the richest bands in the 
country. Yet, and I quote, ``that band is saying to its people that 
it will not share''.
<P>
	For the minister's information I spent three years in the early 
1980s as an official with the Alberta government helping to 
prepare native and Métis communities in northern Alberta for 
local self-government. I observed firsthand both the business 
acumen and the generosity of the Sawridge band under its chief 
Senator Walter Twinn.
<P>
	I ask the minister what evidence he can provide to back up this 
outrageous insult to the Sawridge band.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is what evidence. The 
evidence is before the Federal Court.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1727"> 1727 </A></B>
<P>
	Right now the Sawridge band under Senator Twinn and his 
family has a case before the court which in essence says that the 
Bill C-31-women should not be able to come back and share.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	As a government in the early 1980s we brought legislation 
into the Constitution which would do away with that. In essence 
it says that a woman should not be discriminated against solely 
because she is a woman. That is the basis of it.
<P>
	We supported the development of Bill C-31 which was 
brought in by the Conservative government, but we fathered that 
bill. Today we are back and we are saying the issue is this, do 
you support-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Fathered?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> We personed that bill. Today we are back again 
saying there is poverty, there is richness, there is discrimination 
and non-discrimination, but we stand on the side of those who 
are discriminated against and those who are poor. That is the 
story of what is happening over here.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister completely side-stepped a question 
about his alleged remark to Alberta natives over the weekend 
that the Reform Party hates Indians and wants to be the defender 
of the white man.
<P>
	I ask the minister, did he or did he not make those remarks 
attributed to him by the media, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I was much younger I was 
very influenced by, as a matter of fact, a Tory. I hate to say this, 
but it is true. Former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker came to 
Sault Ste. Marie and said that he loved this House and because it 
was partisan it did not mean that we could not walk away 
friends. He loved the partisanship. That is the way I approach 
this House of Commons. I could never love it as much as he did. 
I could never be as good as he was.
<P>
	What I am saying is that I do not believe I made such a 
statement. I have gone further. I have checked with others who 
attended the same meeting and they do not remember such a 
statement being made. It is unfortunate that such an impression 
is being created. It is unfortunate that the Reform Party is being 
dragged into the wrong side of this issue.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not want to be on the side of this issue 
where they in fact look like or appear to be supporting the rich 
against the poor, women who should be back in the band on the 
side of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Twinn.

<P>
	Will the minister tell the House how he intends to proceed in 
ensuring that the Downsview base in Toronto is owned by the 
public in perpetuity, enjoyed as an open space, an urban forest 
with recreational and educational facilities? This would provide 
enjoyment for Canadians interested in nature studies and urban

<P>
	Will these lands be designated to become our first national 
urban forest?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is a very detailed question. I will have to respond to the hon. 
member in detail at a later date.
<P>
	However, I think this is a unique initiative on the part of the 
government. The Prime Minister should be thanked for giving in 
perpetuity a large urban recreational green space for the benefit 
of Torontonians for years to come.
<P>
	I believe what the government is saying here is that there is an 
alternative to paving over lands and buildings, especially in high 
density areas. This is a plan to have the ownership of those lands 
retained by the Department of National Defence and developed 
for the benefit of all Torontonians recreationally in conjunction 
with my colleague, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
responsible for Parks Canada and my colleague the President of 
the Treasury Board, so that we truly create a unique area for the

that.
<P>
	If we are going to reduce the number of armed forces 
personnel then obviously we need a reduction in training for our 
officers. That is why it is being consolidated at one college. It 
made financial sense to do it in Kingston.
<P>
	I take great umbrage at the suggestion that there cannot be a

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from February 22 consideration of the 
motion that this House approve in general the budgetary policy 
of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Madam 
Speaker, we seldom have an opportunity to do so but before 
resuming our comments on the budget of the Minister of 
Finance, I would like to start by congratulating the interpreters 
who do an excellent job, both in French and in English. This is 
not always easy, especially when members speak quickly and 
use technical terms.
<P>
	Yesterday's budget speech by the Minister of Finance is a 
direct contradiction of any expectations we might have of a new 
government in this House. This government promised us jobs 
that would restore the dignity-as the present Prime Minister 
said and kept repeating, especially during the election 
campaign-of a million and a half unemployed Canadians and 
nearly half a million unemployed workers in Quebec. That did 
not happen in this budget.
<P>
	This budget merely refers to the infrastructure program which 
already been announced on many occasions and will create only 
45,000 temporary jobs, or barely 3 per cent of the needs of the 
unemployed. Three per cent, that is what the government and its 
Minister of Finance are giving us after repeating for I do not 
know how many months, while waving their little red book, that 
what was needed was jobs, jobs, jobs. And all we get is 45,000 
jobs, 3 per cent of what the Canadian labour market needs.
<P>
	The government was also committed to putting its financial 
house in order. However, the deficit for 1994-95 will remain 
very high, at nearly $40 billion the highest deficit estimate ever 
in federal history.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1731"> 1731 </A></B>
<P>
	And since yesterday, this government has felt very proud. The 
minister says he is proud of this budget, and he brings us the 
highest deficit in Canadian history. How can anyone be proud of 
a budget as disastrous as this one?
<P>
	The government failed to make much-needed cuts in 
government spending. It failed miserably. It did not have the 
guts to attack departmental operating expenditures and cut the 
fat in the federal bureaucracy. The fat is still there. Every year 
the Auditor General keeps repeating the fat should be trimmed 
from program administration and public spending in general. 
But where is the political will to do what the Auditor General 
asked the government to do not so long ago? Nowhere.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	This government, and the Minister of Finance in particular, 
does not have the courage either to end overlap and duplication 
which at the very least cost Quebec alone between $2 and $3 
billion. This is unacceptable for a first budget from a federal 
government which promised to get its fiscal house in order. If 
my memory serves me correctly, yesterday's budget reduces 
federal government operating expenditures by only $400 
million, out of a total operating budget of nearly $20 billion. 
How can it be proud of this achievement?
<P>
	Instead of cutting expenses, the Minister of Finance and his 
government have foolishly chosen to increase the fiscal burden 
of taxpayers, specifically the burden of the middle class, thereby 
falling into the same ruts as the previous government.
<P>
	Overall, the government will collect no less than $575 million 
in 1994-1995 from a variety of new taxes, and more than $1.3 
billion in 1995-1996. Not so long ago, every member of this 
government, and in particular the current Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance, was saying that when they came to power, 
there would be no tax increases and no income tax increases. 
They are doing exactly the opposite of what they have been 
saying for months. They are also doing exactly the opposite, 
Madam Speaker, of what they said they would do in their red 
book, this rag that they have been waving in our faces every day.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> In so doing, Madam Speaker, they are also 
directly contradicting themselves and their claims to want to 
increase economic growth opportunities, because by increasing 
the fiscal burden of taxpayers, the government is reducing their 
purchasing power and jeopardizing the already anemic 
economic recovery.
<P>
	Finally, the Minister of Finance, the stand-up comic of 
Canadian economic policy, is soaking middle-income earners 
for more than half a billion in tax revenues over three years by 
taxing-and this is just one example-life insurance premiums 
paid by employers, by taxing middle-income earners.
<P>
	Moreover, we now know the true meaning of the words 
``modernization'' and ``rationalization'' when spoken by the 
Liberal government and the apparatchik.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance, the real boss when it comes to 
running public affairs in Canada, is making, on the backs of the 
very people who have to rely on assistance from the entire 
community, a shameful $7.5 billion cut in social programs.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> And inadmissible. It is inadmissible that a 
government which, not so long ago, was complaining to the 
previous government that it was outrageous to attack the 
universality of social programs and to start cutting back such 
programs.
<P>
	Members opposite have the gall to talk about-and I have 
been hearing the same thing over and over for a very long 
time-social justice and a fair contribution in looking for ways 
to better control public finances. The government claims to be 
concerned with poverty and unemployment and then turns 
around and attacks the victims of these two social evils to solve 
its own problems.
<P>
	I cannot figure out what kind of social conscience these 
people have, but as soon as they have the reins of government in 
hand, they forget who they owe this to, and that is inadmissible.
<P>
	These are not the only tax bites suffered by the taxpayers. 
Reneging on its election promises, the government has cut 
transfer payments to the provinces, payments which are used to 
support education and social assistance programs. It is taking 
away, stealing from the pockets of the provinces nearly $2 
billion for fiscal years 1995-96 and 1996-97. That is what has 
come to be known as shifting one's deficit onto the shoulders of 
the provinces while sparing oneself the unpleasant task of 
confronting the voters with additional tax increases.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> There. That is it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The cat is out of the bag.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Who is going to pay for all this? Who will pay? 
Again, as always, the taxpayers. The same people pay for it all. 
We do not have different groups of taxpayers for federal income 
tax, provincial income tax or municipal property tax. The same 
people pay at all three levels. Whether we increase taxes directly 
at the federal level or pass the buck to the provinces, in the end, 
the taxpayers are paying and the middle-income taxpayers in 
particular have been overburdened with taxes since 1984. Yet, 
they have just been struck another blow and are seeing their tax 
burden become even heavier.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1732"> 1732 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	From this perspective, the Official Opposition can only 
condemn the fiscal stance of the Minister of Finance, which 
does not solve the huge problem of the federal deficit, quite the 
contrary!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is no action in the budget for job creation and no hope 
for the 1.5 million unemployed in Canada. The infrastructure 
program is supposed to create 45,000 jobs, only 3 per cent of the 
needs of the Canadian labour market.
<P>
	The finance minister expects the most spectacular deficit in 
Canada's history, the highest ever calculated. We know by 
tradition, especially the treaty of tradition, that the deficit will 
go over $40 billion. It will probably go over the $45 billion mark 
this year.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance does not have to be proud of it.
<P>
	There are no reductions in federal spending, but taxes will 
increase for middle income earners. There is nothing in the 
fiscal loopholes under family trusts but promises to study them 
in the finance committee. There is nothing concerning the 
recommendation of the Auditor General on the possibility of 
saving more than $5 billion a year by removing inefficiencies in 
public services. There is no provision for social housing in the 
budget. Instead, the minister decided to cut social welfare by 
$7.5 billion for the next three years including a cut of $2 billion 
in provincial transfer payments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, there is really no need to remind this House 
that the inability of the government to control the deficit is 
merely the continuation of the fiscal laxness of Liberal 
governments in the seventies and the early eighties, and I did say 
Liberal, not Conservative. As you know, the current Prime 
Minister was even the Minister of Finance for a while during 
those years. This laxness on the part of all those Liberal 
governments is directly responsible for the huge increase in the 
public debt, which is now over $507 billion.
<P>
	From 1970 to 1985, during 15 years of almost uninterrupted 
Liberal regime, the ratio between the budget and the GDP went 
from a surplus of 0.3 per cent to a deficit of 8.5 per cent, a high 
which remains unequalled. This disastrous state of our public 
finances is the legacy of successive Liberal governments.
<P>
	If the past is any indication of what the future holds, and I 
believe it is, we are in for quite a ride with the budget tabled 
yesterday by the Minister of Finance, especially because it 
maintains social injustice, fiscal laxness and tax unfairness. 
Rich people and major corporations will not pay any more taxes, 
while the poor and the middle class will continue to pay for the 
Liberal government's attitude. This is unacceptable!
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has no reason to be proud to 
announce a deficit of some $40 billion for the fiscal year 
1994-95. Especially since he knowingly-and I do mean 
knowingly-and wilfully increased the amount of the deficit for 
the last fiscal year, so as to look more efficient with the cuts 
announced in his budget of yesterday.
<P>
	According to several economists, some of whom he consulted 
during the pre-budget exercise which took place recently, the 
actual national deficit for the current year is not $45 billion but 
somewhere around $42 billion. In fact, the Conference Board, 
which can certainly not be accused of promoting sovereignty, 
wrote this in its note on the Canadian economy for the winter of 
1994: A large part of the $3 billion cost overruns for 1993-94 
results from changing the implementation date of certain 
measures announced in policies and, as such, is due to one-time 
discretionary accounting decisions. What that means is that, 
based on the deficit forecasts from the Department of Finance 
and on the budget tabled yesterday, the Minister of Finance 
moved only $2 billion towards his expense-cutting objective. 
The minister speaks of cutting the deficit by $7 or $8 billion, but 
it is a fraud, a sham. I will not say that they are lying, because 
that is unparliamentary, but I will say that they are not telling the 
truth.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Since the deficit for 1994-95 will be reduced by only $2 
billion, where is the effort to restore fiscal sanity to 
government? They must be joking, they are not credible! Do you 
think, do we all think, that the Minister of Finance and this 
government are waiting for a third warning from the 
International Monetary Fund before doing something? Are they 
also waiting for a further deterioration of Canada's fiscal 
situation as a result of a lower credit rating from the major rating 
agencies? Madam Speaker, this government and especially the 
Minister of Finance are grossly irresponsible.
<P>
	I believe that compared to other industrialized countries, the 
economic situation in Canada called for aggressive budgetary 
measures. If you allow me, Madam Speaker, I will give a few 
examples of Canada's bad performance to show that we needed 
more than budgetary cosmetics from the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The facts that I will now present are known, and I hope they 
are known to the Minister of Finance. I hope he knows his 
ABC's. First of all, the relative size of the Canadian deficit is 
greater than in the other G-7 countries. In 1993, according to the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and 
according to the definition given in the national accounts, 
Canada's deficit-GDP ratio was 63 per cent higher than the G-7 
average. It is spectacular in the bad sense of the word.
<P>
	The second fact that the Minister of Finance should know, that 
his government should know and that all ministers should know 
but instead pretend not to know in order to hide the fact that our 
present system is a national catastrophe, is that our debt is 
growing much  more rapidly than in that of the G-7 countries as 
a whole. From 1985 to 1993, the debt-GDP ratio of OECD 
countries grew by only 21 per cent, whereas Canada's debt-GDP 
ratio grew by 82 per cent. That is 82 per cent versus 21 per cent. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1733"> 1733 </A></B>
<P>
In less technical terms, this means that Canada's debt is growing 
much more rapidly than the revenue that could be used to reduce 
it some day. When a country gets to the point where it cannot 
generate enough revenue to be able some day to pay the interest 
and part of the principal on its debt, it means that things are bad, 
really bad.
<P>
	As if that was not enough, between 1983 and 1992, the 
proportion of the federal debt held by non-residents more than 
doubled. This is unacceptable. It makes us lose control over the 
Canadian economy, so that future generations, our youth, are 
crippled more than other taxpayers. They are the ones who will 
have to pay off the debt, including our enormous foreign debt.
<P>
	I can tell you that the present government, as did the previous 
ones, is leaving quite a legacy to our youth, seing that the 
unemployment rate is at 17.5 per cent in the under 25 age group. 
Such are the figures for the last quarter of 1993. It is quite a 
legacy, which does not allow them much hope.
<P>
	Again, according to the OECD data, due to structural factors 
the Canadian public sector's spending is increasing faster than 
that of most countries of the OECD, and faster than in all G-7 
countries. Simply put, it means the system is no longer working.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	This system is rotten to the core, as we say in Quebec. The 
system does not work and things only get worse because of the 
fact that tax revenues do not flow in the federal coffers as they 
should, given the economic growth. Why? Because of 
overtaxation, and to put it bluntly, because Quebecers and 
Canadians are fed up. A new underground economy has emerged 
and is becoming larger and larger.
<P>
	I believe the Minister of Finance, with the budget he tabled 
yesterday, is contributing to the growth of the underground 
economy both in Quebec and in Canada. That is unforgivable. 
He is contributing to the collapse of our country and of our 
system which he pretends to be protecting.
<P>
	According to the technical data from OECD, government 
expenditures are now out of control and changes are needed, not 
only some patching here and there, but major changes the 
Minister of Finance does not have the guts to make. Tabling a 
budget like the one the Minister of Finance put forward 
yesterday is an act of cowardice.
<P>
	Even if the members opposite laughed at us before their first 
budget was tabled, we did not take any pleasure in constantly 
urging the government to set up without any delay a special 
parliamentary committee not only to consider, but to analyse 
carefully and in detail all of the expenditure items of the 
Canadian government, not only  the budgetary expenditures but 
also tax expenditures. We wanted to make major changes that 
would help us to control somewhat the degradation of public 
finances in Canada, since we cannot totally control the situation, 
with the system on the brink of collapse.
<P>
	Of course, we will not go over the history of the past three 
months, but already, even without the committee, even without 
the government's response to the establishment of a special 
parliamentary committee, the Minister of Finance yesterday, if 
he had the courage of his convictions which he showed when he 
was in the Official Opposition, could have applied the Auditor 
General's recommendations of the past three years and thus 
taken a considerable amount, not just $40 million, from the 
government's spending on operations. According to many tax 
experts, he would get at least $5 billion a year in wasted public 
spending and inefficiency and bureaucracy of all kinds, but the 
Minister of Finance and his government did not have the 
courage to take that medicine.
<P>
	As for revenue, when we look at the forecasts-and these 
forecasts are absolutely ridiculous; they have no credibility in 
economic and financial circles-we must admit that the 
Minister of Finance is making exactly the same mistakes as his 
predecessor in this House. He still thinks he is in the period from 
the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, when tax revenue rose in step 
with economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic 
product, that is growth in the nation's wealth.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance wrongly predicts that any 1 per cent 
increase in national wealth as measured by the gross domestic 
product will result in an increase of over 1 per cent in tax 
revenue. Since the mid-1980s, that is no longer the case, as a 
Conference Board study done in January confirms. When the 
nation's wealth as measured by the gross domestic product 
grows 1 per cent, tax revenue grows by only 0.4 per cent. Why? 
For a very simple reason, as I just said: the emergence and 
growth of a large underground economy in Quebec and Canada, 
because taxpayers are fed up with taxes and have had enough of 
being overtaxed, while seeing that the present government, like 
the previous one, does not have the courage to act to eliminate 
waste and inefficiency.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I would remind you, Madam Speaker, that revenue forecasts 
are unrealistic, even in comparison with the estimates done in 
the last three years. For example, the February 1991 budget 
overestimated revenues for the 1991-92 fiscal year by $6.5 
billion. The following year, the budget again overestimated 
revenues for the 1992-93 fiscal year not by $6.5 billion but by 
$10.6 billion. Finally, according to the Department of Finance's 
estimates, the April 1993 budget overestimated revenues by 
nearly $10 billion. So how much credibility can one expect with 
such revenue estimates in the finance minister's budget when, 
on one hand, the assumptions underlying economic growth-re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1734"> 1734 </A></B>
<P>
lated tax revenues are  false and, on the other hand, the team 
responsible for the previous government's economic and 
financial forecasts is still giving the finance minister the same 
kind of estimates?
<P>
	According to the analysts I heard yesterday, the finance 
minister's estimates are totally unrealistic and he will not meet 
his target to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP in the next 
few years. It is technically impossible.
<P>
	Not only does the finance minister lack finesse and credibility 
in this respect but, like his predecessors, he also shows a lack of 
vision because he goes even beyond using data that is not 
credible. He said in his speech yesterday that government 
revenues would not only follow economic trends but grow faster 
that the economy. Imagine, he goes even further than the 
previous government by using totally unrealistic assumptions. 
He says that tax revenues will increase faster than the collective 
wealth.
<P>
	I do not know how this bill of goods was sold to the finance 
minister. I do not know whether he believed in it from the start 
but I can assure you that it is impossible. It is impossible and if it 
ever happened, the government's friends or the Chamber of 
Commerce representatives would be deeply concerned about 
this kind of forecast.
<P>
	I do not know if the finance minister remembers how 
indignant he acted and how he condemned the Conservative 
government's surrealistic forecasts when he was on this side of 
the House. Like his predecessor, is he wearing rose-coloured 
glasses which encourage finance ministers to overestimate 
government revenues or is he trying to live up to its reputation as 
a stand-up comic, as the prestigious Toronto daily <I>The Globe 
and Mail</I> recently called him.
<P>
	With regard to revenues, the government and the Minister of 
Finance are broadening the tax base as they promised to do, but 
they do it again on the back of the middle-class which is already 
overtaxed.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, let me give you a few examples to flesh out 
my argumentation. In the next three years, the Minister of 
Finance will unduly burden middle-income workers with taxes, 
first by taxing the employer contribution to various group 
insurance plans. In the next three years, the Minister of Finance 
will hit middle-income workers for at least another $520 
million, that is half a billion dollars.
<P>
	Furthermore, last week, while looking at ways to eliminate 
abuses and loopholes for the rich, maybe the Minister of Finance 
had a stroke of genius, who knows. However, in seeking to end 
abuses and close loopholes, he has thrown the baby out with the 
bath water by reducing the tax credit for meal and entertainment 
expenses. While it may be true that some of the people who 
benefit from this deduction fall into the high-income category, 
it is also true that nearly 80 per cent of those claiming these 
kinds of deductions fall into the middle- or lower-income 
categories. This provision will primarily affect self-employed 
workers. They are not the ones with  hefty incomes who shelter 
their money safely away in family trusts. They are the people 
who work tirelessly to create their own jobs because they must 
contend with a government that is incapable of supporting their 
job creation efforts.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Obviously, the minister, even though he continues to wave his 
red book and to chant ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', did not give a 
moment's thought to the impact, largely negative, that this 
measure would have. He did not give any thought either to the 
effects of this measure on jobs in the restaurant industry. He did 
not think about this. He did not think about how this provision 
would discourage self-employed individuals who, day after day, 
work doggedly and struggle against the tax burden and the 
federal bureaucracy to earn a living.
<P>
	My feeling-and we have an illustrious representative of the 
former administration-is that the Liberal government, and its 
Minister of Finance, is simply following without question the 
advice of federal apparatchiks. We see before us a pale 
reflection of these mandarins. To spend $170,000 to deliver a 
speech in New-York City, great! He travelled in a Challenger at 
public expense, at the expense of the very same people on whom 
the Minister of Finance is now imposing a tax hike, an 
irresponsible tax increase, as irresponsible as a $170,000 
expenditure to travel in a Challenger to go and deliver a speech.
<P>
	By eliminating the age credit for seniors, the Minister of 
Finance is widening the tax base at the expense of 800,000 older 
people. That is social justice! That is how we reward seniors 
who worked hard all their lives to start a family and build this 
country that this government claims to stand for.
<P>
	They will actually be squeezing out of seniors another half 
billion or so over the next three years. How can the minister 
think seriously that a senior with an annual income of $25,000 is 
affluent and use that as an excuse to cut the age credit for 
seniors? How can he justify such an action when, at the same 
time, very profitable large corporations are allowed to pay not a 
cent in taxes? That is inadmissible.
<P>
	I gather from this that, like his Conservative 
predecessors-because this is basically a Conservative budget 
tabled by Liberals-the Minister of Finance is relentlessly 
targeting the middle-class. Must the minister and his 
government be reminded that, from 1971 to 1991, the actual tax 
rate for families with an average annual income of about 
$46,000 increased by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1735"> 1735 </A></B>
<P>
32.3 per cent on average, as compared to only 26.7 per cent for 
families with an average annual income over $110,000?
<P>
	This blatant injustice, when it was uncovered not too long 
ago, prompted the editorial page editor of <I>Le Devoir</I>, Mr. 
Jean-Robert Sansfaçon, to point out to his readers the unfair 
situation the middle-class was being put in. This is what he said: 
``Since 1980, middle-class Canadians have had to hand all their 
additional income over to their governments''. They had to give 
all their extra income since 1980, everything they have earned 
since 1980, to the government. It goes on to say: ``The tax 
burden climbed faster than the combined inflation and growth 
rates. Last January, the Liberals, newly arrived in the federal 
capital, raised unemployment insurance premiums by 7 per cent, 
a direct tax on job creation''.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The finance minister behaved in an odious fashion, worse in 
some respects than the Conservatives, whom he criticized for 
taxing middle-income Canadians. It is a rather silly situation 
when part of the budget denounces the payroll tax to finance 
unemployment insurance, which was increased from $3 to $3.07 
in January, and accuses it of slowing down job creation. But it is 
the Liberals who, last January, increased employers' and 
employees' premiums, thus taking some $800 million from 
workers' and entrepreneurs' pockets and compromising their 
promise of creating long-term jobs in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	I do not understand, Madam Speaker. I get the impression that 
the Liberals are laughing at Quebec and Canadian taxpayers, as 
no other government has dared to do in the political history of 
Canada.
<P>
	They recognize that this increase has slowed down job 
creation, but they still agree to keep it at $3.07 throughout 1994 
and say they will create jobs this way. They agree it is an 
obstacle but they still want to keep it. How ridiculous, Madam 
Speaker! Jobs, jobs, jobs, cut, cut, cut. How utterly ridiculous!
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance know that taxpayers from all 
income groups pay proportionally seven times more taxes than 
businesses in Canada? This is another aspect of the budget 
which I would like to discuss.
<P>
	The federal tax base is split like this: roughly 73 per cent of 
the money is paid by individual taxpayers, compared to 27 per 
cent by Quebec and Canadian businesses. Maybe it is time to 
create a better balance, because contributions made to the 
federal tax base by businesses are getting smaller year after 
year.
<P>
	I would like to mention some figures, again from the OECD, 
to those who, like the minister, his colleagues, and the friends of 
and contributors to the Liberal Party of Canada-and I will get 
back to this later, Madam Speaker-believe that businesses, and 
particularly very big money-making corporations, are doing 
their share.
<P>
	The Canadian corporate tax burden represents approximately 
6.6 per cent of our gross domestic production, whereas for all 
the G-7 members, that is for the seven most industrialized 
countries, this proportion is 9.9 per cent. I think there is still 
some margin for manoeuvre without jeopardizing the 
competitiveness of major money-making corporations, and I 
think we could tax those big companies which have made $27 
billion in profits in 1987-88 and still did not pay any taxes. It 
seems to me that we should look at this possibility.
<P>
	Some say ``it is not industrialized countries we have to look at 
but our main trading partner''. Indeed, Madam Speaker, if you 
look at the corporate tax burden in the United States, you will 
see that it represents 7.2 per cent of their GDP, compared to 6.6 
per cent here in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	So considering this difference between Canada and the United 
States, there is room for an entirely legitimate tax grab from 
large corporations that take advantage of tax loopholes.
<P>
	I think this is clear proof that we need a minimum corporate 
tax. There is no minimum tax for large companies that are very 
successful and manage to transfer their profits elsewhere and 
patriate losses from other countries to deduct them in this 
country. This proves that a minimum tax would be most 
welcome. I think it is high time to get rid of the inequities and 
unfairness in our tax system.
<P>
	In the same vein, we have repeatedly asked the federal 
Minister of Finance to put a stop to the outrageous family trust 
scheme which was actually introduced by a Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Again.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member: </B>Friends of the party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Them again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Exactly! The system allows wealthy families to 
defer indefinitely, in other words, until the death of the last 
heir-this could go on forever!-all taxes, not only on the 
capital deposited in these trusts, but also on the interest 
generated by the trusts which themselves are not subject to tax.
<P>
	A number of analysts estimate, unlike what the Minister of 
Finance claimed this afternoon, that the government could 
obtain at least $350 million annually in new federal revenue 
from this source-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Who said that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> -and even as much as one billion dollars in 
new revenue, according to the estimates.
<P>
	I hear some comments from our friends opposite. They did not 
have the guts, and if they think these trusts are so funny, why did 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1736"> 1736 </A></B>
<P>
they not get rid of them right away, to see how that would affect 
the government's tax revenue?
<P>
	Why did they not do away with the family trust system right 
away, instead of raising direct and indirect taxes on middle 
incomes? They had no hesitation in doing that. They did not ask 
the Finance Committee for a study. They did not ask for an 
impact assessment of these tax increases.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Hold a forum? Certainly not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> They increased taxes, so why did they not do 
anything about family trusts?
<P>
	The minister was saying this morning that, since the Finance 
critic of the Official Opposition had requested that family trusts 
be reviewed, he had referred the problem to the Committee on 
Finance. The minister knows full well that what I asked him to 
do is to abolish those trusts. It is true that I asked him to instruct 
the Auditor General, with the consent of the House, to review all 
the tax loopholes used by rich individuals and large companies, 
as this could be part of the attributions of the Auditor General, 
but I specifically asked that family trusts be abolished 
immediately.
<P>
	The minister knows full well that the government, for 
political and politicking reasons, has already given the 
Committee mandate to find alternatives to the GST and that, 
consequently, the review of family trusts could not possibly be 
undertaken before next year.
<P>
	If that is not helping the friends of the party, I wonder what it 
is. If this is not not telling the whole truth, what is it?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Protecting your buddies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Instead of going after middle- and low-income 
earners, why did the government not go after those tax shelters 
of the wealthy? Why did it not tackle the real problems, the 
problems that Quebecers and Canadians are faced with, which 
are unemployment, the curse of our time, and 
underemployment? The government is always talking about 
jobs, jobs, jobs, but it did not even give an absolute priority on 
this desirable objective. We would have supported them on that, 
but there is nothing in this budget, but another repetition of the 
creation of 45,000 temporary jobs as a result of the urban 
infrastructures program.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Regarding job creation, we can only condemn the absence of 
genuine job creation strategies in the budget. Need we remind 
the Minister of Finance that the anemic economic recovery has 
had virtually no effect in terms of creating new jobs. For 
example, Quebec has recovered only 25 per cent of the jobs it 
lost during the recession, while the recovery rate in the rest of 
Canada is slightly higher at 40 per cent. As I said, the recovery is 
anemic everywhere. In Quebec and in Canada, unemployed 
workers and families struggling to make ends meet will suffer 
even more as a result of the Finance Minister's budget.
<P>
	Moreover, I would add that the Minister of Finance was not 
being completely truthful yesterday in so far as Canadian 
economic policy is concerned when he stated with a straight face 
and without encountering any opposition that his government, 
the Canadian government, was very proud of the fact that since 
October 26, it had followed through on its election platform as 
set out in the red book. In referring to monetary policy, he said 
that his government had set monetary policy right so that it 
would never again jeopardize economic recovery. The minister 
is making fun of Quebec and Canadian taxpayers. What a joke!
<P>
	Last December, I attended a press conference at which the 
Minister of Finance was accompanied by the new Governor of 
the Bank of Canada, Mr. Thiessen, who was the principal adviser 
to and right-hand man of the former governor, John Crow. Mr. 
Thiessen took this opportunity to unveil his monetary policy. 
And what was his monetary policy? They have exactly the same 
monetary policy as the previous administration, with their 
relentless and dogmatic fight against inflation without paying 
any attention to this goal they claim to have, namely job 
creation. Stop kidding the people and stop telling them that, 
once recovery really gets under way-if and when that happens 
and if this government does not jeopardize it-the Governor of 
the Bank of Canada will take, as he did during the first quarter of 
1990, drastic measures to bring inflationary pressures under 
control.
<P>
	I did not understand the point the minister was making 
yesterday when he said that this policy was changed to reflect a 
quantitative target to achieve balance between long-term price 
stability and short-term job creation requirements.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The red book has turned blue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Exactly! I was also surprised to notice that 
there was nothing in this budget to help the business community, 
and the small and medium-sized businesses of Quebec and 
Canada in particular, face the challenge of globalization. Again, 
the red book is disregarded, because the red book said this was a 
priority, that support would be provided to the small and 
medium-sized businesses to help them recover from the 
recession and face market globalization. What do we find in this 
budget? As expected, the Minister of Finance was true to 
himself and the budget is pure posturing. It reflects a taste for 
consultation, consultation and more consultation, without ever 
making decisions or taking positive steps.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is suffering from acute consultation 
fever. When he said: ``Working in partnership with the private 
sector and the financial community, the government will seek 
the best possible way to provide long-term funding to 
businesses''. The government is not making any decision, only a 
commitment with regard to consultation. I am still new to some 
things, but I get the distinct impression that I have  been hearing 
about nothing but consultation, whether in the form of constitu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1737"> 1737 </A></B>
<P>
tional talks or citizens' forums like the Spicer Commission on 
the future of Canada, the future of something which is 
technically flawed.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	That is something! I quote another passage from the budget 
speech, where it says: ``The government will undertake a 
thorough review of federal spending on science and technology, 
in order to implement a more effective policy to assist research 
and development''.
<P>
	Once again, for about five years, Canada has had a chronic R 
and D deficit; it is lagging in technological development, the 
key to meeting the challenges of globalization, and we are told 
that a thorough review will be done. What credibility can the 
Minister of Finance and this government have in presenting 
such things to us?
<P>
	Still quoting the Minister of Finance: ``The Minister of 
Industry, with funds available in 1994-95, will establish a 
program of technological partnerships to strengthen 
co-operation between public and private institutions, so that the 
results of research lead to new products and employment''. For 
ten years we have been discussing these things, for ten years we 
have had no decision and the minister is continuing this 
governmental inaction.
<P>
	I think that the time has come to act, to stop discussing, to stop 
sitting around a table and trying to develop new partnerships. 
The partners are there. They are waiting for this government to 
get out of its laissez-faire attitude, to make concrete decisions 
and not to compromise the economic recovery by its actions, by 
increasing taxes or in various ways. That is what people want. 
Presenting things like that is not serious.
<P>
	Another very important point in the budget, which I found 
particularly disturbing, yesterday we discovered-I hear 
laughter from the other side, that is not serious, but so is the 
budget-who the real Minister of Human Resources 
Development was and we saw that it was the Minister of 
Finance, the member for LaSalle-Émard, who was dictating to 
the Minister of Human Resources Development that he would 
have to do without $7.5 billion for social programs over the next 
three years.
<P>
	I was shaken because there always is some trust between 
individuals and I believed the members opposite were serious in 
some regards. When the Liberals were the Official Opposition, 
they said that social programs should not be tampered with and 
they warned the Conservatives against meddling with the 
Canada Assistance Plan and the federal contribution to 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	The current finance minister and the Prime Minister rent their 
clothes every time the Conservatives talked about changing 
social programs one iota. In this regard, yesterday the minister 
made everyone proud and happy by presenting us with a $7.5 
billion budget reduction plan over the next three years.
<P>
	What kind of social conscience do these people have? Is this 
how they intend to restore tax equity and fairness in Quebec and 
in Canada? Is this what they had in mind? Is attacking the 
underemployed and the poor what they were thinking of? It is 
outrageous.
<P>
	The Leader of the Bloc Quebecois and Leader of the Official 
Opposition was right. When the members opposite talk about 
reforming social programs or about reforming the health-care 
system, like the hon. member for Hull-Aylmer did, they are 
talking about cuts. They are not talking about improving the 
systems but about cuts, pure and simple. We had undeniable 
proof of that yesterday.
<P>
	It is the same thing with social housing. As you know, Madam 
Speaker, maybe better than I do, 1.2 million Canadians, mostly 
women and young children, are waiting for social housing. Why 
is that? It is because these people spend between 30 and 50 per 
cent of their income on rent. This means that they have roughly 
half of their income left for clothes, hydro, telephone, 
medication and unforeseen expenses.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Not that long ago, some poor people from Quebec and every 
part of the country took part in a demonstration here in Ottawa. 
This is actually a good opportunity to make a point. Five MPs 
were there to meet these people, and all five were Bloc 
Quebecois members. Neither the Liberal Party nor the NDP 
were represented.
<P>
	These people asked us to be their spokespersons and tell this 
House as well as other Quebecers and Canadians about their 
plight and their daily hardships. The hon. members for 
Laurentides and Ahuntsic, a couple of others colleagues and 
myself have had the opportunity to work with these people and 
help them make a budget. Once they had paid for rent, food, 
clothes-and I mean the bare essentials-and medication for 
their children, some of these people, particularly single-parent 
families, had a deficit in their monthly budget. In the case of one 
person whom I had the privilege of helping with her budget, that 
deficit was $27.
<P>
	Again, the Liberals were in opposition last year and they were 
outraged when the Conservatives announced a $600 million cut 
in social housing programs. But what are they doing now with 
this budget? That is the problem: they do nothing to give some 
hope to the poorest families.
<P>
	I remind the Minister of Finance and member for 
LaSalle-Émard that the level of poverty in Montreal has 
constantly been on the rise in the last ten years. In that city-and 
the minister should know that since he is one of its prominent 
representa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1738"> 1738 </A></B>
<P>
tives-close to 64,000 families,  that is one family out of five, 
spend more than half of their income on rent. This makes 
Montreal the Canadian city with the largest number of renting 
households spending more than 50 per cent of their income on 
accommodation.
<P>
	There is more, and I want the minister of Finance and member 
for LaSalle-Émard to listen to this. He is not here? Surely he 
must be listening to me. Excuse me, Madam Speaker, I 
apologize. I made a blunder. I wish the Minister of Finance 
would realize that in Montreal, as I said earlier, 64,000 
families-one household out of three-pay more than 50 per 
cent of their income on housing, and 20,000 people are 
homeless. Are the Minister of Finance and his government 
going to close their eyes much longer to this human suffering?
<P>
	It is time to stop the pretty speeches and take action. The 
government should stop saying it will do anything at all to help 
people, when it agrees to maintain a decision to cut $600 million 
from the budget for social housing.
<P>
	I have a few comments on national defence, since the Minister 
of Finance and the Minister of National Defence referred to the 
Bloc's position on the subject this afternoon. The measures in 
this budget are not what the Bloc Quebecois asked for. I will 
explain, perhaps for the last time in this House, what the Bloc's 
position was on the budget for National Defence. The Bloc 
Quebecois was in favour of a 25 per cent cut in the defence 
budget. It favoured using part of the resulting savings on 
reconversion of defence industries to civilian use, something 
which is entirely absent from the budget plan of the government 
and its Minister of Finance. It is not the same perspective. They 
can use as much political rhetoric as they like, as the Minister of 
National Defence did this afternoon, but they cannot deny that 
this was requested by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Second, we asked, and we defended the principle during the 
election campaign, that a fair share of Canada's national defence 
budget be spent in Quebec. We asked that fairness be restored to 
the system before proceeding with drastic cuts just about 
anywhere.
<P>
	Today, and the Official Opposition defence critic will correct 
me if I am wrong, about 19 per cent of Canada's national defence 
budget, let us say between 17 and 19 per cent, is attributed to 
Quebec, although Quebec represents 25 per cent of the 
population, and now they say: of course you will agree with the 
closing of the only francophone military college in North 
America. I think that is outrageous. We will never agree with 
that decision, and I can assure you that in the case of the Collège 
militaire royal in Saint-Jean, the Bloc Quebecois and its 
supporters, and I think we have quite a few in Quebec today, will 
stand and fight, and I mean this quite seriously, against the 
closing of the only francophone military college in North 
America.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Time is flying, but I was told I had unlimited 
time. I find that fantastic, although I would not want to 
exaggerate.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words on international assistance. 
We did not talk much about that, and I think we should start. The 
budget contains a 2 per cent cut in international assistance. That 
is a $400 million reduction in the budget over the next three 
years.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, short of increasing the budget for this 
item, would have asked the government to keep the level of 
Canadian development assistance, because we are still quite far 
from the objective of 0.7 per cent of our GNP for international 
aid programs. As I could see during my years of employment 
with a farmers union, poverty in Latin America as well as Africa 
is not only still there, but it is increasing. The government could 
have corrected some of the administrative problems in 
international development that the Auditor General pointed out 
in his last report. We should, at least, have had the decency of 
maintaining the level of our international assistance, our 
commitment to helping the neediest on this planet. It seems to 
me that it is not much to ask of a country like Canada.
<P>
	We should not forget that every time we teach people in the 
developing world to do something, they become wealthier and 
therefore, they acquire goods and services in Canada. Such a cut 
is therefore postponing possible growth in the demand for 
Canadian goods and services. From an economic point of view, 
the only one that the government ever takes into consideration, 
this fact should have been remembered. We deplore the $400 
million reduction in international development assistance over 
the next three years, while children in Africa and Latin America 
continue to die every day.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would just like to say that this budget is 
devoid of the measures that the government should have taken. 
Moreover, its spending reduction targets are ridiculous because 
as I said at the outset, in nominal terms, expenses will not be 
reduced over the next three years. In fact, spending levels will 
remain relatively stable.
<P>
	This budget does not contain any serious measures which 
would allow the government to get its finances in order. As 
many observers have pointed out since yesterday, it is not a 
visionary budget. It does not contain any job creation incentives 
to give some hope back to the 1.5 million Canadians and 
460,000 Quebecers who are unemployed. The middle class is 
being taxed to death, while the poor and the disadvantaged will 
feel the effects of cuts to social programs.

<P>
	If I may digress for a moment, last week I was rereading René 
Lévesque's memoirs and a thought came to mind. As you know, 
in Quebec, Mr. Lévesque left us with a legacy whereby political 
parties can only accept contributions from individuals. I notice 
that the federal Liberal Party and the Reform Party have no such 
system in place. This seems to be the case just about everywhere 
in Canada. I wonder if the fact that the Liberals do not have such 
a system explains in part why they did not move in this budget to 
close the various tax loopholes which benefit large corporations 
or to do away with family trusts which benefit the wealthiest 
members of society.
<P>
	I went and got a copy of the report the Federal Liberal Agency 
of Canada submitted last year to the Chief Electoral Officer of 
Canada, only to discover that among the contributors whose 
names I will not mention -the report is public domain, anybody 
can refer to it- there are Canadian manufacturing industries 
which have contributed up to $68,000 to the election fund of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. Probably the same ones dodging tax in 
tax havens like Barbados and the likes. I also noticed that the 
Liberal Party of Canada received from banks and trusts 
companies amounts ranging from $12,000 and $45,000. They 
are the ones responsible for administering family trusts.
<P>
	I wondered if that did not explain in part why the government 
across the way, the Liberals, did not eliminate this kind of 
preferential tax treatment for contributing friend of the Liberal 
Party of Canada. When you accept contributions like that, you 
have to expect to have your hands tied once you are in office. 
You must also expect that you will not really be free to make the 
right, timeliest and fairest decision. I wondered if that was not 
the reason. If indeed it is, I am outraged. If not, prove it to me. 
Let our friends opposite put in place a system based on René 
Lévesque's great legacy, a system similar to the one we, the Bloc 
Quebecois, have adopted.
<P>
	Our hands are not tied. We can speak on behalf of 
middle-income taxpayers and those suffering the most hardship 
in our society, without the diktat of large corporations and the 
wealthiest families of Quebec and Canada being imposed upon 
us.
<P>
	To conclude, I would ask the Minister of Finance to take off 
the work boots the Prime Minister has offered him, because I 
believe he is not worthy of wearing them.
<P>
	I therefore move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substanding the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House denounce the reversal of the Government's position on the

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, thank you 
very much for the opportunity of addressing this assembly. I 
would first of all congratulate the minister for presenting us 
with his first budget. I encourage him today to do better. That 
will be my objective.
<P>
	In summary, what I would like to say to the assembly are 
basically three things: First, look at some of the positive aspects 
of this budget; second, examine taxation, the deficit budget 
proposal; and, third, make some proposals on behalf of the 
Reform Party to this assembly and as well to the Liberal 
government in terms of the priorities and some of the things it 
can do to bring the spending of this country in line and deal in a 
more responsible way with our fiscal budget.
<P>
	As well at this moment I would like to offer my appreciation 
to the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. The hon. 
member has been very eloquent today and has laid out a number 
of proposals. I do not agree with a number of the specifics that 
were presented to us here today, but I hope when I am able to 
speak en français that I am as fluent and as facile as the hon. 
member was here this afternoon.
<P>
	This budget gives us as Canadians, and certainly members of 
this House, the first opportunity to judge the government on its 
promises. Canadians over the last few years have faced a 
number of difficult things: inflation, large tax increases, GST, 
and certainly recession.
<P>
	Canadians are now asking the government a most important 
question. Will this new budget offer them hope, tax relief, and 
an end to the chronic deficits that this country has had in the last 
10 years, deficits that have smothered us and created difficulties 
for employment opportunity, business growth and economic 
growth? They are asking that question and this government must 
answer it.
<P>
	To be fair, and this is the Reform way, I want to talk about 
some of the positive aspects of this budget. First, I want to 
acknowledge what the government has done in terms of social 
programs, that it has started to target them toward those most in 
need. In these sad economic times we as Reformers believe that 
is a basic principle to be adhered to. In light of that principle, we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1740"> 1740 </A></B>
<P>
recognize the changes to the UIC and the elimination of the age 
credit as well for wealthy seniors.
<P>
	Second, I recognize that this budget does bring about 
restraint, not excessive restraint or the type of restraint we 
would like to see, but modest restraint. If that is a slight flavour 
of what we are going to see in the future, then it is a good 
beginning. If it is not, then it is a very unacceptable start.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	What we do not see along with that restraint is a real spending 
plan and that concerns us. We see this restraint in the military 
reductions. I know the hon. minister will address this today and 
will go into detail on some of those reductions which we hope 
will have fairness across Canada.
<P>
	Our first review and examination of the reductions taking 
place regionally seem to be fair and spread across Canada as 
such. We appreciate the way that was handled. We were 
concerned prior to the budget that the cuts might be all in one 
province or in one region which certainly would have been very 
unfair.
<P>
	The other area of modest restraint we see is in terms of 
decreases to business and regional subsidies. The red book had 
indicated $225 million to $250 million. They are around $150 
million less but there is restraint.
<P>
	The third item is the modest reduction in some of the 
government operations. We certainly salute that and encourage 
the government to pursue that direction.
<P>
	When I examined the budget, and listened in the lock-up and 
listened to the speech by the hon. Minister of Finance, my 
attention was drawn to some of the comments on pages 1, 3 and 
15 of the budget speech. I would like to read those comments 
into the record to set the tone for what I have to say later.
<P>
	This is what the Minister of Finance said they want as a 
government:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Canada where our public finances are in order, not ruin.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The days of government simply nibbling at the edges are over.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We need a new architecture, for government and for the economy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On page 3 we can read this quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The era of tax and spend government is gone.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>People told us we should freeze spending. We agree.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On page 15 is the support for what I have already quoted: 
``One of the reasons for the growth of the underground economy 
is that Canadians believe that taxes are too high. We agree''. He 
said that; I say that. He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We want Canadians to rejoin the legitimate economy, not leave it. Our 
objective is to get growth up and get the deficit down so that in the years ahead, 
taxes can be reduced. Ultimately, the pay-off for getting the deficit down will be 
lower taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those are excellent statements. When I heard them I felt as if I 
were flying like an eagle over the prairies of Alberta. I felt 
dominion over all. But all of a sudden, as I read other parts of the 
budget I felt as if I had crashed like a duck on the ice of Lost 
Lake in southern Alberta. What a change and what a let down.
<P>
	When we examined the budget speech we came to the 
conclusion that the government was not coming to grips with 
some of the problems. We have renamed it the child of the red 
book and the budget speech is the red ink book. I am going to 
talk about that for a few moments today.
<P>
	First, let us look at why the red ink. Canadians told all 
members of this House of Commons that they were overtaxed. 
However, if we look at the red ink book-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. Perhaps the 
hon. member is not aware that it is not permitted to raise the red 
ink book in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, certainly I will 
try to-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. I requested 
that the hon. member not raise the red book from his place in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Thank you very much, Madam 
Speaker. I will adhere to that directive from the Chair.
<P>
	The red ink budget presented to us told Canadians that there 
was going to be an increase in taxation levels and that the 
government would be relying on increased revenues for a large 
portion of its deficit reduction program. That was unacceptable.
<P>
	Canadians have said in the last few months that we must stop 
overspending and get rid of the deficit now. What did that red 
ink book say to Canadians? What did the government say 
yesterday and today?
<P>
	The budget will contain a $40 billion deficit and there will be 
minor expenditure reductions to reduce the deficit, a little today 
but mostly later. Mostly later, not today. If we examine the 
budget further we find that most of those reductions were taken 
by other expenditures, new expenditures of government, so we 
did not get ahead. We are $40 billion in debt.
<P>
	Canadians wanted a long term plan, a plan for at least the 35th 
Parliament. Did we get it out of the red book? We got a two phase 
plan but it did not meet the request of Canadians. It is totally 
silent on a formal plan to deal with Canada's economy.
<P>
	Another thing Canadians wanted was jobs, jobs and jobs and 
this was on the marquee of the Liberal Party during the election. 
When we read through all of these documents presented to us, 
the budget speech, the budget plan, the supporting documents, 
and the hearings we attended, there was no mention of numbers 
in the goals for jobs, either through job creation or job 
opportunities created by small and medium sized businesses 
across  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1741"> 1741 </A></B>
<P>
Canada. The numbers there are minor to the real need of 
Canadians. There is nothing comprehensive in a plan that speaks 
to Canadians as to what this government intends to accomplish.
<P>
	To sum up why I call it the red ink book plan it is because this 
government has not heard what Canadians have said on taxes, on 
the deficit, on the plan. Most important the government has not 
dealt with the question of jobs.
<P>
	The minister claims he is going to do that. He presented the 
budget in a pair of what I call farm work boots. I want to say this 
very clearly. If someone came to my farm one morning, I hope 
ready to work, and at noon those boots were still clean and 
nothing really had been done, I would not keep that person 
around very long.
<P>
	It is time for the Minister of Finance to get to work and get 
those boots dirty. It is time that the minister, the Prime Minister 
and other ministers of this government take on the tough job 
they face in terms of the economy. They have to show the will to 
deal with the difficult circumstances, the overexpenditure, the 
high taxation which is suppressing businesses across Canada, 
the high taxation which is creating doubt and a lack of 
confidence for investment that would create job opportunities 
for all Canadians.
<P>
	I want to make some remarks about taxes and the attitude of 
the Liberal government on taxes which is highlighted in the 
budget. The minister was so proud when he presented it. He said: 
``For every $5 of cuts we only are raising taxes $1 over the next 
three years on a three year average''.
<P>
	Looking at some of the projections on the cuts, they are 
questionable in terms of whether the government will achieve 
them with the present policies which are in place. That is 
number one. However the other indicator that may be more 
realistic is the 1994-95 budget. The cuts for 1994 according to 
the budget speech are going to be $2.1 billion. The new program 
funding that will be introduced will be $1.7 billion. The net cuts 
that are realistic are $.6 billion.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Looking at that picture in terms of taxes versus cuts, for every 
$1.25 of tax increase there is $1 in cuts. This is the opposite of 
what the government is claiming in terms of a $5 cut for $1 
increase in taxes.
<P>
	The second thing that concerns me with regard to taxes is that 
this budget depends on revenue growth; that is, more tax 
revenue to deal with its responsibility. The expenditure levels 
are somewhat consistent at $122 billion. However to deal with 
the deficit and bring it down the government is placing all of its 
hope on revenue growth. That is all right on one hand but on the 
other we have to look at the expenditure side.
<P>
	Looking back in history to the 10 years of government under 
the Tories and what they did in their plan, they never came to 
grips with expenditures. They never dealt with priorities and 
kept on spending. One of the major criticisms that can be made 
of the present budget is it seems that the tax and spend days of 
the Tories are not too far away from us. That is unfortunate 
because we expected this government to do better.
<P>
	Why should we have some concerns about high taxes and 
increased taxes? First of all, as was said by the finance critic of 
the Bloc Quebecois, internationally Canada has the highest tax 
burden of the G-7 nations, except Germany. When we look at 
that we wonder about our underground economy. We need to 
lower the taxes.
<P>
	The second thing I would like to bring to the attention of 
government is the provinces. They are concerned about this 
continuous increase in taxes.
<P>
	Not too long ago Quebec Premier Johnson said in an article 
that we have to do everything possible to avoid higher taxes. In 
that same article his finance minister made some similar 
comments that we have to work on the expenditure side, cut on 
the expenditure side, not increase tax revenues. They called on 
Ottawa to keep the tax levels down.
<P>
	In Alberta a very comprehensive program of deficit reduction 
is going on. The premier intends to balance the budget within at 
least three or four years and get rid of the deficit. That is a very 
noble plan.
<P>
	However if Ottawa continues to increase taxes and impose 
costs on the provinces it makes their job very difficult. We have 
to deal responsibly with this budget at the federal level.
<P>
	Another item which concerns me is noted in a document dated 
February 1994 from the Dominion Bond Rating Service. It 
comments on the weaknesses of the Canadian government 
sector. In trying to rate the credit for the federal government, 
two things are said: ``Revenue, the new problem: (a) The 
economy has a lower tax generation capacity than in the past; (b) 
Tax rates are high relative to the U.S. in almost every category''. 
I do not think that speaks well for the Canadian scene. We should 
recognize that and deal with the problem before us.
<P>
	I would like to comment on the deficit reduction plan of the 
government. As I said earlier the proposed cuts are offset by 
spending in 18 new program areas. In this budget there are 15 
program reviews. My experience has been that every time a 
committee or group is put together to conduct a review most of 
the recommendations are expensive and call for increased 
expenditures. I certainly hope that does not happen here. 
However, that is usually the pattern.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1742"> 1742 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The third point I would like to make is that total budgetary 
spending is to increase over the next two years. It is not going to 
decrease. There is a slight increase built into it. Under the 
current conditions that is a rather scandalous circumstance.
<P>
	One item I raised in the House today was with regard to the 
Spending Control Act. I feel that is an act that had at least the 
possibility to set some benchmarks so that when people wanted 
to examine whether the government is in a positive trend or in a 
progressive way dealing with the deficit, reducing expenditures, 
through that act, there would be a benchmark. The government 
has felt that it can do it on its own. It takes the ceiling off and is 
going to be responsible. It has not proved that yet and the 
question is still out. Why not leave it there? Is the government 
afraid of targets?
<P>
	Another point I would like to make is that this two-stage 
budget is not meeting the needs. Stage one is doing almost 
nothing. Stage two is measures after lengthy and costly studies. 
That is not good enough. Where and when can we meet these 
lofty goals?
<P>
	The 3 per cent plan of the government to deal with the deficit 
and to reach $25 billion in the year 1995-96 is not good enough 
either. Canadians need something more concrete. There are a 
number of reasons why that 3 per cent target is not adequate. The 
Maastricht treaty that was set up required that as an entrance 
requirement. Any country that was involved in that economic 
union was asked to deal with its deficit and balance its budget. 
That was part of it.
<P>
	The priorities of the Reform Party are to reduce and eliminate 
debt. During the period we are here we want to be the conscience 
of this Parliament and call for very responsible spending.
<P>
	I would like to move an amendment very quickly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by removing all the words after 
``government'' and by adding thereafter the following words:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>and regret that the necessary measures were not taken to balance the budget by the 
end of the 35th Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The Chair will examine 
the proposed subamendment and will advise the member 
shortly.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
ask the indulgence of the House.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for Lethbridge a question. 
I can appreciate some of his comments. He has been pretty fair 
in his analysis. However, in the context of the subamendment 
that he has just laid down, the Reform Party obviously wants 
drastic cuts to our budget.
<P>
	I would like to ask him how those cuts, if implemented, would 
play out in the defence budget. Is he advocating in the House 
today the closure of further defence facilities, more than were 
done yesterday, such as CFB Winnipeg, CFB Moose Jaw, CFB 
Edmonton, CFB Calgary, the training facilities at Wainwright 
and Suffield, CFB Cold Lake? Could the member answer that 
question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
question from the minister of defence. The Reform Party did call 
for reductions in the area of defence spending based on budget 
figures of some eight to twelve months ago. Things have 
changed somewhat in the interim. However, our figure at that 
time was in the area I believe of 25 per cent, around $2 billion 
dollars.
<P>
	In terms of where we are at the present time, we support the 
reductions that have been made. We are concerned, however, 
that we sort of put the cart before the horse.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Like other members, and I am sure the minister would like to 
have done this, we would like to have been able to examine 
Canada's defence position in total. Then, once we have agreed as 
to what our objectives are, we could work back and have the 
budget facility there to support those objectives.
<P>
	I am sure the minister would like to have done that and we 
would as well. Under the circumstances, we cannot always have 
the conditions that are most favourable.
<P>
	Concerning the reductions that have been made, we support 
those. I think now we should get on quickly and do the review so 
that we can then look at whether further reductions can be made.
<P>
	In terms of specifics, as a caucus or a group we have not done 
an analysis of each one of the bases. I cannot answer the hon. 
minister's question regarding that. If I had the information, I 
would lay it on the table. Our caucus has not taken a 
step-by-step procedure through which we have made a 
judgment on each one of those bases.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a short question for the hon. member. I listened 
carefully to his comments and I find them rather philosophical, 
dealing in generalities. However, now that we know exactly 
what is in the budget, we know that the government is attacking 
two things, to name only these: unemployment insurance and 
seniors. We know that the tax credit for people 65 or older will 
decrease progressively for net incomes over $25,921 and will 
disappear for incomes over $49,100. We also know that the 
government will cut transfers for unemployment insurance, 
education and welfare by some $466 million and by $1.5 billion 
1996. I would like the hon. member to tell the House whether the 
Reform Party  agrees with this kind of measure. Can seniors and 
people receiving UI benefits count on the Reform Party, which is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1743"> 1743 </A></B>
<P>
an opposition party, to raise its voice loud and clear against this 
injustice? Can these people count on the Reform Party for 
support?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, in terms of 
unemployment insurance, the Reform Party believes that we 
should build that program into an insurance program so that it 
pays its way. Those who pay in get the benefits thereof. That is 
number one.
<P>
	Second, in terms of some of the changes that have been made 
to deal with the $6.6 billion deficit that is currently in the 
unemployment insurance program, those changes would be 
supported. We think those who are most in need will still be able 
to receive benefits.
<P>
	With regard to transfers to provinces in the area of education 
and health care, that was one of the areas I was to cover in my 
remarks here today, but I was not able to set out that list of 
priorities.
<P>
	The Reform Party has said very clearly that the transfers 
given to the provinces for health care and education in the 
budget of 1992-93 would be maintained and that we would not 
reduce the transfers any lower than that fiscal year. If the current 
proposal of the government indicates that the transfer payments 
would be reduced below that, we would have cause for concern.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The Chair has looked at 
the subamendment. We have examined it and we find it to be 
receivable. I will read the English translation. It is moved by Mr. 
Speaker:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by removing all the words after ``budget'' 
and by adding thereafter the following words:</BLOCKQUOTE>

this first day of the debate on the impact of budget 1994, 
especially as it concerns the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	In the past few weeks it seems that every time we turn around 
there are defence issues facing us. We have had a debate on our 
peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia. We have had a 
debate on the cruise missile test. We had a debate last week on 
the establishment of the special joint committee on defence 
review and there have been many questions in the House relating 
to some of those issues.
<P>
	It is quite obvious that there is a great interest in defence 
policy in the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Why such great interest? Because the government intends to 
keep its election promises to Canadians, particularly the 
promise to review defence policy and to substantially reduce the 
national defence budget.
<P>
	The time has come to fulfil our promises and that is what we 
are doing. That is why we have taken important steps to 
implement the economic program outlined in the red book. If I 
may, I would like to start with our economic program.
<P>
	The government's number-one priority is to put the Canadian 
economy back on track. The government has expressed its 
intention to tackle the enormous federal deficit. At the same 
time, we must stimulate employment and economic growth. Our 
policy, based on these two requirements, translates into a 
program in two parts: one, job creation and economic recovery 
and two, decisive action to bring the debt and deficit under 
control.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In fiscal policy, our goals are quite ambitious but realistic. 
This distinguishes ourselves from the members of the Reform 
Party. As we have just heard from the member for Lethbridge, 
his party would like to put in place a deficit reduction regime 
that in our view would bring on an absolute economic 
depression in the country if the measures were put in place to 
reduce the deficit during the life of this Parliament as he and his 
colleagues are advocating.
<P>
	Instead, our government intends to get the federal deficit 
down to something more realistic, 3 per cent of GDP during our 
first mandate. This will require very strict discipline in 
government spending in all departments. To stimulate growth in 
employment, which is the other side of this debate, and it seems 
the Reform Party forgets, we will be moving on several fronts.
<P>
	For example, together with the provinces we have launched 
the public works program to renew elements of our national 
infrastructure. In the last election campaign the Liberal Party 
promised to cut defence spending by $1.6 billion over four years 
beginning April 1 of this year. Much of the money that we cut 
yesterday in the budget will have gone to the national 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	While on the one hand we have been taking it from the defence 
end of expenditures, we have been recycling it and reinvesting 
it, if you will, in the public works infrastructure program which 
is now taking effect and which will have an impact on all parts of 
the country.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lethbridge raises a very interesting 
point. I dealt with it last week, but I want to reiterate it. Why did 
we make the cuts that we made yesterday in the budget without 
first waiting for the results of the defence review? It is a genuine 
question and I will repeat the answer I gave last week.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1744"> 1744 </A></B>
<P>
	In a perfect world we analyse our priorities, our policies and 
then we look at the money we have to implement those policies 
and put them into effect. We do not live in a perfect world. The 
fact is, and the hon. member for Lethbridge will agree, the debt 
situation is becoming quite alarming. The deficit has gone up 
astronomically. It is much larger than we believed when we first 
entered office. The Minister of Finance has made that point. As a 
result we had to act very quickly.
<P>
	We acknowledged this before the last election campaign. I 
will not raise the red book. I do not have to raise it. It has become 
a benchmark for political discourse in the country and will go 
down as one of the great political documents of all time.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	In the red book we outlined a regime to reduce defence 
spending, as I mentioned, $1.6 billion beginning April 1. We 
could not wait for a defence review. The mere setting up of the 
committee has taken time. Parliament only returned in January. 
We had to debate the motion. We were surprised that there was a 
recorded division forced by members of the Official Opposition 
on the motion. We voted on it this afternoon. They objected to 
the participation of the Senate although, to give them their due, 
they are willing to participate after they express their views 
against the Senate.
<P>
	We are just getting the committee under way. The Minister of 
Finance had to act. He had to demonstrate to Canadians and to 
the financial markets that we knew where we were going in 
terms of the financial regime of the country. As a result these 
cuts had to go into effect now.
<P>
	To preserve the integrity of the process upon which we voted 
this afternoon, I say to the hon. member for Lethbridge, we have 
cut the defence budget in such a way as not to impair what is 
known as the sharp end of defence. In other words we have taken 
the tough decisions. Members will see in the days ahead when 
the full impact of the budget becomes known that we have taken 
tough decisions in base closures and other installations. There 
are 21 closures and reductions altogether that other 
governments had failed to make.
<P>
	For 10 years the Conservatives sat here in the biggest 
post-war economic boom and did not deal with the tough 
questions of surplus military infrastructures. They just sat on 
them and saddled Parliament with the consequences of their 
action, which is a deficit last year of $45 billion. They should be 
ashamed of themselves.
<P>
	They paid the price in the last election. That is why there are 
only two of them sitting in the House. I am not so sure about the 
member for Saint John. She voted with us more than with the 
Conservative Party. Maybe she knows something the rest of the 
Canadian public figured out in the last election. The 
Conservative Party has been penalized, perhaps irrevocably, for 
what it has done to the country. The Conservatives should have 
taken these tough decisions and not left them to us.
<P>
	It has been heart-wrenching and gut-wrenching for us on this 
side because most of the closures are in ridings represented by 
Liberal members of Parliament. It is pretty tough for them to go 
back home to Cornwallis, to Shelburne, to Gander or to 
Chatham. Even the Minister of Industry in Ottawa and those of 
us from Toronto find it tough. I see some colleagues here from 
Don Valley North, High Park and Rosedale; they are all here. We 
have to go back and say why 1,000 jobs are being left in Toronto. 
We are not dumping this on the opposition. We are taking the 
responsibilities the Tories should have taken in the last 10 years.
<P>
	If we had not done that we would have had to have taken it out 
of the sharp end. We would have had planes that would not fly. 
We would have had lovely new frigates admired by many 
nations in the world, certainly by our American friends, that 
would not sail. They would not get off the Grand Banks because 
we would not be able to afford to operate them. We would have 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia; luckily they do not have to shoot 
much, but we might very well have had to send them over there 
without bullets. I am being somewhat facetious, but we could 
not have continued our international commitments if we had 
taken out of the sharp end of the military budget at this time. We 
dealt with the tough questions.
<P>
	When the review is complete we will have a military of which 
we can be proud. Even with these reductions the number of 
combat personnel in the army is going to go up about 2,500. We 
are reducing the number of uniformed personnel from the 
current 76,000 to 66,700 people. Yet we are adding, because of 
the economies we are making, 2,500 combat troops for future 
engagement. That is good management and I think Canadians 
will appreciate it.
<P>
	Some people could ask: ``Why are you cutting bases and 
throwing people out of work? Why don't you just cut capital 
expenditures?'' I hate to say it but the former government of 
which I was a part in the early 1970s took that approach. We kept 
the capital expenditures low and the results were not very well 
appreciated by our NATO allies or certainly by our military. It is 
like anything else. If we let our cars run down and do not get 
them fixed, if we do not have our houses painted, at some point 
our past catches up and we have to repaint, buy new cars or 
spend a lot of money as I did this week on my car to get it 
running after this tough winter.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	We did not cut the capital projects. Would hon. members want 
us to cut the armed personnel carriers now being constructed in 
London, Ontario, by General Motors? Our order has given the 
critical mass to produce and sell 800 armoured personnel cars to 
the U.S. marines and bring needed foreign exchange and jobs 
not only to southwestern Ontario but to other parts of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1745"> 1745 </A></B>
<P>
country that contribute components. Do they want us to cancel 
that? I think not.
<P>
	I said to some colleagues on the east coast: ``Did you want us 
to cancel the coastal patrol vessel with nearly a billion dollar 
contract that will keep the Halifax shipyards working for the 
next few years?'' This is work that can be built upon by other 
contractors and value added for the future. No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I ask members of the Bloc Quebecois, the Official 
Opposition: Do they want that contract for the construction of a 
new supply depot in Montreal to be carried out?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are going to build a state of the art supply centre in 
Montreal, in consitutencies represented by the Bloc Quebecois. 
We are not playing politics. We are thinking about the best 
interest of people in Quebec in this case.
<P>
	Are they saying they want the 25 per cent reductions they 
bandied about to be taken out in this way, by cancelling a $270 
million computer contract, much of which will be spent in the 
province of Quebec? Did they not want us to consolidate the 
supply mechanism in Edmonton and in Montreal? I would like 
answers to those questions.
<P>
	While I am on the subject of the Official Opposition, I read a 
quote from question period that I liked so much I will read it 
again. Before doing so I will read a quote from yesterday's 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I quote the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, who 
just ended his speech and who said this in his reply to the budget 
speech yesterday in the House: ``I have the feeling that this 
government is living on another planet, that it is not aware of 
Canada's excessive debt, which puts it in first place about 
everywhere in terms of poor performance''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They say we are living on another planet and ask whether we 
know about the debt. Then they sit here this afternoon and 
criticize us for the cuts that were made to the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	My friend over there, the critic, is a nice guy but this is what 
he said in the House of Commons on February 17.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I quote the hon. member for Charlesbourg: ``In spite of it all, 
the defence infrastructure remains far too big for the size of the 
forces. With a strength of merely 78,000 members, the Canadian 
Armed Forces are maintaining from coast to coast facilities that 
could accommodate 140,000. Obviously, more cuts are needed, 
especially since several of our bases''-several of our bases, 
Madam Speaker-``are obsolete and increasingly expensive to 
maintain''.
<P>
	But not in Quebec. Oh no! Not in Quebec! Make cuts, but not 
in Quebec! That is what the Bloc Quebecois member is saying.
<P>
	I continue to quote, Madam Speaker: ``Also, their strategic 
value is not the same as it was at the time they were built. So, for 
all these reasons, the government will have to make a choice and 
impose a new round of closures''. I just quoted the Official 
Opposition critic for National Defence and Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	I will now quote the hon. member for Verchères, who said this 
during the same debate, on February 17: ``During the last 
election, and many times since October 25, the Bloc Quebecois 
has reaffirmed its support for cuts in the budget of the 
Department of National Defence. Despite the international 
context I have just described, we believe that we could cut that 
budget by some 25 per cent without dramatically impairing the 
operations of that important department''. That is what he said 
in the House, Madam Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	If we cut the defence budget, as we did yesterday, there will be 
a decrease in the number of soldiers and officers in the army and 
other Canadian forces. That is why we do not need three military 
colleges. I want the hon. members over there to be honest and to 
acknowledge that we are not closing only the Collège militaire 
de Saint-Jean, in Quebec, but also the Royal Roads, in British 
Columbia. We are trying to be fair to the people in Quebec and to 
all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How sad!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> We made cuts, yes, and it is sad. Ten years 
ago, when I was a member of this House, I went to the Collège 
militaire de Saint-Jean to study French, and I am sad at the idea 
of closing this college. As I said during Question Period, there 
will be a military college in Kingston, a national military 
college for all Canadians, where everything will be done in both 
official languages. I see the hon. member does not believe me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These people over there say one thing every night on the news 
in Quebec; I watch the news from Quebec. They say one thing 
there and another thing here. They do not believe in the same 
concept of Canada we believe in.
<P>
	The hon. member for Charlesbourg stood in the House and 
said, as have some of his colleagues, that there cannot be a 
bilingual college because it is not in Quebec. What about the 
million francophones who live outside Quebec? What about 
them? I do not get upset very often, but I get upset when I hear 
that kind of rhetoric. That kind of rhetoric tries to tear the 
country apart and we are not going to have any part of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1746"> 1746 </A></B>
<P>
	Before I lose my composure let me say I am really concerned 
about some of the two-faced comments I have heard on the 
closing of the military college in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, on a question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup on a question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, the Minister of National Defence 
is putting words in our mouths that we never said. He is 
misinterpreting our statements. I am not talking about speeches 
which were read, but about speeches where he accuses us of 
being windbags. We are in a situation-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but this is not 
a question of privilege. The hon. minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Madam Speaker, there are worse things in 
life than being accused of speaking in rhetorical tones.
<P>
	I want to be serious for a moment. What we did yesterday is, 
as I have said, gut-wrenching. There will be 16,500 people in 
the armed forces phased out over the next four years. It is going 
to be tragic for many lives. In a sense we have walked through 
the lives of many Canadians. We have to show our 
understanding as members of the sacrifice these people will be 
making.
<P>
	We are putting in place a very generous regime to deal with 
both our uniform personnel and our civilians. In terms of 
uniformed personnel there are measures such as pensions, 
annuities and training. For the civilians there will be in a sense a 
buyout package, training moneys over and above what would 
normally be coming to them through the workforce adjustment 
act. We have been discussing these matters with our unions and 
we hope to have their co-operation. I know it is a bitter pill to 
swallow.
<P>
	When hon. members examine the true picture of how we are 
trying to deal with the people who are losing their jobs, they will 
see we have been as fair as possible, given the financial situation 
of the government.
<P>
	With respect to the communities affected we have a real 
problem in some areas. I mentioned some of my colleagues from 
South West Nova, Miramichi, South Shore and Gander. These 
are poor areas. There is very little industry there. Afacilities 
were surplus. They were facilities that we could not justify 
keeping open. We will work with those members. We will work 
with the provincial premiers, especially the three Atlantic 
premiers concerned, Premier Wells, Premier Savage and 
Premier McKenna, to try to find uses for those facilities.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	As I said last week, there is no magic solution. We just do not 
have a pot of money to throw at the situation as the previous 
government did with Summerside. We are going to have a very 
lean, effective military when this is all done. It will be one of 
which all Canadians will be proud. In the meantime we have to 
try to soften the blow as a result of some of these base closures.
<P>
	I think when all is said and done, after the next few months 
when the defence review works itself out, Canadians will 
appreciate the role of defence spending. They will appreciate 
what good measure for money we get with those taxpayers' 
dollars, both in our international presence and domestic 
presence. I hope there will be a well thought out, well crafted 
policy, one that we can afford.
<P>
	Again, by doing what we have done in the last few days we 
have preserved the ability of the sharp end, the ability of the 
forces to have a very professional, lean, efficient presence, well 
equipped to be able to go overseas and march with the best 
because we will have a proud group of people worthy of our 
Canadian military tradition.
<P>
	In closing, I would only repeat the words of the Chief of 
Defence Staff yesterday who appreciated very much the efforts 
that have been made, especially by those who will be losing their 
jobs, and the understanding of the forces across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
The forces use both official languages.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
Those forces, which are part of the fabric of Canada and help to 
unify Canada, will get through this difficult time and move on to 
better things in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to say first of all that before I am a member 
of the Reform Party, I am a Canadian and a very proud Canadian. 
I hope that the budget brought down by the Minister of Finance 
works. This is our country and we need to work together. All of 
us here are Canadians and all want to be Canadians at the end of 
the day.
<P>
	In this budget debate the Minister of National Defence has 
been explaining the difficult time he has had with the cuts that he 
has had to be responsible for. I think on balance they have been 
very fair. The minister is absolutely correct that these are 
decisions that should have been made 10 years ago. Had they 
been made 10 years ago, it would not have been nearly as rough 
today. I personally commend the minister for the good job that I 
think he has done in that regard.
<P>
	I do have a question and it has to do with the budget forecast. 
The budget is relying almost exclusively on an increase in 
revenues. It is relying on an increase in revenues of about 15 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1747"> 1747 </A></B>
<P>
cent over two years after coming from a year, last year, with a 
decrease of 5.6 per cent.
<P>
	In my experience every time I have had trouble in my 
business, and most bankers would say most businesses have a 
problem, it is with forecasting revenues too high and 
expenditures too low. The expenditures are forecasted to rise 
just .3 per cent over this same period.
<P>
	My question for the minister is this. In a period of deflation, 
which we are in right now-at least in my opinion we are in a 
time of deflation-do we have any backups to prevent a further 
erosion of our fiscal position if the revenues that are projected 
and we hope arrive do not arrive?
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure I am qualified 
to answer this question. I have been somewhat preoccupied with 
a department that is looking at a dearth of revenues. The 
Minister of Finance should really deal with it.
<P>
	He is pretty confident that the projections he has given will be 
realistic and will be met and that the doomsday scenario that is 
implied in the question of my hon. friend will not materialize.
<P>
	I would also like to say that his comments were most 
appreciated and in the best tradition of parliamentary debate in 
understanding the difficulties that we have had with the defence 
cuts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the minister's comments, and it seems 
to me there are some figures or details he either failed to 
mention or mentioned so quickly that I did not hear what he said.
<P>
	Before putting my question, I just wish he would agree that as 
far as bases, colleges and infrastructures are concerned, Quebec 
has always been short-changed. There is no comparison 
between what happens in Quebec and what happens in the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	For many years, the policy at National Defence was to 
compensate for this imbalance with substantial military 
contracts that made up for the lack of military infrastructure in 
Quebec.
<P>
	The international situation has changed, however. So much so 
that the Bloc Quebecois does not protest when a contract is 
cancelled, as in the case of the helicopters, because although this 
contract would have gone mostly to Montreal, we preferred to 
see the money invested elsewhere. We never objected to the 
cancellation as such.
<P>
	There is also the new procedure for distributing these 
contracts across Canada. In any case, will the minister confirm 
today that Quebec has only 13.8 per cent of all the 
infrastructures? That Quebec has only 15.8 per cent of defence 
spending in Canada although it has 25 per cent of the 
population?
<P>
	I did not hear him mention those figures. But when he closes 
bases or colleges in Quebec or cuts as little as 5 cents or a dollar, 
he adds to the imbalance in this respect.
<P>
	The figures I mentioned, 13.8 per cent of military 
infrastructures and 15.8 per cent of defence spending, while we 
have 25 per cent of the population, if the minister can confirm 
those figures, would he agree that he is adding to the imbalance 
by making budget cuts that affect Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure whether I have 
enough time to give the hon. member a detailed reply, but he is 
right that the percentage of the defence budget spent in the 
province of Quebec is lower, simply because there was a lot of 
construction in the maritime provinces during World War II.
<P>
	I must point out, however, that as a result of major cuts in the 
rest of the country, after this budget the percentage of military 
spending in Quebec will have increased. It was 19 per cent 
yesterday, and today it is 22 per cent, even after closing the 
Collège militaire royal and part of the base in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	I appreciate his reasoning that Quebec is not getting its fair 
share, but that is a result of its geographic location in this 
country. If we had cut 25 per cent we would have had close the 
Valcartier base in Quebec City or perhaps Bagotville. If we had 
followed the recommendations of the Bloc Quebecois with 
budget cuts of 25 per cent, there would have been more drastic 
cuts.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	This is not a good time for Quebec, but it is not a good time 
either for other provinces, especially in the Atlantic region. I 
think Quebecers will appreciate they have done their share to 
fight the deficit by taking these cuts in the defence budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the minister for his comments. I enjoyed 
listening to his statement.
<P>
	I noticed he used terms like maintaining the sharp end of 
defence and that our military in the future would be a lean, 
effective military. I notice when I review the red ink book that 
there seems to be no mention, although they took the hard 
decision following the election to eliminate the contract for the 
EH-101 helicopters, of the cancellation costs for those 
contracts. There seems to be no mention in the red ink book 
about replacement costs. It is obvious if we are going to have a 
lean but effective military that those helicopters will have to be 
replaced. Yet there seems to be no costs for those things built 
into this budget statement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1748"> 1748 </A></B>
<P>
	I would ask the hon. minister where those cost estimates are 
and why they are not part of the projected costs for the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Madam Speaker, the cancellation costs for 
the EH-101 will be borne in the overall budget rather than in the 
general budget revenues, thankfully not out of the defence 
revenues. The President of the Treasury Board perhaps could 
address that when he tables the estimates and it will be very 
clear.
<P>
	The other question was what would we do to replace the 
EH-101s. If the defence review believes that we should have 
this capability, and I assume it will because we need a search and 
rescue craft, the old Sea Kings will be okay until the end of the 
century, but they will have to be replaced.
<P>
	Obviously their replacement will have to come out of this 
drastically reduced budget. Not only did we cut $7 billion 
yesterday, added to the $14 billion the Conservatives had cut, 
but out of that we have to fund ongoing operations and also new 
equipment purchases such as a potential replacement, probably 
off the shelf, for the Sea King helicopters some years in the 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Madam Speaker, in the 
House of Commons of Canada, February 22, 1994 will remain 
the day of broken promises and betrayed hopes. A number of 
Quebecers and many Canadians believed the leader of the 
Liberal Party when he promised jobs, jobs, jobs. Unfortunately 
for them, it was only a flashing slogan, but nevertheless an 
election campaign slogan.
<P>
	Broken promises, betrayed hopes by a party that promised to 
break with the Conservative policies and management, but 
whose budget is blatantly in line with and even reinforces the 
financial, fiscal, economic and social policies of the previous 
government.
<P>
	The budget speech shows clearly that this government does 
not have the slightest political will to address unemployment. It 
does not have any employment policy except a few devices such 
as the infrastructure program, which will only mean about 
15,000 non permanent jobs for all of Quebec for two years. Even 
worse, instead of addressing unemployment, this government is 
attacking the unemployed and the most vulnerable people in our 
society. Indeed, the Minister of Finance immediately 
announced, without any embarrassment, that he intends to cut 
social programs in order to collect more than $ 7.5 billion by 
1996-97.
<P>
	Let us look at these points one by one. On employment, not 
only does the government not have an employment policy, but it 
has seriously harmed employment.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	It must be pointed out that this government, as early as 
January, increased unemployment insurance premium rates, 
thus adding a further $800 million to the tax burden of 
businesses and workers. The finance minister went so far as to 
recognize, as the Bloc Quebecois had maintained on several 
occasions, that this kind of payroll tax harms employment and 
businesses which are more labour-intensive than 
technology-driven.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it, even though the minister 
recognized that such a tax was bad for employment and 
businesses, he has not reduced it yet. He has maintained it for 
the remainder of 1994. It is only next year, when it will have 
taken $800 million from workers and businesses, that he will 
bring it back to its 1993 level. He will do so, not only when it 
will have produced $800 million, but also after benefits owed to 
workers will have been reduced.
<P>
	Therefore, such a measure compounds non-productive 
decisions which, far from helping the employment situation, 
make it worse. It is no wonder that the finance minister is 
forecasting in his budget that unemployment rates will only 
drop from 11.2 per cent in 1993, to 10.8 per cent in 1995. We 
know that Ms. Campbell paid dearly for similar comments she 
made early in her campaign. They are taboo during an election 
campaign.
<P>
	Let us talk about unemployment insurance. According to the 
minister's projections, it is more than $5 billion he will save in 
that area. Let us see what he is planning and who will suffer. By 
increasing the minimum number of weeks a person must work to 
qualify for UI, especially the first time around, one will have to 
work 40 weeks to be entitled to 20 weeks of UI; by reducing the 
duration of benefits, the finance minister is pushing many 
people, especially in areas already economically depressed and 
those who are already experiencing major difficulties, on 
welfare. In so doing, the minister is passing the buck to the 
provinces, since there will be no jobs. He is making the poor 
poorer.
<P>
	This flies in the face of the official discourse to the effect that 
we must bridge the ever widening gap between social classes 
and their income discrepancies. On the other hand, the finance 
minister proudly announces special measures in favour of the 
least fortunate members of our society. He is proud to say for 
instance that individuals with a weekly income of $390 who 
support dependants would receive 60 per cent of the average 
business income. But these individuals are already in a position 
such that they will not be receiving more than $234 a week in 
benefits. He stated that the benefit rate would increase to 60 per 
cent, but see under what conditions. This is important. It has not 
been emphasized yet.
<P>
	Let us not forget that, in Quebec and probably other provinces 
as well, social assistance services have reported cases of single 
mothers who have suffered humiliation as their private lives 
were brought under scrutiny because  they did not qualify for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1749"> 1749 </A></B>
<P>
this or that benefit because they had dependant children. So, 
when the minister introduces this notion of dependant children 
to justify bringing the UI benefit rate down from 57 to 55 per 
cent for all recipients, a rate which is getting close to the US rate 
by the way, when the minister uses that excuse to say: ``How 
generous. We do have the well-being of the less fortunate at 
heart'', he is actually taking us back to the dark old days when 
women had to prove they were worthy in their private lives of 
being recognized as independent, single mothers who needed 
adequate support.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	That is why I want to denounce as a fraud a budget speech 
which is supposed to be liberal and progressive, but is in fact 
bringing us back to the days before the 1970s reform. This 
measure will open the door to all sorts of inquiries, nit-picking, 
whistle-blowing and create a system within a system, again, to 
save about $10 a week.
<P>
	Chances are that this measure will not cost much, considering 
how long it takes for a decision to be made and for the first UI 
cheque to be issued. It is not true that we are creating this 
wonderful world. On the other hand, we are setting ourselves a 
dangerous course with this widespread consultation on social 
programs. The government is leaning toward the concept of 
family income, a concept which, in so far as social assistance is 
concerned, plunged us into a kind of inquisition situation which 
I denounced earlier.
<P>
	The axe will also fall on seasonal workers, on those who have 
trouble finding steady work either because they are young, lack 
basic experience or work in areas where despite their 
qualifications, they cannot find work. These are the people who 
benefit from the 10/42 or 10/39 system.
<P>
	Instead of attacking the regions' structural problems, the 
government is shifting the burden of responsibility onto 
individuals and restricting their access to unemployment 
insurance and to the benefits to which they are entitled. What is 
the Minister of Finance doing to resolve the problems of those 
who are in need? Nothing. He has failed to propose any 
solutions. Worse still, he has scrapped several tax incentives and 
regional subsidies, leaving people in the regions without any 
hope at all.
<P>
	The extent of the cuts to unemployment insurance and the 
introduction of the concept of family income prove to anyone 
who may have doubted it that with its attempt at the so-called 
modernization and restructuring of social security programs, the 
government is merely turning the clock back to the 1970s. At the 
same time, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development are resurrecting the old ghosts of the 
1970s. They are proposing to take a trip down memory lane and 
to reinstate the outdated, archaic concept of basing benefit 
levels on family status.
<P>
	The government is announcing a reduction of more than $5.5 
billion in the unemployment insurance budget over the next two 
years. And that is not all. That is only one aspect of the 
upcoming social program reform.
<P>
	We cannot help but be concerned about another aspect, 
namely social assistance reform, and the more than likely 
decision on the part of the government not to renew the Canada 
Assistance Plan. It is indeed cause for concern because it is 
specific. As for total savings, the Minister of Finance says that 
the reform will have to result in savings of more than $7.5 
billion by the end of 1996-1997. That is his objective and the 
consultation currently being planned may in fact never take 
place.
<P>
	Three clear, inescapable conclusions can be drawn from the 
budget figures. First, the only major cuts announced in this 
budget-and I am not saying that the cuts to the military are not 
major, but when compared to cuts to social spending, they are 
minor-for the next two years affect social programs, more 
specifically, the unemployed and those who are often the most 
vulnerable.
<P>
	Second, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
cannot continue making fun of Quebecers and Canadians any 
longer by pretending to consult them about their priorities and 
concerns, since his own priorities and concerns, namely moving 
ahead with cuts, are reflected in the budget.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I urge him, Madam Speaker, to immediately table his reform 
project and to get rid of these experts at $500 a day plus 
expenses.
<P>
	Third, if the finance minister is able to assess so accurately 
the effects of reform, it must be because his government's 
project has been ready for a long time since it is that of the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	We can understand by looking around us and guessing the rest 
why, early in the election campaign, Ms. Campbell shied away 
from the possible consequences of reform. She was not as 
cynical as this government, elected to create jobs, which is 
sticking to its predecessor's policy of cutbacks.
<P>
	It must be said that, in their time, the Conservatives followed 
the Liberals' policy. They implemented all major 
recommendations of the Macdonald Commission created by 
former Prime Minister Trudeau, except for one, income security 
reform. That is where we are now. We are looking at the 
Macdonald Commission's plan, with variations we may admire, 
of course, but most of that plan is there, with details we can 
guess at.
<P>
	Declarations by the minister followed on the heels of 
declarations by the deputy ministers. We must not forget that the 
deputy ministers who briefed the minister are the same ones who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1750"> 1750 </A></B>
<P>
briefed the former government, who briefed Mr. Benoît 
Bouchard before the OECD conference held on the 8th and 9th 
of December in Paris, where Mr. Bouchard gave a speech that 
the Minister of  Human Resources Development could not 
disown, that could even be his.
<P>
	Does this mean that there is no other way to play politics than 
the way of Liberals and Conservatives? For the Liberals, the 
answer is no. Until Canadian federal parties escape from the 
clutches of the big corporations that finance them and whose 
interests prevail government after government, Canadians will 
have a choice between six of one and half a dozen of the other.
<P>
	Why did the finance minister refuse to go after the real 
sources of revenue and to ensure that large corporations pay 
taxes by blocking the royal road to tax shelters. Fortunately, and 
I was happy to see that our finance critic came to the same 
conclusion, Quebecers exercised that prerogative thanks to the 
late René Lévesque. No one is saying that governments are not 
in a difficult situation, but nothing less than equity between 
individual and corporate citizens is acceptable.
<P>
	Without this fairness, citizens are tricked, manoeuvred and 
manipulated by a clique who are not affected by the many and 
growing insecurities of ordinary people. They do not even have 
an idea of what it is like to be afraid of losing a meagre 
unemployment insurance or welfare cheque. They do not know 
the humiliation and anguish caused by the raised eyebrows of all 
the welfare and unemployment insurance officials in the land. 
They could not live for a single day on what a woman has to raise 
two children on for a whole month. And now this woman will 
have to prove that she really is the head of the family and that her 
personal income is such that she is entitled for a few weeks to 60 
per cent of not much, scarcely more than the minimum wage. 
The minister tells us about the responsible management of 
social programs.
<P>
	It is both scandalous and revealing that the Minister of 
Finance forgot to attack costly duplication, a big source of 
potential savings, in his speech. It shows that this government 
lacks the will to deal with this important issue, especially with 
the Government of Quebec. It also shows this government's 
desire to centralize and its eagerness to meddle in fields of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will tell you something, and I thought about it 
twice. I had heard that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development was a progressive man whom I could help, in the 
strange way that the Official Opposition usually does. Now I 
know that is not at all the case; despite his generous words, he 
agreed to make the only significant cuts which the Liberal 
government is making at the expense of the most vulnerable 
people and their children. The Minister of Finance told us today, 
``We are advancing social security reform by taking specific 
measures affecting unemployment insurance and federal 
transfers to the provinces for social security''.
<P>
	We say to the Minister of Finance that he has not advanced 
social security reform. He has shamefully attacked the most 
disadvantaged. He has refused to attack the main cause of all 
these problems, employment. He has also refused to attack 
seriously the most important sources of potential savings: 
family trusts, defence and duplication. Because we in the Bloc 
reject this vision, which is the same as the one previous 
governments had, we want the people of Quebec to have a real 
plan for the future, which can only come about if Quebec goes it 
alone as a sovereign state, even though that will not be easy.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was paying attention to the hon. member's speech and I was 
quite puzzled by some of the statements she made, particularly 
in relation to unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	I recall a few weeks back when the hon. member was 
complaining that perhaps the premiums were too high at $3.07. 
Now we have reduced them so that we can give the type of relief 
to small business to go ahead and create over 40,000 jobs.
<P>
	I will tell the hon. member that one thing she will learn very 
quickly in this House is that inconsistencies are quite dangerous, 
when we promote certain ideas in the House of Commons, 
particularly as a member of the opposition.
<P>
	I am also quite puzzled by the fact that the hon. member would 
say that this government is not addressing the concerns of young 
people. Perhaps the hon. member should be reminded of the 
establishment of the Canadian youth corps and the national 
apprenticeship training program that this government 
introduced. It was part of our red book initiatives.
<P>
	It is fundamental for the hon. member to understand that the 
issues we have raised in the budget are quite consistent with the 
commitments made in the red book. I will tell the hon. member 
why that is important. In case she has forgotten, that red book 
was what gave us one of the strongest-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. There are three people who wish 
to make a comment or ask questions. I do not think the purpose 
of this is to have a speech from the hon. parliamentary secretary. 
Would he make a brief comment or ask a question so that other 
members may participate in this part of the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, you may have been aware that 
there were three people who wanted to participate. I thought I 
was the only one who had the floor at this time and that is why I 
raised those issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1751"> 1751 </A></B>
<P>
	There is some inconsistency. We have to really give a fair 
assessment of what this budget does. The budget does address 
the commitments made in the red book. I do not think it is fair 
for the hon. member for Mercier to somehow tell the Canadian 
people that it does not.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, the inconsistencies are not on my 
side. When the government was elected it had the choice as to 
whether or not to raise UI premiums. The finance minister 
yesterday said that the raising of UI premiums is bad for small 
enterprises and for jobs. However, the government raised them 
from $3 in December to $3.07 in January 1994 for small 
businesses.
<P>
	If the hon. member does not know it, he should look at the 
facts. The inconsistency is to say that it is bad for enterprise, 
taking $800 million from the economy and then a year after 
going back to $3.
<P>
	The government was inconsistent by saying it was not good 
and then doing it. I am glad that it has done it. For me it was a 
pleasure to read that it is not good because it has done it.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the remarks of the member.
<P>
	What came to my mind is a quotation from Jesse Jackson, the 
American political activist, who stated that it was not the poor 
that attended the banquet of the 1970s and 1980s when we saw 
deficit financing by the Liberal and Conservative governments 
that created the inflation and tremendous increase in wealth and 
real estate, stocks and bonds, the over-indulgence to leverage 
buyouts, the huge waste of public money and private corporate 
money. It was not the poor that attended the banquet, but it is the 
poor that gets stuck with the bill.
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree with Jesse Jackson's analysis and 
also agree that what this government is doing is presenting the 
poor with the bill even though the poor were not responsible for 
creating the deficit and the financial mess we are in.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comment. I think he could draw his own conclusions from that 
document.
<P>
	The fact is that there are people right now who do not have 
access to secure jobs. I mentioned in particular young people, 
women, many who live in remote regions, and others as well. In 
Quebec, more than 4,000 bright young engineers are 
unemployed. These people can only rely on the social safety net 
which the government wants to make even smaller, on top of 
making them pay for the inconsistencies of successive 
governments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Mercier for her speech.
<P>
	She made reference in the last sentence to Quebec 
sovereignty. Earlier this afternoon the first speaker for the Bloc 
spoke of Canadians and Quebecers. In referring to Canadians 
and Quebecers and to Quebec sovereignty, are the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois Party referring to Quebec separation from 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that Bloc 
Quebecois members were elected on a platform that promotes 
Quebec's sovereignty. However, they are not in Ottawa to 
achieve that but, rather, to protect Quebec's interests. Quebecers 
respect and appreciate Canada, but during all these years of 
attempting to make reforms which would have given 
appropriate status to our province, the notion that enough is 
enough gradually grew stronger.
<P>
	Instead of wasting time and let intolerance grow, for the very 
reason that there is so much poverty and unemployment, let us 
put all our energy into finding a solution to those problems. To 
that end, Quebec must assume all powers and develop the best 
possible relations with Canada. This is what I was referring to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
brief. The point about sovereignty has been raised.
<P>
	On a financial issue in that regard, the member concluded that 
as a result of the inconsistencies therefore the answer must be 
that a sovereign Quebec will be the solution.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would care to advise the House how 
much of the $500 billion national debt Quebec is prepared to 
assume and how it intends to finance that and survive as a 
separate country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before the hon. member for Mercier 
responds, with the Speaker having just left, I must remind 
members to please put their comments to the Chair. He gets 
quite upset if you do not do that.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will understand, and so will 
the hon. member, that the Bloc does not have a mandate to 
negotiate what will be a normal settlement under the 
circumstances. Assets, liabilities and the repayment of the debt 
will have to be examined. Some people in Quebec have already 
looked at this and I imagine that others are doing the same in 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1752"> 1752 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member and her compassionate approach. She 
brought back memories of the short lived Prime Minister and 
what price she had to pay in the most recent process.
<P>
	Never before have inclusion and consultation taken place with 
respect to putting the budget together. There is no question the 
minister has gone from coast to coast to coast. He opened up the 
process. He listened to the people. Based on what they told us he 
delivered with respect to the RRSPs and capital gains.
<P>
	The member spoke about manipulation and humiliation. I do 
not see any manipulation in going out to the people and asking 
them what we can give them and for their input so that we can 
put a package together that will be good for all in Canada.
<P>
	There were no tax increases. Does the hon. member not think 
that putting $300 million back into small businesses as a result 
of the reduction in the UIC will enhance their opportunities to 
hire people?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> I will say again that the raising of the UI 
premium has deprived small enterprises of opportunities to have 
more employees. I will not go back on that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for consulting, nobody is saying that the Minister of 
Finance did not consult people. In fact, as a member of a 
committee, I can say that I would appreciate being able to hold 
such consultations across the country, although I am aware of 
the cost of such an exercise. However, it may be that the minister 
did not consult enough young unemployed people, unemployed 
single mothers and others who will be adversely affected by the 
new system. In fact, the only ones who will really be penalized 
are precisely those who were not consulted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with my colleague from York-Simcoe.
<P>
	As I was writing this, my maiden speech, I realized it was 
fitting to talk about my riding since I believe the success of the 
federal riding of Waterloo embodies the spirit of the 
government's budget plan.
<P>
	My riding encompasses the city of Waterloo, part of the city 
of Kitchener, and Woolwich township in the heart of 
southwestern Ontario. I am proud to say the Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce recently selected this area as one of five model 
Canadian communities from which to seek advice in order to 
help other communities in their aim for success.
<P>
	In addition, provincial government projections show that 
Waterloo region will be the fastest growing region in Ontario 
over the next two decades. My riding has been successful 
because there has been a partnership of business, academic and 
local government communities supported by the broader 
constituency. This has made Waterloo riding work.
<P>
	As the government stated in the red book upon which the 
budget is based, we must do more with what we have by 
stressing the notion of partnership with all sectors of society and 
by taking advantage of economic and social opportunities that 
can only be realized when all of us are working together.
<P>
	As an example we in the Waterloo region have what is called 
spinoff companies. These companies have used technology and 
human resources transferred from the university community as a 
prime ingredient in their business. These companies have 
already created over 2,000 jobs in Canada. The concept of 
universities and businesses working together is outlined in the 
budget.
<P>
	Waterloo riding, apart from having many companies in the 
new information based economy, also has many traditional 
companies doing well. That is not to say we have not had our 
share of companies and people deeply affected by the recession: 
names such as Seagram's, Uniroyal, Goodrich, Labatt's and 
others. That is why the budget is important, as it creates the 
environment wherein businesses can grow and flourish to create 
the jobs which will put these constituents and others like them 
across Canada back to work.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	To the victims of the recession and the evolution of the 
economy we need to show compassion. The status quo will not 
do for the 1.5 million unemployed Canadians and the millions 
who rely on assistance. I applaud the government for 
undertaking a major effort to build a responsible social security 
system that is fair, compassionate and affordable.
<P>
	Canadians deserve a hand up, not a handout. The ultimate 
social program we can design should provide an economic 
climate so that every Canadian who is willing and able to work 
can find meaningful work. When Canadians work Canada 
works.
<P>
	In particular the budget supports the small and medium sized 
business sector which will continue to be the number one creator 
of jobs in Canada. This holds true in my riding as well. Our 
strong economy is helped greatly by their entrepreneurial drive. 
The global economy is not just a catch phrase of local 
businesses; it is an integral part of their market.
<P>
	The concept of networks of organizations outlined in the 
agenda of the budget has been practised in my riding for some 
time now. Local businesses, civic leaders and academics have 
formed networks for exporting, environmental companies, 
computer technology firms and total quality management. Total 
quality management practised for years by local governments in 
my riding has become a plan that will be pursued by the 
government with its commitment to streamlining government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1753"> 1753 </A></B>
<P>
operations and reducing spending to make them more efficient 
and effective.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are to be 
applauded for recognizing the concerns of my Liberal 
colleagues and myself that middle class Canadians would not 
tolerate an increased tax burden. I am pleased to note the 
Minister of National Defence has taken courageous steps in the 
budget to rationalize the excessive national defence 
infrastructure on the basis of need and function. He is further 
committed to examining my concern about government waste, 
including government moves, a commitment to cost savings and 
efficient operations in government. That has always been part of 
my public life and continues to be so in the House.
<P>
	In keeping with this idea we should debate expanding the 
number of seats in the House. It is my strong wish that any 
reallocation of boundaries be reconsidered in keeping with the 
central premise that the number of MPs be restricted to the 
present number of 295. Canadians do not want more politicians; 
they want us to do more with what we have.
<P>
	People in the community have also been working on creating a 
community venture capital fund by which the community could 
support its own entrepreneurs through capital investments. It is 
ideas like this one which embody the spirit of programs such as 
our Canada investment fund.
<P>
	Environmental issues are not simply a current trend in my 
riding. The University of Waterloo has been a leader in 
environmental studies education for years. The Waterloo public 
interest research group was created by students from the 
University of Waterloo 20 years ago. Through voluntary 
contributions of time and money it has spent over $1 million on 
consumer and environmental concerns. Environmental related 
companies are a growing segment of our business community.
<P>
	For this reason I join with Friends of the Earth to applaud the 
finance minister who is the first ever to speak about sustainable 
development in a budget speech and the government's 
commitment to this end.
<P>
	To achieve this objective the budget outlines the 
establishment of a task force involving government, industry 
and environmental NGOs to identify barriers and disincentives 
to sound environmental practices and to find effective ways in 
which to use economic instruments to protect the environment.
<P>
	The expertise of the riding's workers, managers and 
entrepreneurs is enhanced by the presence of the post-secondary 
institutions mentioned previously, namely Conestoga College, 
the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. 
These world class institutions participate in explicit transfers of 
expertise through their excellence in co-operative education 
and apprenticeship programs.
<P>
	The riding can enjoy a recruitment advantage in this well 
trained pool of potential employees. As a result the 
post-secondary institutions of the Waterloo region offer their 
expertise to the community well before their students graduate.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Until now there has been an alarming trend for our best 
resources, these students, to look for a future in other countries. 
It was a sad commentary that these students were looking to 
companies such as Microsoft in the United States for jobs. In 
effect we had our own brain drain.
<P>
	I am happy our government has addressed this problem by 
active promotion of programs such as the Canadian technology 
network and engineers and scientists program to keep our most 
precious resource, our youth, in Canada.
<P>
	Our commitment to established programs financing 
expenditures to universities will be maintained. This 
government is concerned with education and literacy as 
demonstrated by fully restored funding to the national literacy 
program. This is important to my riding as well.
<P>
	The public and Catholic school board systems offer high 
quality education to our region's students. Both offer 
progressive innovative opportunities for individuals in the 
region. The public school board offers the opportunity for the 
region's workers to complete their high school diploma through 
on site classrooms in the workplace. As well, the separate school 
board is world renowned for placing a priority on full and 
successful integration of challenged students into the 
mainstream classroom.
<P>
	As the finance minister said yesterday, the budget reduces the 
deficit by $6 billion next year and by $7 billion the year after. 
This is an important accomplishment in light of the fact that the 
previous government underestimated the deficit we inherited by 
$13 billion. Over the next three years for every dollar of deficit 
reduction on the revenue side there are $5 of spending cuts by 
this government.
<P>
	What was demanded by Canadians in pre-budget 
consultations was a fair and equitable budget. This has been 
presented by our government. It is our commitment to make this 
government transparent. We will work together, as I know 
personally from my riding that Canadians can, to build a 
partnership that will create opportunity for this country. This 
budget is the foundation that will make that happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the 
hon. member for Waterloo on his excellent speech.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1754"> 1754 </A></B>
<P>
	I remind him that the neighbouring riding of Kitchener is also 
encompassed within the model community cited by the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
<P>
	The hon. member is well known in the area for his interest in 
and knowledge of environmental matters. I was wondering how 
the budget would affect the Waterloo riding and community. He 
referred to the Friends of the Earth comment about the finance 
minister and this particular budget. Waterloo is an area where 
environmental related businesses are most prominent. Is it 
likely that those businesses will be assisted by this budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and 
neighbour from my sister riding.
<P>
	There is no question that the Waterloo federal riding and my 
community has a great history of involvement in environmental 
matters.
<P>
	I refer to a situation which probably started in terms of 
heightening environmental awareness in Canada. In the Love 
Canal in the United States toxic substances were impairing the 
lives of people. The company working on that was 
Conestoga-Rovers which is located in Waterloo. It is one of 
many companies that has started up in our region.
<P>
	I can say to the member for Kitchener that yes, this budget 
will very much enhance those operations. We hope to be one of 
the centres of excellence. I believe we already are and we can 
build on that to make sure in the new economy Canada gets its 
fair share of international business for cleaning up the 
environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his speech. I would like to ask him a question about 
the budget.
<P>
	Does the hon. member have an opinion as to the consequences 
this nation will face if we add another $100 billion to the federal 
debt in the next three years? There is no indication within the 
budget speech or the budget itself of any such consequences.
<P>
	Would the hon. member care to comment on it?
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Telegdi:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was not too long ago that I and 
many of my colleagues were debating these very questions at 
all-candidates meetings. I have always been amazed at the 
extent to which it was hard to get the point across, particularly to 
members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Our position has been very consistent. It is in our red book. 
We went to Canadians. We told them about it. We put the plan 
forward and it is the foundation for everything we do. I believe 
this is where we differ from their approach. Fundamentally, we 
as Liberals believe in making this economy grow. We have 
outlined in our expenditure program that is exactly what we are 
going to do.
<P>
	The Reform position was that it would eliminate the deficit 
within three years. Our position was that we would cut back the 
deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP in three years. The leader of the 
Reform Party has stood up on different occasions and 
challenged the government to attain that 3 per cent of the GDP. 
From looking at this budget and from studying the figures my 
answer is that we can.
<P>
	I have to say to my friend from the Reform Party I hope he will 
stand in this House and applaud when we do accomplish that. We 
believe we have to make this economy grow. We cannot shrink 
it. If the economy shrinks we will go back into a recession. We 
have to believe in ourselves and we have to believe in the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
new member of Parliament I am pleased to deliver my maiden 
speech.
<P>
	I am humbled by the history of this place and yet comforted to 
be part of the long tradition of Canadian democracy. This is not 
to say that tradition is static, unchanging. In fact, this is far from 
the case. Tradition, particularly the Canadian parliamentary 
tradition has adapted and evolved throughout the history of this 
institution.
<P>
	There are many pressures on Parliament, on government and 
on parliamentarians to transform the way government operates. 
Economic, social, environmental, technological, political and 
global forces all act in different ways to challenge, to push and 
pull, to mould a new kind of relationship people have with their 
institutions. The Minister of Finance and the government 
recognized and welcomed this.
<P>
	As a result the Minister of Finance has set upon an 
unprecedented budgetary process, a process that does not end 
with this one finite document. It is a process that if allowed to 
develop fully will lead to a new kind of partnership, a real and 
meaningful partnership among the people of Canada, their 
government, and their social and economic institutions.
<P>
	It is only when we are able to understand the full extent and 
nature of our problems and when we undertake exploration of 
the widest possible range of solutions that we will ever begin to 
address the tough economic problems that affect our nation.
<P>
	Canada has a rightful place as a leader among the nations of 
the world in the 21st century. Through the kind of consultation 
process the Minister of Finance has just begun we will not only 
solve our own problems successfully but we will also provide a 
model for other countries to emulate. The Minister of Finance 
has given all of us a great opportunity to work together and let 
our voices be heard, let our ideas be tested, let our vision of 
Canada meld with the rest to form the Canada we all want.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1755"> 1755 </A></B>
<P>
	We have a difficult and challenging task before us: to restore 
integrity to government and erase public cynicism. As one 
parliamentarian I stand here today and say to the constituents in 
York-Simcoe, to Canadians from across this land, and to my 
colleagues on the other side of this House: We have the political 
will to open dialogue. We have the political will to renew the 
social, economic and political institutions of the country.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	This is the reason I decided to run for office. I believed it is 
important, now more than ever, to rebuild the trust that has been 
broken between the people of Canada and their elected officials. 
I am sure that many of my hon. colleagues in this House have 
similar goals.
<P>
	As Canadians, the most important thing we can remember is 
that we are in this together.
<P>
	When I was elected a member of Parliament I did not stop 
being a citizen of Canada. I also have a stake in this. I have a 
family that I love dearly, a community that I am committed to 
and I have a country that I honour.
<P>
	Like other Canadians across the nation, like my hon. 
colleagues on both sides of the House, I want this country to 
succeed. I want this Parliament to succeed.
<P>
	My colleagues and I need all Canadians to have patience 
because as the hon. Minister of Finance said yesterday in his 
speech, the challenge today is not to rush. The challenge is to get 
things right.
<P>
	We are not asking Canadians to have patience while the 
government sits back and does nothing. We have acted on our 
commitments and will continue to do so. We have fulfilled our 
promises to reinstate the court challenges program and to 
implement the national infrastructure program, the youth 
services program, the aboriginal head start program, the 
women's centres of excellence, the Canadian technology 
network, as well as many others.
<P>
	The red book lives in this budget.
<P>
	We need to have an opportunity for ideas to be generated and 
tested without being torn down. Creative juices are quick to 
freeze in a climate of frosty, unconstructive criticism. Now 
more than ever, it is necessary to develop alternative 
understandings and approaches to problem solving.
<P>
	To paraphrase Albert Einstein, everything has changed but for 
our way of thinking.
<P>
	If we are to approach government differently, we must all 
understand that not only government must change but we must 
change as well.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I am very sorry to 
interrupt the member during her maiden speech but is there 
unanimous consent to let her finish, another four or five 
minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> I thank my hon. colleagues in the House 
for the patience they have shown me.
<P>
	Government has a responsibility for taking leadership to 
create the framework and environment necessary for open, 
inclusive dialogue. The issue now is for government to continue 
to build on the consultation process that has lead up to this 
budget.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we can support this process in our 
own ridings.
<P>
	Fairness and equity are important principles upon which this 
budget is based. These principles must continue to be the 
cornerstones upon which the consultation process rests.
<P>
	Equity is served when consultation is inclusive, when all 
perspectives that represent the differing aspects of Canadian 
diversity are respected and validated.
<P>
	Our diversity arises from geography, race, religion, ethnicity, 
age, gender, sexual orientation, physical and intellectual 
capabilities, class, education and physical appearance, among 
many others. Equity is served when our intergenerational 
responsibilities are acknowledged, when our global roles and 
relationships are honoured.
<P>
	Equity is also served when the natural environment is 
respected.
<P>
	All costs, be they social, health or ecological, are economic in 
the long run. It is very important that the government, through 
these consultations, finds a way to include a new accounting, a 
new way to value the ecological and health benefits and costs 
that government programs, subsidies and taxes provide.
<P>
	This new, ongoing budgetary consultation process, coupled 
with the review and renewal of major government departments 
and policies, particularly human resources, health, defence, and 
industry, means that this government is serious about taking 
action to meet the central challenges facing this nation.
<P>
	This results in the kind of responsible government Canadians 
demand and deserve.
<P>
	It was in my riding of York-Simcoe where the seeds of 
responsible government were first sown in Upper Canada. It was 
here that the rebel, William Lyon Mackenzie, joined forces with 
the farmers and small business owners to challenge the Tory 
family compact.
<P>
	Although it has been over 150 years since responsible 
government has been instituted, the descendants of these rebels 
have carried on the tradition of farming and operating small 
businesses in York-Simcoe, a riding which I am proud to 
represent.
<P>
	Today their farms grace the landscape of New Tecumseh, 
King, east and west Gwillimbury. The world famous Holland 
Marsh is located near Bradford. Small businesses were and are 
still the heart of the economic engine in communities like 
Newmarket and Bradford. Their trades have always been carried 
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1756"> 1756 </A></B>
<P>
out along the main  streets of the villages of Sutton, Keswick, 
Mount Albert, Beeton, Tottenham, Pefferlaw and Schomberg.
<P>
	My riding of York-Simcoe is also graced with the beautiful 
beaches of Georgina along Lake Simcoe. A tourist trade booms 
here all year long with boating in the summer and ice fishing in 
winter.
<P>
	We are also fortunate to have a First Nations band, the 
Chippewas of Georgina Island. This band is determined to 
achieve its inherent right of self-government.
<P>
	I am privileged to stand here today as a representative of a 
riding that reflects the diversity of this great nation. The 35th 
Parliament is a milestone in the Canadian parliamentary history 
as it, far more than any other, is representative of the rich 
tapestry of Canadian diversity.
<P>
	Sitting in this Chamber I look around at my colleagues on 
both sides of the House and I know that we are merely passing 
through. This institution will exist long after the pages of 
<I>Hansard</I> fade and crumble.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we will be measured by the respect that 
we show all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 6.35 p.m., this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.35 p.m.)
<P>
