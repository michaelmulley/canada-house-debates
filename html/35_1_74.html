	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of enthusiasm that 
I join in this debate on the private member's motion first 
presented to the House by the member for Nepean.
<P>
	The need for change to the child support system is recognized 
by Canadians and the government. As many in the House have 
noted the question of child support touches deeply and in many 
respects is a very personal issue. It relates to family 
responsibilities and to the well-being of our children.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Accordingly the government is committed to broad 
consultations with those Canadians most affected. That is why 
as task group of MPs has been formed to conduct a series of open 
round table discussions on child support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As many of you will have noticed, the subject of child support 
payments raises, when it comes to parental responsibilities and 
the well-being of our children, questions which are deeply felt 
and which in many respects are very personal.
<P>
	This is why the government is committed to broad 
consultations with those Canadians most affected. It has, 
therefore, set up a task force of members to hold a series of open 
round table discussions on the subject of child support 
payments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a member of that task group I welcome the deliberations of 
the House. They constitute a thoughtful and highly valued 
source of advice. At the same time I am confident that whatever 
the results of our current debate, the House shares my eagerness 
to hear what Canadians will say to the task group.
<P>
	Over the coming weeks we will be asking Canadians to share 
their experiences and make suggestions with respect to the tax 
treatment of child support. The task group will provide feedback 
and advice on this issue to our government colleagues.
<P>
	We have worked out a schedule to reach a cross-section of 
Canadians, including representatives of custodial and 
non-custodial parents, child advocates, women's organizations, 
lawyers, accountants, community groups and others concerned 
about this issue.
<P>
	We have set out a schedule of meetings in Regina, Montreal, 
Vancouver, Winnipeg, Moncton, Toronto and Ottawa and are 
providing ways for those not in those cities also to participate 
and make their views known to the task group, to the 
government, and to the House.
<P>
	The task group will listen to Canadians with an open mind, 
guided by a number of clear principles. Our over-arching 
principle is that the child's needs come first. Tax rules for child 
support must place paramount importance on the welfare of 
children.
<P>
	Second, we are committed to the principle of fairness. That 
includes fairness between custodial and non-custodial parents 
as well as fairness to other taxpayers. We must treat all family 
situations equitably whether there has been a marriage breakup 
or not.
<P>
	Third, while tax equity demands that tax be paid on income, 
this exercise is not at all about increasing government revenues.
<P>
	The issue surrounding child support payments encompasses 
more than just their tax treatment. Questions relating to levels of 
support and enforcement are critical as well. It is a sad fact that a 
great majority of single mothers in Canada receive no support 
payments at all for their children and that the great majority of 
support orders are not obeyed.
<P>
	Our goals therefore are broader than those of the current 
motion. We want to create a more equitable system for child 
support determinations. That includes generally increasing the 
value of child support awards, simplifying the process, 
providing similar awards in similar family situations.
<P>
	I can understand that Canadian women affected by the 
Thibaudeau decision may be sceptical of the government's 
intent. I want to reassure them that although the decision is 
being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4550"> 4550 </A></B>
<P>
appealed the government recognizes the need to improve the 
child support system.
<P>
	The fact remains, however, that the court's ruling has led to 
tremendous uncertainty and possible chaos in Canadian family 
law. As well, in dealing with only the income inclusion and not 
the deduction the ruling has created an unbalanced system.
<P>
	We expect to achieve significant progress toward a better 
system by the end of this year. That includes reviewing the tax 
system, legislating child support formulas to simplify the 
system and finding more effective ways to enforce support 
orders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We hope to be able to make significant improvements by the 
end of the year, specifically through revision of the tax system 
and legislative measures on child support formulas in order to 
simplify the system and with a view to finding more efficient 
means of enforcing support orders.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am confident that the insights Canadians will provide the 
task group will make a major contribution to this important 
work.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for her motion and the House for the 
opportunity to speak today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too am very happy to speak to this motion and I wish to 
congratulate the hon. member for Nepean for bringing it to the 
floor.
<P>
	The motion, for those watching this on television, has to do 
with the taxing of child support payments. It states that taxes on 
child tax support payments should be paid by the payer rather 
than the recipient. On its face it tends to make sense, but when 
we delve into it a bit deeper we find a host of interrelated 
considerations.
<P>
	This bill is particularly timely following as it does the 
Thibaudeau decision recently received from the Supreme Court. 
This decision has caused a general review of the whole situation 
of tax status and the support paid to families after a marriage 
breakdown.
<P>
	I have a couple of insights I would like to bring to this debate 
and to the broader debate, but I want to assure those watching on 
television that whether this bill survives or passes the 
Commons, this is not the end of the story. It will go on. 
Parliament will come to a reasoned position, one that will be 
satisfactory to all of the various perspectives on this issue.
<P>
	The broad perception is that the tax treatment is not fair. I 
have a fair amount of personal experience in this because I have 
been paying maintenance payments, as many people have, for 
years. My ex-wife and I have talked at great length about this. 
We have come to an agreement outside the judiciary on how we 
would handle it.
<P>
	The real problem was alluded to in a presentation by the hon. 
member who preceded me. It is that the vast majority of people 
who are required to make maintenance payments do not and they 
skip. When we are looking at this we have to look at it in the 
broader context. How do we get the deadbeat parents to accept 
responsibility for looking after the children that they brought 
into the world? Why is it that every time we turn around in our 
country we are able to escape whatever responsibilities we 
should have as individuals and pass them off to the state?
<P>
	The broader question is how do we go about nailing the 
deadbeats, whether they are male or female. Perhaps we should 
look at changing the income tax structure so that if money is 
paid by the state, then the people who owe it have to pay it back.
<P>
	If the individuals owed the tax department the money, would 
they get away with it? I think not. If they do not make their 
payments and look after their responsibilities we as a people, as 
a nation, are forced to look after their responsibilities.
<P>
	As we go down this road it is going to be very important not 
only to consider what is fair to the people who are involved, but 
what is fair to the taxpayers and to once again inculcate the sense 
of responsibility to people when they bring children into the 
world to look after their responsibilities.
<P>
	The problem is interprovincial because if people skip from 
one province to another, they have to be tracked. It is a question 
of will. If people involved in the breakdown, in the divorce, are 
rancorous and do not want to pay, how do we go about doing this 
with a sense of fairness so that they will pay? It is the children 
who are involved that we want to protect.
<P>
	I would like to read briefly from a very thoughtful letter I 
received from a constituent on this issue just the other day. Her 
name is Zanne Cameron and she wrote quite a long and involved 
letter. It is very touching:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As a single parent receiving support payments, I was immediately bumped 
into a 33 per cent tax bracket. The GST was introduced the same year, and I have 
seen health care premiums increase from $80 in 1983 to $180 quarterly in 1994. 
A middle class income is no longer $35,000 a year. It is somewhere over 
$45,000 or more. Yep, it is tough out there. You know what, though? It is not 
tougher for me than for married couples or single people with no children. 
Making a living is not easy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	In the broader context of doing what is right, we have to do 
what is right for the family. The question then comes up, if 
people are not divorced and choose to stay  home and raise a 
family or if one parent does, how is it that family then does not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4551"> 4551 </A></B>
<P>
get the same tax break? That family cannot income split the 
same as a divorced family does.
<P>
	We should be ensuring there are reasons for families to stay 
together rather than to break up. We cannot look at this as a 
straight forward tax this person or tax that person situation. We 
have to look at it based on what is best for the children and what 
is best in the context of our nation.
<P>
	I would like to read once more from Miss Cameron's letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No matter how you dice it, support payments are income to the receiving 
parent. This is not really a feminist issue at all. All parents, single or married, 
must pay taxes on their income. We as women are not special here, nor are we 
the only single parents. The fathers of these children are also their parents, some 
more so than others, but these are private issues. I do not feel that it is fair to 
assume that all divorced men with children neglect them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In conclusion, we cannot automatically assume every 
marriage breakdown is the same. We cannot automatically 
assume every divorced dad or every divorced mom is not 
conscious of their responsibilities and may not end up being a 
better parent because of the situation they are in.
<P>
	Miss Cameron goes on to make a solemn kind of suggestion 
which is that the income be split. The more one thinks of it, the 
more sense it makes. Rather than taxing all one or the other, split 
it down the middle and tax 50 per cent to the recipient and 50 per 
cent to the payer. It does not necessarily have to be all one way 
or the other. In a divorce, heaven knows there are all sorts of 
very complicated issues which arise.
<P>
	As part of a judgment why not decide who is going to get the 
tax benefit so as to induce the most possible income will go to 
the children? Why could it not be left that a person who is in a 
fairly high tax bracket will make the payment to someone in a 
low tax bracket to give the benefit of the tax deduction 100 per 
cent to the payer? In another situation, if the recipient does not 
want to pay any tax and the payer is quite happy to pay the tax, 
then why could that not be done, or any combination?
<P>
	We do not have to go all in one direction or all in another. If 
for the sake of the tax department and for the sake of simplicity 
we need to have it all one way or another, then it would seem to 
me the appropriate thing to do would be to split it 50:50.
<P>
	I want to reiterate to all of the people affected by the 
Thibaudeau decision that on the face of it it does tend to make a 
lot of sense. Many people out there think that perhaps this 
Parliament is not sensitive to their needs. However, I want to 
assure everyone that at least from this side of the House, I know 
from the government side, but I think also from the Bloc, we are 
going to work together as parliamentarians to come to an 
agreement on this which will be palatable both to the payers and 
the  recipients and fair to all concerned. This is particularly to 
benefit the children involved.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have this opportunity to speak in support of the motion of my 
colleague, the member of Parliament for Nepean, and to 
compliment her on bringing this issue to the House for debate.
<P>
	In her motion the member is addressing a crucial factor 
contributing to the poverty of women and children in Canada. 
That is the tax treatment of support payments in cases of divorce 
or separation.
<P>
	Twenty years ago I first heard a woman who had been through 
the experience deliver the warning that any woman is one 
husband away from poverty. In 1994 the situation has not 
changed much. The most recent report of the Vanier Institute 
confirms that the majority of women who walk out of a marriage 
walk into poverty. The actual figure is that two-thirds of women 
whose marriages break up end up in poverty, along with their 
children.
<P>
	When Statistics Canada conducted its recent comprehensive 
survey of women's experience of violence, it learned that 45 per 
cent of women had experienced violent abuse during a previous 
marriage; 15 per cent reported being victims of violence in their 
current marriage. These figures indicate that women do leave 
abusive marriages in great numbers, but to escape the danger of 
a violent marriage they must be prepared to accept the abuse of 
poverty.
<P>
	When single mothers are poor, their children are poor. Since 
this Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution to end child 
poverty by the year 2000 the situation has become worse, not 
better. At that time one in six Canadian children lived in poverty. 
Now that ratio has grown to one in five, an increase by 20 per 
cent of the number of poor children in one of the wealthiest 
countries in the world.
<P>
	As we promote better education and training, we ignore the 
single greatest factor in children dropping out of school: 
poverty. A poor child is four times as likely to leave before 
completing high school.
<P>
	As we try to address the challenge of maintaining a universal, 
accessible health care system while containing its costs, we are 
failing to address a significant factor adding to the demands on 
our health care system: poverty. Poor children are many times 
more likely to be seriously ill, to have serious accidents and yes, 
to die than non-poor children.
<P>
	The treatment of family income on the breakup of a marriage 
is the significant factor in the poverty of women and children. 
Report after report has shown the impact of both inadequate 
support payments, the failure in 75 per cent of cases to pay the 
support as ordered and  finally, the taxation of support payments 
in the hands of the custodial parent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4552"> 4552 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me mention just a few of these reports from the last few 
years. The Federal-Provincial-Territorial Family Law 
Commission and its report on Financial Implications of Child 
Support Guidelines, May 1992. The Ontario Fair Tax 
Commission Report on Women and Taxation, November 1992. 
The Status of Women Canada, Analysis of the Tax Treatment of 
Child Support Payments, January 1993. Le rapport du 
Protecteur du citoyen de la province de Quebec on Child 
Support, Proposals for Reform, November 1993.
<P>
	All these reports have said the same thing: the tax treatment of 
child support payments needs to be changed. It is hurting women 
and it is hurting children. All these reports identify the 
taxability of child support payments in the hands of the 
custodial parent as a major contributor to the poverty of women 
and children. Canada is the only country in the world that taxes 
child support payments in this way.
<P>
	Most recently the Thibaudeau court decision has called the 
tax policy discriminatory on the basis of marital status because 
tax treatment for a couple supporting children is not the same as 
for two separated people supporting children. Our government 
has appealed this case in order to avoid the chaos of cases in the 
thousands coming before the court to vary orders which were 
established under the existing law and which some will argue 
took into consideration the tax treatment of support payments.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The big losers again would be the custodial parents, most of 
whom are women, and their children. Most of them do not have 
the resources to ensure their interests are well represented 
before the courts.
<P>
	Our government is committed to achieving an orderly 
transition from the present system to a better way. Our goals 
generally are to increase the value of child support awards, to 
simplify the process, and to create a more equitable system.
<P>
	We realize the vast majority of single mothers in Canada 
receive no support payments at all for their children and that the 
vast majority of support orders are not obeyed. This represents 
not only a burden to that majority of single parent householders 
in this country, but to all of us as the responsibility for caring for 
these families is often assumed by our social security system.
<P>
	Our goal as a government is to achieve concrete results by the 
end of this year, including reform to the tax system, legislating 
child support formulas and finding ways of working with the 
provinces to enforce support orders.
<P>
	We know there are no easy answers. That is why an important 
part of this process of finding solutions is listening to the 
experience of people on the ground. That is why we have set up a 
task force to consult with  Canadians, to consult with those 
involved with this most unfair system and to find those 
solutions.
<P>
	I want to congratulate my colleague from Nepean for bringing 
forward this issue. With her motion she has ensured that at last 
Parliament and not the courts will address the inequities of the 
current tax laws. She will have to her credit what is all too rare in 
our system: an action by an individual member of Parliament 
that rights a wrong, that will potentially improve the quality of 
life and the future prospects of over one million Canadians. I 
congratulate her.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member for Nepean for bringing forth this 
motion. This motion will help us participate in a much needed 
debate on a very important topic.
<P>
	Clearly the current system around the issue of child support 
payments is unfair. It is outdated and simply is not working. The 
hon. member has helped us to recognize this vital concern that 
the system must be reformed and that we must find a system 
which is fair to women, men and most especially to the children 
who unfortunately experience the breakdown of the family.
<P>
	Understandably, this has been a topic of interest in my own 
riding of London-Middlesex and indeed obviously right across 
this country. This is a vital concern which interests all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Both this motion and the Thibaudeau case show that the 
current system is not working. It is outdated and in bad need of 
repair. However, simply eliminating taxation of support 
payments will not necessarily improve the situation.
<P>
	Without discrimination against women I support the appeal of 
the decision and the task force to consult further into taxation 
measures and enforcement of child support payments. We need a 
more balanced system which is fair to all involved. However, I 
say again most especially we need a system that keeps as its first 
priority an adequate level of support paid regularly and on time 
to the children who have experienced the breakdown of their 
family.
<P>
	On a personal note, as an educator for some 21 years in 
Ontario I can attest to the learning and social difficulties 
experienced by many children who come from broken and 
poorer families. All too often these children are unhappy in 
school and they underachieve as a consequence. Let me hasten 
to add there are many obvious exceptions to that. There are 
young people who are so well balanced and mature they manage 
to live through the breakdown of the family and carry on fairly 
nicely to successfully complete their education.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	I say again, and any teacher anywhere in this land can tell you, 
all too often that is not the case. All too often these students have 
a number of problems which must be overcome if they are to 
successfully complete their education. Many times, unfortu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4553"> 4553 </A></B>
<P>
nately, that education is  interrupted or prematurely ended 
because of the problems that I have mentioned.
<P>
	I commend the hon. member for this motion. We have heard 
many people speak out on the issue in our ridings, in the media, 
in this Chamber and obviously in the courts. Times have 
changed and the legislation to deal with this important problem 
must keep pace with the times.
<P>
	As it now stands, the government is short $330 million in tax 
payments and $660 million in deductions. The issues that this 
case and this motion raise go far beyond narrow questions of 
taxation or legal interpretation. Most important and as part of 
his comprehensive review of social programs, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development in co-operation with the 
provinces will have to come to grips with the fact that the vast 
majority of single mothers in Canada receive no support 
payments at all for their children and that the vast majority of 
support orders are not obeyed. That is a pathetic fact that I think 
we all acknowledge. Indeed, one of my colleagues across the 
way spoke to this on a more personal basis earlier.
<P>
	We simply cannot have the courts and the laws of this country 
flouted in such an important area as the support of one's 
offspring.
<P>
	The system dates back to 1942. That date alone calls to mind 
that the system is outdated. The problem was that lawyers and 
judges frequently failed to increase payments to offset taxes. 
High income fathers got off without paying tax on part of their 
income while children suffered to make up the shortfall. Even 
with the tax benefit a majority of support agreements are in 
default in Ontario and some two-thirds of children from 
separated families live in poverty. That point has been made 
before in this House and today again, but it is a point that is so 
dramatic that it cannot be made too often. Some two-thirds of 
children from separated families live in poverty and the fallout 
of that, both in the school systems and in society at large, is 
incalculable. It is really a major problem that our society must 
come to grips with.
<P>
	A modern and comprehensive approach would boost 
enforcement and set minimum support guidelines to ensure that 
children are properly served.
<P>
	I am pleased to see the emphasis on fairness to Canadian 
women and I am sure the first people to support this would be 
those very women. The priority must at all times be the children 
involved. Whatever is going to be most effective to make sure 
that they are adequately cared for is the system that I and 
Canadians want to support.
<P>
	To sum up, an appeal of the Thibaudeau decision may not 
seem necessary since Ottawa and the provinces are already 
studying ways to improve child support guidelines. I think the 
appeal is a good step as it will help us come to grips with the 
system in a more comprehensive way and to find that balanced 
system which we are sorely lacking right now.
<P>
	Because the court only examined one side of the formula, the 
tax but not the deduction, there is this imbalance of which I 
speak. The father can claim the deduction but the mother no 
longer pays tax, a far richer subsidy than anyone intended. I do 
not think there can be anyone in this House and I have heard 
from very few Canadians who would object to the statement of 
the hon. Minister of Finance. He put it very succinctly and he put 
it very well and with common sense: Someone has to pay the tax.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that someone must pay that tax. It 
cannot simply be forgone.
<P>
	In closing, I support the task force chaired by the Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women because I fully recognize with the 
government the need for change. Again I commend my hon. 
colleague from Nepean for her motion. I hope the end result of 
this process will be a much fairer system recognizing the needs 
of the children.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to offer my support to this motion which calls for the 
government to amend the Income Tax Act so that child support 
payments are no longer considered taxable income for the 
recipients.
<P>
	I would first congratulate the hon. member for Nepean for 
raising this matter in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Last March I wrote to the Minister of Finance urging him to 
make changes to the Income Tax Act in order to rectify this 
inequity. In the past few weeks the issue was thrown into a state 
of chaos by the Federal Court of Appeal rendering its judgment 
in the well publicized Thibaudeau case.
<P>
	In effect the court ruled that separated custodial parents did 
not have to include child support payments as part of their 
income when filing income tax returns. This decision has raised 
public attention to the urgency of reforming the Income Tax Act 
with respect to child support payments. I am proud to see that 
this government recognizes the importance of this issue and is 
already taking measures to address the matter in the fairest way 
possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have no problem supporting this motion as well as the 
government's recent decision to appeal the Federal Appeal 
Court's ruling. I must admit that, at first, I was having my doubts 
regarding the government's decision, but I then realized that 
appealing this judgment would better serve the interests of those 
who were the most concerned, namely children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4554"> 4554 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government appealed the Thibaudeau decision so it may 
come up with a better arrangement to avoid a potentially 
disastrous situation in the meantime. It is my understanding that 
the court's ruling is causing much confusion among both 
support payers and recipients.
<P>
	Lawyers from across the country are receiving phone calls 
from clients who want their support payments lowered. If the 
court ruling was allowed to stand thousands of applications 
would have to be litigated, Canadian courtrooms would be 
clogged and the result would be needless anguish and expense 
for all parties concerned.
<P>
	In addition, it is also thought that the recent court decision 
would further aggravate the problem of failure to pay support 
payments since non-custodial parents would have less incentive 
to comply with court mandated support payments without the 
benefit of tax deductions.
<P>
	Moreover, since the federal appeal court's decision did not 
deal with the deductibility of child support by the payer it left in 
question how the tax will be paid on income that is directed to 
child support.
<P>
	If the ruling was left untouched its effect would be that 
separated parents unlike other parents would not be required to 
pay taxes on money they use to support their children. Clearly 
this type of scenario would create a very unfair situation for 
married couples with children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government, realizing that a change is due, is going to 
consult Canadians who are the most directly affected. The 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women will head a task force 
made up of MPs, which is to hold a series of public hearings, 
very shortly, on various issues regarding child support, 
including the tax system, and report to the government.
<P>
	Moreover, the Minister of Justice asked a 
federal-provincial-territorial committee on family law, which 
is presently looking into a whole range of issues concerning 
child support, to present its report before the end of the summer.
<P>
	The findings of the task force and of the family law committee 
will guide the government in its review of a new and fair child 
support system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Currently there are over 1.2 million children who live in 
poverty. If we consider that among female lone parent families 
62 per cent have income below the poverty line it is easy to see 
where the majority of these children come from.
<P>
	In my opinion, the tax rules relating to child support payments 
probably have something to do with these grim statistics.
<P>
	I believe the question at hand is one of fairness for single 
parents and their children. Child poverty has reached 
frightening levels in this country. It must be dealt with now. This 
government will soon introduce measures that will improve the 
circumstances of single parents and their children. By making 
reforms to the tax system and legislating child support formulas 
to simplify the system, this government will demonstrate its 
commitment to tax equity and reducing child poverty.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	This is a very important area of social policy and merits a 
great deal of the government's time and attention. Unfortunately 
the opposition parties are much more preoccupied with 
constitutional issues and questions such as law and order. The 
threat of Quebec separation creates economic instability and 
stifles our growth, but worst of all it detracts our attention from 
important social matters that need to be addressed urgently.
<P>
	I am sure the members of the Reform Party would notice a 
huge difference in the crime statistics they quote so often if 
issues such as child poverty were the priority of all members of 
this House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the motion today. I congratulate the hon. 
member on behalf of Canadians families for taking the initiative 
to bring this bill forward.
<P>
	Tax treatment of child support is not merely an issue of 
taxation. The tax treatment of child support goes to the 
fundamental principles of justice and equity. The paramount 
consideration in determining the issue of tax treatment of child 
support must be in the best interest of our children and in the 
best interest of the family, not the legal or economic 
considerations which are often the determining factors in 
taxation issues.
<P>
	Fundamental to this legislative debate here today are the 
principles of equity and fairness. To tax child support payments 
is inequitable. To give a tax deduction to the payer of child 
support is inequitable.
<P>
	During my 17 years of practice in the field of family law I saw 
the burdens that exist as a result of the inequities both economic 
and social and that are still existing today due to the marriage 
breakdown and the breakdown of families and family life.
<P>
	The economic and social inequity is borne by the custodial 
parent who is left without the burden to provide the financial and 
the non-financial contribution to the support of the children as a 
result of marriage breakdown.
<P>
	I draw the attention of the House to the Moge and Moge 
Supreme Court of Canada case and its reasoned judgment which 
gives details of the hardship, the economic disparities, poverty 
and inequities that exist as a result of marriage breakdown in our 
society today. I also draw attention to the allocation of child 
support, the quantum and the inequities that exist throughout 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4555"> 4555 </A></B>
<P>
our  country. I recommend this decision to members for their 
reading for background information.
<P>
	Another inequity that exists is that a payer of child support 
should be rewarded with a taxation deduction to provide an 
incentive to support one's very own family. We should question 
the underlying issues of morality and equity and ask why 
Canada is the only country in the world to tax child support 
payments and to provide such a deduction to the payer.
<P>
	Another inequity in the present system is that the families that 
stay together and are united in marriage are not provided a tax 
deduction or allowed income splitting to provide economic 
equity for our stay at home mothers or one income families.
<P>
	In conclusion, in keeping with the fundamental principles of 
justice and equity and to afford legal, economic and social 
protection of our families as they exist today, all the inequities 
that are raised in this bill must be addressed without delay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be given the opportunity to speak on 
this particular proposal.
<P>
	The Thibaudeau case has occurred, the appeal has been 
undertaken, there will be hearings, but what is important at the 
end of all of this is to remember the following. Most people, and 
most often women, do not get child support payments. Many of 
those who do-and I am told it is a majority-do not get them 
paid and many who do get them paid do not get them paid on 
time. It would seem to me that unless these particular problems 
are corrected at the end of the process we have done a great deal 
for very little.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Let us remember there is a great deal of inconsistency 
throughout the country with respect to child support payments. 
Let us remember that one can be given a particular award in a 
particular province in a particular situation. Yet there can be a 
like situation and the award can be entirely different. That is 
within the one province, let alone comparing provinces and 
territories.
<P>
	Let us also remember that most people rearing families after 
broken marriages are women. Let us remember that women's 
earnings, their ability to earn and to spend on themselves and 
their families, are reduced significantly as a result of marriage 
breakdown. Let us remember that whenever they attempt to get 
justice, either to have an appropriate amount paid or to have 
whatever was decided paid on time, it often costs them a great 
deal of money; most often resources they do not have.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, in my view, it is a matter of fundamental justice. A 
number of things have occurred. A ruling was handed down, an 
appeal will be launched and public hearings will be held across 
Canada. That is all well and good, but, as I mentioned earlier, if 
the problems I have identified-and I identified only a 
handful-are not resolved, it will be most unfortunate, because 
one thousand women, hundreds of men and thousands of 
children are adversely affected. There are no specific provisions 
in place to ensure that children do not fall into the poverty trap, 
that they receive what is rightfully theirs and that they enjoy the 
same opportunities as children who do not come from broken 
homes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Those are the few comments I wanted to make. I reiterate that 
if at the end of the process the problems I have identified are not 
corrected it will be for naught. In most cases women and 
children suffer. We must correct that for their sake.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
have the opportunity to make a few comments in this debate. I 
begin by congratulating the hon. member for Nepean on 
bringing forward the motion. Her interest in and her support for 
women and children caught in untenable situations have long 
been known. We are all very grateful to the hon. member for 
Nepean for bringing it to the forefront in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	With regard to the whole way the income tax system deals 
with the questions of child support and maintenance, there is a 
rather high level of misapprehension and misunderstanding out 
there among even those people who are involved in the system.
<P>
	The first thing to remember is that we have a very bad rate of 
collection of maintenance and child support in the country. 
Currently only 37 per cent of child support orders are 
enforceable in Canada.
<P>
	When I started practising law in 1980 it was worse. The 
non-compliers were in the high nineties. However clearly 63 per 
cent of child support payments are unenforceable and in the 
province of Ontario 80 per cent are either unenforceable or in 
arrears. That is unacceptable in a country like Canada. That is 
why I want to speak very much in favour of the government's 
initiative in setting up the task force to go across the country to 
consult with Canadians, the women who receive these payments 
on behalf of themselves and their children, the men who pay the 
payments, and the lawyers who represent them both.
<P>
	The ramifications of the Thibaudeau case are not simple. 
They are very complex. The problems of the tax system are not 
simple; they are very complex.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4556"> 4556 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	We have here a question of fairness, not just fairness to those 
people who are the payers and payees of child support but 
fairness to families as my colleague from Central Nova and 
other colleagues have mentioned. There is a question of fairness 
to those mothers and fathers who co-parent and who also need 
tax breaks.
<P>
	There is the question of poverty among women and children. 
It is very important to note that we should not separate women 
and children. The number of children who live below the 
poverty line is unacceptable and in the vast majority of cases 
their mothers live with them. We have to look at the problem and 
deal with it in the broader sense, not merely in the context of the 
Thibaudeau decision and in the context of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Fair taxes are something that we on this side of the House are 
very concerned with. It is absolutely crucial that Canadians, and 
Canadian women in particular who think the Thibaudeau case 
was a bonus for them, understand there is more to it. We must 
have a policy.
<P>
	I commend the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Justice, 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance and the 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women. This task force will 
bring us the consultations we need to formulate the policy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be very brief. I simply want to say how much I 
support the motion of the hon. member for Nepean.
<P>
	As other members have pointed out, in other countries 
including the United States, there is no tax on child support 
payments to women who receive them. Yes, there is taxation on 
alimony payments to former wives, to formers spouses, but not 
on child support that is sent to a mother. If they can do it in the 
United States certainly this is one area where we can copy them.
<P>
	I also simply want to make the point that fathers who are still 
in the family have the obligation in the family to support their 
children. There is no special tax break of the same nature that 
they have under the present law.
<P>
	I simply as another member want to fully support the 
initiative of the hon. member for Nepean and hope that the court 
appeal will in no way impede in the long run what she is 
attempting to do.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like 
to have the consent of the House for a few moments to close the 
debate on this very important matter.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent, given that 
the time has expired, to grant a few more moments to the hon. 
member for Nepean?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank everyone on all 
sides of the House for speaking in support of Motion M-14.
<P>
	The motion has received a tremendous amount of interest 
right across the country. There have been an incredible number 
of contacts made to me personally from every province, from 
women, from custodial parents and from payers whom I want to 
thank publicly in the House of Commons.
<P>
	This motion was born because of the plight of children. We as 
a nation have said consistently that to look after children we 
must decrease poverty. We must ensure that our children are 
properly looked after.
<P>
	It was because of people bringing the issue to my attention 
during the recent federal election campaign that I brought the 
issue forward in the House of Commons. It has been a great 
privilege for me to have had the opportunity to present it and to 
have three one-hour debates on the votable motion before the 
House.
<P>
	Again, on behalf of all parents and all children, I hope we have 
unanimous consent in the House to approve the motion. I thank 
the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Justice. There is no 
doubt in my mind that we will move ahead to enact some change 
to the Income Tax Act to allow the children to be better taken 
care of.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, before you ask us to vote on this 
motion, as chief government whip, I would like to announce that 
this vote will be a free vote as usual. All votes on private 
members' business are free votes, and this one will be no

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed, from May 26, consideration of Bill 
C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to implement certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 22, 
1994, as reported (without amendment) from the committee; 
and of Motions Nos. 23 to 38.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate on the motions in 
group No. 5 or Motions Nos. 23 to 38 inclusive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on Bill C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 22, 1994.
<P>
	The provisions of Bill C-17 respecting unemployment 
insurance are unacceptable, as a whole and individually, 
particularly as far as benefit rates are concerned.
<P>
	In my speech on the budget, I reminded the House at the time 
that Montreal has become the capital of poverty. In March 1994, 
according to Statistics Canada, there were 151,270 UI recipients 
in Montreal. In the greater Montreal area, 18.5 per cent of 
families are living under the poverty line.
<P>
	I have asked a question about the effects the increase in 
unemployment will have. The unemployment rate has grown 
from 9.1 per cent in December 1989 to 13.8 per cent in 
December 1993, exceeding the growth of the unemployment 
rate in Saint John's, Newfoundland, for the same period, while 
in Toronto it had gone from 4.1 per cent in December 1989 to 
11.5 per cent in December 1993. I also pointed out that, even 
before consultations on the needs of the population start, the UI 
reform would have an absolutely catastrophic effect on the 
provinces' finances.
<P>
	The budget measures will result in an increased need for 
social assistance at the expense of the provinces which will then 
have to cut, as usual, in their social programs and services 
because transfer payments are frozen.
<P>
	Last Thursday, Statistics Canada announced that long-term 
unemployment had increased in 1990, 1991 and 1992, which 
means that fewer people received or qualified for 
unemployment insurance. It is estimated that more than 10 per 
cent of unemployed workers have turned to provincial social 
assistance programs.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has proposed that this Bill, in Clause 22, 
be amended by replacing line 16, on page 11, with the following: 
``(ii) the greater of 57 per cent of the''.
<P>
	The purpose of this amendment is simple. At present, the rate 
of weekly benefit payable to a claimant is equal to 57 per cent of 
his average weekly insurable earnings; the government plans to 
reduce this rate to 55 per cent. The Bloc is merely asking to 
leave it at 57 per cent.
<P>
	As we know, insurable earnings are based on average 
insurable weekly earnings over the reference period. For 
example, a person whose average insurable weekly earnings 
amount to $620 would see his or her benefits decrease from $353 
to $341 if the bill is passed without amendments.
<P>
	The government tackles its deficit by gradually eroding the 
benefits of the poorest.
<P>
	Let us also keep in mind that the benefit rate will be reduced 
from 57 per cent to 55 per cent for about 85 per cent of 
recipients.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Once again, government savings are achieved on the backs of 
the unemployed. I would like to remind you that businesses 
whose annual UI contributions are less than $60,000 qualify for 
a tax credit to cover the increase in their contributions up to 
$30,000.
<P>
	What a funny UI program: the government does not have 
money to pay benefits to the unemployed but finds the necessary 
resources to pay some employers' contributions to that same 
plan. Another double standard, not to say anything about social 
equity.
<P>
	The changes to the benefit structure are simply designed to 
erode income replacement programs and introduce the principle 
of justification based on means. The double benefit rate 
structure is outrageous. Like the Canadian Labour Congress, we 
must recognize that workers' income is not based on their 
family status any more than their premiums, hiring or dismissal.
<P>
	For a government to conceive such a program strongly 
contradicts the principle of income replacement and other 
aspects of the labour market; it is a disgrace. This government is 
destroying the basic principle of income replacement that was 
the hallmark of the Canadian UI program for many years.
<P>
	The formula described in clause 22 whereby a higher benefit 
rate would be given to low-income claimants with dependants 
hides the fact that other planned changes in this bill will 
decrease the benefits paid to these same people.
<P>
	In fact, the advantage of a higher benefit rate will be cancelled 
by the stricter eligibility standard, a reduction of 12 to 10 weeks 
of work and a reduced benefits period. The real reason for this 
bill is to reduce benefit levels. I remind this House that the 
benefit level has already been reduced twice: from 66 to 60 per 
cent of salary under Bill C-21 in 1990 and from 60 to 57 per cent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4558"> 4558 </A></B>
<P>
of insurable  earnings through the amendments made in Bill 
C-113 in 1993.
<P>
	How can the public not be cynical towards governments when 
it sees this Liberal government pursue the very policies it 
denounced when it was in opposition barely a year ago? I will 
take this opportunity to quote the present Prime Minister in a 
letter dated March 26, 1993 to opponents of Bill C-113: ``The 
Liberals are dismayed by these measures. By reducing benefits 
and further penalizing those who voluntarily leave their jobs, 
clearly the Conservative government cares very little for the 
victims of the economic crisis. Instead of attacking the real 
problem, it is attacking the unemployed-'' That was barely a 
year ago.
<P>
	Conservative or Liberal, it is the same thing. The poorest 
people, who are the victims of this system, are attacked. The 
proposed changes in Bill C-17 will lower the benefit rate for the 
great majority of claimants to 55 per cent. The lower benefit rate 
was adopted for just one reason: to reduce spending on 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Like others, including the Public Service Alliance, I reject the 
two-rate benefit structure described in this bill, as well as the 
lower general benefit rate. In fact, it is important for benefits to 
be paid to all claimants on the basis of their former employment 
income.
<P>
	The government points out that the 60 per cent benefit rate 
will apply to only 15 per cent of claimants. However, I will add 
that the reduction of the benefit rate from 57 to 55 per cent will 
apply to 85 per cent of claimants. The Canadian Labour 
Congress points out that the higher benefit rate, even the 60 per 
cent rate for recipients with dependents and a low income, is not 
designed to increase the protection afforded to the unemployed.
<P>
	The $12 per week involved is cancelled out by more stringent 
eligibility standards or the duration of benefits, or both. In the 
case of workers deemed ineligible because they cannot even get 
12 weeks of work, this means a total loss. The government did 
not tell us how many of those recipients who earn less than $390 
per week and who have dependents will lose everything.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	With this measure, the Liberal government is getting closer to 
the American pattern regarding weekly insurable earnings. 
Indeed, Canada reduces its rate from 57 to 55 per cent, while in 
most American States that rate is 50 per cent.
<P>
	Taken together, the new unemployment insurance measures 
will translate into savings of $725 million for the government in 
the first year, and $2.4 billion in the two subsequent years. This 
decision however causes a serious prejudice to the unemployed, 
who will see their purchasing power diminish and will thereby 
make less of a contribution to the economy of their region and 
community. The government is only creating a greater gap 
between the rich and the poor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Eighty-five per cent of the claimants of unemployment 
insurance will lose money in order that the government may 
avoid the painful exercise of cutting costs of government 
operations. Only claimants who have both dependants and a 
dismally underpaid job will be able to receive 60 per cent of 
insured earnings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Like Quebec with the ``boubous macoutes'' of the Quebec 
Liberal government, the rest of Canada will see the emergence 
of its own flock of overzealous federal civil servants trying to 
track down their quota of bad abusers the system. The witch hunt 
is on.
<P>
	For the most part, it is divorced workers responsible for single 
parent families who will have to prove that they have 
dependents. What an incredible mess! The government is adding 
yet another administrative level, ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', at the 
expense of taxpayers, to harass the unemployed.
<P>
	Some used to say ``poor Canada''; now, thanks to the Liberal 
government, this country will be even poorer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have an opportunity to 
speak on Bill C-17, an act to implement budget measures.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois members are missing a central theme in 
the budget. It has to do with small and medium size business. We 
campaigned last summer on the fact that small and medium size 
business represented the greatest hope for putting Canadians 
back to work.
<P>
	As Liberals we said that if the 900,000 men and women who 
owned or operated small and medium size businesses were given 
a proper environment, the chances of hiring Canadians were 
very good. A central theme in this budget has been to try to 
create that environment that will cause that entrepreneurial 
spirit to move forward again.
<P>
	There are a number of things that one has to do to create that 
environment and they have all been listed in the budget. Of 
course one of the very first items that we said we would address, 
and we did say this in the budget, was access to capital for small 
and medium size business.
<P>
	All members of the House have been working on that issue 
over the last three months. We are beginning to get some 
movement. It is amazing that when the opposition stands up, it 
picks one or two little pieces. It is all negative. It cannot seem to 
find anything positive that we have done here in the House of 
Commons or in committee in the last few months.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4559"> 4559 </A></B>
<P>
	Another theme in the budget which is related to the bill that 
we are talking about today has to do with making sure that we 
encourage our small and medium size entrepreneurs to trade 
more on the international scene, on the global scene.
<P>
	As members of Parliament, we have to be more creative when 
we are looking at this budget and use it as an instrument of hope 
as well as a way of giving guidance to some of our small and 
medium size businesses.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	Last week a group of parliamentarians from the government 
side went to China for 12 days with 120 small and medium size 
businessmen and women from every region of this country. I 
would say through you, Mr. Speaker, to the opposition that over 
90 per cent of them had never gone on a foreign mission before. 
Going to China was a totally new experience.
<P>
	We discovered number one that there is an economy over 
there which is very receptive to doing business with small and 
medium sized Canadian firms. It is not just the larger Canadian 
firms that they want to do business with. In fact unlike a few 
years ago when China was a place where it would take 
sometimes as long as 10 years to complete a deal, today they are 
moving in a very expeditious way.
<P>
	I believe if we as parliamentarians would become more aware 
of the economic opportunities that exist in a country like China 
for our small and medium size business, we would then look 
more at this budget that the Minister of Finance has put forward 
where he is trying to create an environment which will inspire 
that sector to take risks, to have the courage to move forward, to 
hire again. If we showed them that their markets are not just in 
North America but that there are tremendous markets as well in 
the Asia Pacific region, I think we could trigger this economy 
that we are all working desperately on to move forward.
<P>
	My message today on Bill C-17 is the fact that all of the 
components of the budget are an attempt to create a total 
environment which will allow small business to reinvent itself, 
to retool itself, to allow it to rethink its whole strategy for the 
new economy.
<P>
	If we approach the budget knowing that all of those options 
exist then we will probably have a better chance of putting 
Canadians back to work. The member said earlier in his speech 
that jobs must be our focus. I think realizing that objective 
would be a lot more realistic.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, like all my 
colleagues, I am here today to speak to Bill C-17. For the benefit 
of those listening, I would like to recall the purpose of the bill 
before the House today. Bill C-17 is what is commonly referred 
to as an omnibus bill, a kind of catch-all that contains measures 
affecting a number of different acts and programs. It is a mixed 
bag of provisions, the only connection between them being that  
they are intended to implement proposals contained in the 
budget brought down on February 22, 1994.
<P>
	Of course when we talk about the budget, we talk about money 
and when we talk about money, we can talk about so many 
things, which is also the case today. Again, for the benefit of our 
listeners, this bill contains amendments to the Public Sector 
Compensation Act, the Governor General's Act, the Judges Act, 
the Parliament of Canada Act, the Salaries Act, the Canada 
Assistance Plan, the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act, 
the Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act, the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, the Broadcasting Act and the 
Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you can see, a large number of acts and 
programs are affected by this so-called omnibus bill. Our 
listeners will probably have noticed that, in their presentations, 
members have approached these subjects in various ways.
<P>
	Today, I intend to discuss the Unemployment Insurance Act. 
There are eight measures in the bill that will affect this 
legislation. However, it has been two years since in Quebec, the 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre has 
been prepared to take full responsibility for manpower, and 
unemployment insurance is one aspect of this sector.
<P>
	Unfortunately, like the Conservative government, the Liberal 
government has yet to act on the requests made by the 
Government of Quebec and, instead, is proposing new measures 
that have made it incumbent on us in the Bloc québécois to try to 
make the best of a bad situation, in other words, to take the 
measures and make the necessary changes that would prevent 
them from having a negative impact.
<P>
	For instance, I would like to draw your attention to clause 22 
in Bill C-17 which deals with the difference in rates of benefit 
for a claimant without dependants and for a claimant with 
dependants.
<P>
	We know that in the case of claimants without dependants, the 
bill proposes a rate of benefit that is 55 per cent of insurable 
earnings, while in the case of claimants with dependants, the 
rate is 60 per cent. The intent of the bill is commendable because 
it goes without saying that claimants with dependants do indeed 
have additional financial requirements.
<P>
	Our concern stems from the fact that there is no clear 
indication in the bill before us on whom the burden rests to 
prove that the claimant does or does not have any dependants. 
We are concerned that, as the bill is now worded, the burden of 
proof rests with the claimant. My colleague who spoke earlier 
alluded very clearly to this point. If this is in fact the case, the 
bill creates problems for claimants who will be required to prove 
that they do indeed have dependants and who will experience an 
additional delay in receiving their benefits, not to mention all of 
the bureaucratic frustrations this process is likely to entail.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4560"> 4560 </A></B>
<P>
	For this reason, the Bloc Quebecois proposed an amendment 
which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For purposes of paragraph (1)(<I>b</I>), a claimant needs only to establish a <I>prima 
facie</I> entitlement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	All the claimant would be required to do is acknowledge or 
confirm that he or she does in fact have dependants. The rate of 
weekly benefit provided under that paragraph would thus apply. 
The burden would rest squarely with the Commission to prove 
that the claimant was not entitled to this rate of benefit. In my 
view, this amendment would protect in the best possible way the 
interests of the public and, in particular, of those individuals 
who do have dependants and who would thus need to do nothing 
more than simply say so.
<P>
	When people file their income tax returns, they state certain 
facts. The Department of Revenue takes it for granted that the 
facts are correctly stated, and the onus is on it to prove 
otherwise.
<P>
	Moreover, most single parent families-and it is a fact of life, 
one that I am not passing judgement on-are headed by women. 
And if the present wording of the clause in the bill is maintained, 
it is a good bet that some of these single parents, most of whom 
are women, will have to prove their entitlement by travelling, 
losing time from work or time to be with their children, to go to 
the commission and show that they have dependent children.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I think that it is adding insult to injury by again giving single 
parents more work to do.
<P>
	Therefore, the purpose of the Bloc's amendment is to remove 
the burden of proof from the claimants and also to 
avoid-unfortunately, such things have already 
happened-setting up welfare police to investigate in the 
neighbourhood of these claimants who say they have dependants 
and to verify the accuracy of their statements, an approach that I 
find inappropriate, to say the least, in a civilized society like 
ours.
<P>
	We admit that controls are required, but we say that care must 
be taken in the way that they are exercised. In this context, we 
believe that it is not only right but necessary for the burden of 
proof to be on the commission so that people will not have to 
worry and fret in order to prove their good faith; the good faith 
of everyone concerned should be assumed.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, unfortunately those who can benefit 
from such a measure are usually those with the lowest salaries 
and, quite often, these job categories are in direct relation with 
the educational level. This is not merely a point of view: it is a 
statistical fact.
<P>
	These less educated recipients do not always know what to do 
to protect their interests or have access to certain remedies. 
They are not always able to express themselves easily and 
defend their position.
<P>
	Should these people, who are already less privileged by 
society, have to shoulder an additional burden?
<P>
	Finally, as I also mentioned, women responsible for single 
parent families have neither the time nor the means to take care 
of an injustice done to them. Yet, they have to do it to get the 60 
per cent to which they are entitled, or else they will only receive 
55 per cent of their insurable earnings. This gap will create 
enormous problems, particularly for these people who, 
generally, can barely afford to pay for their rent and food. Yet, 
they are asked to take on a responsibility which the commission 
would be in a much better position to assume.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask the House to approve this amendment, 
since it would not affect in any way the increase provided for 
recipients with dependents, but would give to the 
implementation of this clause a human dimension which would 
take into account, among other things, the plight of single parent 
families, and which would ensure that a good decision is taken 
in the appropriate manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to make a few comments regarding this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the first things I want to do is pick up on a number of 
points that have been made in the debates and to show that there 
is some inconsistency.
<P>
	For example we talk about an omnibus bill. That is really 
quite correct. Various members have indicated that they wanted 
to see it separated. Perhaps people have observed that the only 
real commentary that has been received, and a lot of it has been 
received, has been on the unemployment insurance provisions. 
If it bothered so many people that this is an omnibus bill, surely 
they would taken each section and would have said this or that is 
what I oppose, with respect to each particular part.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I find it interesting why it should be so. Clearly people who 
oppose, if they are sincere, must have some specific 
recommendations to make on every single part of the bill. I have 
not heard that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is confusing. I mentioned unemployment insurance, and I 
really have no criticism to make on that. I believe that what the 
Bloc would like to do is very clear. When dealing with an 
omnibus bill and claiming that it would have been simpler to 
consider each element, one at a time, because of the multitude of 
programs involved, it seems to me that it should have considered 
them one at a time, and said: ``This is what we suggest regarding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4561"> 4561 </A></B>
<P>
A,  what we want concerning B, what should be done respecting 
C''. During a debate, differences of opinion are expected.
<P>
	I see some of my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois with a 
smile on their faces. They must appreciate my remarks. I shall 
go on then. The Bloc's discourse seems to be blatantly 
inconsistent. I will give you an example. On many occasions, 
not only their leader, but several Bloc members mentioned that 
they would like to see expenses cut, that we spend too much 
money, that the deficit and the debt are staggering-we do 
agree-and that we should manage our affairs better; and then, 
when the government decides to do just that, they claim that it 
should not cut anything, and that instead it should spend more. 
There may be some logic in all that, and I am sure that my 
colleagues from the Bloc will come and explain to me where it 
is, in a little while. I know how eager they are to help me 
understand things.
<P>
	A few days ago, they were blaming the government for its lack 
of long term vision. Mr. Speaker, you and I know that, after a 
few months in the House, or even a few sessions or Parliaments, 
the opposition loves to repeat that the government has no vision, 
no long term or short term plan, that it does not know where it is 
going, and so on and so forth. After a while, it gets rather boring. 
Let us be a little bit more creative. We do have a long term vision 
called social program reform. I am quite sure that you have 
heard of it since a few questions were put to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development on the matter. Our long term 
vision is to bring about changes that will meet the real needs of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	It seems to me that we should be working together on such a 
project with a view to finding creative solutions and go on from 
there. This past weekend, it was announced that we lived in the 
best country in the world. This was fantastic news. I have a 
feeling that after hearing this announcement from the United 
Nations, my colleagues from the Bloc will work hard to help us 
not only to appreciate what we have, but to build on our 
achievements in order that we may maintain our top ranking and 
remain number one, together!
<P>
	In another speech, mention was also made of duplication. You 
know as well as I do, Mr. Speaker, and I believe my colleagues 
know it too, that duplication exists everywhere, be it at the 
provincial, municipal or federal level. Regardless of the level of 
government, members have a responsibility to endeavour to 
eliminate costly duplication. This is a positive, much 
appreciated way to cut government spending. Of course, the 
discussion focused primarily on duplication between the 
provinces and the federal government. No admission was made 
of duplication at the provincial government level. No admission 
was made of duplication at the municipal government level 
either.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	My friends from the Bloc admitted that duplication existed, 
but were not prepared to say how it should be eliminated.
<P>
	However, they do propose one solution to the problem, and 
that is to break the country apart. They claim that this would 
spell the end of duplication. Let me assure you that this would 
not be the case. In my opinion, this solution is rather hard to 
defend, Moreover, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the 
Bloc to defend it as well. As I see it, we are gradually 
eliminating instances of duplication. We are making progress 
and my colleagues are aware of this fact.
<P>
	My colleagues in the Bloc also talked about a centralizing 
government and they know-they are well informed, but I feel 
that some members sometimes choose what they 
prefer-Canada is the least centralized country in the world. 
Yes, in the world.
<P>
	They know that. They do not like to hear that; they are starting 
to blush a little. But who knows, one fine day they may rise in 
the House and say: ``Yes, you are quite right, but we wanted to 
say that because we believed that it would advance our cause''.
<P>
	I think that people are starting to understand that some things 
are exaggerated and people do not like exaggerations. Listen, we 
should bring together all kinds of reforms going on in Canada 
now; because we live in the best country in the world, we ask you 
to help us find creative solutions.
<P>
	Yes, there is duplication. We are negotiating to remove 
duplication and we are refining the machinery of government. 
Listen, if we centralize too much, I think that we are ready to 
look honestly, openly and co-operatively at how we could make 
the machinery of government more flexible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would feel that I had not done my duty if I did not address a 
few comments about some of the statements made by the 
Reform Party. Reform Party members feel that this particular 
omnibus bill is une aberration de quelque sorte. They are open to 
the observation and accusation I made that if they were so 
concerned about this particular bill why did they not take it one 
piece at a time and tell us precisely what they would have done 
to change it? They did not do that. No, of course not. Why? 
Perhaps there were some politics being played. I guess politics 
are played in this House on occasion, even I play on occasion.
<P>
	Anyway, I was rather surprised that the Reform Party would 
do something like that, condemn this omnibus bill and not bring 
forward certain specific recommendations to every single part 
of the bill. Perhaps that is still coming. Perhaps, perhaps, 
perhaps. Who knows? I hope so because if not it would be a 
flagrant contradiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4562"> 4562 </A></B>
<P>
	As I indicated, a lot of things have been said about 
unemployment insurance par mes amis du Bloc. Of course 
Canadians will realize if they believe that these cuts have been 
undertaken, these changes are really rather severe. If the Reform 
Party had undertaken these cuts they would have been draconian 
and dramatic and they would have hurt a whole lot more. We 
have heard all kinds of comments as to what they would like to 
do and it is not a gradual cut; it is an amputation.
<P>
	I have addressed most of the concerns my colleagues have 
raised both from l'opposition officielle, le bloc Quebecois, 
including the other opposition party, the Reform Party.
<P>
	As I indicated today there are a number of flagrant 
contradictions. Politics are being played and I think they rather 
enjoy it. They are becoming rather good at it. I must commend 
them. Most of them are quite good at it, but at the same time they 
are not fooling too many Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians are listening and they are asking if the solutions 
were as simple as the Reform Party proposes, why were they not 
resolved a long time ago? Of course they condemn the solution 
of the Bloc. All of the ills of the world will be corrected 
supposedly by the separation of Quebec from Canada. Nobody 
believes that, not even my friends from the Bloc believe that.
<P>
	Today, if my colleagues from the opposition parties will do it, 
in view of the United Nations report which shows us as the best 
country in the world, I hope we will start working together not 
only to maintain that position but to improve it in the spirit of 
co-operative federalism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
opportunity to break new ground today and I hope the 
parliamentary secretary will be listening carefully.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I will start by saying that I am in agreement with the 
government on this portion of Bill C-17. I will be speaking to 
the portion on unemployment insurance. When I hear that 
Reformers are always negative and do not have any constructive 
alternatives, I particularly would like to explain why I am in 
agreement with the government on this issue.
<P>
	We are talking about unemployment insurance program 
reform. I agree that unemployment insurance does need reform, 
in fact it needs more reform than is proposed. Of course the 
government is going through a social program review which will 
allow that to take place.
<P>
	I referred to the red book on this particular issue and looked 
for what I could expect from the Liberal government during the 
election campaign. What I understood from the red book was 
that the Liberals would work with the provinces to redesign 
social assistance programs, so sorely tested in recent years, to 
help people on social assistance who are able to work to move 
from dependence to full participation in the economic and social 
life of the country.
<P>
	During the election campaign I had a fairly specific proposal 
to place on the table for the unemployment insurance program 
review which reads: ``The Reform Party supports the return of 
unemployment insurance to its original function; that is, an 
employer-employee funded and administered program to 
provide temporary income in the event of unexpected job loss''. 
It was a fairly specific proposal. It is fairly obvious that is more 
specific than the proposal I had from my opponent on the other 
side.
<P>
	Frankly I was hammered on this and other social program 
issues during the election campaign. I was hammered as being 
uncaring, as being a person who was involved in slash and burn 
cutting with no compassion. I must admit those allegations hurt 
me a little because I entered the national arena of politics for 
compassionate reasons.
<P>
	In my line of work I felt government mismanagement had a 
specific and significant impact on my life and my work and the 
life and work of those whom I had treated. I came here for 
compassionate reasons. I strongly believe that if our social 
programs are continually eroded by fiscal mismanagement that 
we will not have social programs and compassion will be very 
weak.
<P>
	Last week I had an opportunity to talk with a number of grade 
12 students in my constituency. Reformers have decided that to 
represent our constituents better we are divvying up our time 
and one week when the House is sitting we are actually in our 
constituencies. I took that week to talk to my grade 12 students.
<P>
	I had a number of messages to give them. The one specific 
message I had to give was that our government and our country 
is in debt and in serious trouble. I went through the figures: that 
we are overspending $110 million a day; that we are half a 
trillion dollars in debt; that over 30 cents of every $1 is spent 
today on interest; and that every social program is in jeopardy, 
including their educational needs and wishes.
<P>
	The figures were not particularly meaningful to those grade 
12 students. I rethought my proposals as I spoke to them and 
tried to put them into a frame of reference they could better 
understand. The one thing which seemed to strike home was 
when I said that every single one of them who sat in front of me 
owed the federal government a brand new pickup truck.
<P>
	I was specific when I said: ``Each one of you owes the federal 
government a pickup truck. It is a two-wheel drive pickup truck, 
not an extended cab. It does not have electric windows, no 
options whatsoever. It has an am-fm radio. It does not have any 
trick wheel covers on it. It does not have radial tires. It is a basic, 
brand new pickup truck. That is what each one of you owes the 
government''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4563"> 4563 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	Then I asked: ``If everything comes about that the government 
today is proposing during its mandate, where will you be at the 
end of that mandate at the next election?''. Each one of them and 
every single Canadian will then owe to the federal government a 
pickup truck with an extended cab, alloy wheels and radial tires. 
This truck will now have an am-fm radio with a CD player and 
electric windows. It is still a two-wheel drive pick-up, not yet a 
four-wheel drive.
<P>
	These youths asked me: ``What are you saying to us? How 
long can this go on?''. It cannot go on forever. It was like saying 
to them: ``Suppose you pump gas at a gas station and make $100 
a week but every week you spend $115. How long could you go 
on?''. Obviously, it cannot go on forever.
<P>
	The message I took to those grade 12 students is that my 
generation and we in this House are mortgaging their future. The 
grade 12 students in Macleod asked me to bring their message 
back to the House of Commons: Stop mortgaging the futures of 
the youths of Canada.
<P>
	I went through the Bill C-17 proposals. I went to the 
summaries of the proposals suggested by the minister. It is 
always interesting to read the summaries.
<P>
	On unemployment insurance the summary on page 5 of the 
minister's document indicates: ``Changes will require claimants 
to work for longer periods in order to be eligible for the same 
number of weeks of benefits. For example, a claimant with 36 
weeks of work and living in an area of 12 to 13 per cent 
unemployment is entitled to 50 weeks of benefits under the 
present schedule. In order to have the same entitlement under 
the proposed schedule the same individual will have to work for 
52 weeks''. That is 36 weeks has changed to to 52.
<P>
	The summary on page 13: ``The proposed changes to UI will 
improve the linkage between work and benefits while enhancing 
adequacy and fairness in the provision of income support. The 
changes will contribute significantly to job creation by 
providing premium relief beginning on January 1, 1995''. It is 
interesting and every Canadian should pay attention to this: 
There is a linkage between providing premium relief and job 
creation. In this document the Liberal government is saying 
something I say very strongly.
<P>
	I had a personal intervention in my constituency office earlier 
this spring. A seasonal worker came to see me griping about the 
unemployment insurance changes being proposed by my 
colleagues. He was griping because he had been on 
unemployment insurance and would have to work longer to get 
the same amount of benefits. It was a criticism of the whole 
process.
<P>
	He asked me what I thought as a Reformer about the Liberal 
unemployment insurance changes. I asked him what he would 
think if I told him I did not think a seasonal worker would soon 
have unemployment insurance benefits if we continued going 
the way we were.
<P>
	I told him: ``You have told me your story about how you 
worked very hard as a seasonal worker. You spent your summer 
on a road paving crew last year. You worked overtime and made 
$45,000 during the good time of the year. Then you went on 
unemployment insurance. You told me you went on 
unemployment insurance by choice''.
<P>
	He had told me he did not really have to be on unemployment 
insurance; he could easily have obtained a job with a transport 
company. He had a class 1 licence and the company was dying 
for him to come and work. However for the convenience of his 
family which I can understand, he chose to stay home during the 
winter to be closer to his wife. Therefore he would not be driving 
some place far away in the U.S.
<P>
	He chose to do that because unemployment insurance was 
there for him as an individual who had made a significant 
amount of money during another portion the year. The principle 
of his being able to choose that over working when a job was 
available to him is something we must address or we will not 
have unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I support the direction of this portion of Bill C-17 and I say 
that with no rancour whatsoever. As it is one of my committee 
responsibilities, I will push toward a significant change in the 
principle of unemployment insurance so that it becomes what it 
originally was.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I will end today with the message that came from my grade 12 
students in Macleod, that the Government of Canada stop 
mortgaging the future of our youth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the 
second opportunity I have to participate in this debate on the 
Budget Implementation Act, 1994. On April 14, I said no to 
undue delays in reducing unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	I also questioned statements by the Minister of Finance about 
potential savings to businesses, savings that could be reinvested 
to hire workers.
<P>
	It is in that context that I will address today clause 26 of the 
bill.
<P>
	The philosophy behind clause 26 of Bill C-17 is simple. It 
rests on the principle that, assuming the Minister of Finance's 
forecasts are realistic, the businesses would actually reinvest in 
job creation the amounts they have saved as a result of premium 
reductions. There you go, jobs are automatically created!
<P>
	If this scenario is likely, and that is what we are given to 
understand, then the next logical step is to ask ourselves why the 
same government that has come up with this scenario almost 
simultaneously increased contributions to the plan. On the one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4564"> 4564 </A></B>
<P>
hand, it tells us that premium reductions will undoubtedly result 
in job creation and, on the other, it increases contributions. The 
logic behind this line of action eludes us.
<P>
	This government expects 40,000 news jobs will be created as 
a result of its new policy concerning UI premiums. Let us take a 
closer look, if you will.
<P>
	Based on the government's own calculations, 9,000 jobs were 
lost as a direct result of the UI premium rate increase that came 
into effect on January 1.
<P>
	In the context of the present scenario, rolling back the UI 
premium rates starting January 1, 1995, would prevent the loss 
of another 31,000 jobs slated to disappear like those that were 
lost last January. If you add these 9,000 jobs to those that will be 
lost come January 1, 1995, the grand total is indeed 40,000. And 
that is what they call a ``40,000 job job-creation program''. In 
terms of creativity, we have seen better, but not in terms of 
demagogy.
<P>
	The main question that comes to mind of course is: Why not 
have acted earlier? Or to put it another way: Why did the 
government, knowing that a premium increase would inevitably 
eliminate jobs, go ahead with this increase?
<P>
	We do not understand and we are convinced that many 
Quebecers and Canadians are asking the same questions we are.
<P>
	Will the 9,000 people who lost their jobs last January because 
of the premium hike be impressed by the glorified job creation 
program announcements? Of course not! How will the 
government explain its inaction to these workers? How will it 
explain that the jobs they lost will be re-created a year later? 
How will it explain to these people that it preferred to wait for 
one year before taking action, when the enormous personal 
sacrifices made by those who lost their jobs were totally 
unnecessary and unjustified? Will it blame these injustices on 
the Official Opposition, the source of all evils? Maybe. We have 
seen such demagogy before in this chamber.
<P>
	The Official Opposition has vigorously denounced the 
February 22 budget since it was tabled in this House. We 
denounced the inequity of the lower benefits and the longer 
qualifying periods for the unemployed. We denounced the 
budget's inequity to some regions, especially Quebec and the 
Maritime provinces. We denounced the odious impact on 
women of budget measures that control their private lives. We 
denounced the disincentive and despair that these measures will 
create for young unemployed people at the beginning of their 
working lives.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The Official Opposition denounced the lack of vision of this 
so-called ``new'' government. We have noticed and deplored 
the lack of real job creation policies and we will continue to do 
so, Mr. Speaker, until the government stops oppressing the poor 
and protecting the rich. We will continue to press for the 
creation of real jobs, new jobs, even if we are blamed for all the 
problems in the world.
<P>
	I am speaking today in favour of the proposal to amend clause 
26 of Bill C-17 put forward by my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. The proposed amendment is a 
very concrete solution aimed at eliminating one of the irritants 
created by the February 22 budget. This proposal is also 
designed to facilitate, albeit in a very minor way, job creation. 
The Official Opposition is thus trying to repair the damage done 
by the government.
<P>
	We must support a motion such as the one we are proposing 
today to ensure that jobs are created as soon as possible. To do 
so, we must reduce premiums as early as June 1, 1994 while 
waiting for concrete, real job-creation policies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
discussing the issue as such and the amendments tabled by some 
members, I want to reply to the comments made earlier by the 
hon. member for St. Boniface. The hon. member criticized the 
Bloc Quebecois on a number of issues and, on several occasions, 
he made comments which were quite inaccurate. I want to state 
the facts and also look at the real intentions of the government, 
in the light of the member's remarks.
<P>
	He said that the Bloc is inconsistent since it is asking the 
government to cut spending, while opposing the fact that the UI 
budget will be reduced by several billion over the next few 
years. Yet, there is no contradiction there. It is possible to cut 
expenditures, but the government must certainly not start with 
cuts which will adversely affect the unemployed. The hon. 
member is telling us that, as regards spending reduction, the 
only significant measure in the budget, of which this bill is the 
result, is major cuts to the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the opposition lacked vision, 
adding that the problem was not new. He must know what he is 
talking about since he sat on this side of the House for a quite a 
while. I remember that at the time he and several of his 
colleagues, including the current Deputy Prime Minister, used 
to vigorously denounce the UI reforms of the Conservatives. It 
is rather amusing to read the speeches made then by those 
people. They were talking about inhuman measures and other 
similar things.
<P>
	Yet, only four months after they took office, and after 
claiming in many cases that it was impossible to implement 
quick reforms because these things require in-depth reviews 
and a long term approach through  committees which have to 
work for a year or two before changes can be made, the 
government was more than ready in the case of the UI program. 
And this only 18 months after the Liberals vehemently opposed 
the idea of targeting UI to fight the deficit at the expense of the 
unem-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4565"> 4565 </A></B>
<P>
ployed. Yet, four months after they came to office, the Liberals 
launched an all-out attack on the jobless.
<P>
	This is where they will go and get a good chunk of the money 
they need to reduce the deficit in a very small way, as they said 
in the last budget.
<P>
	The hon. member then went on to say that we live in the best 
country in the world and that our quality of life is second to 
none. He referred to a UN study, to the umpteenth version of a 
study that is published every year and whose findings were 
released during the weekend. According to the study, Canada 
ranked first for the second time in three years, and he was very 
proud of all that. Of course, he forgot to mention that the study 
does not consider debt levels in its ranking.
<P>
	However, the report did say there was some concern about the 
future, because considering the debt, many programs may not be 
possible to maintain, at least not as they are now. There are a 
number of criteria in this study which are debatable, including 
the number of tv sets per household, and so forth. This is quality 
of life evaluated in North American terms. It is no coincidence 
that a country like Canada comes out well in this study. Criteria 
and values are ours, and they form the basis for the judgment 
made by the study.
<P>
	If the debt were included as a criterion, I think there would be 
a little less enthusiasm, and I think the hon. member would be 
the first person to acknowledge this. Fine, we can say our quality 
of life is very good, but if next month I were to use up all my 
credit, my credit cards and my bank loans, of course I would 
have an excellent quality of life during that month. But I could 
hardly say the same for the months after that. I might have a few 
problems then, although for a while I would have a very good 
quality of life. Well, it would be a quality of life on credit.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	He also referred to Canada as the most decentralized country 
in the world. I must admit I found it hard to keep a straight face. 
The hon. member must know a couple of countries. In any case, I 
will mention two he should look at a little more closely.
<P>
	Certainly Belgium, where the federal level is responsible only 
for foreign affairs, international trade and currency. And even in 
the case of foreign affairs, two of the three levels have certain 
powers. I wonder how he drew the conclusion that he did. I 
suggest he take a course in international politics and take a close 
look at the Belgian model.
<P>
	He could also look at Switzerland to see how the system in 
that country works. He would realize that they are somewhat 
more decentralized than we are here.
<P>
	He also talked a long time about the duplication that exists 
between Quebec and Ottawa. As a member I get terribly 
frustrated when someone comes to my office and wants to apply 
for a training program, and they tell him he is not eligible 
because he is not on unemployment insurance. The program is 
open only to unemployment insurance recipients. If he is on 
welfare, he has to apply for a different program, because he is 
not eligible for this one. And then these people say: ``But how 
come we have these criteria, because after all it is public money, 
and we want the training''. And again they are told this program 
is not for them and that they have to go to the other level of 
government, which is responsible in their case.
<P>
	What we have here is a lack of vision and a lack of 
consistency. The hon. member for St. Boniface knows this. And 
what have they done about it since they came to power? Nothing. 
It is easy to see. He says that we made ``no concrete 
suggestion''. We have been telling him for a long time that there 
were concrete measures to be taken in the area of manpower 
training. It is a very concrete suggestion and I am convinced that 
he sees people like that every day or so in his office. I know I do.
<P>
	Let us talk about what is being proposed now. They are 
attacking the present unemployment system in many ways. They 
are changing the number of weeks, the benefit rate and the rules 
of eligibility. Since they cannot control unemployment itself, 
they will at least control the number of unemployed people and 
the way they will receive benefits. They are attacking the 
unemployed themselves. That is where they put the focus in 
order to solve the problem, despite the way they talked about 
employment all through the campaign. They say: ``We will 
decrease unemployment expenditures'' but they will not do so 
by creating jobs; instead, they will modify the plan and make it 
more stringent by increasing the number of weeks required and 
decreasing the importance of criteria such as regional 
unemployment, by increasing the number of weeks of insurable 
employment from 10 to 12 and decreasing the rate of benefits 
from 57 per cent to 55 per cent. For some the rate will increase to 
60 per cent, but for most it will go from 57 to 55 per cent. They 
talk very little about that.
<P>
	Who will be affected most by such a reform in the area of 
eligibility, expenditures, etc.? We can say that the Atlantic 
provinces and Quebec will be hard hit. We heard figures like 630 
million dollars in the Atlantic region, 735 million in Quebec, 
560 million in Ontario and 430 million in the west. You know the 
Maritimes will be the hardest hit.
<P>
	Following the comments of my colleague for 
Saint-Hyacinthe, the subcommittee on finance worked very 
hard and saw to it that witnesses were heard. It was disrespectful 
toward several of the groups that came to express their views 
and their fears, particularly about the UI reform aspect of Bill 
C-17. This was the case for the Acadian community, whose 
presentation was cut short  and whose members were thrown 
out. It did not even take the time to listen to them. For a 
government which stressed the importance of dignity and 
openness, it showed blatant disrespect. Showing dignity is also 
listening to people and letting them speak even if their visions or 
views are different from our own. The committee did not even 
bother to do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4566"> 4566 </A></B>
<P>
that. This is quite astonishing, considering that that group had 
for the most part supported the elected party.
<P>
	In the few minutes I have left, I would like to ponder what will 
happen now in view of these facts. What will happen if the 
system is made stricter, or the entitlement period shorter? What 
if beneficiaries still do not have a job at the end of their 
entitlement period, since nothing would lead us to believe that 
they will easily find one. They will simply have to become 
welfare recipients.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Then, which level of government will take them over? The 
provincial level. Another level of government will pay the bill. 
They are not in our records any more and they do not produce 
any red ink here. They are now in the records of the provinces 
which may end up with a tab of $100 million.
<P>
	Researchers from the Université du Québec à Montréal, 
economist Pierre Fortin and his group, have estimated at almost 
$600 million the liability thus transferred to the provinces. 
Therefore, we are passing the buck and telling the provinces: 
``Make the choices that we refuse to make'', notwithstanding the 
fact that their budgets are much smaller.
<P>
	Here we have a budget of $160 billion, when in Quebec it is 
less than $50 billion, that is less than a third. We are telling 
them: ``You have more imagination, do the cuts we refuse to 
make''. This is a terrible thing to do. Who are the losers in all 
that? They are the individuals under attack and given little hope. 
They are the consumers who just lost their jobs, that are often in 
very difficult economic situations, and to whom we say that they 
cost us too much and that they are responsible for the deficit. We 
find that unacceptable.
<P>
	This is why several of my colleagues have proposed 
interesting amendments aimed at preserving an efficient enough 
system, given that we are presently studying an in-depth reform 
of social programs. I believe that what we have in front of us is a 
major piece of legislation, and I call on my colleagues to support 
the proposed amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 25 
last, the Canadian people elected a new government. In Quebec, 
we were in the advantageous position of having the choice 
between three political parties. Quebecers chose to send Bloc 
Quebecois members to Ottawa. On October 25 last, the 
objective, the campaign slogan of the Liberal government was 
hope. All over Quebec, we heard ``Votez libéral pour l'espoir''. 
Whenever I heard that slogan I thought that it  did not make 
much sense, especially knowing the government's background.
<P>
	The Liberal government is to be blamed for most of the 
Canadian deficit. All the Conservatives did afterwards was to 
increase it. The Conservative government, which was in power 
in the 1980s and early 1990s, increasingly curtailed citizens' 
rights and now with Bill C-17, this government of ours is going 
even further.
<P>
	Since his election as leader of his party and the last campaign, 
the Prime Minister is forever talking about bread and butter. We 
now know that those are mere words. What the Prime Minister 
and his cabinet are doing by amending the Unemployment 
Insurance Act, is to take away a little bit more bread and butter 
from the poorest members of our society. I rise today to 
denounce the irresponsible attitude of a government which is 
supposed to help economic recovery. A government which is 
supposed to make Canadians and Quebecers feel better. But 
what it is doing instead is taking a little bit more from 
everybody.
<P>
	The Liberals are hitting the poorest members of our society, 
those who are the most in need. Losing your job is very sad. Mr. 
Speaker, you and I are in an advantageous situation. We are 
elected to serve for a certain period of time during which we do 
not need to look for a job. You know as well as I do that losing 
one's job is perhaps one of the saddest thing with which a person 
must contend.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	All our government is doing is merely lowering the benefit 
rate. People who once were entitled to 57 per cent of their salary 
will now only be able to collect up to 55 per cent. Minor 
adjustments have been made, but if we look at the figures, we 
quickly see that two thirds of recipients will receive fewer 
benefits than before. This is unacceptable. When a government 
is given a mandate to govern, it must begin by focusing on the 
least fortunate members of our society. That is not what this 
government is currently doing. It is trying to reduce its deficit at 
the expense of the most disadvantaged and that is unacceptable.
<P>
	The Liberals have always adopted the liberal attitude whereby 
the sky is the limit. Today, there no longer appears to be any 
limit at all, and as a result, the least fortunate are becoming 
increasingly dependant. What is this government doing? It is 
lowering UI benefits and, as of result of its actions, provinces 
will have to pick up a bigger share of the tab for social 
assistance. Once again, this government is offloading its deficit 
onto the provinces. This is unacceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4567"> 4567 </A></B>
<P>
	As representatives of the people, we have a role to play. We 
must ensure that all Canadian citizens are treated equally. 
Parliament must also strive to narrow the inequity gap between 
the classes. With Bill C-17, the Liberal government is making 
the gap between rich and poor grow wider and wider. We, in the 
Bloc Quebecois, cannot accept that. We were elected, Mr. 
Speaker, you, I and all the hon. members, to protect the interests 
of the people and, in this case, it would be in the interest of the 
people to at least maintain UI benefits at the 57 per cent level. 
This rate cannot be reduced.
<P>
	The Canadian government seems to be strongly influenced by 
the United States, where the rate is approximately 50 per cent. 
But we have always had a slightly higher rate in Canada and 
Quebec. This government did praise the merits of 
unemployment insurance. The benefit rate has always been 
slightly higher in Canada and Quebec and I think it cannot go 
any lower. Let us not loose sight of those of our constituents who 
are poor. We have in our ridings less fortunate people who do not 
have enough to get by. The government has the duty-and the 
duty of Parliament is to support a government that does so-to 
do its job and be actively involved in creating employment. But 
it is not the case here. This government talks about doing many 
things. It plans to do this, that and the other, but actually does 
very little. This government has accomplished very little.
<P>
	As you know, the rate of unemployment in Quebec is about 13 
per cent. In Canada, it is around 11 per cent. Some 450,000 
Quebecers are presently unemployed, not to mention those who 
lost their jobs but gave up looking for a new one because there 
are none available. It is well know that the fishing, forest, tourist 
and construction industries are seriously affected by the 
measures contained in Bill C-17. Workers will be required to 
work 12 weeks to qualify for unemployment insurance. There is 
a danger that these people will not be able to meet the 12-week 
requirement and will be forced to request social assistance.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	It is humiliating for someone who wants to work to be on 
welfare. To wrap up, I think that the unemployment insurance 
reform reflects the contempt of the Liberals for the unemployed.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development admits to 
pursuing the following objective: to force recipients to work 
longer in order to qualify for the same number of weeks of 
benefits.
<P>
	The unemployed in Quebec and Canada did not choose to be 
out of work and I think the government must do the best it can to 
help them out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for giving me the opportunity to speak to Bill C-17 and 
especially to the UI provisions on which my party has put 
forward a few amendments that are, I think, in the interest of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I do not want to repeat the arguments made since this debate 
started but I would still like to express my opinion on the use of 
public funds to create jobs. Of course, whenever we talk about 
unemployment, we also talk about job creation.
<P>
	Every member of this House can now find out in his or her 
riding the true extent of the infrastructure program announced 
by this government, which will turn into a disaster in coming 
days when municipalities will have to present their ratepayers 
with borrowing by-laws in order to have access to the 
infrastructure program. Let us look at what is now happening in 
our ridings. Many of these projects will not be accepted because 
municipalities are already deeply in debt.
<P>
	We said at the time that it was another way for the Liberal 
government to offload money it does not have onto provincial, 
then municipal governments. In recent weeks, I also analyzed 
what was being said and mostly listened to groups of young 
people between 18 and 30 years of age that I would divide into 
three categories: those who have jobs, young poorly-paid 
workers without contracts but who still manage to get by on their 
salaries for one, two or three years.
<P>
	These workers still manage to get by. However, when their 
contracts expire, they will fall into another category, that of 
workers whose status is precarious and that is where it starts.
<P>
	That is where it starts and when unemployment insurance 
comes into play. For workers whose status is insecure, there are 
only projects, jobs created under DEP or the Challenge program 
or something like that, which under this bill would give these 
workers lower benefits, because the rate is lower, after they had 
accumulated a certain number of weeks of unemployment 
insurance credits.
<P>
	If you are lucky in that game and are back on UI, perhaps you 
will be lucky again and find another project, but there will be no 
third project. At that point, the insecure worker falls into the 
unemployed category and that is my main point.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	We have nothing to offer our jobless young people who are 18 
to 30 years old; we are losing that whole generation because we 
have nothing for them. We are taking away their dignity and 
forcing them for a few hundred dollars a month to take 
compulsory courses in school again, which will be no use in the 
end, since the training they will be given does not prepare them 
for the jobs now vacant.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4568"> 4568 </A></B>
<P>
	You can be sure that young people in that situation-because I 
know, I worked with them for over thirty years-develop a 
certain fatalistic attitude which often makes them drink more 
alcohol and also take more drugs; not having anything to do, 
they find something to occupy their time.
<P>
	The suicide rate is very high. Not a day goes by that we do not 
see lack of work as the main cause of suicide among young 
people aged 18 to 30. Of course they cannot afford to borrow, but 
sometimes they have to and the interest rates they pay are 
abnormally high. So they are caught in a trap from which they 
will have difficulty escaping.
<P>
	We devalue them. These people are socially devalued. We are 
creating instability for a whole generation. If they are lucky, 
they move in coop or low-cost housing units which, when not 
supervised or when provincial governments make budget cuts, 
often look like poverty ghettos. This is where our 18 to 30-year- 
olds live.
<P>
	They also share dwellings, which is not a healthy solution. If 
they are lucky and do not belong to a single parent family, they 
will go back to their parents' home, which is often the only 
solution for many of them. This what you are creating by not 
being able to come up with projects which will put people to 
work and give them back their dignity. The stress and anxiety 
related to the fear of not being able to find a job is very real for 
these young people.
<P>
	I also want to discuss the third amendment proposed by my 
colleague regarding the approval of the House of Commons 
given by resolution of that House, instead of the approval of the 
Governor in Council. The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to pilot 
projects. This is important and I think it gives satisfaction to the 
hon. member for St. Boniface. Again, we are not opposed to 
pilot projects. In fact, we supported the one related to Operation 
Dignity II.
<P>
	We cannot oppose, and that is showing a constructive 
approach, the implementation of new ideas. However, we want 
the ministers, even though they are subjected to ministerial 
accountability, to allow this House to review, examine, evaluate 
and monitor each pilot project, since Parliament is the centre of 
democracy and since elected representatives are accountable.
<P>
	They must ensure government transparency, so that they are 
not stuck with a fait accompli, as in the case of Pearson Airport 
and all the dealings that went on with lobbyists. Once a debate 
has taken place on a pilot project, the ministers are in a position 
to evaluate the pros and cons. This enables them, and us as well, 
to make better decisions. Then, the same information can be 
transmitted to every Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	It is in this spirit that I will support the three proposed 
amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
pleasure to enter into this debate on Bill C-17, the budget 
implementation act.
<P>
	I was very pleased to attend all of the hearings with regard to 
this bill at the committee stage. At that stage there were some 
interesting presentations from those who wanted greater 
benefits in terms of the unemployment insurance portion of the 
act which in this omnibus presentation before us and those who 
wanted to have the legislation concerning unemployment 
insurance more on an insurance basis so that the books would be 
more balanced and there would be less government intervention.
<P>
	I would like talk about what I heard at those hearings. I want 
to make sure that those ideas are presented in this assembly.
<P>
	The Reform Party, as my colleague mentioned earlier, is in 
support of the section concerning the unemployment insurance 
changes. We support it for two basic reasons. First, we believe 
there is a reduction in cost to business. Business across this 
nation at the present time is under stress. We believe that the 
reduction of cost can enhance employment opportunity for 
many people in the working world.
<P>
	Second, we believe that this amendment brings us closer to 
the insurance principle whereby payments by the employer and 
the employee will be equal to benefits that are derived 
therefrom.
<P>
	One suggestion made by a number of the groups is that we 
should have more input by the employer and the employees with 
regard to unemployment insurance. At the present time there is a 
feeling that government has too much say as to how the program 
is run. It was suggested that we should change the legislation 
even more extensively than the legislation before us now to a 
point where the government is one step removed.
<P>
	I asked in that debate what would be the role of government. 
The suggestion was that the role of government would be a sort 
of funding agency that could play a part when there were surges. 
In other words, if there was a surplus of funds in the 
unemployment insurance fund, they could be the retainer of 
those funds but when there is a demand on funds the government 
would have this revolving fund available so that funds could be 
put into unemployment insurance and there would be moneys 
available at times of need.
<P>
	That is a principle that we should consider here. I think it 
would put the unemployment insurance fund on a basis whereby 
it stands on its own merits and on its own financial support 
system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4569"> 4569 </A></B>
<P>
	We had some concerns regarding this Bill C-17 relative to the 
section on unemployment insurance. First, there was the 
question as to whether it should be a change in legislation just to 
reduce the deficit. As reformers we certainly support any kind of 
measures that go to reducing the deficit. If that were its only 
purpose we would feel that supporting this amendment would 
not be the right thing to do.
<P>
	The second item that raised some concern with us was with 
regard to the item which we call the two tier system whereby 
there is the possibility of a means test for certain persons who 
qualify for unemployment insurance. I would think in principle 
it is not right that we have a two tier system. When a person pays 
into an insurance program, whether that person is single, 
married or whatever the status may be, that person should 
qualify for a certain level of benefits. To enter this other 
dimension into the system and at that time raise the question as 
to a person's other means I think is wrong. I certainly would not 
be in support of that area in this piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The third area that concerns us is the fact that this legislation 
was brought in with the budget. It was implemented with the 
budget. Following that the government announced a very 
comprehensive review of social programs. In a sense 
unemployment insurance is an integral part. To approve 
legislation in this assembly separate from this comprehensive 
review I do not think is right. It certainly raises a concern with us 
on this side of the House.
<P>
	Fourth is with regard to the pilot projects. As a reform party 
we are not against any kind of pilot projects where we can 
experiment, look at efficiency or bring about avenues by which 
we can better allocate and expend public funds. However, the 
questions that are unanswered are the ones we are concerned 
about. What really qualifies as a pilot project? Who will be 
involved in these pilot projects? Will they be persons who are 
really skilled and have expertise in the area? Are we looking at 
some type of pilot projects that will satisfy some political 
friends? I hope not.
<P>
	The other question is what is it that we are really trying to 
discover? What do we want to achieve through the pilot 
projects? Is it another means by which we are evading the real 
question before us? That question is certainly dealing with the 
unemployed of this country. Are we trying to do things just to 
pacify the general public by putting in place a pilot project 
which in a sense is a delay tactic that is often used by 
government in trying to avoid the main question that is before 
us?
<P>
	To resolve and deal with these problems, certainly the one 
about unemployment insurance, we have to deal with the 
primary question. The primary question as we all know is what 
do we do about government spending? What actions must we 
take to encourage growth in the economy? The primary question 
is what actions must be  taken. We feel and have said very 
clearly in this House that one thing that must be clear to the 
public and the investment community in Canada is that the 
government does have a deficit reduction program.
<P>
	The presentation of the budget, this budget implementation 
act and other actions of the government to this time do not 
indicate to the investment community, the business community 
or the private individual community that the government has 
come to grips with its spending. When we do and confidence is 
in this nation and the economy grows then jobs will be available 
and the concerns we have heard with regard to unemployment 
insurance will certainly not be there. They will be set as a side 
agenda very low on the priority not only of this House but of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I feel the solution lies in that area. However, in terms of the 
unemployment insurance program we must remember that 
program is not a welfare program. It is not a program by which 
people can live for months and months on unemployment 
insurance. It is a program that provides interim assistance 
between one job and the next job opportunity.
<P>
	As I listen to the Bloc Quebecois make its presentation in this 
assembly I become concerned when it says benefits must be 
extended extensively. What I hear in its message is that it wants 
the benefits to be just about welfare benefits, not benefits on an 
interim or temporary basis for those who are between jobs. If we 
move to a point at which it becomes a program of longer term 
financial security then we have moved away from the insurance 
principle about which I spoke in the early part of my remarks 
and that would be wrong.

	<B>Mr. Dingwall (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that the

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the House knows, this is very 
important legislation although it may appear to be housekeeping 
to some. I would like to rise today to speak on this legislation 
and to urge for its speedy approval.
<P>
	This is not a bill to command great attention in the public 
arena. Rather it represents some of the work-a-day measures 
addressing tax fairness and good international and trade 
relations that are a vital part of our endeavours on behalf of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill S-2 is to implement reciprocal trade 
treaties between our nation and Hungary, Nigeria, Argentina and 
Zimbabwe, treaties that will eliminate double taxation on 
income tax. As well, the bill implements the protocol to revise 
the current tax convention between Canada and the Kingdom of 
the Netherlands.
<P>
	A tax treaty between countries is an important tool to provide 
the benefit of certainty and stability regarding tax regimes, 
benefits that concretely promote and facilitate international 
trade and investment. Another benefit of such tax treaties is that 
they also reduce annoyance in the operation of the national tax 
systems involved in several ways.
<P>
	First, they eliminate the necessity of paying tax on business 
profits in the source country if there is no permanent 
establishment in that country. As well, they provide a 
mechanism to settle problems encountered by taxpayers.
<P>
	More important, tax treaties eliminate or alleviate double 
taxation in the instances where international transactions are 
involved and may give rise to the same income being taxable in 
the hands of the same person by more than one nation.
<P>
	I should remind the House that the treaties enacted by this bill 
are the latest within a longstanding process. The major reform of 
Canada's income tax legislation in 1971 required Canada to 
expand its network of double taxation conventions or tax 
treaties with other countries. Since that time, negotiations for 
the conclusion of new treaties or the revision of existing ones 
have been entered into with almost 75 countries.
<P>
	In this bill, the four tax conventions under review follow the 
general pattern of the conventions previously approved by 
Parliament. The number of Canadian tax treaties in force is 
presently 52.
<P>
	For the record, let me remind hon. members of the main 
elements of the new treaties covered by the bill. These treaties 
provide generally that dividends may be taxed in the source 
country at a maximum rate of 15 per cent. However in the case of 
intercompany dividends, the  rate is often reduced if the 
company receiving the dividends holds a certain equity interest 
in the company paying the dividends. Such a reduced rate has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4571"> 4571 </A></B>
<P>
been set at 10 per cent for the countries covered here, except for 
Nigeria where it will be 12.5 per cent.
<P>
	Regarding interest paid by a resident of one country to that of 
another country, the rates set out in this bill are 10 per cent in the 
case of Hungary, 12.5 per cent for Argentina and Nigeria and 15 
per cent in the case of Zimbabwe. There are however some 
exceptions.
<P>
	Interest paid on a bond or a similar obligation of the national 
government, a political subdivision or a local authority will be 
exempt from tax in the country in which it arises. Also, these 
treaties, except that with Zimbabwe, contain a certain provision 
that will allow interest paid on loans or credits extended, 
guaranteed or insured by certain state entities, in Canada for 
example, the Export Development Corporation, to be taxable 
only in the country where the recipient of the interest payment 
resides.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	These treaties also address the taxation of royalty payments. 
They provide for a general rate of source taxation of 10 per cent 
in the case of Hungary and Zimbabwe, 12.5 per cent in the case 
of Nigeria and from 3 per cent to 15 per cent in the case of 
Argentina, depending on the nature of the royalty. Copyright 
royalties are exempt under the treaty with Hungary.
<P>
	A number of other matters are dealt with in these tax treaties. 
First, the treaty provisions dealing with capital gains reflect a 
standard Canadian position enabling the source country to tax 
gains arising on the sale of real property, business assets and 
shares in the real estate companies.
<P>
	Second, under the conventions, discrimination on the basis of 
nationality is prohibited. This ensures nationals of one country 
equal treatment with nationals of another country in the same 
circumstances. However, this does not prevent a country from 
providing fiscal incentives, for example, Canada's small 
business deduction, on the basis of the residence of the taxpayer.
<P>
	Third, Canada has also preserved its right to tax pensions paid 
to residents of the countries covered by the bill. However, it is 
important to point out, especially in light of the upcoming 
D-Day anniversary, that war veterans pensions are generally 
exempt from tax under the four treaties.
<P>
	Fourth, the treaties provide that in Canada double taxation of 
foreign source income of Canadian residents is alleviated by 
way of a foreign tax credit, in accordance with the limitations 
provided for in the Canadian legislation. Reciprocally, relief 
from double taxation is granted in the other treaty country and in 
accordance with the method recognized by that government.
<P>
	Let me turn to a final undertaking enacted by this legislation. 
Bill S-2 will implement a protocol to the tax convention signed 
by Canada and the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1986. This 
updates the existing treaty to take into consideration changes 
made to the respective laws and policies of the two countries.
<P>
	For example, in 1992 Canada announced that it was prepared 
in tax treaty negotiations to reciprocally reduce the withholding 
tax rate on direct dividends. This was seen as a valuable 
incentive to encourage international direct investment. In the 
1993 budget, the government stated its willingness to enact 
bilateral exemptions from withholding taxes on payments made 
for the use of computer software. I am pleased to say that the 
Netherlands is the first country with which we have completed 
such an agreement.
<P>
	Under this bill, in cases where a dividend recipient holds 25 
per cent or more of the capital or 10 per cent or more of the 
voting power of the dividend paying corporation, the 
withholding tax will be reduced to 5 per cent from the current 10 
per cent. This reduction will take place over a five-year period 
starting from 1993. As regards interest payments, the protocol 
reduces the rate to 10 per cent from the current 15 per cent.
<P>
	As well, the agreement eliminates the withholding tax on 
royalties for computer software and on interest paid to pension 
plans.
<P>
	In simple summary, the four tax conventions and the 
Netherlands protocol contained in the bill provide some 
equitable solutions to the various problems of double taxation 
existing between Canada and certain international partners. 
Each of these countries hopes to implement the bilateral 
convention as soon as possible. Consequently I commend this 
bill to the House and urge its speedy passage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome this opportunity to speak again, this time on third 
reading of Bill S-2, a bill that deals with tax conventions 
between Canada and Hungary, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Argentina 
and the Netherlands.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I would like to take the next few minutes to repeat the reasons 
for our objections to Bill S-2, that is to say, the objections of the 
Bloc Quebecois. We do not object to these tax conventions 
because we object to the countries as such. In other words, the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois, Quebecers in general and 
Canadians in general as well, on whose behalf we occasionally 
speak as the Official Opposition, do not object to Hungary or 
Nigeria or Zimbabwe or Argentina or the Netherlands.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4572"> 4572 </A></B>
<P>
	However, there are certain inconsistencies in the Canadian tax 
system as well as in the rules and traditions of this tax system, 
and we often find these inconsistencies in tax conventions of 
this kind.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, we support free trade, and in fact 
we were instrumental, and when I say we I am referring to 
Quebecers, in adopting two international agreements. The first 
one was with the United States and the second included Mexico. 
We also supported arrangements to improve the rules of 
international trade, like those that were adopted last December 
at the GATT talks.
<P>
	We also have a tradition of international co-operation and a 
tradition of reaching out internationally. We remember Lester B. 
Pearson, whom we admire for his international involvement, 
and Jean Lesage in Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, it is not in that regard that the Bloc Quebecois has 
to show its opposition in the case of international treaties. Tax 
treaties are usually a good thing because they allow businesses 
to avoid double taxation on the benefits of their various 
affiliates.
<P>
	Tax treaties also have the merit of creating reciprocal 
agreements, which allows to draw a clear line between two 
countries regarding taxation of the profits of companies, 
because to be effective, those tax treaties must call for levels of 
taxation that are roughly equivalent between two signatory 
countries.
<P>
	Besides, and this will be my first negative point in assessing 
Bill S-2, as the auditor general mentioned several times, there 
are flaws in the principle underlying tax treaties and in certain 
agreements signed with countries that are considered as tax 
havens.
<P>
	In some of those countries, for instance Barbados, Cyprus, 
Malta and Singapore, who have signed tax treaties with Canada, 
corporate taxation and all that pertains to income or capital 
gains taxation is much lower than Canadian taxation.
<P>
	As the Auditor General underlined it in his 1992 report, no 
corrective measure was adopted, even in the last budget of this 
government, despite all that was said. According to the Auditor 
General, incomes earned in countries that are tax havens and 
that are designated by order may enter Canada tax free even if 
they have not been taxed or have been at a very low rate.
<P>
	The Auditor General also said in his 1992 report: ``The 
Department of National Revenue Taxation is aware of a number 
of taxpayers who have used this scheme-tax havens-to be in a 
position to move $500 million into Canada tax free''.
<P>
	This first point is already appalling enough. I must tell you 
that, at the present time and since 1984, middle-income 
taxpayers have been crippled by the Canadian tax system. 
Incredible sacrifices are asked of the poorest in our society since 
the last budget, while other taxpayers, probably those with very 
high incomes, because they are the only ones who can take 
advantage of  those flaws, are allowed to move $500 million tax 
free from foreign countries to Canada. I find this appalling.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The second negative aspect regarding tax treaties is that the 
foreign revenues of Canadian corporations, which are subject to 
little or no tax, give the Canadian shareholders access to the 
same federal tax credit on their dividends as on dividends payed 
by a Canadian company which operates and pays taxes in 
Canada. How can we speak of developing the Canadian 
economy while this measure maintained by the tax treaties 
hampers our economic growth and the development of Canadian 
businesses?
<P>
	Good Canadian corporate citizens which pay their taxes also 
pay for other corporations which benefit from this type of 
exchange, this type of deduction. And we are asked to quietly 
support such a bill when tax treaties as a whole should probably 
be reviewed to determine where are the tax havens and the tax 
loopholes which allow bad corporate citizens not to pay their 
fair share of taxes for years and years. I find it rather absurd that 
we are asked to support this bill when all those treaties should be 
reviewed.
<P>
	The third negative aspect regarding tax treaties is that, 
according to the existing legislation, a corporation operating in 
Canada can deduct interest on the money it borrows to invest in a 
foreign subsidiary. Companies that invest in tax havens have 
found two ways to avoid paying taxes. First, they deduct their 
loan interests and then they bring back to Canada, free of tax, 
their profits which are subject to little or no tax in foreign 
countries.
<P>
	I am not the only one to say so. For about three years now, the 
Auditor General has been saying that the tax conventions 
legislation is full of holes. Let me quote the Auditor General on 
this issue. It is always interesting to quote someone who is 
non-political and neutral, someone who can put his fingers on 
the problems linked to the Canadian tax system and the inaction 
of the federal government which does not seem to want to do 
much about the various loopholes. In his 1992 report, the 
Auditor General said, and I quote: ``That deduction of interest 
reduces Canada's tax revenue and, at the same time, the related 
income is not necessarily subject to tax in Canada. It may be 
received as a tax exempt dividend and may never appear in the 
Canadian tax base''.
<P>
	So, by using such tactics, Canadian companies can avoid 
paying taxes first by transferring to the Canadian parent 
corporation the losses incurred by their foreign affiliates. In 
other words, the Canadian companies which report losses due to 
their foreign production operations can deduct these losses in 
Canada, which means that Canada is losing a similar amount of 
money in tax revenues. Second, according to the tax treaties, 
profits made by Canadian corporations can be redirected to 
foreign countries. If profits are made here, in Canada, and 
taxation levels are lower in the countries where the Canadian 
parent company has a foreign affiliate, profits  can be taxed in 
the other country. Third, by using such tactics, Canadian 
companies avoid paying taxes by converting their profits in 
exempt income.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4573"> 4573 </A></B>
<P>
	One element of the Canadian tax system that needs to undergo 
an in-depth review is all of the tax treaties and the legislation 
concerning the Canadian tax conventions, because that is what 
allows people who take advantage of all these loopholes to laugh 
all the way to the bank.
<P>
	Among the many examples I could use, I would like to quote 
only one striking example the Auditor General gave us. I quote: 
``A Netherlands Antilles subsidiary of a Canadian company had 
assets of $865 million and income of $92 million. The offshore 
income is not taxed on entering Canada, but it carries the federal 
tax credit on dividends paid to Canadian shareholders''. 
Imagine! That allowed the Canadian parent company to report a 
$29 million tax loss in Canada. There was no production on 
Canadian soil. No jobs were created. There was no investment in 
machinery or equipment in Quebec or in Canada. The company 
was engaged in a production activity in a foreign country 
without creating economic activity either in Quebec or in 
Canada, yet it was able to deduct from that foreign activity an 
operating loss of no less than $29 million.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	If that is not exporting jobs and economic activity that are so 
precious to us, I do not know how else to describe this flight of 
capital.
<P>
	The Auditor General gave us an idea of the costs related to 
loopholes in the legislation governing tax treaties. According to 
him, for 1990 only, Canadian businesses invested nearly $92 
billion in non resident companies with which they have a 
non-arm's length relationship; $92 billion, that represents 
significant production activity exported elsewhere and 
substantial tax exemptions for production activity exported 
elsewhere. That also represents a lot of tax exemptions on 
profits from economic activities not exercised on Canadian soil; 
it amounted to $92 billion for 1990 alone.
<P>
	Of course, some of this $92 billion has been invested by good 
corporate citizens. There are companies doing real trading with 
countries not considered as tax havens, but there are 
nevertheless examples that can be drawn from the current 
situation to show that some of these investments in countries 
considered as tax havens are suspicious. Take for example the 
investment of $5.2 billion made two years ago in companies in 
Barbados, a recognized tax haven. These investments generated 
$400 million in dividends which were tax exempt when received 
on Canadian soil. As another example, $10.9 billion were 
invested in companies in Cyprus, in Ireland, in Liberia, in the 
Netherlands and in Switzerland, all countries also considered as 
tax havens. These investments generated more than $200 
million in dividends which were tax exempt once brought into 
Canada.
<P>
	According to the Auditor General himself-who does not 
hold a membership card from the Bloc Quebecois, nor from the 
Liberal Party, nor from the Reform Party-and I quote: ``It is 
reasonable to conclude that hundreds of millions of dollars in 
tax revenue have already been lost and will continue to be if 
nothing is done to remedy the situation''. That was in 1992. The 
Conservatives did nothing in 1992 and 1993. Then, in 1993, 
there was a change of government, but to the same effect: the 
Liberals have done nothing in the face of a tax scandal, a flight 
of capital scandal, whereas Quebec and Canadian taxpayers are 
being bled dry. This is unacceptable. It is a disgrace.
<P>
	The Auditor General recommended a comprehensive review 
of tax arrangements so that we can really determine which 
countries we should have tax arrangements with, countries that 
are not mere tax havens, and do not encourage massive capital 
exodus as well as the loss of hundreds of millions in tax 
revenues for Canada. This is not the time for such a waste of 
money. On February 23, the Minister of Finance said that cuts 
were in order. But instead of eliminating loopholes such as tax 
arrangements, he targeted unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I noticed your signal, Mr. Speaker.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. He will be able to 
resume his remarks at three o'clock.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
reviewed the details about a lady who was brutally beaten and 
raped in 1987 in my riding. Wayne Alexander Perkin was 
convicted of this terrible crime, given six years, and paroled 
early.
<P>
	Last week I sat with Corinne Schafer in her home as she talked 
about her sister Angela's death. I attended court last Thursday to 
hear the verdict on the same Wayne Perkin found guilty of 
brutally murdering Corinne's sister Angela in 1992 while he was 
out on parole.
<P>
	I am sad for Corinne, her family and friends. I am frustrated at 
a justice system that time after time has proven itself 
ineffective. However, most of all I am angry at a government 
that mimics its predecessors. The government has the power to 
change many aspects of the justice system now, yet it continues

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Kingston city council recently passed a special resolution 
blocking the construction of a French language high school on 
an abandoned industrial site. The school would also have housed 
a francophone community centre. You may recall that the 
students of École Marie-Rivier have been attending classes for 
the past seven years in cramped, makeshift structures without 
washrooms.
<P>
	Does the government intend to intervene directly to compel 
Kingston city council to approve the construction of a French 
school equipped with proper sanitation facilities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the 
Leader of the Opposition is travelling around the country these 
days professing to be the great defender of francophone rights 
outside Quebec. When the time came to authorize real 
self-determination for Acadians outside Quebec, he and his 
party voted against this proposal. Why? In his own words, to 
punish those who voted against Charlottetown. The following 
question then arises: Does the Leader of the Opposition truly 
want to support student rights or is he merely interested in doing 
some politicking to advance his own separatist goals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know the Deputy Prime Minister to be a polite, 
courteous and honourable person. I know she will want to check 
<I>Hansard</I> and the <I>Votes and Proceedings</I> of the House where she 
will see that the Bloc Quebecois voted in favour of linguistic 
equality for New Brunswick's Acadians. That is the truth. The 
Deputy Prime Minister is repeating the gossip and false rumours 
making the rounds. The Bloc Quebecois voted for equality-
<P>

hear the questions and answers during Question Period. The

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In any event, a check 
of <I>Hansard</I> will settle this argument. I would like <I>Hansard</I> to be 
verified immediately since I want Canadian citizens to be 
informed at three o'clock that we stated the truth.
<P>
	Does the government recognize that the decision of Kingston 
city council is indicative of the kind of obstacles encountered by 
francophones outside Quebec when they try to avail themselves 
of their French language education rights? Getting back to the 
issue that concerns us and to this blatant example of injustice, 
can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us what steps she intends to 
take in order to have this hateful decision reconsidered?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the Leader of the 
Opposition were really interested in Kingston's francophone 
students, he would have taken the time to learn the reasons why 
city council decided to oppose the relocation of the school. The 
proposed site was only steps away from a dangerous toxic waste 
treatment site and Kingston city council did not want students 
going to school there if their health would be endangered. The 
decision had nothing to do with the fact that they were 
francophones, but rather with the fact that the proposed location 
was close to a toxic waste site.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see that the Deputy Prime Minister supports this 
decision and that far from distancing herself from it, she is even 
justifying it, even though it will continue to deprive students at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4578"> 4578 </A></B>
<P>

washrooms for students, in a country like Canada.
<P>
	My question is for the minister of defence. In view of the 
fierce opposition in the city of Kingston to the construction of a 
school for francophones, will the minister of defence continue 
to argue that Kingston is the best site for a bilingual military 
college, one where francophones will feel comfortable?

	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

Deputy Prime Minister answered the substance of the hon. 
member's question and I thought she did so very effectively.
<P>
	With respect to the consolidation of the military colleges in 
Kingston there will be no change to our decision. There will be 
one military college that will be located at Kingston.
<P>
	In fact I was in the area this morning talking with the local 
press. I am really quite heartened by the attitude that the people 
of that area have toward making Kingston a showplace of

is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Despite appeals from the Government of Quebec, the 
Kanesatake Band Council has continued the work to expand the 
Indian cemetery. In a letter to his federal counterpart, the 
Quebec Minister of Native Affairs, Mr. Sirros, asks the federal 
government to begin negotiations quickly with the Kanesatake 
Band Council.
<P>
	As trustee, did the federal government intervene directly with 
the Kanesatake Band Council to convince it to stop the work and 
to return to the negotiating table or are we to understand instead 
that Chief Jerry Peltier still refuses to return to the negotiating 
table?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal government has 
just appointed a negotiator in the person of lawyer Michel 
Robert for the very purpose of negotiating an end to this 
situation.
<P>
	But on these issues, all sorts of opinions must be taken into 
consideration, including Daniel Turp's; speaking on 
self-determination for native people, he said to the Quebec 
National Assembly: ``In my opinion, the fact that the natives are 
a people, that they consider themselves to be a people gives 
them a right to self-determination in the same way as Quebec''.
<P>
	Of course, when we consider the issue of self-determination 
for native people, we must consider not only the opinions of 
negotiators in this context but also those of the Bloc Quebecois's 
advisers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, my second 
question is still for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Can she tell us if the federal negotiator will make stopping the 
work now going on in the pine grove a precondition for resuming 
negotiations?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>

	Does the federal government agree that it must act quickly to 
forestall any escalation in Oka? Does the federal government 
agree on that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously, when a 
negotiator is appointed by the federal government, he has all he 
needs to end this conflict. We want it to be settled generously, 
equitably and fairly in the interests of all concerned. We have 
confidence in the ability of lawyer Michel Robert and we await 
results. We do not want to consider proceeding until we have 
seen at least our negotiator's report.

raping seven women, was released from prison last Friday. 
Fisher is now free to travel wherever he pleases without any 
obligation to declare himself to local enforcement officials.
<P>
	In an internal memorandum issued last week by the RCMP, it 
warned that because of his past criminal history it is likely that 
he will reoffend. So that people like Larry Fisher can be 
identified by local law enforcement officials, will the Minister 
of Justice include a national registry of sexual offenders in his 
forthcoming package of judicial reforms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

question, it is not something that is planned at present but a 
national register of sexual offenders is something I would be 
happy to consider and discuss with the hon. member once I have 
had an opportunity to examine its implications.
<P>
	I will deal more broadly with the thrust of the member's 
question without commenting on the case of Mr. Fisher who has 
completed his sentence and has been released at the end of the 
sentence which, by the way, was served without parole.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4579"> 4579 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me speak more generally about the whole question of the 
release of offenders. As the hon. member will know, we have 
long since identified as a matter requiring action the whole 
question of the release of high risk offenders at the end of their 
sentences of incarceration.
<P>
	I have already started with my colleagues in the provinces and 
territories an examination of alternatives. We have planned 
meetings with the ministers of health of those jurisdictions later 
this year to discuss specific changes to provincial mental health 
legislation to permit assessment and, if public safety requires it, 
continued confinement of such persons beyond the end of their 
criminal sentence in order to protect society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
minister for his answer and his concern in this area.
<P>
	Following in the same vein, it was recently reported that Easy 
Street, a children's centre in Calgary, unwittingly hired a janitor 
who had just been released from a 12-year sentence for sexually 
abusing a seven-year old girl.
<P>
	Calgary vocational services which helped the man get the job 
said it knew of his criminal record but was bound by 
confidentiality. This example shows that action is needed now. 
Will the Minister of Justice include a national registry of child 
abusers in his forthcoming package of judicial reforms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, in concert with the Solicitor 
General and the Minister of Health, we are releasing a 
discussion paper on the whole question of a national child sex 
abuse register for the protection of children to adapt existing 
technology to permit us to store for retrieval in appropriate 
circumstances particulars of convictions for sexual abuse. 
Protection of children in cases such as the one referred to by the 
hon. member is our paramount concern.
<P>
	After we have the benefit of the views of Canadians including 
the provincial authorities on the alternatives set out in our 
discussion paper, we will put in place a national register with 
respect to those convicted of child sexual abuse.
<P>
	As I informed the House last week, our objective is to have 
that in place in the fall of this year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I thank the 
minister for his response to these very urgent public matters.
<P>
	On Saturday the Manitoba Teachers' Society endorsed a 
resolution that would inform schools whenever they had a young 
offender in their classes. Similar requests are likely from both 
Alberta and Ontario in the next few weeks.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister's forthcoming proposal include these 
requests, namely that school officials be informed of young 
offenders in their midst?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the changes we are 
going to introduce in legislation to be tabled in the House will 
meet those concerns.
<P>
	I have engaged in discussions with chairs of school boards, 
with representatives of schools, with police forces, with parents 
groups. I am keenly aware of the strong feeling that where 
public safety requires it, information about young offenders 
should be shared, particularly in those cases involving crimes of 
violence.
<P>
	I am confident that the changes we will propose very shortly 
to the House of Commons will meet those concerns and answer 
the needs that have been identified by the hon. member.

Canada Health Act does not specify any amounts in transfer 
payments. That is done under EPF.

	In the last nine years, there have been some decreases in 
funding. However, the good news of the past budget was that we

suggesting that people see their doctor. The fact is however that 
hepatitis C is often asymptomatic.
<P>
	How can the minister responsible for public health refuse to 
take action on the hepatitis C issue when several thousand 
Canadians, unaware of their condition, can transmit the virus to 
others and even die from it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, we 
continue to strive to make the Canadian blood supply system 
safe. But let me tell you that there are many partners in this 
system. The role of Health Canada is to ensure that blood 
products are as safe as possible.
<P>
	As for the Canadian Red Cross Society, its role is to keep a 
precise record of the blood products distributed. Hospitals also 
have a major role to play, as well as physicians, who are 
responsible for keeping their patients well informed.
<P>
	For our part, we are examining our role as a regulating 
authority to make sure that all these people work together to 
ensure our blood supply system is the safest possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, since tens of 
thousands of Canadians have already been infected, does the 
minister agree that, by accepting to make arrangements 
immediately to reach people who may have been infected, she 
would not only improve their quality of life but also reduce 
considerably the risk of hepatitis C spreading?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I 
just said, there are many partners involved in the blood supply 
system. There are many partners in the health system, including 
the provinces, who have a major role to play. I am really 
surprised to see the Bloc Quebecois, which is so intent on 
leaving this Confederation and making sure that we do not 
infringe upon provincial jurisdictions, rise today and urge me to 
tell the provinces what to do.

<P>
	The minister was quoted recently as saying that perhaps the 
dispute between Canada and the U.S. over softwood lumber 
could be taken away from the present dispute settlement panel 
procedures, which have ruled in Canada's favour in the past, and 
moved into some broader based discussions that could lead to 
resolution.
<P>
	Can the minister ensure the Canadian softwood lumber 
industry and all of the workers that this will be an improvement 
particularly considering that Canada has won just about every 
round in this ongoing dispute over the existing procedures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we fully expect to win the next panel reviews. 
There are two more during the months of June and July and we 
expect to win them as well.
<P>
	The point I had in mind was that it is always available to 
United States' interests to retrigger, to reinstitute the whole 
process for a fourth time. Surely it is in both our interest and the 
United States' interest to proceed on a basis that does not once 
again trigger this whole tiresome process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the minister's answer.
<P>
	I was wondering if the minister was thinking of trying to take 
the dispute settlement that is currently being used against us, 
where Canada is being harassed, and actually making it a 
separate part, almost like an auto pact; in other words, taking the 
softwood lumber out from under.
<P>
	I can tell the minister that I had a discussion with 
Congressman Sam Gibbons, a senior congressman, who thought 
that was a good idea. Would the minister support that?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> I 
would be glad to hear in rather more detail what the hon. 
member has in mind.
<P>
	The point that we both share is that there is this possibility of 
ongoing harassment, as the member puts it, and since both 
industries, both sides of the border, are to a degree integrated 
and share common environmental problems, common supply 
problems, it must not be beyond our wit to come up with some 
better solution to our difficulties than this constant recycling of 
dispute settlement panels.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
recently saw, the Minister of Industry totally distanced himself 
from the election promise made by his party to transform the 
defence industry productivity program into a conversion 
instrument rather than a program supporting civilian technology 
for military purposes.
<P>
	My question is: Will the minister explain why DIPP, which 
was not deemed adequate to facilitate industrial conversion 
when the Liberal Party formed the opposition, is suddenly 
perceived as an effective tool to facilitate the conversion of 
military industries to civilian production?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
thought the answers I provided to other Bloc Quebecois 
members on that issue were quite clear. As mentioned in the red 
book, DIPP will indeed be the basis of our conversion program 
for military industries. Also, as I indicated, since we were 
elected, 39 out of 41 proposals accepted by this government 
concerned civilian projects or both military and civilian 
production, and had nothing to do with DIPP.
<P>
	I do not understand why the Bloc objects to the fact that, even 
with a program such as DIPP, we can choose proposals related to 
civilian purposes, and also objects to the commitment we made 
to the effect that we could change some aspects of that program 
to stop the wasting of money, by setting up a system which 
would benefit from contributions made by companies. This is a 
program for the conversion of military industries.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary. Does this mean that the Minister of Industry was 
refused the financial resources required to implement a true 
conversion strategy, which might explain why he is now 
extolling the virtues of DIPP, which was so strongly criticized 
by his party when it formed the opposition?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can only believe that the Bloc keeps repeating the same 
ridiculous allegations in the hope that sooner or later people will 
start to believe them.
<P>
	What we have made clear is that there is a program of defence 
conversion. Yes, DIPP needs to be expanded and yes, we need to 
create a revolving fund, but fundamentally we made a key 
promise when we went to the polls last October which was in 
part to cut subsidies to business.
<P>
	The Bloc keeps wanting us to write cheques to companies 
which somehow or other were not aware that the Berlin wall 
came down in 1989 and their shareholders are not willing to 
invest enough now to give them a plan for the future. If that is 
the kind of company the member wants us to give money to, I am 
sorry I do not agree with him and the government does not agree 
with him.

	The recent report of the core sport commissioner 
recommended among other things the elimination of federal 
funding for 19 amateur sport programs. Six of the targeted 
programs are Olympic sports, two of which saw gold medal

remains a good sport when it comes to funding those sporting 
activities which remain important to Canadians.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
The minister has assured this House that the Canada pension 
plan is in good shape with a healthy surplus.
<P>
	However, almost all the surplus, 93 per cent of it, is loaned out 
to provinces at bargain basement interest rates. For example, it 
has just been reported that a Saskatchewan crown corporation, 
SaskTel, owes $100 million of its huge $600 million debt to the 
Canada pension plan at below market rates.
<P>
	How could cheap loans to debt ridden governments and crown 
corporations be in the best interests of CPP contributors and 
beneficiaries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member may be 
interested to know that this arrangement in terms of using 
surpluses of CPP as a basis for provincial use has been in place 
since the mid-1960s. It is not simply a program to lend to crown 
corporations.
<P>
	If the member would speak to some of her colleagues who 
have been in provincial government she would know that the 
provinces also provide guarantees on whatever loans that are 
given to their agencies. Those are usually on a return interest of 
about 11 per cent, as I understand it. In effect the process has 
been in place for 30 years.
<P>
	We are certainly glad the Reform party wants us to take a new 
look at this co-operative arrangement with the provinces and do 
something about it. Generally the program has worked very 
well. It has been a very important source for all provincial 
governments to invest in a wide variety of important 
infrastructure and educational institutions in their provinces. It 
is too bad the Reform party wants that program to come to an 
end.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
really is going on is that some of the provinces are funding some 
of their activities with low interest federal money instead of 
with tax dollars. They are getting further into debt because of it. 
Also CPP premiums are now expected to rise to keep pace with 
payments of benefits.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	Will the government agree to a moratorium on these low 
interest loans and ensure that from now on CPP surplus funds 
will be invested with an eye to a reasonable rate of return?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will quote directly the auditor 
general who says in his most recent report: ``The CPP fund earns 
a reasonable rate of return on its investments''.
<P>
	If the hon. member is not prepared to take my word for it, 
perhaps she will take the word of the Auditor General. In the last 
report he underlined the fact that CPP funds are in fact being 
used for useful investments at a proper reasonable rate of return.

discrimination and harassment of women in particular in the

<P>
	In fact, this morning I was at a workshop in Gananoque of the 
spouses of Canadian forces personnel. They are working as a 
group within the department but also are volunteering their time

this horrible trend of harassment in Canadian society does not

there is a problem getting adequate financing for small business.

business community as the key factor in creating jobs. We have 
been discussing with the banks a code of conduct for lending 
practices which we hope we can agree to with them. A number of

they were not doing as much as they could have done for the

point of order is to the effect that, during Question Period, we all

doubt that the Leader of the Opposition was absolutely right.

duty and indeed my pleasure to present today in conformity with 
Standing Order 109 of the House of Commons to table the first 
report of the committee of the environment and sustainable 
development.
<P>
	In doing so, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the 
government for this most interesting assignment; the members 
of the committee for their work, advice, input and very 
thoughtful support; the clerk, researchers and support staff for 
their dedication, advice, guidance and the benefit of their 
experience.
<P>
	I would also in a particular way like to thank all the witnesses 
and those who in large numbers advocated the thrust of this 
report, making most valuable recommendations on how the 
proposed commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development is to operate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4586"> 4586 </A></B>
<P>
	We have looked at the future well beyond the next election. 
We have produced a report which, if adopted, would serve 
Canada well into the next century. What we are proposing, if 
adopted, would take Canada to the forefront in the global 
community both in anticipating and preventing depletions in our 
ecological and natural resource capital and in integrating 
economic with environmental goals so that once and for all we 
get out of the dangerous balancing act we find ourselves in as a 
society.
<P>
	In adopting the committee's recommendations, the 
Government of Canada will be giving substance to its 
commitment to an environmentally sustainable future and will 
assume its rightful place as a leader in the world community.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has about 24 minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker, for the accuracy in your time assessment. I had 
calculated 23 minutes and 49 seconds myself, but I accept your 
time of 24 minutes.
<P>
	So we were considering at third reading Bill S-2, which 
renews a tax agreement between Canada and five other 
countries, namely Hungary, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Argentina and 
the Netherlands. It is never very enjoyable to be interrupted in 
the middle of a speech, so I will repeat some of the points I 
covered in detail in the first part of my speech.
<P>
	The first point is that the Bloc Quebecois has nothing against 
the countries that have signed the tax agreements mentioned in 
Bill S-2. The Bloc Quebecois, like all Quebec sovereignists, has 
shown in the past that it is open to the world, has a deep-rooted 
tradition in the international cooperation and development area 
and supports mainly North American but also international 
agreements of all kinds.
<P>
	You will recall how we supported the Free Trade Agreement 
with the United States and Mexico, as well as the GATT 
agreements signed last December. After long and laborious 
negotiations, we came to support these conventions, these 
international agreements.
<P>
	The same thing applies to tax conventions. When they meet 
the original needs and the criteria that have been set, we have 
nothing against such conventions. First and foremost, these tax 
conventions are used to avoid taxing twice a company which has 
foreign affiliates.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	These are indeed very worthy conventions, but for them to 
meet their main goal, there has to be reciprocity between Canada 
and the countries with which we have signed these conventions. 
There must be reciprocity as well as commensurate tax 
treatment for profits made by the companies, capital profits and 
a similar series of exemptions for private corporations.
<P>
	But, these last few years, the Auditor General of Canada as 
well as some Liberal members, then in opposition, denounced in 
no uncertain terms some of these conventions which were 
signed and are still being renewed between Canada and 
countries considered as tax havens for hundreds of millions of 
federal government tax dollars.
<P>
	I was pointing to the flaws of the tax convention system and 
explaining why we have so many reservations about a measure 
like Bill S-2, as we have long been asking for a review of each of 
these arrangements between Canada and various countries to 
discover which countries do not deserve reciprocity agreements 
or tax treaties such as the one under review this afternoon.
<P>
	We were not the only ones who denounced these conventions. 
Several others have already done so. For example, in December 
1992, the sitting hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, himself a 
Liberal, criticized loopholes in tax conventions with countries 
considered as tax havens, by declaring the following: ``We are 
really worried because the Department of Finance has done 
nothing to eliminate most of these schemes''-he was talking 
about schemes concerning tax conventions with countries 
considered as being tax havens-``used by foreign subsidiaries 
to avoid taxation. In my opinion, this problem is not new and we 
are confronting it again this year''.
<P>
	Indeed, the problem is not new. I would say that, since 1987 or 
approximately 1987, the Department of Finance has been 
``dealing with'' the problems of tax loopholes associated with 
tax treaties. Indeed, in 1987, the Department of Finance 
announced that it would study the taxing of foreign affiliates. 
These studies were never tabled. Imagine! The Department of 
Finance of Canada has been aware of the problems for seven 
years, and has let them deteriorate for seven years. It has let 
these problems deteriorate while the Conservatives were in 
office, and it is letting them deteriorate under the Liberals.
<P>
	I am extremely disappointed that the Minister of Finance and 
the Liberal government did not respond to our numerous calls 
for a serious and comprehensive analysis of those tax 
conventions that are causing the loss of hundreds of millions of 
dollars to the federal treasury in a period where, for some time 
already, we can no longer afford to deliberately lose hundreds of 
millions of dollars. This government continues to be inactive in 
the examination of those tax conventions. Even worse, it is 
proposing us to extend those conventions before analyzing their 
provisions as a whole.
<P>
	This government perpetuates the injustices detected in some 
tax conventions, the sieves for Canadian corporations that do 
not carry out their duty as good corporate citizens in terms of 
contributing to the elimination of the deficit and debt problem of 
the federal government. I would tell you that the Liberal 
government, the Liberals, the members of the Liberal  Party of 
Canada are only sensitive to two words: ``lobby'' and ``friends''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4588"> 4588 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	As was the case for all taxation decisions that have been made 
since the evening of October 25, since the last election, and in 
particular since February 22 or 23, when the Liberal government 
tabled its first budget, these two words have become 
commonplace within the Liberal Party.
<P>
	All taxation decisions have been made on this basis, on the 
basis of lobbyists and friends of the party. Perhaps I should have 
mentioned a third word: lobbyists, friends of the party. Friends 
who have been handsomely paid for their support since the 
Liberal Party came to power.
<P>
	Friends who, for several years, have made generous 
contributions to the Liberal Party of Canada. Friends who are 
also stakeholders in tax loopholes such as those provided for in 
income tax treaties, family trusts and different leaks in the 
Canadian tax system.
<P>
	With regard to the funding of political parties, is it normal that 
big Canadian corporations contribute such huge amounts to the 
Liberal Party of Canada in the same way they contributed and 
may still be contributing huge amounts to the Conservative 
Party of Canada, as they did last year?
<P>
	Is it democratic, in a country that prides itself on being 
democratic, for a government to have both hands tied and not to 
be able to run the country freely because those people, from the 
Liberal Party of Canada, have to please those who contributed 
generously to the fund of their party? They have to be careful not 
to disappoint them. The Liberal Party has to go on. Like any 
other great federalist party, the Liberal Party must have some 
continuity. So, when these people come to power, the first thing 
they have to do is to please the friends of their party.
<P>
	When someone wants to change a tax convention, for 
example, and when a Canadian business that made donations to 
the fund of the Liberal Party of Canada for many years comes 
under fire for its ability to evade taxation in Canada, it is quite 
usual, for this government, not to take its responsibilities and 
bring about sound reforms.
<P>
	When we learn that the National Trust Company contributed 
$12,454.70 to the Liberal Party in 1993 and the Royal Bank of 
Canada gave $45,000 to the same party, we are not surprised to 
see that this government refuses to put in place measures that 
could affect it, nor can we fail to notice a certain complicity 
between a federalist message and the annual report of the Royal 
Bank or any other analysis of the constitutional impact of a 
certain decision that the Quebec population could make.
<P>
	Is it normal too for the Liberal Party to receive $25,000 from 
the Royal Trust Company, $42,000 from the Bank of Nova 
Scotia, $40,000 from the Toronto Dominion Bank and $31,253 
from Scotia McLeod and so forth? I could go on, there are many 
other examples.
<P>
	In any case, the Liberal Party of Canada gets half of its funds 
from big business. So, not surprisingly, when the time comes to 
make decisions in the public interest, decisions which could 
further restore the public finances, at least in part, and which 
could somewhat tighten the budgetary policy or close tax 
loopholes, these measures, the real initiatives that should be 
taken, are not.
<P>
	The Liberal Party, a great Canadian party, like the 
Conservative Party, came to office with its hands tied; they feel 
uneasy because they have to deal with lobbies and friends of the 
party.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	By the way, we saw over the week-end that if you are not part 
of a lobby, if you are not a friend of the party, you are at a 
disadvantage. A newspaper article this week-end said that rich 
families lobbied the government to keep their tax exemption. 
The Canadian Press article mentioned family trusts and said: ``A 
lobby representing some of Canada's oldest and wealthiest 
family businesses talked the former Conservative government 
out of imposing capital gains tax on sheltered trust funds worth 
billions''.
<P>
	They managed to do the same with the Liberal government, 
the present Liberal administration. They succeeded to do the 
same, because despite pressures from the Bloc Quebecois, from 
the Reform Party and from people fed up with social injustices, 
tired of paying for fiscal mismanagement and weary of lack of 
control on public finances, despite all these pressures, the first 
budget of the Liberal Party did not abolish the privileges of 
family trusts and did not plug the loopholes created by tax 
treaties signed between Canada and countries considered as tax 
havens.
<P>
	I will continue with the article, because I found it fascinating 
and very representative of everything we have denounced about 
this government, about patronage and party friends. You know 
that family trusts were instituted by Pierre Elliott Trudeau. I can 
call him by his name since he is no longer a member of 
Parliament. It was Trudeau's idea. Trudeau is our phantom of the 
opera; he haunts this place. Every time you happen upon a bad 
measure, as it turns out, Trudeau was behind it. And if it is not 
Trudeau, it is the current Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	Interviewed in Toronto, Mr. Sharwood, the former president 
of Guaranty Trust, one of the contributors to the Liberal Party 
fund, indicated that the majority of the members of his 
association-read lobby or interest group-are family 
businesses that go back several generations. The association 
also represents families among the wealthiest. This means that 
all the wealthiest families are bunched together in the same 
lobby. These  families, the wealthiest in Canada, have 
contributed to the Liberal Party of Canada election fund. So you 
can imagine what kind of a welcome is extended to anyone from 
this lobby when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4589"> 4589 </A></B>
<P>
he or she knocks on the door of the finance minister or of the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	I am not surprised to see how powerful these lobbies are, 
considering they spend millions, even hundreds of millions-if 
you put together all the contributions made by large 
corporations formed into a lobby-on furthering their own 
interests, not those of the people of Quebec or Canada. I am not 
surprised to see that they manage, as they often do, to prevent 
this government from making perfectly legitimate decisions 
that would certainly be welcome, given all the sacrifices asked 
of taxpayers in Quebec and Canada, people who are already 
crushed by the tax system.
<P>
	I am not surprised when I look at the arrangements, at the 
family trust issue. I am not surprised, but I was even less 
surprised when I participated in the debate on the bill tabled by 
the Minister of Transport concerning Pearson airport. During 
that debate, which was very similar to this one on tax 
agreements and family trusts, we discovered that friends of the 
party had once again shown great strength, forming lobbies to 
ensure that the Minister of Transport, in his legislation 
regarding Pearson airport, would retain some discretionary 
power to, perhaps, compensate them if he deemed appropriate to 
do so following the cancellation of the contract for the 
privatization of that airport.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	There, as in the case of the two previous issues, and 
particularly this one on tax agreements, we noticed that friends 
such as Leo Kolber-he is the senator who organized a small 
lunch at $1,000 a plate during the elections to finance the 
Liberal Party of Canada's campaign-played an active role in 
the privatization of Pearson airport. Leo Kolber had invited 
friends such as Charles Bronfman. Herb Metcalfe, a lobbyist 
with the Capital group, was also present, as well as Ramsay 
Withers, a federal lobbyist with close ties to the current Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	So, there were many friends of the party who, again, formed a 
lobby to ask that at least some clauses in the bill tabled by the 
Minister of Transport provide benefits to them. These are 
friends of the party who formed lobbies. Imagine their power: 
they exert direct pressure on the Liberal Party to make sure it 
implements measures which will benefit their own interests.
<P>
	When I see all this and when I look at what the government's 
last budget, which was its first one, contains in the way of 
budget cuts at the expense of the average citizen, I am disgusted, 
because I have yet to hear a single Liberal, among all those who 
have been complaining bitterly about such cuts for the past eight 
years, object to the fact that the government is doing nothing 
about unfair practices and loopholes in the Canadian tax system, 
while on the other hand, in order to  improve the state of the 
federal treasury, it introduces measures like cutting $5.5 billion 
from the unemployment insurance fund, eliminating the age tax 
credit, and generally, measures that come down hardest on the 
neediest in our society who are already depressed because they 
have no work, and are now facing additional constraints.
<P>
	As in all other areas, it is clear the members of this 
government are arrogant and cynical in the extreme. I keep 
repeating this because it is true. Every day I wonder how the 
Liberals can treat people the way they did, the Liberal members 
of the finance subcommittee which examined the bill on 
amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act. I am really 
disgusted at the way they behaved.
<P>
	People came from the Maritimes, all the way from St. John's, 
Newfoundland, to appear before the committee, which hardly 
bothered to listen to their grievances about the unemployment 
insurance cuts. The government did listen to the lobbyists who 
asked them not to eliminate certain tax conventions with 
countries that are considered to be tax havens. The government 
did listen to the richest families in Canada who wanted the 
government to maintain the outrageous preferential treatment of 
family trusts.
<P>
	They came all the way by car, like those who came from the 
Acadian peninsula, and they were thrown out because they came 
to express their grievances. They came to say they were 
ashamed of supporting a government that had promised to put 
the economy in the Maritimes back on track, but instead had 
shown it could not care less what happened to them and dozens 
of communities in the Maritimes.
<P>
	I get rather emotional whenever I talk about inequity and 
unfair taxation, because as a newcomer in politics, I sincerely 
believed that people who for years had been fighting for more 
tax equity and who made their objections heard every time the 
Conservatives introduced measures which they themselves 
condemned, were sincere. I thought that these people were 
sincere. In spite of our differences of opinion on constitutional 
matters, I really thought that they were sincere, but I realize now 
that they are nothing more than good actors. They are excellent, 
but the play does not last forever.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	When I see this kind of measure, when I see the richest 
Canadians keep their privileges when the poorest members of 
our society are being asked once again to tighten their belts, this 
year, next year, and until the end of this government's mandate, I 
tell myself that, one day, common sense will prevail. People will 
realize that this government is a puppet government, and that it 
may be time for Quebec to change the constitutional order of 
things, to take its future into its own hands, and to implement 
real measures. It is time for fair taxes, for a Quebec tax system in 
a sovereign Quebec, based on the  principle of equality for all, 
and taking into account the needs of our poorest citizens.
<P>
	I have been wishing for and dreaming of such a system. These 
people are making this dream of a fair tax system even brighter. 
Let us dispel the nightmare of this unfair federal tax system.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
pleasure today to speak on Bill S-2, the Income Tax Convention 
Act, which deals with a number of tax conventions. My intention 
in the next few moments in the debate is, first, to support the 
principle of the bill; second, to raise some general questions; 
third, to raise our specific concerns with regard to points in the 
bill.
<P>
	As I listened to the debate so far on the bill there is a lot of 
latitude I could take. I could move all the way from the countries 
we are dealing with here-Hungary, Nigeria and 
Zimbabwe-and into the bedrooms of the nations, it seems, in a 
very easy and facile way in this assembly.
<P>
	In looking at the bill, as was mentioned by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance it is certainly a 
housekeeping bill, but there is a very important principle in it. 
The extent to which we deal with the principle and apply it in 
relationships with various countries of the world is very 
important not only to Canadians but to the other countries 
because today our world is certainly changing as never before.
<P>
	Technology is allowing us to deal with every country of the 
world. Whether they are friends or semi-friends, we can deal in 
a businesslike way with countries. People in this country can sit 
in their living rooms, their kitchens or small offices in their 
homes and deal with countries anywhere in the world in terms of 
our technology and making business arrangements. That is one 
aspect of it.
<P>
	Another aspect is that we want people in our country to use 
their skills, abilities, knowledge and technology to work with 
the people of other countries. They can exchange the same 
attributes we have so that they can be of benefit not only to other 
countries but also to persons who work within the confines of 
other government jurisdictions.
<P>
	As was mentioned, the purpose of the bill is to prevent income 
tax evasion, double taxation or unfair taxation of people who 
work between one country and another. That principle is 
certainly important.
<P>
	The countries we are dealing with at this point in time are 
Hungary, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Argentina and the Netherlands. If 
there are other areas of the world we should deal with, we should 
do so to make sure there is consistency.  This is a good first step.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	What are some of the general questions I would like to raise 
for the parliamentary secretary or the Minister of Finance to 
consider in their response at a later period in the debate?
<P>
	First, why are we only signing on with the limited number of 
countries listed and not some of the emerging markets we will be 
trading with in the future?
<P>
	Second, is the reason for these conventions that tax evasion 
exists in Canada due to our comparatively high level of 
taxation? Or, is it that the government is not willing to prevent 
the problem from occurring by bringing our tax level in line with 
those of other countries? Is the problem we are facing a tax 
question rather than the consistency question that has been 
raised here?
<P>
	Third, is it realistic to expect these conventions to be 
workable when Canada's tax system is considerably more 
complicated than that those of the countries with which we are 
signing these conventions?
<P>
	Fourth, is our high taxation level responsible for people 
leaving to go to these countries and is that the reason we need 
these conventions?
<P>
	There are some specific concerns I wish to raise with regard to 
Bill S-2. First, article 21 on page 43 of the bill allows for 
Canadian professors teaching in Nigeria to be tax exempt from 
both the Nigerian government and the Canadian government. Is 
the government allowing tax loopholes to exist that we should 
deal with in terms of our tax policy?
<P>
	The second concern I raise is with regard to article 10, 
paragraph 2(b), at page 60 which allows Canada to tax dividends 
emulating from Zimbabwe funds invested in Canada at 15 per 
cent but Canadian dividends from investments in Zimbabwe can 
be taxed at 20 per cent. Is this contrary to the concept of 
reciprocity?
<P>
	The third question I raise is with regard to article ll, paragraph 
3(a), at page 61 concerning interest arising from Canadian 
bonds held by Zimbabwe investors that can only be taxed in 
Zimbabwe. In this case the converse is also true. This is a 
questionable article because it is unlikely that very many 
Canadians will invest in Zimbabwe government securities. This 
is interest that will leave Canada and probably will not return.
<P>
	Those are some of the general questions I have with regard to 
the bill and some of my specific concerns. I would appreciate it 
if the parliamentary secretary, or one of the government 
members who has investigated the bill further, could respond to 
those questions.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform caucus I would like to say that in a 
specific sense with regard to the principle we support Bill S-2 
and will do so on the floor of this assembly.

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage)</B> moved that Bill C-31, an act to amend the Canadian 
Film Development Corporation Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
of Canada is pleased today to propose to the members of this 
House amendments to the present Canadian Film Development 
Corporation Act, in order to create a loan guarantee program 
that will give companies in the Canadian film and video industry 
easier access to sources of private funding.
<P>
	This program, which is the outcome of a very detailed 
analysis of the needs of the Canadian film and video industry, 
will allow better management of public funds without involving 
the federal government in any additional expenditure. It will be 
managed by one of our major national cultural institutions, 
Telefilm Canada, and will guarantee loans totalling $25 million 
annually.
<P>
	The program, in fact, will be an invaluable financial incentive 
contributing to the growth of the Canadian film and video 
industry. Its objective is clear and its scope considerable: to 
encourage our financial institutions to become better acquainted 
with this industry and devote more of their resources to funding 
Canadian production and distribution companies. For it must be 
said that the financial institutions have always been reluctant to 
participate in funding companies of this type, because they were 
unfamiliar with the cultural sector and considered intellectual 
property as inadequate security from a financial perspective.
<P>
	In recent years, the financial position of the film and video 
industry has been affected by the continuing decline in resources 
available from both public and private sectors. Telefilm 
Canada's annual resources will shrink by some $195 million, or 
22 per cent, over the period from 1992-1993 to 1997-1998.
<P>
	On the one hand, the banks are not co-operating as much as 
they might and, on the other hand, government funding has 
consistently fallen. If this trend continues-and there is little 
chance of a turnaround in the foreseeable future-production 
will decline and this will inhibit the government's efforts to 
ensure that Canadian cultural products of quality are available 
on our own market.
<P>
	The time for action is now. Change is necessary if Canada's 
cultural industries are to establish themselves in the new 
cultural landscape that is now taking shape. They have always 
had to deal with the proximity of the ``American giant'' whose 
vital mass culture assures worldwide success.
<P>
	Ours is one of the most open cultural markets on earth. While 
this is certainly enriching for all Canadians, such openness also 
represents a threat to our own creative artists. We cannot allow 
our national culture to be marginalized in our own domestic 
market, or fail to provide it with every opportunity to prosper in 
foreign markets.
<P>
	The loan guarantee program is an innovative solution to this 
problem. As well as demonstrating this government's 
commitment to protecting our cultural sovereignty, it aims to 
diversify the funding sources of a fast growing industry and 
foster good business relations with new financial partners.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The situation is especially pressing in that a study conducted 
in 1992 reveals that the growth of the Canadian film and video 
industry is limited by chronic lack of access to sources of 
interim financing. It is difficult, even impossible, for Canadian 
film and video companies to obtain from the banks the funding 
they need for their activities when their only guarantee is a letter 
of intent from a broadcaster or distributor.
<P>
	The contract signed on the basis of these guarantees are worth 
an estimated $70 million to $100 million a year. This shows how 
important they really are. Once it is in place, the loan guarantee 
program will rectify what has been a problem to the industry and 
could generate up to $143 million in activities related to film 
and video production and create several thousand jobs.
<P>
	The Canadian film and video industry which barely existed 20 
years ago has experienced phenomenal growth and is now a 
major employer and a producer of high quality entertainment 
programs.
<P>
	The figures speak for themselves in this regard. The total 
revenue of this industry, despite fluctuations from year to year, 
rose from $122 million in 1980 to more than $835 million in 
1992, with the number of direct and indirect jobs totalling more 
than 50,000 in 1992.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada, the revenue from exports of 
film and broadcast products jumped by $210 million from 1980 
to 1989 to reach $230 million. There is no doubt that this is a 
vital and viable sector of Canada's economy. The loan guarantee 
program could not come at a better time to stimulate the growth 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4592"> 4592 </A></B>
<P>
of a dynamic Canadian industry and to establish a relationship 
of trust between cultural enterprises and financial institutions.
<P>
	It is possible to hope for better co-operation between the 
cultural and financial sectors and over the long term reduce 
dependency of the cultural sector on public funding. This is the 
objective of this legislation.
<P>
	The risk is small. Any potential losses will be covered by a 
reserve fund established with Telefilm's current parliamentary 
appropriations and the user fees levied from recipients. Telefilm 
Canada will subject applications for loan guarantees to close 
scrutiny using strict criteria to ensure that only promising 
projects submitted by solvent companies receive such 
assistance.
<P>
	This is the first step in that direction. It is not unthinkable that 
the Government of Canada, if it considered it appropriate, would 
contemplate extending this program to the publishing and sound 
recording industries which also suffer from chronic under 
funding and the same lack of understanding on the part of 
financial institutions.
<P>
	The minister has asked the officials in his department to study 
this possibility. In a way it would be a question of applying the 
same tried and tested solution to a similar problem. The 
challenges of the 1990s must be met with the solutions of the 
1990s. The importance of the cultural sector, both in terms of 
strengthening our national identity and the economy, calls for 
judicial changes to the structures already in place, especially at 
a time when borders are fading and it has become imperative to 
preserve everything that makes us unique as a country.
<P>
	The loan guarantee program partakes of such a vision and 
attests to the government's commitment, set out in the red book, 
to promote Canada's cultural development. It is an innovative, 
effective and economic tool that will contribute to the prosperity 
of one of our most flourishing cultural industries, enhance the 
production of quality Canadian cultural products and enable 
banks to better understand the needs of Canadian cultural 
enterprises.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to say that the Bloc Quebecois fully supports this 
legislation, and this includes the official critic, the hon. member 
for Rimouski-Témiscouata and all members of the Bloc.
<P>
	We know that this proposal is the result of three years of 
discussions conducted by the Department of Communications, 
the Treasury Board, the Department of Finance and Telefilm. 
The process, which started under the Conservative government 
three years ago, has finally led to the tabling of a bill, and I want 
to congratulate the government on acting so promptly in this 
respect. We seldom hear good news from the government 
nowadays, but when we do, I think we should stress the fact, and 
I am delighted to salute this initiative on behalf of all my Bloc 
colleagues.
<P>
	It was high time the government interrupted a bleak series of 
cutbacks that have been a burden on the cultural sector in 
Canada and decided to introduce a measure long awaited by the 
film community.
<P>
	Between 1992 and 1998, the government would have cut 
about $100.5 million from its grants to a film industry in full 
expansion.
<P>
	The measure before the House today is a godsend for the film 
industry which suffers from a glaring lack of capital funding. 
Good projects that never set off the ground because of lack of 
cash are legion.
<P>
	A study by the Department of Canadian Heritage has revealed 
that today, letters of agreement between producers and 
distributors worth a total of between $70 and $100 million have 
not been signed because of lack of money.
<P>
	Furthermore, many very interesting projects never get beyond 
the production stage because they are not judged to be 
commercially viable. This bill will fulfil its purpose if it also 
reminds Telefilm Canada of its original mandate, which is to 
support all Canadian cultural products, not just the commercial 
ones.
<P>
	Like SOGIC in Quebec, Telefilm Canada should give equal 
treatment to commercial films and documentaries, television 
and cinema, as well as female and male filmmakers and 
producers.
<P>
	If it achieves its twofold purpose, Bill C-31 will ease the 
plight of Quebec and Canadian producers who are waiting for 
the government to deliver on another measure that is essential to 
the survival of this industry, and I am referring to a tax credit 
that would replace the existing tax relief for depreciation.
<P>
	A tax credit would directly benefit Canadian film and video 
production, unlike the present tax shelter. It is estimated that 
only 7 per cent of the cost of this tax measure is reinvested in 
Canadian productions as such. The tax credit would not require 
any additional investment.
<P>
	Introduced in Quebec in 1990, the measure has been a real 
success story and truly serves the interests of the Quebec film 
industry.
<P>
	In concluding, I again wish to congratulate the government on 
this very appropriate initiative, and as an incentive to keep up 
the good work, I would like to quote what was said a few weeks 
ago by Pierre DesRoches, outgoing president of Telefilm 
Canada: ``A country that does not have what it takes, either 
intellectually or financially, to make a feature film does not 
deserve the name''.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to reiterate the support of Bloc members 
for this bill and express the hope that the bill will pass all three 
stages today, so that producers who have been waiting for years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4593"> 4593 </A></B>
<P>
will perhaps not see their dreams come true but at least have 
some way to get the money they need to start production.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
remarks on Bill C-31 will be premised on the assumption that 
most of us in this Parliament want to do what is best for our 
country as a whole and for the industries, such as the film and 
television industries which are a part of that entity.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	What is the best role that Parliament can play? My thought is 
we should try to have the most thorough examination possible of 
any subject that forms the basis of a bill before the House.
<P>
	I do wonder if Bill C-31's timetable is going to permit the 
examination the bill merits. It was tabled on Thursday, May 26. 
It was announced on Friday last that second reading would be 
today, Monday, May 30. I found out about it Friday afternoon. I 
do not think that is too much time to gather the facts on a subject 
one is not particularly familiar with.
<P>
	One of the problems the public at large is having with the 
government and Parliament is the perception that decisions are 
made behind closed doors, that government with a majority in 
Parliament can do as it pleases. This House could dispel that 
impression by bringing things into the open. I am not suggesting 
there is anything concealed with Bill C-31, but surely more time 
for consideration would help the debate as well as the public 
perception of it.
<P>
	What should be examined in detail is the whole concept of 
government assistance to industry versus free enterprise. There 
is a role for government to play, especially regarding start-up 
industries.
<P>
	There is, for example, a real lack of venture capital in Canada. 
The government should not get into the business of providing 
venture capital, but it should encourage it through taxation rules 
on capital gains. If the government does get involved with the 
provision of loans or loan guarantees, it should do so for a 
strictly limited period of time. No industry that habitually 
depends on the government for support is going to prosper in the 
long term.
<P>
	As we consider the extent to which the Government of Canada 
guarantees loans, we should be mindful of Canada's deficit and 
debt situation. With the federal debt at the $500 billion dollar 
mark the government must send out a signal of fiscal 
responsibility and a capability and willingness to get things 
under control. Its signal to date is inadequate. While Bill C-31 is 
a relatively minor matter, the loan guarantees it proposes 
exacerbate the government's position on the side of fiscal 
responsibility.
<P>
	On the positive side of this bill we note that similar loan 
guarantee programs exist in several of our provinces. Quebec, 
Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia all have 
programs of guarantees. They have experienced a very low rate 
of default which is good news.
<P>
	It is also noted that the Canadian Film and Television 
Production Association and l'Association des producteurs de 
film et de télévision du Québec both believe this program will be 
of great benefit to the industry. The government has stated it 
believes the program should only exist for a short period of time. 
That is on the positive side of it.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Also on the positive side, there is evidence of real growth in 
the industry in western Canada. Activity in indigenous Alberta 
productions has increased by 360 per cent in the last few years. 
British Columbia has enjoyed similar growth. This increase has 
come without any federally guaranteed loans. It shows that 
relationships between the producers and Canadian financial 
institutions is healthy and is improving. Perhaps this indeed 
demonstrates there is no longer a need for guaranteed loans.
<P>
	This House should look closely at what is happening in the 
industry in western Canada, that the provinces alone are able to 
furnish the guarantees necessary and that this is having a very 
positive effect on the industry. It is growing and succeeding. 
Why then do we have to keep coming in with federal government 
intervention?
<P>
	The other concern I would voice, but on the positive side 
concerns co-operation interprovincially and internationally. 
There are joint production efforts going on between the 
provinces and between our country and others. This also is a sign 
of success. That is where we should allow the industry to 
capitalize on its success and go in that direction.
<P>
	If this program goes ahead another concern is the equitable 
distribution of loan guarantees. This is to be to all of the 
provinces. I would like to know from the government what 
process will be used to ensure an equitable distribution if the bill 
takes effect. If the effect of Bill C-31 is to regionalize the 
industry, to concentrate more development in Ontario and 
Quebec as opposed to the development which is going on in the 
west of Canada then again it is not going to have the effect it 
should be having. If it is going to regionalize, please let us make 
sure this regionalization is not concentrated in one area but is 
spread throughout.
<P>
	The spokesman for the bill in committee mentioned a promise 
to get rid of Telefilm as a crown corporation. I would like know 
from the government what the time schedule is on that and when 
it thinks it should happen. Also, why was the statement made 
that Telefilm could eventually be done away with when the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4594"> 4594 </A></B>
<P>
government is doing more now to jack it up with Bill C-31? I do 
not quite understand that.
<P>
	In conclusion, I encourage the government to introduce bills 
such as Bill C-31 with a little more leeway in the timing to allow 
for more comprehensive preparation for debate. We do agree the 
government has a role to play in encouraging industry, 
particularly fledgling industries in Canada. However, it seems 
to us the role should concentrate on providing appropriate tax 
incentives rather than loans or loan guarantees.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	If in its wisdom and with its majority the government decides 
to proceed with this bill, we caution it to put a time limit in the 
bill, a sunset clause as it were, and to ensure that the 
international financial community fully understands why this 
temporary assistance to this Canadian industry is needed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Are 
there questions and comments?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a matter of 
fact I thought this would be a question and comment period 
myself, but now that I have the floor I will address some of the 
comments made by my hon. friend from the Reform Party.
<P>
	In this House I may be the only member of the Alliance of 
Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists. I have knocked 
around the industry performing professionally since 1966. I can 
recall where film was at that time, where it went and what the 
inhibitions were to its proper and orderly development in this 
country.
<P>
	Film development and the development of a base for film 
production in Canada is much more than loan guarantees, 
although they are part of it. It is much more than tax incentives 
which have not always worked in the past.
<P>
	The requirement has been for a consistent employment of 
both technical and performing talent which would allow the 
medium to continue to grow in this country. It is not enough to 
establish an industry on a one-time basis. What happens is you 
can bring in a lot of mediocre capability and end up with a 
mediocre product and then have nowhere to go from that point 
onward.
<P>
	To this point the development of film drama in Canada with 
the assistance of successive governments has been consistent. It 
has been consistent enough so that the talent base has been 
maintained and cultivated in this country, not just the talent base 
for performers but the talent base for technical people, the 
technical base for all of the ancillary needs of a film industry.
<P>
	It has grown to where it is starting to be recognized as being 
one of the best places to produce films and television programs 
in the world. That was not so in 1966 when producers and 
directors who in the main were from other countries looked upon 
Canada as a place to go to to get cold.
<P>
	I recall a company in Toronto called Film House which 
established one of the most sophisticated and advanced systems 
for film dubbing. It ended up failing because it could not attract 
the volume of work needed to keep afloat.
<P>
	It has been a constant battle, a constant effort, to prove that 
Canadian capability ranks as world class in order to attract the 
kind of-my friend refers to joint efforts with other 
countries-joint effort as a result of assistance to the Canadian 
film industry that allows the rest of the world to look on it as 
being second to none. As hon. members will know, we are now 
in a position where we are able and do produce television series 
and so on which we export to the rest of the world.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Film production as we know is a very individualized effort. 
My friend talked about making sure that these loan guarantees 
were spread across Canada. I have to tell him that film 
production is site specific. It is not relegated to the major 
centres of this country. Feature film is shot in every province of 
Canada but it is done on a film specific basis. I believe that loan 
guarantees in this case are probably superior to tax write offs.
<P>
	I can remember when there were very attractive tax write-offs 
in the film business. A lot of film was produced that never saw a 
screen. It never got farther than the can but it fulfilled the 
requirements for the tax write-off.
<P>
	I would suggest when we are considering assisting this kind of 
venture that we should be taking those elements into account. 
We have reached a certain stage in development. I use the phrase 
talent base. Talent base is a much more broad term than actors as 
I think we will all accept. We have reached a level where 
Americans like to come to Canada because grips, technical 
people, cameramen and women are able to compete on a world 
class second to none. Facilities now have developed to a point at 
which we have some of the largest sound studios in the world. 
We have the best technical people. We have a class that we can 
offer. What happens is that these productions in effect de facto 
become an export for Canada.
<P>
	Support for the performing arts in the past has often taken 
second place to things that some people considered to be more 
important. I have to say that if we look at support for the 
performing arts, whether it is in theatre or film and so on, it has 
an economic spinoff that may be as high if not higher than any 
other venture.
<P>
	If anybody wants to challenge that I would invite them to 
downtown Toronto any night of the week to see all of the 
theatres that are operating at the present time and the spinoff 
effects that has on the economy of metropolitan Toronto for the 
people who work in the service industries, et cetera.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4595"> 4595 </A></B>
<P>
	When you and I go out and pay $65 for a ticket, which we 
think is exorbitant, to see ``Miss Saigon'', we probably buy 
dinner as well and take guests with us. All of that infuses 
economic activity into that area.
<P>
	Assistance to the performing arts, regardless of what it may 
be, is an economically sound venture providing it is done in a 
responsible and proper manner. I heartily endorse it.
<P>
	The other thing we must consider is that we are in competition 
with other countries in the world. Australia was one of the early 
lower populated countries to begin to export film and television 
programs. Over the years it has been very successful. Canada is 
now perhaps behind in the volume of export that goes on. It is 
because these countries support their industry. We can do no less 
in this House than to provide that kind of support. I of course 
endorse this bill wholeheartedly for the reasons I have put 
forward.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	I would hope that every member in this House understands 
that this kind of support is a positive thing. It is an investment. It 
is something we do and we expect excellent sustaining returns.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see the member from Nanaimo 
getting up. Unfortunately it is not questions and comments, so 
he will need unanimous consent to speak again. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> May I clarify why there are no questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is raising a point. 
The rules stipulate that when a bill is being introduced, the first 
three speakers on behalf of the three parties have 45 minutes, but 
there are no questions and comments after their speeches. 
Thereafter, for example the member who just spoke, there is a 10 
minute questions and comments period. Perhaps the member 
wishes to ask questions or make comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you and I thank you for the intercession of my colleague to 
get it straightened out.
<P>
	The last hon. member who spoke painted an almost glowing 
picture of the industry today and that is good. I am very happy 
that is so and it is burgeoning. In view of that, and this is an 
honest question, does the member foresee the day coming when 
such loan guarantees will no longer be required? Is that coming? 
Is the industry successful enough that in the foreseeable future it 
will be able to stand on its own?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, the intent of the legislation is to lead 
toward that point. That is one of the reasons I suppose why we 
would deal in terms of loan guarantees rather than tax 
incentives.
<P>
	We are at the point of near maturity in this industry in terms of 
our ability to compete on a world-wide basis and so on. There 
are still areas where this kind of assistance is desirable and often 
becomes necessary.
<P>
	It is not always. I know the hon. member has pointed out that 
there are productions taking place in western Canada. I was 
involved in one last year which was an ABC movie of the week 
shot in Toronto which had no government funding whatsoever.
<P>
	It is certainly getting there. We have certain things we can 
offer to our friends in other countries, most particularly in the 
United States because of the volume of material that it produces.
<P>
	I think there is still a need to encourage and enhance the 
world-wide recognition of what Canada does and what Canada 
can do. We started it with some assistance. It was an investment. 
It has been paying off. I firmly believe that we will see the time, 
perhaps in our tenure here, where we may grow right through it 
and out the other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question for the member for Halton-Peel relates 
to the fact that parts of the industry appear to be operating quite 
successfully without loan guarantees and other parts seem to 
require it.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Does that not imply somewhat of a defeatist attitude on the 
part of the industry in terms of why this bill is required in this 
format? We first heard about it last week and we are rushing it 
through this week. Is there some reason that the member is 
aware of why we are going through this rapid exercise here?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are some productions where it 
is much easier to raise money. For instance, if Canada is 
shooting an American production that financing will be in place 
but it will be shot as an American production.
<P>
	I refer back to ``JFK: Reckless Youth'', ABC movie of the 
week. That financing came here already in place. However in 
Canada there are many times when one is venturing into new 
areas where that financing is not as readily available and where 
the banks are not forthcoming 100 per cent. Members know how 
ventureless banks are when one gets right down to it.
<P>
	The member would also recognize how expensive film 
production really is. It is a very expensive item. I hope there is a 
recognition that we are not dealing with new money in this issue. 
We are not trying to create new finances or increase the deficit 
and so on. We are simply attempting to direct money in a manner 
that is going to be most effective, if you like, the biggest bang 
for the buck.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4596"> 4596 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I have already expressed I have some concerns about 
the timing on this bill and why it is being presented in the way it 
is.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-31, an act to amend the 
Canada Film Development Corporation Act. Telefilm Canada is 
the better known name for the Canada Film Development 
Corporation.
<P>
	A major stated purpose of this bill is to help the already well 
established producers develop a better relationship with 
Canadian financial institutions. My interpretation of this 
statement in simpler language is very different and I can 
summarize it in three statements.
<P>
	First, this bill is all about access to capital. Second, the bill 
leaves the selection of winners and losers in the hands of the 
Telefilm Canada bureaucracy. Third, this bill assumes that the 
relationship between producers and banks is unhealthy. I would 
like to discuss each of these in turn.
<P>
	This bill is all about access to capital. The problem is that the 
banks will not give anyone any money even though one has an 
order. This is certainly not unique to the film industry in Canada.
<P>
	Second, the bill leaves the selection of winners and losers in 
the hands of the Telefilm Canada bureaucracy. This bill makes 
Telefilm Canada a guarantor for the loan for part of the presale 
agreement to a maximum of 85 per cent with an annual allotment 
of $25 million. Each application would be to a maximum of $1 
million.
<P>
	This will place the producers in the situation of having to sell 
their project twice, once to broadcasting or other companies and 
then to Telefilm bureaucrats. Broadcasters will soon find out 
which producers can sway bureaucrats and which cannot. This 
will tend to distort the whole marketplace. It is one more 
example of the Canadian disease whereby the government 
interferes in the free market. In this case it has the effect of 
backing the strongest players in the market by giving loans to 
the healthiest and most established companies that apply.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	A director for Telefilm at the briefing on the bill stated that 
the money would help the 50 or so strongest Canadian producers 
and that it was not meant for new or fledgling producers. Over 
time this will have a tendency to preclude those with new and 
fresh ideas who are new to the marketplace and those from the 
non-established film centres. This will be counterproductive to 
Canadian culture.
<P>
	Another major concern I have based on the briefing is that 
there are no specific criteria in place to evaluate the applications 
or proposals to Telefilm Canada. That is left open even after the 
bill.
<P>
	Third, the bill assumes that the relationship between 
producers and banks is unhealthy. While this may be true in 
some instances there are instances where it is apparently not 
true, as in B.C. and Alberta examples where indigenous 
productions have increased dramatically in the last few years 
without federally guaranteed loans.
<P>
	The bill is a response to a portion of one industry having some 
difficulty accessing capital. It is important to look at the bigger 
picture since this difficulty is a longstanding Canadian problem 
which the parliamentary standing committee on industry has 
been studying in this session with regard to access to capital for 
small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
	Why is there so little Canadian investment? Can we achieve 
our goals with regard to Telefilm Canada through tax credits or 
through motivating the banks? Both these methods are 
preferable to the intent of the bill which will have bureaucrats 
backing the winners. There is nothing in the bill to preclude a 
grant from Telefilm Canada, a grant giving organization, and a 
guarantee against production. The government may be 
accepting more than 85 per cent, or even 100 per cent, of the 
risk.
<P>
	It is very unlikely this type of legislation would be 
contemplated in Germany, one of our major trading partners. 
Both Canada and Germany have a strong national banking 
system, but I am told by German business people that if they 
have a legitimate order in Germany they will almost certainly 
get the money to produce the order. They have a very good 
system to ensure that capital flows to legitimate business 
propositions. It is a major strength of their country.
<P>
	In one of my previous careers I was a Canadian manufacturer 
with some export sales. Selling with foreign purchase orders 
was preferable to domestic sales because the federal 
government guaranteed the major portion of payment upon 
delivery. A very positive aspect of the federal program was that 
the eligibility rules were clear and certain and applied whether 
one was a new entrant such as us or a long established enterprise.
<P>
	Bridge financing can be a reasonable proposition if it follows 
the principles of equal access to all and encourages good ideas. 
We should be in a position where if we have a good idea we can 
go for it. It makes no sense to have a capped and artificial 
program limit of $25 million. If we want to get into this area as a 
country we have a lot of homework to do and the bill does not cut 
it.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In summary, the strongest and largest film producing areas are 
in Toronto and Montreal. There is concern within the industry 
about equitable distribution of funds for loan guarantees. The 
bill will tend to entrench regionalization for an industry that is 
thriving across Canada without federally guaranteed loans.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4597"> 4597 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadian access to capital is a problem for many industries. It 
is my recommendation that we look very closely at the German 
example for constructive ideas we may want to adopt.
<P>
	Canadians want a strong national identity. This is best 
achieved through a strong cultural community that is allowed to 
develop and grow with minimal government constraint. The bill 
entrenches bureaucrats as arbiters of culture in my view and is 
counterproductive to progressive Canadian culture. There are 
many examples where Canadian banks have provided loans for 
cultural program development. Let us build on this success and 
attack the problem, not the symptom.
<P>
	I am opposed to the bill because it is ill designed and is 
counterproductive to the long term benefit of Canadian culture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
friend is somehow opposed to the people he calls the bureaucrats 
in Telefilm Canada refereeing who will get the support and who 
will not.
<P>
	One question I should ask him is who should referee it? 
Certainly not a group of politicians from committee. Does he 
have any suggestions of who would be better referees than we 
have at the present time?
<P>
	Another question jumped out at me during his speech. He was 
talking about banking systems responding if a company had an 
order. That is very commendable in itself, but what is an order 
for a film? What is an order for something that has yet to be 
created? It is not an order for a bottle of milk.
<P>
	With it goes risk. It is a creative risk. It is all those things 
banks do not like to deal in. That is why it is still necessary to 
help allay some of the risk at least. Each film that is made, each 
television series that is ventured, each pilot show that is done, is 
done with some creative risk. Either it will be a success or it will 
bomb. Some of them bomb. They are not all successful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, as a small manufacturer in the 
furniture business with about a 20 per cent success rate, the 
banks were very used to the manufacturing success in my 
business. That is the best example I can give.
<P>
	Every business has a degree of risk, particularly 
manufacturing. I empathize with the member's comments in 
terms of the banking system and how the access to capital for 
small businesses is not forthcoming in the way we would like to 
see. However to single out this one industry with a bill wherein 
the rules of engagement afterward are not specified is not doing 
our homework.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	As to who should do the refereeing, I gave an earlier example 
of federal bureaucrats administering the export development 
program. They are not insiders. That is my concern with having 
Telefilm Canada be the arbiters. They have all the baggage of the 
established cultural  industry in Canada and will be potentially 
blind to new regional development or new blood that wants to 
come into the industry.
<P>
	It was apparent in the briefing on the bill that this program 
would go to the strong and the established. It was not to go to 
fledglings or new entrants into the business. Who has the biggest 
concern with access to capital? I would say the opposite to the 
apparent intent of the results of the bill.
<P>
	My suggestion on who should referee the whole process 
would be someone not within that group but someone perhaps 
associated with the regular bureaucracy that is used to this type 
of standard setting and this type of allotment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
both the hon. member for North Island-Powell River and the 
member for Halton-Peel. This has actually been a very good 
discussion.
<P>
	In my previous job as mayor of the city of Owen Sound we 
tried to get a centre for the performing arts. It was very difficult. 
On the one hand we had to have a balanced business approach 
and on the other hand we were looking at visionaries, idealists 
and artists, and artists are not necessarily business people.
<P>
	Let us try to imagine a world without artists. Somebody had to 
dream or imagine many of the things we do in life whether it is 
the CN Tower or the Corvette car we drive. Sometimes dreamers 
or imaginers do not know anything about money and sometimes 
they do make mistakes. The government is trying to find a 
medium through Bill C-31 to encourage the arts in Canada.
<P>
	We are rather unique in Canada in our proximity to the United 
States and with the competitiveness from there. All of us are 
aware of what happens in Universal City. We know the Japanese 
are taking large chunks of it. It is a very clean industry. It is a 
great industry. It is a growing industry. It is an industry that 
Canadians could be proud of, with the quite recent ACTRA 
awards. As the hon. member for Halton-Peel has said, we have 
good film makers and a lot of producers coming to Canada. We 
have an environment in major cities, as mentioned before, for 
this kind of climate.
<P>
	Notwithstanding it is not going to be perfect, knowing the 
groups at work here. The hon. member from the Reform Party 
talked about the business part of it and the hon. member for 
Halton-Peel talked about the artistic part of it. Somehow we 
have to merge those two parts. People have to take risks. 
Sometimes they bomb. Sometimes it takes years for things to 
happen, but we need these people and we need to encourage 
them. I am certainly glad we on this side are trying to promote 
that kind of climate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4598"> 4598 </A></B>
<P>
	I know there have been boondoggles in the past. There will 
probably always be, but hopefully we can cut out the loopholes 
and have a climate to create work for our people, expression for 
our people and growth for our country as the great country we 
know it to be.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know exactly what the 
question was, but I do appreciate the fact that we both have the 
same bottom line on this bill which is we want to see Canadian 
culture improved as a result of the cultural industry in Canada. I 
certainly would not want anyone to think that was not the 
direction I was also heading in. I thank the member for his 
comments in that regard.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for questions and comments 
has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-31, an act to amend 
the Canadian Film Development Corporation. I am rising to 
voice my opposition to this bill. It will encourage state 
intervention in what should be a naturally evolving and 
privately funded industry. I will begin by speaking broadly.
<P>
	Culture cannot be bought. It is something which exists 
because people practice it. They live it. They are it. It cannot be 
artificially created or preserved by the state. All cultures thrive, 
evolve and change naturally as the wishes and practices of the 
people change.
<P>
	Although a young country, Canada has a culture and it is one 
to be proud of. We need to define what that culture is. Reform 
has taken a swipe at identifying some components of Canadian 
culture.
<P>
	We believe that Canada's identity and vision for the future 
should be rooted in and inspired by a fresh appreciation of our 
land and the supreme importance to our well-being of 
exploring, developing, renewing and conserving our natural 
resources and physical environment as a part of culture.
<P>
	We believe the people of Canada are this country's most 
valuable resource. The nurture and development of human 
knowledge, skills and relationships are the keys to full 
participation in the knowledge based service economy of the 
21st century.
<P>
	We believe the creation of wealth and productive jobs for 
Canadians are best achieved through the operation of a 
responsible broadly based free enterprise economy in which 
private property, freedom of contract and the operations of free 
markets are encouraged and respected.
<P>
	Furthermore, we believe in the value of enterprise and 
initiative. Governments have a responsibility to foster and 
protect an environment in which initiative and enterprise can be 
exercised by individuals and groups.
<P>
	Looking at Bill C-31, it reminds me of an old tax incentive 
program. I believe it was introduced by the Liberals, but maybe 
it was the past Conservative government; sometimes it is hard to 
distinguish between them. It was a research and development 
tax credit scheme. All of us believe in research and development 
and we want to promote that, but this scheme attracted a number 
of con artists. It was a fiasco. The design of the program caused 
the loss of millions and millions of tax dollars because it was not 
properly handled. It was interfering in what should have been 
more of a private sector enterprise.
<P>
	We believe every individual, group, province and region in 
Canada is entitled to fundamental justice. Fundamental justice 
entitles the people of each region to benefit equally without 
discrimination from participation in Confederation and from the 
programs and expenditures of the Government of Canada. There 
is some doubt as to whether Bill C-31 in fact would be broadly 
based across the country and allow equal access by all 
Canadians.
<P>
	To repeat what I said, Canada although a young country has a 
culture, one we should be proud of. It includes peacefulness, 
fairness, compassion, excellence, tolerance, initiative of spirit, 
an appreciation of the arts, in spite of government red tape, high 
taxes and inefficiency.
<P>
	Any attempt to artificially interfere with the natural progress 
of Canadian culture is destined to become just one more failed 
attempt at social engineering. It is certainly not the role of 
government to dictate what the culture of the population will be 
nor is it appropriate for the government to interfere on the edges 
as is the case with C-31.
<P>
	Much apart from the fundamental issue of state intervention 
within society, the bill itself has some significant problems. The 
loan guarantees this bill would provide will diminish the 
opportunities that would allow new, innovative and evolving 
cultural enterprises to break into the market.
<P>
	Under this bill loans would likely be guaranteed to the 
healthiest existing companies. This will have the dual effects of 
entrenching the existing players in the market, thereby 
establishing an elitism within the industry which will hinder 
change and growth within the industry, and creating an industry 
that finds itself increasingly out of sync with mainstream 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Not only would this bill have a detrimental effect on the 
cultural industry in Canada but there is nothing to suggest that 
loan guarantees are required. For example, the motion picture 
industry in Alberta has had a 360 per cent increase in 
productions over the past few years without federally funded 
guaranteed loans. The results in B.C. are similar.
<P>
	These examples prove there is no requirement for guaranteed 
loans at all. This bill is unlikely to have an  impact on regions 
with fledgling industries like Saskatchewan. It is not that I 
support this type of funding for regional development purposes, 
but not even the regional development argument can provide a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4599"> 4599 </A></B>
<P>
pretence of defence for Bill C-31. One might question whether 
this bill is another of the government's special interest payouts.
<P>
	Furthermore there has been a trend in Canada for more jointly 
funded projects involving Canadian and international 
organizations. Canadian culture can thrive in the private market 
and has demonstrated it can do so. One such example is the 
filming of the Clint Eastwood movie ``Unforgiven''. It was 
filmed in Fort MacLeod, Alberta. The venture involved many 
Canadian production companies, one of which won an Academy 
award for set design.
<P>
	Many Canadian television programs have gone into 
syndication as a result of partnerships with international 
agencies. There is a list of Canadian companies which have 
prospered without federal loan guarantees through this kind of 
international co-operation. They include: Alliance 
Communication Group; Paragon Entertainment Corporation; 
Accent Entertainment; Astral Communications; Cinar Group 
Ltd.; Nelvana Ltd.; Atlantis Media Group; Power Pictures 
Corporation; Post-Production Buzz Inc. These are but a few.
<P>
	These companies are testament to the fact that Canadians can 
compete and thrive in the entertainment industry without 
government interference. It is these kinds of ventures that are 
going to drive the industry and also be most in sync with 
mainstream Canadian culture.
<P>
	Art and culture for its own sake as an industry has its place in 
generating economic growth, but it is not the kind of thing we 
should be looking at to lead an economic recovery and end 
unemployment woes for Canadians. This government is 
constantly telling us, the media, the public, and anyone else who 
will listen that its priority is jobs. This bill will have no effect on 
unemployment. It may make job creation more difficult if the 
government has to shell out money to cover defaulted loans.
<P>
	Some people may be looking to make political mileage by 
smearing our position on Bill C-31 and will say that there is a 
Reform bias against culture. That is clearly not the case. We 
want to remove all government barriers to the promotion and 
growth of Canadian culture. We do oppose government handouts 
to business, even the business of culture.
<P>
	We take the same line with cultural organizations as we do 
with all businesses and special interest groups; that is, you 
cannot expect to get grants, loan guarantees and tax holidays 
from the government indefinitely. All special interest groups 
should raise money from the people they claim to represent or 
they should have a project that is viable enough that the bankers 
will lend them the money.
<P>
	There are many examples of where we would reduce funding 
for these groups in the spending plan we published during the 
last election campaign. Our zero in three package outlined very 
clearly that business and special interest groups of all kinds 
would have to expect less from government in the way of grants, 
loans and loan guarantees.
<P>
	There are some significant omissions in this bill, especially 
where issues of loan criteria and repayment details are 
concerned. Many people in the industry have very grave 
concerns that nepotism is rampant within some of these 
organizations. Many projects are funded on the basis of who 
knows who and family relationships rather than on artistic merit 
and economic potential.
<P>
	The bill omits all explanation of repayment terms. If the 
government is backing 85 per cent of the loan and the loan 
defaults after partial repayment, is the government portion 
considered to be paid off first? Is the government liable for any 
of the interest on the loans when it backs over 50 per cent of the 
value? If not, what is the incentive for the banks to ever accept 
any less than 15 per cent of the risk?
<P>
	It appears this bill was thrown together in a hurry, probably at 
the request of special interests, without completely thinking 
through the implications of such loan guarantees. I guess the 
details will be supplied later, but it does make us question the 
wisdom of supporting such a bill.
<P>
	Voting for this bill and many others like it would be like 
co-signing on a loan when one's account is $520 billion in the 
red. I would not like to be considered as an accomplice to that 
crime against our future generations.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Another concern is that this program will encourage the 
government to underwrite those projects that would not 
ordinarily have been considered as an acceptable risk. That 
means the default rate is likely to be significantly higher than 
the current one which, by the way, is very low. If this happened, 
it would seriously hurt the reputation of the industry which has 
been steadily improving over recent years. As it stands, only 
those projects considered viable receive funding. That seems to 
be a reasonable place to set the standard for funding.
<P>
	I said it once and I will say it again: You cannot buy culture. 
All you will get for trying to do so is a whole lot of debt. If the 
original idea behind this bill was to build a cultural future for the 
next generation, it will succeed in a small way. It will help to 
build a culture of high taxes and crippling debt. It will contribute 
to a society that strips away most of a family income to pay 
interest on a debt the previous generation ran up. It will create a 
culture that exists with no government services, no safety nets or 
social programs because most government revenue will be 
going to debt financing. This will be a country with massive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4600"> 4600 </A></B>
<P>
unemployment since no investment capital will be forthcoming 
to a nation in such a financial mess.
<P>
	This culture of debt and poverty is not the kind of Canada I 
want to create for the next generation of Canadians. That is why 
I must oppose this bill and all bills like it. The accumulation of 
many bills which spend tax dollars unwisely is the reason we 
have accumulated such a huge debt to this point in our history.
<P>
	It is time for government to carry out its most pressing 
responsibility and let the private sector do the same in its area of 
expertise, namely the marketplace. This bill encourages rather 
than discourages state participation in the marketplace. It is 
likely to increase rather than decrease government spending. It 
is likely to discourage rather than encourage new, innovative 
and emerging firms from entering the industry. It perpetuates 
the idea that a nation's culture can be designed by a select few 
and artificially preserved by the state.
<P>
	As a final concern, this bill was only tabled in the House on 
May 26. Without adequate time, it has been brought forward for 
debate on second reading. Over one weekend our caucus has had 
a limited amount of time to study this bill, to discern its 
implications. As we look into it initially, we have some grave 
concerns about the wiseness of supporting such a bill. We will be 
reviewing this bill in detail in our caucus.
<P>
	We are trying to slow down debate on this bill to give it some 
some second thought so that this House can make wise decisions 
in the way we are putting the taxpayers' dollars on the line in 
loan guarantees. After all, it is the taxpayers we represent and in 
the final account they are paying the bills we run up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
friend seems to have a philosophical thing about state 
intervention. It was a major theme at the outset of his speech. I 
hope he will express the same views to his agricultural 
constituents, the farmers in this constituency. I hope he will 
express the same ideas on the formation of the auto pact. I hope 
he will express the same thing to his business constituents on the 
small business development corporation, or with the oil patch on 
the tax investments and the uncollected tax. There is the aircraft 
industry too. I could go on and on.
<P>
	Canada has had a history of a mixed economy. There are many 
good reasons for it. One of the main reasons has been the size of 
the elephant we sleep with to the south of us. It has been 
considered necessary from time to time not with any ideology in 
mind but from a practical point of view to deal with issues as 
they have arisen.
<P>
	State intervention is not new. I am surprised the hon. member 
is treating this as if it were some kind of new conjuring. It is not 
new. I am a little older than the hon. member. Maybe the hon. 
member does not remember the difficulty Canadian musicians 
had in being heard and the almost impossibility of getting 
Canadian productions over radio until the CRTC came into the 
picture. And that was state intervention too, I should say.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Look at what happened. Look at the result. The result of that 
investment is that all across Canada, whether it is in French 
Canada or English Canada, there is a thriving music industry 
today. It largely came about because those people, those 
performers and creators, for the first time were able to have their 
music heard in a large forum.
<P>
	My hon. friend says that the business of granting loan 
guarantees will create an elitism. I respectfully suggest to him 
that this kind of intervention will prevent elitism, If investment 
money is only going to go to the strongest, the survival of the 
fittest, that to me is elitism. It seems to me that one of the 
functions of these loan guarantees is to prevent that.
<P>
	Finally, I would suggest to the member that in spite of the fact 
that he has tried to create this illusion, this is not new money we 
are talking about here. This is a redirection of money. We are not 
adding to or increasing the deficit.
<P>
	I suggest that he take those things into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with real pleasure that I 
respond to the hon. member's concerns and also his questions.
<P>
	First of all, he is absolutely correct. I do come from an 
agricultural riding that depends on agriculture, small business 
and the production of oil. I might tell the hon. member that in 
our agriculture policy we clearly discuss with producers how we 
might save taxpayers' dollars, how we might become more 
efficient in the defence of the industry of agriculture without 
spending more money but in fact spending less, and how we 
would not justify spending for agriculture in areas unless they be 
beyond the control of producers. I would suspect that Bill C-31 
does not affect film producers or the film industry in areas 
beyond their control.
<P>
	I heard from small business that they want an end to grants 
and tax concessions, loan guarantees. It is not fair. If I do not 
happen to be the beneficiary of the program then I am paying my 
taxes for someone who is the beneficiary of the program. I may 
go out of business trying to pay the taxes to keep my competitor 
in business. It is a very unfair appropriation of tax dollars, 
whether it be in the form of grants or in the form of loan 
guarantees or whatever. It is a distortion in the marketplace 
when what helps Peter is paid for by Paul and many times they 
are in the same industry.
<P>
	I know I have the support of small business in my concerns 
with this bill. The oil industry, by the way, has similar concerns. 
I have spoken in this House about the foolishness of spending 
millions, billions perhaps, of taxpayers' dollars on 
megaprojects such as Hibernia when we are not sure that they 
are fundamentally sound projects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4601"> 4601 </A></B>
<P>
	The marketplace has a very good nose for sniffing out where 
investments should be made and where they should not be made 
and government has a notoriously bad reputation for being able 
to sniff out what is a good business venture and what is a poor 
business venture.
<P>
	I want to respond briefly to the hon. member's concerns over 
our giant neighbour to the south and the effect that that has on 
our culture. He mentioned specifically the music recording 
industry and the fact that radio stations in Canada have to play a 
certain percentage of Canadian content in their air time. Perhaps 
it might be even good to review whether that has had a positive 
effect on the recording industry in Canada.
<P>
	I spoke some time ago with the general manager of a radio 
station who felt that this ruling had limited the growth of the 
recording industry in Canada. He said there were very few 
recording artists in Canada who had ever made it until they made 
it big in the U.S. Because of some of the restrictions in our 
recording industry they tended to leave the country and become 
Americans rather than maintain their allegiance to and close 
association with Canada.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not true in all cases. We certainly have many recording 
artists in Canada whom we are very proud of. There is some 
doubt as to whether or not this Canadian content rule has been a 
blessing or a curse to the Canadian recording industry. In some 
ways it has suppressed the industry rather than assisted it. I 
guess time will tell. We certainly do not have tons of 
testimonials to be proud of. Even today most Canadian 
recording artists do not make it big in Canada until they have 
made it big in the U.S.
<P>
	We have to be looking at our own confidence and the fact that 
we do not consider someone to be of any value because 
government dollars go to support them. We expect and measure 
value based on the saleability of what is being produced for us. 
That is the true measure of quality and the true measure of 
culture in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am going to take just a little different approach to this than my 
hon. colleagues who preceded me on both sides of the House.
<P>
	I think that we have to look at this in reality as what it is and 
not be ashamed of it. It is an infrastructure program for the film 
industry. We should not be ashamed of that. If you look at every 
film industry in the world, save the United States or India 
perhaps, there is a good deal of government intervention in the 
film industry of one kind or another.
<P>
	We are trying with this particular bill to make the intervention 
that we have in our film industry work a little bit better.
<P>
	The film industry in Canada, as other members have 
mentioned, because we are so close to the United States with its 
ever pervasive influence in our culture, is particularly important 
because our sense of identity as Canadians, as we all know, is 
very much wrapped up in the reflection of what we see of 
ourselves when we are watching television. Much of our sense 
of Canadianism or what it is to be a Canadian we take from what 
we see on TV every day.
<P>
	In the expanding universe of television of 500 channels of the 
future, when you see people up north living a nomadic or 
semi-nomadic existence in the barren lands of Canada watching 
Detroit television, you think: ``My God, what kind of vision are 
we reflecting of ourselves as Canadians''. Television and film 
production to Canadians reflects the kind of people that we are 
or would want to be. That is of particular importance.
<P>
	We have to break this bill into two separate issues. One is 
television and the production of film for television. The second 
is the production of feature films. All of the infrastructure 
money in the world or loan guarantees in the world is not going 
to make one iota of difference in the feature film industry if you 
cannot get your feature films on to the screen and all of the 
screens in Canada are controlled by Odeon and Paramount out of 
Hollywood.
<P>
	We have to look at this in two very distinct and very real 
approaches, one being feature films and the other being 
television. Canadians have had a good deal of success in 
producing television indigenously here in Canada.
<P>
	I draw hon. members' attention to this interesting fact. We 
have the CBC in English Canada and Radio-Canada in Quebec. 
In Quebec the CBC has far more viewership per capita than the 
CBC in English Canada despite the fact that we spend more 
money on television in English Canada with the CBC. I submit 
that the reason for that is the French CBC has far more 
indigenous programs, far more programming that originates in 
Quebec.
<P>
	In English Canada if you look at CBC's primary productions 
on any evening, what is it? It is a repeat. I know I am getting into 
the CBC thing again, but prime time viewing on CBC is all 
rehashes of American programming.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	If we really want to do something about feature films and 
particularly made for TV production in Canada, our national 
carrier in English Canada should be carrying a lot more 
Canadian originated TV production.
<P>
	That leads us to the question of public money, financing and 
how you get it to how do you get money into the hands of 
entrepreneurs that want to do a movie for TV or feature film. I 
am 100 per cent behind our caucus position. We do not have the 
right to take money from future citizens of Canada, children yet 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4602"> 4602 </A></B>
<P>
unborn, to give to people today so that we can live better today 
than we should.
<P>
	As an hon. member mentioned earlier, when we start weaning 
our economy from government dependence, we have to wean 
our economy slowly. We have to wean the whole economy, not 
just one sector, away from dependence on government grants 
and handouts.
<P>
	This industry is no different than any other industry. It has to 
work on its own independent of government financing. How 
does it go about doing that? One way would be to relax the rules 
whereby people could get public equity participation in a movie.
<P>
	Imagine how difficult it would be with an intellectual 
property if you go to a bank and say: ``I'd like to finance this 
movie''. When you show the script, you are asked: ``Where's the 
bricks and mortar?''. You say there are no bricks and mortar.
<P>
	The information highway, computer programs and software 
are not bricks and mortar either. Somehow we have to allow our 
entrepreneurs to get money from people who are putting hordes 
and hordes of money into RRSPs to invest in ideas in this 
country.
<P>
	The only way we are going to be able to do that is to relax the 
rules in our corporations act so that people are able to invest in a 
movie production. Yes, it would be extremely high risk but the 
rewards would be there.
<P>
	I do not think we can say this is all one way or all another. I 
agree 100 per cent with my colleague who said earlier that we 
should not be using government money to finance any private 
venture. The minute you start using public money in a private 
venture it is no longer a private venture. It is a public venture.
<P>
	On the other hand it is particularly important that we in 
Canada support our cultural industries particularly our made for 
television movies because TV is so much a pervasive part of our 
day to day lives. We see ourselves reflected back from TV with a 
sense of value as to what it is to be a Canadian.
<P>
	If everything we see on television is imported from some 
other part of the world it is going to be even more difficult to get 
a sense of Canadianism, to be together as a nation.
<P>
	I would like to see us import more of the films done in Quebec 
and dubbed into English and vice versa. Perhaps that would be a 
way to start getting some communication going back and forth.
<P>
	This is in some ways a difficult bill for our caucus to wrap 
itself around because of the involvement of public and private 
money but I think on balance it is worthy of support. Again, it is 
not new money. It is a realignment of present moneys. Telefilm 
must be more sensitive to the regions and more accessible to 
producers outside Montreal and Quebec, Toronto and Ontario, 
but I understand that it is working in that direction.
<P>
	We need access to big screen television for our feature films. 
We have got to break the monopoly of Paramount and Odeon to 
get our feature films on to our own screens.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-32, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Excise 
Act and the Income Tax Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to move second reading of Bill 
C-32. This is an important bill which will give legislative effect 
to excise and income tax changes announced over the past four 
months.
<P>
	The primary purpose of the bill is to implement a range of 
measures related to tobacco taxation that were developed to 
combat the very serious smuggling problem facing Canada. 
These measures were announced in the House of Commons by 
the Prime Minister on February 8, 1994 and form an integral part 
of the government's national action plan on smuggling.
<P>
	The legislation includes, among other things, first a national 
reduction in the federal excise tax on tobacco products equal to 
$5 per carton of 200 cigarettes, $5 per 200 tobacco sticks and $5 
per 200 grams of fine cut tobacco as well as a reduction in the ad 
valorem rate for cigars to 50 per cent.
<P>
	Second, additional reductions in the federal excise tax on 
tobacco products marked for sale in a particular province where 
the province has reduced its provincial tobacco tax.
<P>
	Third, an excise tax on tobacco products for export with 
exemptions for legitimate exports for consumption outside 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4603"> 4603 </A></B>
<P>
	Fourth, a health promotion surtax that would increase the rate 
of federal tax paid by tobacco corporations under tobacco 
manufacturing and processing profits.
<P>
	The bill also contains changes to the air transportation tax and 
the goods and services tax that were announced in the budget of 
February 22, 1994. These changes are intended to improve the 
fairness and efficiency of the tax system and to raise revenues. 
The measures undertaken in this respect are:
<P>
	First, changes in the structure of the air transportation tax to 
reduce the tax burden on short-haul domestic and transporter 
flights and to recover a greater proportion of the cost of air 
facilities and services provided by Transport Canada.
<P>
	Second, a reduction in the goods and services input tax credit 
for eligible business meals and entertainment expenses to better 
reflect the personal consumption elements of these expenses.
<P>
	I would like to turn specifically to measures to address 
tobacco smuggling. There was a dramatic increase in tobacco 
smuggling in 1992 and 1993. Strong evidence indicated that 
most Canadian tobacco products that were exported to the 
United States on a tax and duty free basis were smuggled back 
into Canada and sold illegally without payment of federal and 
provincial taxes.
<P>
	By the end of 1993 these contraband products accounted for 
about 40 per cent of the total domestic tobacco market and 
represented a revenue loss to the federal government of more 
than $1 billion and an additional loss of $1 billion to the 
provincial governments.
<P>
	The impact of tobacco smuggling goes far beyond the 
financial costs and the negative impact on the government's 
ability to deliver needed programs and services. Even more 
troubling are the social costs associated with the contraband 
trade. With up to 95 per cent of the contraband tobacco market 
controlled by organized criminal elements, law-abiding 
wholesalers and retailers were forced to watch as their 
legitimate business interests gave way to a climate of increased 
violence and lawlessness. The proceeds from tobacco 
smuggling were being used as the foundation for further 
criminal activity.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	The social costs associated with tobacco smuggling are 
equally troubling from a health perspective. Increased market 
penetration of cheap contraband tobacco effectively reduced the 
average price paid for cigarettes and undermines the 
government's health policy objective of reducing tobacco 
consumption, particularly among youth.
<P>
	To respond to these very serious problems the government 
announced a comprehensive anti-smuggling initiative on 
February 8, 1994. Within the framework of this national action 
plan both the RCMP and Canada customs have undertaken 
increased measures to disrupt the contraband trade in tobacco 
and other products.
<P>
	These organizations have been assigned substantially 
increased resources in terms of both personnel and technical 
equipment and are deploying these resources to intensify 
surveillance and detection along the Canada-U.S. border and to 
more effectively target organized smuggling networks.
<P>
	To facilitate the increased enforcement efforts the 
anti-smuggling initiative includes a national $5 reduction in 
federal excise taxes on tobacco products. This reduction 
narrows the price differential between contraband and legal tax 
paid on cigarettes across Canada, thereby weakening demand 
for contraband and reducing the incentive to smuggle in all 
provinces.
<P>
	Recognizing that the smuggling problem is more pronounced 
in some parts of the country, the government has extended an 
offer to match any provincial tobacco tax reduction in excess of 
$5 up to a maximum total tax reduction of $10 per carton of 200 
cigarettes. This bill implements the federal tax matching 
reductions in response to provincial tax reductions undertaken 
in Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and 
Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The government is very concerned that tobacco corporations 
not derive any benefit from the difficult decision to reduce 
tobacco taxes. Toward this end the bill imposes a new health 
promotion surtax that will increase by 40 per cent the corporate 
tax rate in respect of tobacco manufacturing and processing 
profits. This surtax will apply for a three-year period and will be 
used to fund the largest anti-smoking campaign in the history of 
the country.
<P>
	In response to the role that export shipments have played in 
the contraband market, the bill reimposes an excise tax on 
exported tobacco products. An export tobacco tax equal to $8 
per carton of 200 cigarettes is designed to more closely control 
export shipments and prevent any recurrence in the level of 
shipments that would effectively supply the contraband trade. 
At the same time the bill makes adequate provisions for 
manufacturers to undertake legitimate export shipments 
intended for bona fide consumption outside of Canada.
<P>
	In addition to these direct changes to excise and income taxes, 
the bill also contains a number of related measures that are 
designed to complement the new tax measures and ensure their 
long term effectiveness. At the time the national $5 reduction in 
federal excise taxes was announced, the government wanted to 
ensure that the reduced rates of tax were immediately passed on 
to consumers at the retail level, complementing enforcement 
measures by weakening the demand for contraband tobacco 
products.
<P>
	Consequently the government has undertaken to pay a full 
inventory rebate to all wholesalers and retailers in respect of 
their inventories of tobacco products on February 8, 1994. 
Where federal excise taxes are further reduced to match a 
provincial tobacco tax reduction, wholesalers and retailers are 
eligible for an additional  inventory rebate to the extent that 
their inventories of cigarettes exceed a certain threshold 
amount.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4604"> 4604 </A></B>
<P>
	The use of threshold levels is designed to protect the interest 
of those persons holding large inventories of cigarettes while 
limiting the government's total fiscal exposure.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Administration of the rebate program is being conducted by 
Revenue Canada and is already well under way with retailers 
and wholesalers from across the country filing their inventory 
rebate claims and awaiting payment of the appropriate amounts.
<P>
	Inventory rebates cannot be paid however until such time as 
this bill which provides the Minister of National Revenue with 
explicit legislative authority to issue amounts in payment of 
inventory rebate claims is approved by Parliament and receives 
royal assent.
<P>
	Ensuring that retailers and wholesalers receive these amounts 
as soon as possible is one of the main reasons we are attaching 
such a high priority to the bill. In view of the variable federal tax 
reductions undertaken by the federal government in response to 
specific provincial tax reductions, the bill contains provisions 
that are designed to ensure payment of appropriate federal 
excise taxes and also to deter any interprovincial diversion of 
tobacco products.
<P>
	First, the bill provides for the collection of federal excise tax 
differential where tobacco products marked for sale in one 
province are sold for any purpose other than personal 
consumption by a consumer in that province. Thus if a 
wholesaler or retailer sells products to a person in another 
province, the seller will be required to pay an amount equal to 
the additional federal excise tax that would apply if there had 
been no provincial tax reduction.
<P>
	Second, the bill contains provisions making it an offence 
subject to a fine for any person to sell or offer for sale tobacco 
products marked for sale in one province to a consumer located 
in another province. The amount of the fine is set at no less than 
$1,000 and not more than three times the additional federal 
excise tax that would have applied to the tobacco products had 
there been no provincial tobacco tax reduction.
<P>
	The combined effect of these two measures will be to 
substantially impair the potential for interprovincial diversion 
of tobacco products from low tax jurisdictions. While the 
collection of the additional federal excise tax can be enforced 
immediately, the offence provision cannot come into force until 
such time as the bill receives royal assent.
<P>
	Also in response to provincial tax reductions, the bill contains 
provisions to deal with the sale of unmarked tobacco products 
on Indian reserves in Ontario and Nova Scotia. Both these 
provinces require that tobacco products sold on reserve free of 
provincial tobacco taxes not be marked. Matching federal tax 
reductions on the other hand are based on distinct provincial 
markings.
<P>
	To reconcile these different marking requirements and to 
ensure that unmarked tobacco products sold on reserve to 
Indians in Ontario and Nova Scotia are taxed at the reduced 
federal rates that would otherwise apply to marked tobacco 
products in each province, the bill contains provisions that allow 
for the sale of unmarked tobacco products at the reduced rates of 
federal excise tax to specially licensed wholesalers and retailers 
in each province.
<P>
	Finally, the bill amends the fines in the Excise Act for 
possession or sale of tobacco products on which federal taxes 
have not been paid. Because these fines were based on the 
previous rates of federal excise tax, this amendment is necessary 
to maintain the fines at their former minimum and maximum 
amounts.
<P>
	These proposed legislative amendments are a very important 
part of the government's action plan to combat tobacco 
smuggling. Together with increased enforcement, these 
measures form an integrated approach that provides the 
foundation for a long term solution to the smuggling problem.
<P>
	I would like to turn to other measures in the legislation, the air 
transportation tax. Bill C-32 also implements changes to the air 
transportation tax announced in the federal budget of February 
22, 1994. The structure of the air transportation tax is being 
altered to reduce the tax burden for short haul, domestic and 
transporter flights and to recover a greater proportion of the cost 
of air facilities and services provided by Transport Canada.
<P>
	To reduce the tax burden and short haul, domestic and 
transporter air travel, the current $10 flat tax component will be 
reduced to $6.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	This measure addresses the concerns expressed in recent 
years by carriers providing short distance air transportation 
services to smaller communities that the tax places too heavy a 
burden on short distance travellers. To enhance the cost 
recovery with respect to air facilities and services the maximum 
air transportation tax on domestic and transborder air travel is to 
increase from $40 to $50. The tax on international travel is also 
increased from $40 to $50 where the transportation is purchased 
in Canada and from $19 to $25 where the transportation is 
purchased outside Canada for travel to Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4605"> 4605 </A></B>
<P>
	These new rates apply to tickets purchased outside Canada 
that include an international departure from Canada on or after 
May 1, 1994 except where the tax has been paid prior to that date 
and to tickets purchased in Canada on or after May 1, 1994.
<P>
	A third measure relates to the goods and services tax. The bill 
also contains an amendment to the goods and services tax. As 
announced in the February 22 budget, the portion of the goods 
and services tax paid on business meals and entertainment 
expenses which may be recovered as an input tax credit is being 
reduced from 80 per cent to 50 per cent.
<P>
	This change will better reflect the personal consumption 
element of these expenses and is consistent with the reduction in 
the income tax deduction for business meals and entertainment 
expenses from 80 per cent to 50 per cent. The reduced rate will 
apply to expenses in respect of meals and entertainment 
consumed or enjoyed after February 1994.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-32 is an important bill. It enacts a 
number of measures related to tobacco taxation that will make a 
very important contribution to eliminating smuggling as a 
significant national problem, as well as implementing other 
excise tax changes from the government's first budget.
<P>
	While some of the tobacco related measures have been 
implemented on the basis of a ways and means motion, two very 
important measures, the ability to pay inventory rebates to 
wholesalers and retailers and the offence provisions in respect to 
interprovincial diversions, will not take effect until the bill 
receives royal assent. I would, therefore, urge my colleagues to 
give speedy passage to the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
follow up on the last comment of the government's 
representative. It is obvious that people will receive no refund 
until the bill is passed. Let me explain.
<P>
	Bill C-32 proposes legal measures resulting from the 
announced decrease in taxes on tobacco products. Some 
storekeepers had inventories for which they had paid the higher 
amount and most of them have had to absorb the cost of that 
decrease in taxes, except those who had 5,000 cartons of 
cigarettes or more for example. It is those people who would 
now receive inventory rebates.
<P>
	This is what the parliamentary secretary was talking about 
when he said they would not receive any inventory rebate until 
the bill is passed. That being said, I do not think this is reason 
enough to rush this bill which contains many elements.
<P>
	There is no need to remind you of the improvisation and 
confusion that surrounded the implementation of the action plan 
against smuggling. It was difficult to convince some provinces 
to join in; I am sure my colleagues from the other side remember 
it quite well.  Toward the end of the process, many steps were 
taken just to please them and to ensure a greater consensus.
<P>
	And now, as is often the case, the necessary measures are 
presented to the House in an omnibus bill. One of these 
measures deals with transportation. The government probably 
thought that this plan against smuggling would pass easily since 
it had been requested from the very beginning of the session. 
They thought that members of the Bloc Quebecois would 
support it, and that they could, discreetly, try to add something a 
bit more controversial, something dealing with air 
transportation.
<P>
	I will come back to this measure which, at first glance and if 
we do not get satisfactory explanations in committee, might 
rankle somewhat the Official Opposition.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Let us come back a bit to the smuggling phenomenon. How 
did it happen? Everybody remembers how widespread it had 
become. There had been a relaxed attitude about it for years. To 
give you an example, in my riding of Témiscamingue, which is 
not in the Far North, but north of the main urban centres, it took 
a while before smuggling arrived. But last year it was amazing 
to see how easily smuggling networks had taken over. They 
provided a form of service which, up to a point, could be seen as 
a model of efficiency. They had home delivery. Customer 
service was exemplary, and the networks controlled two thirds 
of the tobacco market, which is enormous.
<P>
	It took a long time before we could make the government do 
something. It was only after the federal government realized 
that it was maybe losing a billion dollars a year that it decided to 
act. It also took many demonstrations. You probably recall the 
MATRAC in Quebec which openly defied the government	and the RCMP. It organized demonstrations, highly publicized and largely covered by the media, to sell cigarettes to the public at prices that even smugglers could not match. These small business people 
<P>
	Of course, there were winners. Everybody involved in 
smuggling made money out of it. We can even say that 
consumers who bought tobacco products on the black market 
benefited from it and the companies which manufacture these 
products have certainly not seen their sales drop.
<P>
	In the last few years, cigarette prices were on the increase. 
Governments had decided to use price as a deterrent to curb the 
use of a product which had harmful effects on consumers' 
health. We were certainly not in favour of dropping cigarette 
prices in order to increase consumption. Far from it! That never 
was a motive of ours. On the contrary. We always maintained 
that such a measure had to be accompanied by an active 
education campaign on tobacco use-the effects of which were  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4606"> 4606 </A></B>
<P>
known-but what was needed then was perhaps a more 
convincing anti-smoking campaign.
<P>
	Thanks to smuggling, tobacco products had become very 
cheap and easily accessible to just about anyone due to the 
extent of the distribution network. In my riding, smuggled 
cigarettes could easily be found in high schools and CEGEPs. 
They were quite visible. You will remember that, at one point, 
the government had thought that, by having different packaging 
for export, it would solve the problem, and that people would be 
embarrassed to be seen with them, but such was not the case.
<P>
	I remember that during the Christmas break, when I met with 
friends in public places, I would for the fun of it check the 
number of smuggled cigarette packs on the tables, as opposed to 
legal ones. Many people had bought cigarette cases in which 
they hid their smuggled cigarettes; I would say that every other 
package was smuggled.
<P>
	It is estimated that cigarette smuggling accounted for 40 per 
cent of the market in the Atlantic provinces, over 60 per cent in 
Quebec; that is a lot. In Ontario, it was 35 per cent and 15 per 
cent in Western Canada. Those were the statistics just before the 
government took action. It means that the problem has spread 
from east to west, and that it is still relatively minor in western 
Canada where provincial governments have not had to take the 
same measures as Quebec, Ontario and three Atlantic provinces 
to curb this problem which has not yet taken hold there. I am not 
certain though that they will be immune from it much longer.
<P>
	Ottawa is an important player in all this, because multiple 
jurisdictions were involved and things had to be done on 
protected territories; smugglers used tax-free zones to get their 
goods through. They even used some protected areas to establish 
warehouses. The federal government, which had jurisdiction 
over that, had to intervene. Originally, this was seen as a very 
local problem concentrated in the Montreal area. The problem 
grew and finally was seen as a provincial problem, but here in 
Ottawa, it was perceived as a regional problem. After the 
election, every weekend that I went to my riding, people spoke 
to me about the size of this phenomenon and I can tell you that I 
heard a lot about it during the election campaign.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	My riding is close to Ontario, separated from it only by a lake. 
Because Ontario did not follow the federal plan, I can tell you 
that there was tremendous pressure on the Ontario side; many 
people crossed to our area to buy packs of cigarettes legally in 
our stores, since the tax where they lived was higher. A sort of 
negotiation went on before Quebec, Ontario and the other 
provinces came up with a joint plan, because clearly it would not 
be effective in the long run if everyone did not come on side or 
the provisions were not acceptable to all.
<P>
	I told you that that market had become too big, Mr. Speaker; 
let us look at estimates of the contraband market from the 
departments of Finance and Revenue. In 1993, 2.1 million 
Canadians consumed 90 to 100 million cartons of smuggled 
cigarettes, with a retail value of $4.5 billion. That is awful. Of 
course you can tell me that this problem has been partly solved. 
Yes, partly; we must say that the plan has been very effective in 
some respects. Lower taxes strongly discouraged the whole 
market and the underground economy related to it. We must 
learn lessons from that. There are some things to keep in mind.
<P>
	I was just telling you that price was used to deter or strongly 
discourage people from consuming that kind of product. It has to 
be done but we must also know the limits of such a system, in 
that we cannot enforce it or do the legal follow-up, due to all 
sorts of problems that we know very well.
<P>
	In 1988, cigarettes were $25 a carton. From 1988 to 1993, in 
the matter of five years, during a period when, let us not forget, 
Canada had a strong anti-inflationary monetary policy-which 
it is still pursuing-and inflation was low, the price per carton 
went from $25 to $48, a $23 increase. That is a substantial, 
almost a 100 per cent increase. All the while, the price of 
cigarettes remained constant in the United States.
<P>
	There were some exports, because Canadian companies do 
export to the American market, although not all that much. But 
all of the sudden, exports to the United States increased 
phenomenally. It took us some time to realize that these goods 
were making their way back into Canada to be resold here. 
Domestic sales were dropping, while exports were 
skyrocketing. That was proof, obvious proof, that something 
was wrong.
<P>
	We dragged our feet and dragged them some more. We did not 
use the legal measures available to us at the time to exercise 
control over this situation, which eventually deteriorated to the 
point where we had no other choice but to cut taxes. Now, we end 
up with a less than positive product, in fact one which is harmful 
to your health, being easily accessible at a cut price on the 
market. You can change the colour of cigarette packs and change 
the packaging any old way, price remains the main disincentive. 
We must admit that prices, being as low as they are, if they are 
not a major incentive, are not much of a disincentive either. We 
must be well aware of that. This is not a product we want to 
promote.
<P>
	I can remember the Prime Minister saying these measures 
would only be temporary. The bill says very little on the subject, 
and I cannot blame its authors for not wanting to make their 
intentions known just now, but it might be interesting just the 
same to know a little more about the cigarette price increases 
planned for the next few years.

<P>
	That is why this bill, because of some aspects I will address in 
a little more detail, raises questions we have the right to ask in 
committee and to examine with experts in the field and with the 
people involved. It is not true that, because we waited two 
months for the bill to be tabled, it will go through quickly 
because we are told we must now quickly repay the retailers who 
had large inventories.
<P>
	Why are they concerned about it now? They were not at the 
time. They wanted one month and then two months. Why all of a 
sudden, just as they are introducing a transportation measure 
that may be controversial? Let us look at this plan which was 
announced in this House by the Prime Minister. His plan had 
several elements. The first dealt with law enforcement, which 
would clearly have been insufficient by itself, but it was a global 
plan to increase the number of customs and RCMP officers. 
They were supposed to hire 350 extra customs and Revenue 
Canada employees. Increasing control measures was one 
element of the plan.
<P>
	The second element was to reduce tobacco taxes. The federal 
government reduced federal taxes by $5 plus an extra dollar 
depending on what the provincial governments did. In the case 
of Quebec, for instance, this allowed for a $11 cut. The Quebec 
government reduced taxes by $11 and the federal government by 
$10. Federal taxes were limited to $10 per carton.
<P>
	We also implemented measures concerning tobacco-product 
manufacturers. Under pressure from the Government of 
Ontario, towards the end when it seemed very reluctant to get 
involved in this process, an export tax of $8 per carton was 
introduced. This tax or this kind of tax had been tried a few years 
before and turned out to be so inefficient that we had to retreat a 
few months later because of the powerful lobby of the 
manufacturing companies that threatened to move their 
operations abroad.
<P>
	They now seem to be telling us that this measure could be 
implemented. Whenever they talk to us about it, they always 
talk about a tax of $8 per carton. What they forget to tell us is 
that, in fact, it will apply very rarely since estimated production 
before smuggling, that is the first 3 per cent of production sold 
abroad, including on the U.S. market, will not be subject to this 
tax. Its only purpose will be to prevent exports from coming 
back into the country.
<P>
	It would be interesting to make a more in-depth review of this 
bill in committee, to look at its merits and to see if it is merely a 
show-off to comfort some who thought that this measure alone 
would be sufficient to eliminate smuggling. A promotion surtax 
was also included, a surtax on profits made by tobacco 
companies which was to be invested in a campaign for the 
promotion of health. I will come back to this, which was the 
original intention. However, these measures are not part of the 
proposed legislation today.
<P>
	There were also measures against tobacco consumption, 
including regulations to limit access to vending machines and 
other similar measures designed to deter people from smoking. 
This was the initial plan. Now, we have this bill. The first part of 
the legislation, which specifically concerns the fight against 
smuggling, contains a series of measures. As I recall, there are 
eight of them.
<P>
	As I said earlier, there is also a reduction in the excise tax, 
which means a reduction in the price, since the GST applies to 
the excise tax and the amount of GST on that tax is reduced. This 
is one aspect. There is a further reduction for provinces willing 
to go beyond a certain amount, as is the case for Ontario, 
Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward 
Island. As far as I know, this is an option which remains open to 
other interested provinces. This is the type of issue for which we 
would like to get answers when the Standing Committee on 
Finance will look at this legislation.
<P>
	There is also the imposition of an excise tax and offence 
provisions that apply where tobacco products taxed at a reduced 
federal excise tax rate in one province are diverted to another 
province.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	We are trying to put an end to some illegal activities carried 
out this time by well known and registered retailers, who make 
up another kind of smuggling ring.
<P>
	Another provision in this bill ensures that unmarked tobacco 
products sold to Indians on reserves in Ontario and Nova Scotia 
are taxed at the same reduced federal excise tax rates as marked 
tobacco products sold to other consumers in those provinces. 
There is nothing wrong with this provision.
<P>
	There are also provisions for rebates of excise tax paid on 
tobacco products in stock when federal excise tax rates were 
reduced. I want to lay emphasis on this last issue, because it 
means that the government will compensate retailers who had 
tobacco products in stock at that time, who had bought the 
products at the old price and now have to sell them legally at the 
new price.
<P>
	Since the new price is lower than the old one, storekeepers 
must sell at a loss. Now the government tells them that it is 
going to compensate them. What it does not say is that it will 
only compensate retailers with an inventory of 5,000 cartons or 
more.
<P>
	In my own riding, I have small retailers, corner store owners, 
small grocers, and even a distributor who does not have 5,000 
cartons in stock. For them, the losses are significant. In Quebec, 
there has been a $10 federal tax reduction. That means that a 
carton now sells for $10 less.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4608"> 4608 </A></B>
<P>
	A corner store owner who has 50 or 60 cartons in stock stands 
to directly lose $500 to $600. It may not seem like much to you. 
But these people who have been fighting against smuggling 
rings for three, four or five years have suffered heavy losses 
already. And they will suffer even more. They will also be the 
ones to pay for the plan. Nobody will say it out loud but this is 
the price they have to pay for the fight against smuggling. Some 
retailers pay more than others. For an inventory of 1,000 or 
1,500 cartons in Quebec, you have only to multiply by ten to 
know what the losses are. And they are substantial.
<P>
	We received a great many calls in the days following the 
announcement of the anti-smuggling plan, especially since the 
Quebec government chose to compensate all the retailers, 
whatever their inventory, via its forms and a method it considers 
rather simple. Thus, the information is available. The 
information is not impossible to find. It exists and it is available, 
and we could have agreed to use the information that the Quebec 
government has on the inventories of all Quebec retailers to 
determine the compensation.
<P>
	We could have had an agreement. These people who speak 
almost daily about reducing overlapping almost never act on it. 
Here they had an opportunity to easily compensate retailers, 
using the list already established by the Quebec government. 
But they did not do it.
<P>
	Since that plan to fight smuggling costs about $300 million- 
which would have been higher if we had decided to compensate 
small retailers also-we ask them to bear a significant part of 
those costs. I am sure that Liberal members also received 
complaints from retailers in their ridings. Of course, business 
went up for many retailers in the days after the plan took effect. 
Higher tobacco sales helped make them accept a measure they 
never liked.
<P>
	But nevertheless, it is a blatant injustice for them. Of course, 
we could say that they sometimes win when there are small tax 
increases, but they never get such a break all at once. Although 
many retailers had reduced their inventory because of lower 
sales due to smuggling, many of them still had a large number of 
cartons in stock and they had to pay the price. However, the 
government is not in a hurry to give them a refund. Only those 
retailers who had 5,000 cartons or more in stock will be 
compensated. And now the government says: ``We have to pass 
this bill quickly because it is one of our highest priorities''.
<P>
	But what about small retailers? Are they not a priority for this 
government? That is a question we have a right to ask. I will not 
elaborate any further on the sixth measure because I am certain 
that, at committee stage, some people will come to explain to 
government members the impact that this measure had on their 
businesses and to tell them what $1,000, $2,000 or $5,000 can 
mean in a year to a small convenience store. God knows we have 
many of them, and all kinds of other stores where cigarettes are 
sold, like drug stores, and  food stores that have somewhat larger 
inventories and that suffered substantial losses.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	In that regard, it would take much more specific reasons to 
justify the arbitrary figure of 5,000 and the fact that the federal 
government is not acting like the Quebec government which, 
while wanting to fight against smuggling, chose to reimburse 
everybody. It did not choose to make small retailers pay the cost 
of it.
<P>
	The seventh measure is an adjustment to the fines applicable 
for illegal possession or sale of unstamped tobacco products. Or 
course, these measures are good, if they are applied.
<P>
	The eighth measure is the imposition of a surtax on tobacco 
manufacturing profits. That surtax looks good. It looks like it 
affects the companies themselves. But we must understand that, 
with the price reduction, it will be very easy for manufacturers 
to pass the cost of that surtax on to consumers. That is not to say 
that we should necessarily be against that measure, but the 
government should be honest and say that this is an indirect way 
to admit that it has not reduced prices as much as it seems. It 
looks good to say that manufacturers will pay for part of it, 
whereas in fact it will be very easy for them to pass this burden 
on to consumers, especially since no mechanism is provided to 
prevent that.
<P>
	The government wanted to look good saying: ``See, those who 
profited from it, the manufacturers, will have to pay their share 
of the cost of the fight against smuggling''. Except that, 
ultimately, the manufacturers will have the last word in being 
able to easily pass it on to consumers.
<P>
	I would like to come back to another point. I remember taking 
part in a few discussions or open-line programs where people 
would say things like: ``We oppose that measure because it will 
be costly, and will have a terrible impact on public health''. I 
could understand their concerns but, at the same time, I thought 
and many people thought that the black market had taken on 
such huge proportions and was undermining public trust in the 
whole tax system to such an extent that even this measure would 
not be enough to restore that trust. Tough action was needed to 
regain control because the distribution networks were very well 
established. Apparently, those networks are now being used 
more and more to sell liquor. And the black market racketeers 
will find other products to sell. Had we left them one more 
product, because it was a sure market and for all kinds of good 
reasons, consumers would have felt justified to take advantage 
of the bargain. A frightening variety of products could have been 
smuggled through this network.
<P>
	Those were a few of the arguments served up, that it made 
sense for economic reasons, but the government understood 
their point of view and told them that it would clearly define a 
policy or a prevention campaign in conjunction with that. The 
government and the Prime  Minister himself said that they 
would invest-the money raised with the surtax-directly in a 
health promotion campaign against tobacco use. And the Minis-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4609"> 4609 </A></B>
<P>
ter of Health said the same thing. It pleased her to reassure 
people by saying the same thing.
<P>
	In concrete terms, and I am referring to a surtax which could 
generate around $200 million in revenue, I am not sure-far 
from it-that we have seen the effects of such a promotion 
campaign. If so, I would be interested to know what they are. 
The best way to assess the effectiveness of something is to ask 
whether people are aware of it. I am rather close to everything 
that is going on in government, but I do not really feel the 
concrete effects of that. People are saying very little to me about 
it. Professionals from the health field, from regional health 
offices in my area have asked me: ``When will this campaign 
start? What form will it take?'' Their input has not been sought, 
and they are still waiting.
<P>
	But we too are still waiting to see which direction the 
government is going and what the minister of health will do to 
make sure that she gets the amounts that she has been told she 
would receive from the surtax. ``Directly'', Mr. Speaker, it 
seems to me that it cannot be clearer. These amounts should be 
linked to that. Well, it is simple for her, because she has a source 
of revenue. Now, we would like to know how she will use it.
<P>
	I want to quote from the speech that the Prime Minister made 
in this House: ``The amounts thus collected will allow the 
funding of the most important campaign against tobacco ever 
seen in Canada''. We are waiting. It will certainly be one of the 
things that are yet to come.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	There are two other measures in that bill. The first one, 
probably the less controversial one, was announced in the 
budget. The government has reduced the income tax deduction 
for business meals expenses that was claimed by business 
executives or independent workers. That deduction is reduced 
from 80 per cent to 50 per cent. The GST will be adjusted 
accordingly. The GST rebate that was claimed by those people 
for meals expenses has also been adjusted in the same 
proportions. It is a minor adjustment. We can argue whether the 
rate should be 80 per cent or 50 per cent, which was a difficult 
decision. There are many aspects involved in the budget.
<P>
	A very interesting study indicated who would be directly 
concerned by that measure, how they would be and what 
category of meals would be affected. I am convinced that the 
authors of the study would be very happy to give explanations to 
the committee and to examine the impact of the measure in a 
more detailed fashion in order to see who is affected, who was 
anticipated to be affected and who will be, because the measure 
is now in effect and we are able to know a little bit more. That 
would be an interesting thing to do.
<P>
	We are told that we must act quickly, that time is running out 
and that we must repay retailers who have stocks of 5,000 or 
more. Some say that the opposition is ungrateful, that it wants to 
delay the passage of the bill and that it wants to prevent the 
government from paying retailers back. The question might 
have been put on the table much earlier if their concern really 
was as we were told.
<P>
	The third measure contained in the bill, which comes out of 
the blues, deals with the tax on air travel.
<P>
	These objectives were announced: the review of the air 
transportation tax in order to reduce the tax burden on short haul 
domestic and transborder flights, as well as to recover a greater 
proportion of the cost of facilities and services provided by 
Transport Canada.
<P>
	Worse, they have the nerve to include short haul flights to 
smaller communities. Coming from the regions, we are going to 
examine thoroughly what this means. Right now there is a flat 
tax. It works like this: you pay a flat tax of $10 for an airline 
ticket on the domestic market. Add to this a tax of 7 per cent on 
the ticket value, up to a maximum of $40.
<P>
	Now, they say that they will lower the flat tax to $6, but that 
they will maintain the tax of 7 per cent. However, the maximum 
is raised to $50. Take the case of a region like 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue. An airline ticket from 
Rouyn-Noranda to Ottawa costs about $525, $530. Before, the 
maximum tax was $40. Today, with the new cost structure, we 
are talking of $41.
<P>
	The objective is to reduce the tax burden imposed on domestic 
flights, particularly on short-distance flights to smaller towns. 
We can also go from Ottawa to Rouyn-Noranda. I am told that 
my tax burden has been reduced with this increase from $40 to 
$41. At the same time, I am told that this measure will give rise 
to a recovery of $21 million this year and of $44 million next 
year. I am also told that this is supposed to benefit small towns 
and people living in those towns. I think that the members 
opposite do not really understand what regional development is 
all about. I think they did not look at that provision for very 
long.
<P>
	The costs are higher in some areas. Sometimes, it costs $600 
or $700, and it is often more expensive to go from Montreal, 
Quebec or Ottawa to some areas, in Quebec, than to fly from 
Montreal to Paris. The upper tax limit on those tickets, which 
was $40 before, will now be $48 or $50. One might say that it is 
only an $8 or $10 difference. However, it is a lot of money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4610"> 4610 </A></B>
<P>
	As if deregulation had not hurt enough. It was supposed to 
have no impact on airfares, but the contrary is now obvious. It is 
more expensive for me to return to my riding than to go to Paris. 
It does not make any sense.
<P>
	It is far from certain that we will let that be passed rapidly. 
The Minister of Transport is in the House. He should take good 
note that he will have to explain to us what he really intends to 
do about this rate structure.
<P>
	Only flights between $100 and $400 will benefit from this 
measure, that is the Montreal-Toronto and Montreal-Quebec 
runs or other popular short distance flights. Only those flights 
will benefit from it.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Do not try to tell me that with the structure I have in front of 
me-unless my information is erroneous, but it comes from the 
Department of Finance-travellers to the regions and to smaller 
communities, as it is said here, will benefit from it. Maybe for 
some, going from Toronto to Montreal is travelling to a smaller 
community. However, in our region, travelling to small 
communities would mean going to Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d'Or, 
Chicoutimi and the like, which we consider major centres. Plane 
tickets to those places already cost $600 or $700 and they will 
increase by $8 to $10, though only by one dollar in my region. I 
am lucky, the price of my flight to Rouyn will only be raised by 
one dollar. To go to the neighbouring riding, that of my 
colleague for Val-d'Or, perhaps I would have to pay $8 more. 
Some might say that we do not have to worry much, since the 
House pays some of our travel and other costs.
<P>
	Our business people travel, they get around, they have to go 
and represent their companies. Besides, people often travel for 
Quebec government departments and go from our region to 
Quebec City. This will increase operating costs for the other 
government. All individuals who want to travel by air will have 
to pay for these costs. As if by chance, this comes in an 
innocent-looking bill to fight smuggling, we are told. In very 
small writing, in the second to last measure, not the last 
one-often we look at the beginning and at the end-we see that 
there will be changes. The explanatory note in the bill says: 
``The amendments to the air transportation tax reduce the tax 
burden on short-haul domestic and transborder flights and shift 
the tax burden to long-haul flights''.
<P>
	They forget to make the connection with the price and the tax 
is related to the price. I could even discuss how this compares to 
the former system and how it penalizes the regions as well. I 
think that they were afraid to open this debate for fear that we 
would show the government members the impact of 
deregulating air transport on the regions. I am sure that some 
Liberal members, when they see this, will have trouble 
explaining it to their constituents. I am thinking of my 
colleagues from northern Ontario. How come they put up with 
such a thing?
<P>
	We will not let this be rushed through. It will go to committee 
and we will take a thorough look at it in committee. We can work 
quickly but thoroughly, that is what we will do, but at this stage, 
with no major amendments, there is no question of the Bloc 
Quebecois supporting this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I very much 
appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on Bill C-32. One 
of my colleagues will deal with the excise tax in the area of 
tobacco. I intend to cover air transportation and the goods and 
services tax. I certainly will do that in the next seven minutes.
<P>
	What I would like to say first deals with air transportation tax. 
We have to deal with the principle that we should pay as we go. 
We should look at crown corporations and the aviation industry. 
If we believe there is a sound principle that we should pay as we 
go and as customers of the service, we should support the tax and 
the formula that are in place. We should support the fact that the 
ceiling has now been raised to $50. We are going to bring in 
some $20 million more in the current fiscal year and another $40 
million in the next fiscal year and try to reduce the deficit in the 
transportation system.
<P>
	I understand that currently it costs around $780 million to run 
the aviation section of the Department of Transport and we take 
in some $600 million. There is a deficit. Through this change of 
policy the minister is attempting to move the program to a point 
where it is on the basis of pay as we go. We in the Reform Party 
support that. We feel very strongly about that.
<P>
	I listened to the Bloc Quebecois member who has just taken 
his seat make the case that we have to worry about the increased 
cost of tickets. That is certainly a matter we could worry about 
but if we believe in the principle that we pay as we go, the sort of 
welfare dependent attitude portrayed by the Bloc Quebecois 
member just does not hold water.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	As Canadians we must start to change our principles and to 
change our attitudes. It is changing in the nineties. We must 
move from the attitude of the seventies and eighties where we 
believed government had to do everything for us. We became 
dependent on government. We believed government had to 
subsidize a variety of services that we were using as private 
individuals, as businesses and as companies.
<P>
	We have to move away from the 1970 and 1980 mentality of 
the welfare state and start to move toward a more conservative 
attitude where people must be responsible for looking after their 
own welfare. People must be prepared to pay their bills, whether 
travelling on Air Canada, Canadian Air or any other charter 
airline in our country. People who wish to travel must make that 
part of the cost of our lives on a private basis and part of the cost 
of our business. If we as members of government  have to travel 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4611"> 4611 </A></B>
<P>
or if members of the public service have to travel then it is a 
budgeting cost in this assembly.
<P>
	The bill is more than a change in policy with regard to 
increasing the revenue available to the Minister of Transport. 
We are moving over the threshold in the attitude we have as 
Canadian governments. I hear it in the House sometimes. I 
would like to hear it more. We talk about governments being 
independent, being able to run on their own and being able to 
pay their way. We are starting to move away from agencies, 
particularly large corporations or companies that get grants 
from government and become dependent on government, to a 
point at which people are more independent in the way they 
behave, in the way they act and in the way they respect public 
funds.
<P>
	That primary principle is starting to expose itself and to 
become more obvious in this piece of legislation. I certainly 
commend the minister for supporting it in this piece of 
legislation. I highly recommend to the government that as we 
are planning for the 1995-96 budget we should look at ways and 
means the government can move away from creating dependent 
circumstance or agencies of government that are very dependent 
on public funds, to a point where the agencies or in many 
circumstances the private elements of our society look after 
themselves.
<P>
	A primary item the government must look at for the upcoming 
budget is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the same 
principle. We subsidize that corporation by $1.1 billion a year. It 
is asking in another piece of legislation-and I know I am 
walking close to the edge of the rules by referencing another 
piece of legislation-for $25 million of borrowing power to 
support its organization. Whether it borrows more money or 
receives it as a grant from government, the public purse is 
supporting that agency. It is creating a dependency within our 
Canadian community and it is wrong.
<P>
	I highlight that my support and the support of the Reform 
Party for the section on air transportation tax in Bill C-32 
changes a direction and makes the industry more independent 
and self-sufficient. If we want to move a number of our airports 
into private management components, I believe this is a start. If 
we can show-
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the hon. member would excuse the 
Chair, there was a misunderstanding. The debate goes on until 
6.30, not until 6.15. He is entitled to go on until 6.30 or he might 
wish to yield the floor to somebody else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
appreciate the extra time which is available to me in this debate.
<P>
	The second principle in the bill I want to talk about concerns 
the GST changes for meal allowances. It reduces the amount 
from 80 per cent to 50 per cent that can be calculated as 
entertainment or meal allowances for those persons wishing to 
use it in their tax calculations.
<P>
	We have supported that change on the basis we felt this was a 
business subsidy. The Reform Party is very concerned that 
government should get out of business. Government is too far 
into the lives of the business community. For those people who 
wish to entertain potential clients with meals or other types of 
entertainment expenses then that should be their responsibility. 
It should not be the responsibility of the state to subsidize them 
indirectly with a tax concession. On that basis we support that 
type of change with regard to the goods and services input tax 
credit.
<P>
	Those were the two areas I wanted to speak on. The Reform 
Party supports each of them. First, we support the transportation 
tax changes which make the industry more self sufficient and 
not so reliant on the subsidy of the public purse. Second, we 
support the reduction or changes in the GST allowance tax credit 
from 80 per cent to 50 per cent. It is a good move in that 
government is less involved and the private sector looks after 
itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
just take a couple of minutes to talk about that. I cannot let a bill 
like this get passed in this House without first telling the House 
about the effects it has on my riding. When I talked about this 
bill before I explained to the House how important legislation 
like this is to my riding of Haldimand-Norfolk.
<P>
	I represent somewhere in the neighbourhood of 800 tobacco 
producers and I have represented them on this issue over the past 
few years. Over a number of years I and indeed a number of 
members in this House have been calling for the government to 
reduce taxes on tobacco. We felt, as do most of my constituents, 
that tobacco taxes and the way they have been applied in this 
country have been to the detriment of many of my constituents 
certainly the tobacco farmers and the area communities which 
support them.
<P>
	I also represent the people of the Six Nations which is the 
largest Indian reserve in the country. It was dramatically 
impacted on by this legislation and the lowering of the taxes we 
brought in earlier this year, in February.
<P>
	One thing we have seen in Haldimand-Norfolk and in the 
area surrounding the Six Nations is a great reduction in the 
number of smoke huts. Prior to the dropping of the taxes there 
were in the neighbourhood of 150 tobacco huts. Today it is very 
difficult to find one or two on the reserves. Some of them are 
now dealing in commodities other than tobacco, more than 
likely spirits of some sort, but it certainly has had a dramatic 
impact in that area.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	It was the elders, the senior people of the Six Nations who 
came to me most often and said: ``You have to deal with this 
situation. We don't like what it is doing to our children. We don't 
like the money aspect it has instilled in our children of going out 
and trying to make a quick buck''. A lot of the time these elders 
felt that the children were moving away from the old ways and 
the old teachings by getting into this money grabbing exercise. 
They certainly were very pleased by what this government has 
done.
<P>
	In the past I have talked about how taxation policy has been to 
the detriment of the tobacco industry. It has been that way 
because governments have not been able to give the 
industry-when I talk about the industry, I talk about the 
tobacco farmers-an idea of their taxation needs over the years.
<P>
	Even though there is a marketing system for tobacco, when 
the numbers came out as to what the tobacco requirements 
would be for a year the government would come in later and all 
of a sudden apply a high tax on tobacco which would completely 
throw the market into an upheaval. That is why over the years I 
have been calling for the reduction in taxation on tobacco.
<P>
	There is a major relief for the people in the tobacco growing 
areas. It has helped the spirit in those areas. They are good 
people who had been encouraged by past governments to get 
into tobacco. These people really do not have a number of other 
commodities to move into. These are good Canadians who in the 
past have supported good government. Over the past few months 
when I have been down there visiting with them they have 
praised the government for what it has been doing.
<P>
	Constituents have not been happy with other areas of the bill. 
The export tax is one they see as not only against any provisions 
in GATT but also something that would hurt their legitimate 
export interests. They have called on me to tell the government, 
as I have in the past, that an export tax only hurts Canadian jobs 
and Canadian farmers. It does nothing to solve the problem.
<P>
	We have gone beyond that. Because of the dramatic drop in 
taxation we have gone on to solve the problem. It was a tough 
problem. I listened earlier to the member from the Bloc saying: 
``Gee, why didn't you do something about it?'' I remember when 
his leader was in the previous government which kept raising the 
taxes on tobacco. Why was it that his leader did nothing to deal 
with this situation?
<P>
	We came in and there was a major problem. Maybe some 
people in the Reform Party and in the west did not agree with 
some of the things we did. It was not an easy problem but one 
which I suppose past governments had decided it best to just let 
go. Our leader decided to take it upon himself to solve this 
problem. From all I have seen, it has solved the problem in my 
area.
<P>
	Some will complain that right after we brought in the new 
taxation the sales of tobacco went up, but that was just the 
situation of people resupplying. If members went into 
cornerstores in their ridings they could see people were moving 
out of tobacco sales because they were not making any money on 
it. People were buying their tobacco outside their normal 
channels.
<P>
	We saw in the paper a couple of weeks ago when the numbers 
came out that those numbers have dropped dramatically. In fact, 
we are now seeing there really is not a dramatic drop. It is pretty 
much staying the same in terms of tobacco sales. There has not 
been the dramatic increase some claimed would happen and all 
in all, it is levelling off.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	It has brought to people's attention that serious problem of 
how tobacco was illegally getting into the hands of young people 
in schoolyards. This bill makes sure that if people buy tobacco 
products they will do it legitimately in legitimate areas. If 
someone decides to sell to minors they will face the stiffest 
penalties there have ever been in this country in that regard.
<P>
	That is good government. It is a good piece of legislation 
which deals with a problem Canadians wanted dealt with. It 
bodes well for not only the Prime Minister but also for the 
Minister of Health and the Minister of National Revenue who 
solved the problem together.
<P>
	I will give the Reform Party a chance for five minutes on this. 
I thank the Prime Minister on behalf of my constituents in 
Haldimand-Norfolk for dealing with the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have only a few minutes but I want to make several points. I was 
going to take the opportunity to go through Bill C-32 point by 
point, but time does not allow that. I will simply summarize 
what our position is and then make a few supplementary 
remarks.
<P>
	Reformers are going to come out opposed to this bill basically 
because we did not want the tobacco tax to be reduced in the way 
it was. You may find it rather surprising that Reformers would 
oppose a tax reduction. One of the reasons we were elected was 
to reduce government spending so that taxes could be reduced 
but in this case, we cannot agree with what has been done for the 
following reasons.
<P>
	My constituents have told me this as well. They did not like 
the way the government responded to the criminal element by 
reducing taxes very quickly. They would have preferred that the 
government look at the enforcement problem first and address 
some of the other issues, maybe apply an excise tax on the 
exported tobacco products.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4613"> 4613 </A></B>
<P>
	More and more people will be encouraged to smoke. We 
already see this happening among our young people. For this 
reason we cannot support this reduction in the tax.
<P>
	Because of this increase in smoking we will have long term 
health costs for Canadians which have not been factored in. The 
government should have done some planning in this regard, 
some investigation as to how this would affect our health care 
system. That is a priority with people. They have told us that 
above all else we should preserve our health care system. We 
should not cut back on costs and this will probably increase the 
costs rather than reduce them.
<P>
	We should also have tried more aggressive enforcement 
measures. Seventy per cent of the cigarettes were brought in 
through the reserves. Maybe there was a way to address that 
problem.
<P>
	We would have liked to have seen a new export tax on tobacco 
products tried before the lowering of taxes took place. We could 
probably have worked together with Americans in this regard 
but now they look at us and say: ``The Canadians have reduced 
their taxes, so we don't have to increase ours. It doesn't work''.
<P>
	There will also be a problem between provinces. There is a 
smuggling problem between Canada and the United States and 
now we are going to have a smuggling problem among various 
provinces. How will that be addressed? What will happen in that 
regard? I realize some measures have been taken here to try to 
control that, but it could be a problem.
<P>
	In February when Bill C-11 was introduced we pointed out 
that when the criminal element sees that the profit is no longer 
there for tobacco they will turn to other things. As my colleague 
has already admitted, they will probably begin importing 
alcohol and other things.
<P>
	We support the imposition of the new excise tax on exported 
tobacco products. Senior officials informed us that before the 
tax changes were implemented, between 30 and 40 per cent of 
the total production of tobacco manufacturing in Canada was 
exported. The tobacco companies now agree that only 3 per cent 
was legally consumed in the United States. This shows the 
extent of the smuggling problem. It could have been controlled 
at this end before it even went to the states.
<P>
	This law now allows tobacco manufacturers to export 3 per 
cent of their production tax exempt. Reformers believe that this 
new export tax should have been tried before lowering the tax.
<P>
	The legislation implements measures to ensure that unmarked 
tobacco products sold to Indians on reserves in Ontario and 
Nova Scotia are taxed at the same rate as marked tobacco 
products sold in the two provinces.
<P>
	Also retailers and wholesalers are owed an estimated $150 
million in rebates on excise taxes on tobacco products held in 
inventory when the excise tax was reduced. The minister cannot 
issue the rebate cheques  until this legislation is passed. While 
we oppose the reduction in tobacco taxes, retailers are likely to 
get upset if we delay the bill. We do not want to hold it up for that 
reason.
<P>
	Finally, Reformers support the adjustment to the fines for 
illegal possession or sale of unstamped tobacco products. We 
believe that those who are breaking our laws should be 
punished. We also support the health promotion surtax, an 
increase of 40 per cent of taxes paid on profits by the tobacco 
manufacturers. We feel this is a positive measure. On most of 
these measures we support the government. However, on the 
reduction of the tobacco tax we cannot support it.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I declare Motions Nos. 20 and 22 negatived.

	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you will find unanimous 
consent in the Chamber to apply the vote on Motion No. 4 to 
Motion No. 21.

	An affirmative vote on Motion No. 23 obviates the need for a

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The vote on Motion No. 24 will also apply to Motion No. 25.

<P>
	Motions Nos. 26, 31 and 33 will be voted on separately.
<P>
	All those in favour of the motion will please rise.
