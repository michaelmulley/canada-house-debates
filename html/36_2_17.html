</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Veterans Week will offer Canadians an opportunity to 
honour the sacrifices of our veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to pay tribute to the more than 1.4 million Canadians who 
stood in harm's way to safeguard our freedoms and liberties, and 
in particular, Chatham-Kent born Pilot Officer Leslie Peers, who 
gave his life during World War II while assisting the French 
resistance fighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last July, Canada and its allies gathered in France for a 
memorial service.  This was the first time in 55 years that a 
Canadian delegation set foot on the gravesite to officially 
commemorate the valiant efforts of Pilot Officer Peers and his 
six crew members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weekend will be another first.  French resistance fighters 
are presenting to the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 28 in 
Chatham-Kent their battle flag.  I am told that no French battle 
flag has ever left France unless taken by an enemy in battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada stands proud.  The bond between Canada and France 
endures.  We remain very proud of our veterans.

Canada's proud war veterans are now, and should remain, the 
recipients of the enduring respect of all Canadians for the very 
high price for peace paid this century past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We parliamentarians fully recognize that our existence and 
privileges enjoyed today are due to the efforts of Canada's war 
veterans and their 110,000 fallen comrades resting throughout the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish to support greater recognition of Canada's wartime 
contributions on this passing of the most violent century of all 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask all Canadians to observe a two minute wave of silence to 
begin in Newfoundland, sweeping across the country in a silent 
wave through each time zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We parliamentarians of Canada should proclaim our support and 
pledge to encourage a two minute silence in our constituency at 
the 11th hour of the 11th day in the 11th month of 1999.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Health and the new federal rural health directorate 
have been working hard to tackle the special health problems of 
rural Canada in towns like Peterborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national summit on rural health research in Prince George 
brought together all stakeholders in rural health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, in effect, two health care systems in Canada:  one 
for the big cities and one for the rest of the country.  While it 
is clear that some major health facilities have to be in cities, 
there is no reason that basic rapid response modern care cannot 
be available to all Canadians.  It is the task of the federal 
government to make sure that our health care system is available 
to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge that Health Canada be given the resources to translate 
its fine preliminary work into action.  This will improve health 
care for all rural Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today is bring your children to work day.  It is an 
opportunity for them to experience various occupations by 
shadowing their parents and friends.  This is vital, as it allows 
children to broaden their horizons as to what the future may hold 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My daughter Lara Treiber and her friend Sofie Faga are spending 
the day accompanying me.  They will experience my life as a 
member of parliament on Parliament Hill.  The day will include 
attending committee meetings and question period.  They have come 
to meet and share the ideas and experiences of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All young Canadians participating in this event will have the 
opportunity to learn that in today's world there is a recipe for 
success.  It encompasses education and creative energy.  It 
inspires courage and the ability to envision the future and 
recognize the challenges that still lay ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parents today we must lead the way and set an example for 
others and for those who follow in our footsteps.  I commend 
everyone who has chosen to bring a child to their workplace for 
the day to share the knowledge and experience they have acquired.

farmers and west coast shippers are nervously watching the clock 
today to see if last minute talks will avert work stoppages that 
threaten to halt their shipments and decimate their earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the port of Vancouver a long simmering dispute between the 
Maritime Employer's Association and the longshoremen's union 
threatens to close that port by next week.

disappear down the drain.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should farmers worry?  After all, did the Liberals not 
decree that grain like the mail must go through?  But wait, there 
is a wrinkle in this Liberal labour plan.  If the grain does not 
reach the port it cannot be shipped out.  A contract dispute 
between Agricore and the Grain Services Union could stall 
shipments from 400 Alberta and Manitoba elevators by next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government recognize that last year's tinkering 
with the labour laws did not work?  It is time to give labour and 
management the tools to solve their differences—

Speaker, as we are about to enter a new century, we can well 
imagine the excitement felt by all Canadians at the turn of the 
last one.  We were a small nation in almost everything but size 
and promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet shortly after the century began the first world war would 
take 60,000 of our citizens.  They would die at Regina Trench, 
Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge, Beaumont Hamel and Courcelette, to 
name a few of the battlegrounds that continue to mark our 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their sacrifice would indelibly mark Canada as a nation that 
could be called on to help stamp out oppression and occupation 
wherever it occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there are very few first world war veterans that remain 
with us.  They are national treasures.  We must not let their 
passing dull our memory.  Long may we honour those who died so 
long ago so that their children and their children's children 
might inherit a great nation.  We, their inheritors, pledge to 
keep their stories alive for the children of the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the highest military award for bravery in the 
Commonwealth is the Victoria Cross and on it are inscribed two 
simple words, “For Valour”.  Since the theme of Veterans Week 
this year is “A Century of Valour”, it is appropriate to 
acknowledge that on a per capita basis Canadians have won more 
VCs than any other Commonwealth nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first was awarded to Alexander Dunn for heroism in the 
Charge of the Light Brigade.  Our 95th and last Victoria Cross 
was awarded posthumously to Robert Hampton Gray for a successful 
attack on a Japanese warship an hour before the Americans 
dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, which brought World War II 
to an end. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In war and in peace Canadians have answered the call to duty. 
The fact that so many VCs were awarded to our citizens is 
symbolic of the bravery of all those who represented our country 
under the most difficult of circumstances.

important work on the butterflies of Quebec and Labrador by 
Louis Handfield, a notary in Mont-Saint-Hilaire, in the beautiful 
riding of Chambly, was published.  It comprises 1,100 pages of 
text and colour plates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the outcome of thirty-five long 
years of research and observation and thousands of hours of data 
collection; it is destined to become an encyclopedia of 
knowledge in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I attended the book launch, Mr. Handfield spoke of his one 
regret: the lack of co-operation by Heritage Canada, which does 
not allow specimens to be collected in national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of Mr. Handfield, and in the name of science, I call 
upon Heritage Canada to make an exception to this ban for 
entomologists research and studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must again express my admiration for Mr. Handfield, a modest, 
frank and straightforward gentleman and for his work, which is 
sure to be a priceless reference tool for at least the first 
hundred years of the new millennium.

world leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is delighted with this good news for the 
economy, since it proves that conditions are right for new 
investments such as this one announced by Nortel.  These 
conditions give confidence to key economic decision makers.

this summer's extreme drought conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the municipalities in the province of Alberta have 
declared this region a disaster area.  This should qualify 
affected drought areas for federal tax deferral on the sale of 
breeding livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal minister of agriculture responded by recommending to 
the finance minister that he approve tax deferral for farmers 
affected by the drought.  The finance minister must be just too 
interested in spending his multibillion dollar EI surplus to 
notice the troubles of farmers.  So far there has been no 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These farmers have suffered enough hardship.  The very least the 
finance minister could do is step up and help these farmers by 
giving them desperately needed access to the tax deferment 
provision.

the plan for the WTO meeting in Seattle in December is to 
liberalize investment, agriculture and services, thus allowing 
the public sector, including education, water, health care, 
social and postal services, fire and police services, to be 
eventually carved up by multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP along with the Canadian Labour Congress and many other 
Canadian groups and individuals oppose further liberalization of 
the WTO.  We demand that investment and services be taken off the 
table and that Canada's ability to govern itself for the sake of 
all and for the purposes of social justice be compromised no 
further than has already been the case as a result of NAFTA and 
the current WTO rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the Liberals to rethink their uncritical approach 
to the current model of globalization.  Canadians want to have 
their policies decided by their elected representatives, not by

farm crisis.  He sits behind his desk, orders up some statistics 
from his officials and comes to the conclusion that the crisis 
has disappeared.  He never bothers to talk to farmers and their 
families.  He never bothers to visit the farms.  He simply 
calculates the crisis out of existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When did the Prime Minister become so disconnected from western

<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is very concerned about the farm 
crisis.  He is certainly willing, as he has already demonstrated, 
to listen to farmers and their representatives.  That is why he 
was willing to have a very early meeting when a delegation came 
from western Canada involving premiers and people of all 
stakeholder groups.  That showed the Prime Minister's interest, 
which continues, in working with all concerned to find a fair and 
reasonable solution to this serious matter very soon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thousands of Canadian farmers are staring bankruptcy in 
the eye and wondering how on earth they will get through the 
winter.  Thousands of farm children are suffering along with 
their parents, wondering how their families are going to make it 
at all.  Meanwhile in Ottawa the Prime Minister and his minions 
are putting together a $47 billion spending spree but cannot even 
deliver the $900 million in emergency aid to keep farmers afloat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many farmers have to lose their farms and face bankruptcy

there is a crisis? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

should not support farmers and that we should cut the ministry et

of $900 million.  We have changed the program since then to 
include and to give more support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers the hon. member talked about were numbers people in 
the western delegation were fully aware of.  They were aware of 
that before they came.  If they did not share that with their

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

on illegal migrants, but when hard-pressed Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba farmers come looking for emergency assistance, the 
government says that there is no crisis and no need for help.

government and the Manitoba and Saskatchewan governments provided 
$984 million in assistance through the safety net programs to the 
farmers in those two provinces. When we add the AIDA support for 
1998 and 1999 we will be adding another $550 million worth of 
support to producers.  It is not enough.  We wish we had more. We

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ECONOMIC STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
first blush, the Minister of Finance seems to be sitting very 
pretty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is proposing tax cuts and new programs, but he is forgetting 
the gaping hole in this lovely scenario, the $33 billion he is 
not giving back to those who are providing direct services to 
the public, i.e. the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister plug this hole and give back to the 
provinces the money he cut? 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, although there were cuts in transfers very early on, 
these cuts were not as extensive as those inflicted by the 
provinces on municipalities, as was the case in Quebec, for 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in last year's budget, we increased the health transfer 
by $11.5 billion over five years.  We also increased 
equalization payments, and Quebec alone received an additional 
$1.4 billion in such payments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, these 
cuts amounted to $932 million in cash transfers. That is much 
more than what the municipalities were cut, as the Minister of 
Finance is well aware.  The Minister of Finance is not naive. 
He can do the math; what matters is what he does with the money 
once he has it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that cash transfers have decreased.  The federal 
government has more money than responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister stand by while those providing direct 
health, education, and social services to the public do not have 
the funds needed to do the job, and those with no responsibility 
for these sectors build up surpluses?  That is the problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Once again, Mr. 
Speaker, the member is talking about health, but we increased 
health transfers by $11.5 billion last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the universities, research and development, we 
established the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, 33% of the 
funds from which will go to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech, we announced new research chairs, which 
all universities were quick to approve.  It is very clear that

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 
yesterday's economic statement, the Minister of Finance talked 
about a lot of things, but said nothing specific about indexing 
the tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister not make a commitment now to tell taxpayers

tables? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are going to do a lot more than that.  We are going to look at 
what we have already done.  Next year, the government will have 
cut personal income tax and compensated for indexing at least 
four or five times. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister

how, on matters not under his jurisdiction, matters of 
provincial jurisdiction, such as childhood, the family and 
education, he took it upon himself to make announcements, but 
was unable to be more specific about tax cuts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the announcement he has just made and the 
transfers to the provinces, does the minister not realize that 
he should have been specific on these two points and that it is 
his duty to tell the public today just what he is going to do? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

results, it sets targets.  The government set targets for deficit 
reduction.  Now it is setting targets for decreases in taxes for 
high income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are there no targets for family farms in crisis?  Why are 
there no targets to rebuild health care?  Why are there no 
targets to eliminate child poverty to ensure that all our

because the government just does not care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the very deep feeling of concern that we have for families living 
in poverty, for farm families in this country, and to improve the 
lot of the ordinary Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we put another $2 billion in the national child tax 
benefit.  That is why we have increased CAPC.  That is why we

reduction was a priority, not an afterthought.  Yet in the Prime

taxes and the details of tax reduction are done in budget.  I 
would certainly ask the hon. member to be part of the finance

fine words but they will not pass the paste up test for most 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing a 15 cent cut in EI premiums but a 40 cent hike in 
CPP premiums on January 1, a big tax hike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want some tax relief right now.  Their taxes are still 
going up.  If the minister has supposedly cut taxes already, like 
he claimed yesterday, why is it that Canadians are not seeing it 
on their paycheques? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  First, Mr. 
Speaker, of course they are.  They have seen a 3% reduction 
toward the elimination of the surtax.  They have seen a $675 
increase in the threshold below which Canadians do not pay any 
taxes.  We now have a situation where a family of two earning 
$30,000 pays absolutely no federal taxes.  Where a family is 
earning $50,000, there is 15% decrease in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those happen to be the facts.  What we have also said is that in 
each and every budget, beginning with the next one, we will 
continue on that path.

<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

themselves without work.  Let us understand that $7 billion a

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the finance minister's response was to throw more

bring down the government's sky-high taxes.

<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have outlined the approach we intend to 
take to tax reduction.  We intend to make personal income tax 
reduction the priority.  We intend to make families with children 
a priority within that.  We also made it very clear that the 
government intends to move on business taxes to make sure that we 
have as competitive an area as possible when we have the room to 
manoeuvre to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand full well the necessity of improving R and D.  The

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, no

Canadians who just do not agree.

getting through to the other side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the debt to GDP ratio.  In the last two years, 
Canada has had the most substantial drop in the debt to GDP ratio 
of any industrial country.  That is what we have done.  We have 
cut income taxes.  We have cut them in each of the last three 
budgets.  We are three years ahead of where the Reform Party said 
it would be if it were in office, but of course it will never be 
in office.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE ALFRED PULLEN GLEAVE 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say a few words of tribute to a former 
colleague of ours, Alf Gleave, who at the age of 88 passed away 
in August of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alf Gleave was the member of parliament for what was known then 
as the riding of Saskatoon—Biggar.  I had the honour in 1968 to 
be his seatmate.  He was 58 years old.  I thought that was pretty 
ancient at that time as I was 22.  I am beginning to see that it 
is a lot younger now than it used to be.  Alf Gleave was a 
wonderful person to have as a seatmate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was elected to parliament in 1968. 
He was re-elected in 1972 and sat in the House until 1974. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before he entered politics Mr. Gleave was a farmer.  He farmed 
near the town of Biggar, Saskatchewan from 1938 until 1972.  When 
he was elected to parliament he immediately became very well 
known, partly because he was the former president of the National 
Farmers' Union of Canada.  When he was elected in 1968 he was 
chosen immediately as the chairman of the New Democratic Party 
caucus and he served in that position for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968 and 1969 we had a debate which was a bit like the debate 
we are having now.  It was a debate over a farm crisis, mainly 
over what we called in those days tough and damp wheat or tough 
and damp grain.  He quickly became a national figure, leading 
that debate in the House of Commons at a time when debates on 
public policy centred much more so in this place than they do 
today.  He was a leader in that capacity for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alf Gleave was born in Ontario, but he moved to Saskatchewan 
when he was six years old.  He farmed as a young man and he 
continued to farm until 1972.  Before he entered politics he was 
the president of the National Farmers' Union of Canada, and 
before that he was the president of the Farmers' Union of 
Saskatchewan from 1949 until 1954.  He was also a director of the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture.  In 1964 he was appointed as 
a member of the Economic Council of Canada.  He was also a 
director of the Saskatchewan Power Corporation and a number of 
other organizations in the province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1959 and 1962 he served as an advisor to the federal 
government during the international wheat agreement negotiations 
in Geneva, Switzerland.  Those were very important negotiations, 
which meant a lot to prairie farmers as they obtained an 
agreement for the export and sale of grain around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also very active in the co-operative movement, the 
general co-op movement, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the credit 
union movement in our province, and indeed across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After his political career ended in 1974 he remained very active 
in many of the organizations that he had been active in before. 
He was also a regular columnist, having a bi-monthly column in 
The Saskatoon <I>StarPhoenix</I> on agricultural issues through 
much of the 1970s and 1980s.  He was energetic.  He was always 
involved.  He always spoke with a great deal of compassion on 
issues concerning rural Canada, western Canada and agriculture in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 he wrote a book called <I>United We Stand</I>. As Mr. 
Gleave passed away at the age of 88, he was up in years when he 
wrote this book.  It is one of the more comprehensive histories 
that I have ever read of prairie farmers between 1901 and 1975. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gleave was always very active.  He was very effective in 
advancing the philosophy that when farm people and rural people 
are better off, the people in the cities and the towns across 
this country are also much better off, and that when the economy 
is strong on the farm, the economy of the country is also strong 
because agriculture indeed is the very foundation of our economy. 
I can remember him rising beside me through those six years, 
asking questions and making speeches which employed that 
philosophy time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to express on behalf of myself, my party and I am 
sure all members of parliament who knew him, our great respect 
for a very decent human being and for a very intelligent human 
being.  He was a very passionate advocate of the causes of the 
farmers of this country, both before he got into politics, when 
he was in politics and after he left politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to extend our condolences to his wife Mary, who was 
always at his side, to his family and to his many friends, not 
only in Saskatchewan, but indeed right across Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise in the House today 
to speak of the passing of a man who gave his life and his energy 
to the well-being of the people of Saskatchewan and the people of 
Canada, Mr. Alfred Pullen Gleave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though born in West Zorra Township in Ontario, Alf Gleave's 
heart and home were on the prairies. 
Living in Biggar, Saskatchewan, with his family from 1918, he was 
first and foremost a farmer and very proud of it.  He built his 
life in this honourable profession, so inherently important to 
the province of Saskatchewan.  The farming community, in turn, 
looked to him for leadership on many issues.  He was a life 
member of the National Farmers' Union.  In the first 20 years of 
his working life he served as a director and then president of 
the Saskatchewan Farmers' Union and then the National Farmers' 
Union respectively.  His dedication to farming will be fondly 
remembered by the people of the Biggar district and indeed by 
farmers all across Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His deep commitments carried Mr. Gleave into the political 
arena.  From 1968 until 1974 he was the elected member of 
parliament for the constituency of Saskatoon—Biggar.  A member 
of the New Democratic Party, Mr. Gleave earned the respect of 
members from all parties.  He was chairman of the NDP caucus from 
1968 until 1972 and served as the party's agricultural critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His priorities were always clear in his writing, in his speeches 
and in the issues that he chose to pursue locally, nationally and 
internationally.  One could never have any doubt about where he 
stood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting, I suppose, that we mark his passing at a time 
when a federal byelection is under way to fill a vacancy in the 
House for the very riding which he once represented.  Always a 
competitor, Alf Gleave would be thoroughly enjoying the race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Government of Canada, I want to join all hon. 
members in extending our sympathies to his wife and family, as 
well as his very broad circle of friends. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the people of Saskatchewan, members of 
parliament from Saskatchewan and the party that I represent, I am 
pleased to pay tribute to a man who not only came from 
Saskatchewan and made Saskatchewan people proud of his efforts, 
but a man who, like so many people from my province, was proud to 
come from that province which often suffers great adversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been mentioned, he was a grain farmer, but his 
interests, like so many grain farmers, went beyond the actual 
farm itself.  Alf wanted to do something for all of Saskatchewan. 
His quest and his goal was to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He served as president of the Saskatchewan Farmers' Union as 
well as the National Farmers' Union.  He gave much of his time 
and provided Canada with much insight into the agricultural 
situation in Saskatchewan.  As my hon. colleague from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle mentioned, he also served on many boards, 
sometimes in an advisory capacity.  He was indeed a credit to 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to the House a quote of Alf's.  He wrote that each 
generation must fight for what it wants because good things do 
not just happen.  That statement was never more true than it is 
today.  That is exactly why we will find a real fight going on in 
all of Saskatchewan, in all of the west, in the hope of saving, 
in many cases, fifth generation farmers from complete disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers who lived through the thirties did not just complain 
about the living conditions; they went out and did something 
about them.  Sometimes adversity brings about strong character. 
That is exactly what Alf Gleave gave to Canada, to the House and 
to the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to have lived very close for 12 years to the seat 
that Alf represented in the House.

behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I too wish to pay tribute to 
Alfred Pullen Gleave, who sat as a member of the New Democratic 
Party in the House of Commons from 1968 to 1974 and represented 
the riding of Saskatoon-Biggar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A farm producer, grain farmer and seed grower by profession, he 
was a member of agricultural unions and, as the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle reminded us earlier, was president of the 
Saskatchewan Farmers Union and the National Farmers Union. 
As he wrote in the introduction to his autobiographical <I>United 
We Stand—Prairie Farmers 1901-1975</I>: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Political action was an extension of the farmer's movement.  I 
used it as well as I could to advance western Canadians' 
interests in general and the farmer's movement in particular.” 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the six years he sat in the House, he was an ardent 
defender of farmers and a formidable member of the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture.  He was a feisty MP, as my colleague 
and friend, the hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona, just told me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was particularly interested in issues having to do with the 
price of wheat, farm marketing boards, price controls and 
inflation.  He served as president of his party's caucus and 
also served a leader, David Lewis who, like his predecessor, 
Tommy Douglas, was, in his words, and I am again quoting from 
<I>United We Stand</I>, “an outstanding man”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great honour that I rise on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to pay tribute to the New Democratic Party 
member of parliament who served his constituency of 
Saskatoon-Biggar with great dignity and professionalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not realize until today that the member we are paying 
tribute to, Mr. Gleave, was a seatmate of the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle. I suspect that Mr. Gleave had a great sense 
of humour.  I suspect he had a great deal of endurance. I wish he 
had more years in the House so that he could have passed on some 
of his experience to the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gleave gave years of his life working for the people of 
Saskatchewan, whether it was through his involvement with 
co-operatives, as president of the Saskatchewan Farmers Union or 
as a member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not know Mr. Gleave personally but I know people like Mr. 
Gleave, an individual who took farming as a profession, an 
individual who had pride in what he did by working the land.  He 
was a man who worked for his community, a man who worked for his 
neighbours and a man who worked for his profession, that of being 
a farmer.  I know people, as do members of the opposition and the 
government, just like Mr. Gleave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gleave died this past summer at the age of 88.  His words of 
advice during his tenure as member of parliament still ring true 
today.  As was mentioned by the member of the Reform Party, and 
which is important to repeat, Mr. Gleave talked about how each 
generation must fight for what they want because good things do 
not just happen. 
Good things come to people through hard work, endurance and 
perseverance.  I would have loved to have had the opportunity to 
work and to sit in the House with Mr. Gleave because what I read 
and hear of him is more of those traits that I wish more 
individuals in the House and certainly in this society would 
have.

say a few short words and add to what has already been said in 
terms of paying tribute to Alf Gleave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember him very well as a friend and, to a certain extent, 
as a mentor.  He was president of the National Farmers Union and 
worked in the House as a member of parliament.  His interest was 
certainly the farm and he adopted the motto that people are 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young individual in the farm movement in the early 
seventies, there were several people who inspired me to become 
involved in public life.  Alf was one of those people to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had many sessions with Alf over the years, but after coming 
here in 1993 as a member on the government side and as a member 
of the standing committee on agriculture, it was not unusual at 
all to see Alf in his older years sitting in the agricultural 
committee room listening to the hearings.  He was interested in 
what all sides were saying.  He gave some us on the government 
side a lot of criticism at times for some of the things we were 
doing, but his belief showed through in terms of how important it 
was that programs and benefits be applied to the farm sector.

for his life's work.  I also extend my condolences to his family.

their cost production, not just on crops that are produced in

introduce Bill C-300, an act respecting the protection of 
wildlife species in Canada from extirpation or extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the committee on the status of endangered 
wildlife reports that in Canada 339 species are at risk of 
extinction and habitat loss is the number one cause.  Yet there 
is no federal law protecting the habitat of Canada's endangered 
wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill aims at:  first, protecting all endangered species and 
their habitat; second, identifying species at risk and the 
factors that threaten them and their habitat; third, making it an 
offence to harm, disturb or kill endangered species or their 
habitat; fourth, setting the stage for federal-provincial mirror 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill serves as a benchmark for the government legislation 
soon to be introduced.  Seven years ago, Canada signed in Rio the 
convention on biological diversity.  In view of Canada's 
commitment to the world community and the fact that a recent poll 
found that eight Canadians out of ten are in favour of strong 
endangered species legislation, I urge the government to act 
without delay.

they pay it with money on which they have paid income tax.  For

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to double taxation and so I am introducing this

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague 
for Wild Rose for seconding my bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing was introduced in the 35th parliament in 
the former Bill C-41.  Since that time, tens of thousands of 
conditional sentences have been handed down. 
Most of these sentences are for petty crimes.  However many have 
been handed down for crimes as serious as sexual assault, 
manslaughter, drunk driving and drug trafficking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the B.C. Court of Appeal stated in a decision regarding 
conditional sentencing that “if parliament had intended to 
exclude certain offences from consideration it should have done 
so in clear language”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill does precisely that.  It lists the offences to be 
excluded from any possibility of receiving a conditional 
sentence.  The justice minister wants Canadians to wait for the 
supreme court to decide whether or not conditional sentences are 
appropriate.  I believe these decisions are to be made in 
parliament with direction from Canadians, not the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent national poll states that 84% of Canadians are in 
favour of this bill.  I encourage all members of parliament to 
support the bill and the overwhelming view of the majority of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I commend the hon. member for the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would like to thank my hon. colleague from Wild Rose for 
seconding the bill.  I believe that Canada should hold a binding 
referendum on capital punishment so Canadian people, and not 
political parties, can decide whether or not it should be 
reinstated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Reform government has pledged to do this.  However the 
Liberals do not believe in allowing Canadians to exercise that 
much power.  Today I am reintroducing my bill to reinstate the 
death penalty for adults convicted of first degree murder.  In 
addition, the bill also imposes a range of stiff sentences for 
youths convicted of murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all murderers deserve the death penalty, but in most heinous 
cases such as Clifford Olson, Paul Bernardo and a Karla Homolka 
the punishment must fit the crime.

permanent downward track, and it promises a multi-year plan for 
tax reduction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about an important objective of the throne

looking and innovative nations in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When future generations look back at the turbulent years on the 
cusp of the new millennium, they will see that some nations 
thrived in the midst of change.  They rallied to the new demands 
of creating knowledge and applying it to new products and

thrived in the transition to the new millennium, they will 
conclude that Canada was the place to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 Speech from the Throne reinforces the government's 
commitment to its long term strategy for building a more

By deepening its action in five priority areas of its 
microeconomic agenda:  connectedness, innovation, marketplace 
frameworks, trade and investment, the government continues its 
drive to ensure that Canada is a winner in the globalized 
knowledge based economy.  It will make major investments in 
productivity enhancing actions, productivity that will continue 
to sustain one of the highest standards of living in the world 
and improve the quality of life of all Canadians.

has committed to work with the universities to create 1,200 new 
21st century chairs in research excellence over the next three 
years.  We have set a goal of 2,000 of these new chairs in 
research excellence.  The chairs will enable Canadian 
universities to continue to attract the best graduate and 
post-doctoral students that can create real excitement around 
research in Canadian universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research will be collaborative.  In the 21st century, research 
will not be a solitary pursuit, conducted in the isolation of 
separate ivory towers.  It will involve team-building and 
co-operation, domestically and internationally, so that 
innovation moves through the continuum from pure research to new 
products and processes.  We will foster international 
collaboration and networking by Canadian researchers in 
universities and institutes, including the federal research 
facilities. 
In the area of technological development, we will encourage the 
development of technologies in every phase of the innovation 
continuum.  This includes research collaboration in genomics, 
climate change and advanced engineering, trade promotion for 
biotechnology, information technology, and environmental 
technologies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On market development, we will help to find new markets for the 
products of Canadian innovation and ingenuity.  We will help to 
ensure that new innovations developed by researchers in our 
universities and government laboratories translate into new 
products in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign investment is investment that brings with it 
technological innovation and improved access to the markets of 
our trading partners.  It is investment that helps make Canadian 
industry more forward looking and more outward looking.  We will 
replicate the highly successful team Canada model of trade 
initiatives and with our partners in business and the provincial 
governments will create investment team Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne we stated our commitment to make 
the investment community more aware of the unique opportunities 
for investment and growth in Canada.  We said: “We will 
modernize legislation to make it easier for global corporations 
to locate their headquarters in Canada”. Consistent with this 
commitment, we will put forward amendments to the Canada Business 
Corporations Act to ensure that it provides an operating 
environment that can attract and retain the world's best firms. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular we will propose to reduce the current residency 
requirement for the board of directors of companies incorporated 
under the Canada Business Corporations Act from a majority to 
25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This requirement will not apply to corporations where there are 
ownership restrictions.  We recognize that a modern framework 
legislation must provide globally-oriented Canadian companies 
with the flexibility to build their global markets, investments 
and partnerships for the benefit of Canadians and jobs in 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already gone a long way to making Canada the most 
connected nation in the world.  Last March, Industry Canada's 
SchoolNet program linked a three-student school in Pictou Island, 
Nova Scotia, to the Internet. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, Canada achieved a visionary goal.  Every Canadian 
public school, first nations school and public library wanting to 
be connected by the SchoolNet partnership has been brought on 
line. Canada has won a race where speed was of the essence.  It 
is a race where the countries of the world that can train their 
populations with Internet skills will enjoy the benefits of a 
knowledge based economy.  We are the first country in the world 
to build such an extensive education network, a network that 
connects these schools and their communities to the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this session of parliament, we will push forward on the next 
phase of our SchoolNet program.  We will increase classroom 
access to high speed Internet service.  We will stimulate the 
production of Canadian multimedia content and applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recruit up to 10,000 young people to help Canadians to 
become better users of the Internet.  These young people will 
train those in their communities who want to learn how to go on 
line and how to use the wealth of information that is available 
to them in that medium.  They will help small businesses set up 
websites and use e-commerce.  They will ensure the community 
access sites have the expertise needed for the delivery of 
government services over the net. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fundamental goal of our Connectedness Agenda has been to make 
government a model user of the information highway—to become 
known around the world as the government most connected to its 
citizens.  We aim to achieve this by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do this, in part, through an Internet site that will 
serve as a personal gateway for Canadians wanting government 
information and community content.  The Internet site will also 
lead the world to Canadian businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I do not want to leave the topic of our Connectedness 
Agenda without emphasizing our commitment to finishing the work 
we started in the last session to make Canada a centre of 
excellence in e-commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of the year 2000, we intend to have the most 
attractive policy environment for electronic commerce in the 
world.  We are building a policy framework that deals with: 
encryption technology, public key infrastructure, consumer 
protection, electronic signatures, equitable tax treatment of 
virtual transactions, and standards to ensure the 
interoperability of networks and applications. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the cornerstones of electronic commerce.  The 
government has reintroduced and the House has adopted the 
personal information protection and electronic documents act.  It 
will protect personal and business information in the digital 
world and recognize electronic signatures.  It is part of our 
vision to connect Canadians, to promote innovation in Canada and 
to brand Canada as a world leader in the knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has challenged Canadian businesses, 
especially small businesses, to take advantage of the 
opportunities for electronic commerce.  He has challenged all 
sectors of Canada's economy to capture 5% of the world share of 
e-commerce by 2003.  That would equate to $200 billion in 
business every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has looked at the opportunities of the future as 
well as the challenges.  We have identified the gaps that remain 
in our ability to meet those demands.  Through a comprehensive 
agenda of policies and programs, we will fill those gaps.  We 
will fill them with targeted programs and at the same time 
continue the prudent, balanced approach to making the best 
possible use of taxpayers' money. 
In this way we make Canada the place to be for all those who want 
to be part of a dynamic, forward looking, knowledge based 
economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
has given us a long argument on behalf of the positive role the 
new technologies will play in the life of tomorrow.  That is 
very true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of where we live, whether Latulipe, Sainte-Germaine, 
Montreal, Toronto, or anywhere else, access to technologies like 
the Internet brings us all closer together.  We have access to a 
great deal of information.  In theory, this gives many people an 
equal opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, however, a problem is becoming more and more 
obvious.  I would like to ask the minister's opinion on it 
Among other things, with telephone deregulation, which is not 
without its drawbacks, we are beginning to realize that, within 
a few years, the basic rate for service in areas serviced by 
certain telephone companies will be close to $40, while it will 
be half that in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since access to the Internet requires a line and connection, is 
the minister not concerned that people in some areas will have 
to pay twice what others are paying to be hooked up to this 
technology? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities and schools will be connected, certainly, but 
more and more people want access at home as well.  Some of them 
will have access via their phone line, while others will have an 
Internet line as part of their basic service.  According to the 
latest CRTC decision, Internet service will have to be part of 
the basic service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister concerned by the fact that the charges for basic 
telephone services will be twice as high in some areas as in 
others, depending on the company providing service?   In my 
region, basic service has risen to over $30, while it is around 
the $20 mark in other regions.  In two years, it will be $40 for 
us, and $20 for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister not concerned about this trend?  Does the 
Minister of Industry intend to intervene, and not just to rely 
on CRTC decisions in this area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question is a 
good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I will say that introducing competition into the 
telecommunications sector has produced significant benefits. 
There have been reductions in price, especially for long 
distance calls.  Our rates are now lower than those of the 
United States, where there is a flurry of rate reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition is so strong here in Canada that the rates for most 
Canadians, and this has been the case for a long time as well in 
Europe, are lower than in the United States.  This is a factor 
of competition between Canada and the United States that is so 
favourable to us that we can look for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems remain.  In more rural or remote regions, the cost of 
services is higher. 
There are differences in prices because competition has lowered 
them for long distance calls.  We are in a price adjustment 
period.  We continue to have the greatest access to telephones 
in the world, with an access rate of some 99%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So almost everyone has access to the telephone system.  As 
mentioned, the CRTC has decided to include in the definition of 
basic service, access to the Intranet through a local line. 
That means as well, digital service and single service.  These 
changes will come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In situations like the one mentioned in Question Period, where 
significant differences exist in a very small region, I advise 
him to raise the matter with the CRTC.  It has the power to 
investigate and solve problems when it is satisfied that there 
is an affordability problem or there are unjustified situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a short term response. 
In the long term, we have to be the most connected country in 
the world, and I totally agree that we will have to concern 
ourselves with providing access for everyone, not only at home 
but also, and immediately, in community access centres, schools 
and libraries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that the Internet is the future not only for 
this country but for the world.  Along with it comes a lot of 
problems in people getting access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand one of the biggest problems is the infrastructure 
development for the Internet as well as for cable television. 
Municipalities are encountering that right now with the private 
sector at times having perhaps perceived or non-perceived 
direction from CRTC to basically trespass or take access from 
municipalities without actual municipal permission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister see that problem and how could it be 
resolved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, situations do arise 
occasionally.  Fortunately it is not that often when we consider 
how much development is occurring at the present time in 
essentially rewiring our urban areas with fibre optic facilities, 
in many cases replacing the cables that were already there or 
providing additional cable services, or, and this has sometimes 
been even more problematic, providing the cells for wireless 
service in prominent locations in enough places in a locality. 
The policy that has been followed is one that tries to co-operate 
as fully as possible with the municipalities, both in terms of 
obtaining access and corresponding with local concerns with 
respect to zoning and other considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think at the end of the day the necessity that every citizen 
has to the availability of telecommunications services is one 
that takes a high level of precedence. Where it is not possible 
to reconcile, sometimes it is necessary that access be determined 
by other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a municipality if there is the need to put in significant 
upgrades to services, I think it would be a very short period of 
time before citizens became sufficiently demanding of those 
services. Municipal governments as well would be anxious to find 
ways to satisfy that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to remember that the cost of those services 
needs to be taken into account in our competitive position. 
Probably every municipality in Canada is always looking for new 
ways to earn some revenue, but it is important that we not build 
on to the cost of telecommunications services too many additional 
charges which then render our costs higher than those elsewhere, 
not just between municipalities but between Canada and the U.S. 
where that cost advantage is so important to attracting 
investment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this whole interconnectedness the Minister of Industry talks 
about seems to be a deregulation allowing corporations to allow 
Canadians to be interconnected.  What is the purpose of it?  We 
can have a nice highway system, a nice telephone system and nice 
computers, but if we are still unemployed, if we are still 
without the basic necessities for our families, what is the whole 
purpose of this interconnectedness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of deregulation, I would like to pose another question. 
If I were a fisherman in northern Saskatchewan wanting to sell 
pickerel somewhere, I could easily find some buyer through 
e-commerce, but the freshwater fish industry is regulated under 
freshwater fish marketing rules.  I could not go to 
interprovincial or international trade because of the fish. 
Maybe that is something the minister would like to comment on, 
the fishing industry, interconnectedness and the purpose of this 
whole exercise we are going through in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know about 
freshwater fish marketing, but I do know about fishermen in Nova 
Scotia who went to the local community access site when there 
were no fish for them to chase in the seas.  They were able to 
complete their high school education by having access by computer 
in those situations to that learning, and doing it in such a way 
that was more respectful of their self-esteem than asking them to 
go into classrooms where perhaps they have children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been able to see the situations in small communities 
across Canada where all kinds of electronic commerce 
opportunities are being pursued.  I mention Gordon Currie from 
Dawson Creek, British Columbia whose clients are not necessarily 
in British Columbia.  One is the Atlanta Olympic Committee. 
Others are in Hong Kong, Europe and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all about the jobs of the future.  We all share a 
concern for the people who are challenged in finding jobs in the 
current economy, who have perhaps worked in an industry that has 
closed down.  This is all about where the jobs are going to be in 
the next 10 years and how we can create them. It is about how we 
can give our people the skills and access to the technology they 
will need to fill those jobs that are certainly going to be 
created in a world economy.  We hope to see them created in 
Canada first and foremost.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the 
hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take part in today's debate on the Address in 
reply to the Speech from the Throne. As the Bloc Quebecois 
environment critic, I will primarily focus on the promises made 
by the federal government in that area and on the initiatives 
that it should be taking to ensure sustainable development and 
preserve nature for the benefit of future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to preface my remarks with quotes from a document 
published this year by the federal government, entitled 
“Survey on the Importance of Nature to Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This survey, which involved 86,000 Canadians aged 15 or over, 
confirms the importance of natural resources, fauna and flora 
for a vast majority of people. Indeed, it shows that, during the 
1996 reference year, 29 million Canadians and Quebecers, or 85% 
of the population, took part in nature-related activities, for a 
total of 1.5 billion days. These nature-related activities 
generated 191 million trips and expenses totalling $11 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these figures are telling me two important things. First, 
Canadians and Quebecers are keen participants in nature-related 
activities. 
This is why we must preserve our fauna, forests and protected 
areas, so that we can all continue to fully enjoy them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, these activities have a significant economic impact, 
whether we are talking about outdoor activities, sports or the 
tourism industry. Regardless of what those who believe ecology 
is not compatible with economic development may think, the fact 
is that our environment is a profitable asset that must be 
preserved and developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, since it took office in 1993, the Liberal 
government did very little to protect the environment. Its rare 
initiatives were primarily designed to encroach on provincial 
jurisdictions and strengthen the federal government's control 
over natural resources rather than truly protect the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only good news is that the Liberal government seems to have 
woken up, probably having realized that it should not head into 
the next election empty-handed.  But yes, let us take a quick 
look at a few of the measures proposed in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
While the Liberals initially promised in their red book to 
reduce emissions by 20% by 2005—that is right, 20% by the year 
2005—we recently learned that greenhouse gases have instead gone 
up by 20% since 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Bloc Quebecois members will continue to make every 
possible effort to hold this government—because this is 
essential—to the commitments it made in Kyoto, to set itself 
specific goals and to take firm action to achieve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also intends to protect endangered species.  We 
will continue to denounce interference in provincial 
jurisdictions and the lack of resources to monitor and protect 
endangered species.  Instead of setting national standards, the 
federal government should provide funding—that is what it should 
be doing—for preserving the habitats of these endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most sensible proposal in the throne speech was the one to 
clean up contaminated federal sites.  Finally, a ray of hope. 
The government has been promising to do this for years. 
Finally, it seems prepared to go ahead.  I am giving it the 
benefit of the doubt, but I intend to keep a close eye on 
developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be the priority of the federal government: to clean 
up its own backyard before telling the provinces what to do with 
theirs.  This clean-up should also include sites contaminated by 
the Canadian army, such as those in my riding of Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I see time is passing, I will deal with a very important 
matter left out of the throne speech, that of genetically 
modified organisms.  The Canadian position on the matter of the 
negotiation of the protocol on biodiversity is unacceptable. 
Over 100 countries are prepared to sign an agreement to regulate 
the labelling, import and export of genetically modified 
organisms, primarily plants, and a liability clause for 
companies regarding damage to the environment caused by their 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Canada is part of a small group, with the United 
States and four other countries, that is blocking these 
negotiations because they are bent on putting exports ahead of 
the health of Canadians and the security of their environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close my remarks with a look at the decision by Jean 
Chrétien to permit the import into Canada of a fuel containing 
plutonium, also known as MOX. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I held a press conference this morning to oppose the import of 
this product from the United States and Russia, without public 
consultation on the principle. 
I pointed out as well the unresolved problems of storing 
radioactive waste once the MOX has been used as a fuel in 
nuclear plants.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only deplore the attitude of the Minister of the 
Environment in this matter.  While he should be concerned about 
clean sources of energy and sustainable development, the 
minister has presented nuclear energy as an attractive solution 
that would reduce greenhouse gases.  The minister has even 
advocated exporting Canadian nuclear technology abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I questioned him on the subject of his government's 
proposal to import some one hundred tonnes of plutonium from 
Russian and American nuclear arms, the minister had nothing to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he will quickly change his course in this matter, as in 
others, and attend to his mandate as Minister of the 
Environment.  For this and a number of other reasons, I must 
tell the government it is time to act on the environment.  It 
must do so to give future generations a safe environment.

on sustainable development regarding the environment? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. Reform member for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us in the Bloc Quebecois, everything related to the 
environment is very important as far as sustainable development 
is concerned, because it is important to pass a healthy 
environment on to future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, this Liberal government has made huge cuts in 
funding to the Department of the Environment.  One need only 
think of Bill C-32, which was passed during the last parliament. 
We will recall the general opposition there was to that bill. 
The government pushed it through with a gag order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submit that it is important for everyone, the general public 
and all parliamentarians, to be involved in everything that 
affects the environment.  These are the priorities I defend, and 
shall always defend, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> It is always a 
pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to take the floor when you are in the 
chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to express our great disappointment with this 
throne speech.  I believe it can be characterized quite simply 
as a throne speech offering little in the way of concrete 
solutions to people's concerns.  It is the mark of a government 
that is coming to the end of its time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to reflect on 
this, and I trust that he will have some questions to ask me at 
the end of my speech, because I am always pleased to exchange 
views with him.  I invite him to remember how different things 
would be in this House if the Bloc Quebecois were not here to 
promote the legitimate interests of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were not here, the government would be left to its own 
device, with its rather monolithic view of Quebec. I am taking 
this opportunity to tell you that we will not let the government 
interfere in the referendum debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware that, if it were up to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, given his penchant for controversy—and 
I believe he will allow me to say this—he would want to legislate 
here, in this parliament, on the referendum question, even 
though, as we all know, Quebec already has a referendum act. The 
decision will be made in a democratic fashion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what percentage of Quebecers took part in the 1995 
referendum? Some 93.5%. This compares favourably to the figures 
obtained where voting is compulsory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to calm 
down a little, to control himself, to not add fuel to the fire 
and to accept that this issue will be dealt with by the National 
Assembly and by Quebecers, who will have to make a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally—and this will be of interest to my friend, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs—this past weekend I 
attended a congress with the rank and file in my riding of 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. Whenever my constituents were given the 
opportunity to vote for sovereignty, they did so in very 
interesting numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an illegitimate son of sovereignty. I am a natural son 
of sovereignty, considering that every time the people in my 
riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve had an opportunity to vote for 
sovereignty, they did so. In fact, the minister know who the 
first Parti Quebecois member elected at the National Assembly 
was. We will recall fondly that it was Robert Burns, who now 
sits on the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House about a victory for democracy that took 
place in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.  I put the following idea, which 
will interest the minister, to those attending the congress.  In 
the coming days, I would like to campaign to have the Commission 
des institutions convene a constituent assembly with a four-fold 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like Quebecers to be consulted about the wording 
of the next referendum question.  Naturally, it would still be 
up to the National Assembly to decide whether or not to adopt 
it, but it would be interesting for Quebecers to be consulted. 
This would prevent the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
all the other ministers in this cabinet from saying that the 
question is not legitimate, because it would be based on what 
people wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like a constituent assembly to look into what 
could be called “new democratic practices”.  In a sovereign 
Quebec—it should not be long now—what kind of ballot do we want? 
How can we ensure that decision-making is a truer reflection of 
representation?  These are questions that could be raised in the 
context of a constituent assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third—and I know that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
will be interested in this as well—we must give some thought to a 
question facing modern nations.  This is not something limited 
to Quebec or Canada.  It is a question that I would say all 
modern nations must consider.  How are we to define “citizen” as 
a concept?  In Quebec, the view which I think is most widely 
held right now is that, in a sovereign Quebec, citizenship will 
be defined in relation to participation in a shared public 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shared public culture has a number of components.  First, 
of course, it must be rooted in French.  The language of 
democratic participation in a sovereign Quebec will of course be 
French.  Naturally, we hope that there will be wide 
participation in democratic life and in institutions.  We also 
hope to benefit from the contribution of other communities in a 
context of genuine collaboration and mutual dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constituent assembly could therefore make proposals for the 
wording of the referendum question, examine the issue of new 
democratic practices, and consider the concept of citizenship by 
consulting people about participation in institutions. 
I myself spent a few days in the United States and was trained 
by former congressman Kennedy, who has since left political 
life—but I confess I had nothing to do with it—and he explained 
very clearly to me the benefits of a law that, in the end, 
permits American legislators to measure the involvement of banks 
in poor communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say, to my great satisfaction, that this proposal was 
greeted with barely contained enthusiasm.  It will now make its 
way through the regional bodies to the Bloc Quebecois Year 2000 
congress.  I would very much like the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs to agree to exchange views with me on 
these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, returning to the Speech from the Throne, although I do not 
believe I have ever strayed away from it totally, finally, as 
far as the government's constitutional strategy is concerned, we 
can see an imprecise outline of the underlying agenda of the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would once again caution him against the desire to legislate 
here, in this parliament, on a matter that does not concern him 
in the least.  Moreover, I am told that the minister—a likeable 
man, as is common knowledge—is a man becoming increasingly the 
only one on side with his strategy.  I trust that we will have 
the opportunity to discuss this together, he and I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to have seen some concrete measures contained 
in this throne speech, lacklustre as it is, with no bite, no 
relief, a total lack of imagination. 
What would prevent the government from including in the Human 
Rights Act—not in the Charter, since this would require an 
amending formula, as we know—social condition as a forbidden 
grounds for discrimination? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven provinces already have such a thing in their legislation 
or in their human rights codes, and it would be a formidable 
weapon in the battle against poverty.  We are very well aware 
that social condition refers to people's degree of wealth, their 
position in society, their place in the means of production. 
What would have prevented the government from passing 
legislation, as the United States did in 1977, on community 
reinvestment by the banks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have what they call the Community Reinvestment 
Act. I myself spent a few days in the U.S. and was instructed by 
former congressman Kennedy who, since then, has left politics— 
and I had nothing to do with that—and who explained to me in 
very practical terms the benefits from this Act, which basically 
allows American lawmakers to measure the banks' involvement in 
disadvantaged communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now focus on another issue, namely tainted blood.  This 
is a stigma, a matter of shame for all parliamentarians.  So 
long as the government does not correct the situation, there 
will be a pall over all of the House of Commons.  The government 
ought to correct the situation, and I am referring, naturally, 
to the Krever commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a scandal, a real catastrophe. 
In the early 1990s, Canadian blood supplies were contaminated 
for all sorts of reasons. It is nevertheless true that, in its 
report—a report not prepared by the Bloc Quebecois, a report by a 
royal commission of inquiry that cost taxpayers millions of 
dollars and needed to be called—the Krever commission called for 
a no fault compensation system.  That means that everyone 
contaminated either through a transfusion or through the use of 
blood products would be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like everyone to stay, but acknowledge that is 
impossible.  I know that those who must leave always do so out 
of necessity.  I would have liked a debate with the minister, 
but that is not possible.  We will have it in other forums. 
I think he may be a bit afraid of a confrontation with me, but 
that is part of parliamentary life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that I wished the Krever commission had been 
heard and that we were establishing a compensation plan without 
regard to the fault of those contaminated before 1986 as for 
those contaminated before 1990.  It is a matter of humanitarian 
consideration.  Quebec and Ontario have already compensated 
these categories.  The government is turning a deaf year, and I 
think it is shameful it is taking such an attitude. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for his 
fiery speech. Even the minister he called upon was listening 
carefully. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1630

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, we cannot tell. The minister appears not to be 
listening. This time, however, he paid great attention to the 
message delivered by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question to my colleague, a very 
thoughtful man who is very sensitive to the plight of the 
poorest of the poor in our society. I too work with the 
disadvantaged and the poor in my riding of Matapédia—Matane. 
Since my riding is in a remote region, communications are not so 
good. Major companies and multinationals are reluctant to come 
to my riding, if only because the airport is located in Mont-Joli 
and it takes close to one hour to get to the airport from my 
home. 
Given the transportation services available, this is already a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly recall the case of a local plant. The owners said “We 
are leaving the plant in Quebec City, because if we move it 
further east, it will mean an additional half-hour drive, because 
there is no air service, and half an hour is a long time for 
business people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about a sovereign Quebec, and I know that 
he has given a great deal of thought to this issue. How could we 
be a little more sensitive to the plight of the poor and remote 
areas? How could we treat them better, just as the people in 
Montreal, Quebec City or the Abitibi region are treated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question makes a lot of sense 
and deals with sensitivity, as members will have realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague began with a reference to our friend the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, who is plagued by constitutional 
matters.  If he took the trouble to listen more closely to the 
opposition parties, I think he would see a certain light that is 
sadly lacking in his caucus. That having been said, on the issue 
of poverty, I think that it involves all parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we want to become sovereign?  Because we are a nation, 
but we are also a nation that believes strongly in social 
justice.  Right now, even the best governments that have sat in 
the National Assembly have been unable to implement a genuine 
policy of resource distribution and full employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been unable to do so because monetary policy is 
decided in Ottawa.  The major levers for regulating the labour 
market are in the hands of the Minister of Finance, and the 
Government of Quebec has tools that are very secondary but that 
make dialogue between the parties impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are well aware that the countries—I am thinking of Sweden 
and Norway—that have come close to achieving full employment have 
been successful in getting employers, union representatives, 
representatives of community groups, educators and, of course, 
economic decision makers to sit down together, to agree on a 
certain number of objectives, and to implement them.  In a 
federal system such as ours, this is not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example. 
It is well known that the federal government has turned around 
and deprived the provinces of close to $11 billion in transfer 
payments.  Do members think that this began with a dialogue and 
that the provinces were involved in these macroeconomic 
decisions?  Of course not.  This was authority speaking. It 
shows that federalism is incompatible with the full employment 
policies that Quebec will implement when it gains control of all 
these levers as a sovereign state.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Peterborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense my remarks directly relate to what was just said. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My speech will deal mainly with early childhood, and the 
challenge of finding the means to work along with the provinces. 
I believe we can make considerable progress together. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we as governments, federal, provincial and territorial, 
work together with communities to support children and their 
families, particularly very young children, so that the 
development of those children can be as good as we can 
collectively make it?  That is my subject. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I have chosen that subject, in the context of the 
Speech from the Throne, is something which the Prime Minister 
said in his response to the Speech from the Throne.  He said 
“Together with the provinces we have begun to put in place the 
national children's agenda to improve supports for families and 
children.  I believe this work has to be accelerated.  So do 
provincial premiers.  We must move as quickly as possible from 
talk to action.  Today I challenge all governments to have in 
place by December 2000 a federal-provincial agreement consistent 
with the social union framework to strengthen supports for early 
childhood development, an agreement on principles and objectives 
on measuring outcomes and reporting to Canadians and an agreement 
on a five year timetable for increased federal and provincial 
funding to achieve our shared objectives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge is how we can do such a deal.  How can we work 
with the other governments in the country to do the right deal 
and not just any deal for children?  How can we do it in about 14 
months?  How can we do it by December 2000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the only way we can conceive of a deal is to think of it 
as sort of a national project for all of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of elements of success in place already.  The 
first is perhaps the whole question of knowledge.  What do we 
know about optimum developmental paths for all children, 
particularly those in the zero to six population?  As the finance 
minister said yesterday in his annual economic update, quoting 
Dr. Fraser Mustard, “There is powerful new evidence from 
neuroscience that the early years of development, from conception 
to age six, particularly for the first three years, set the base 
for competence and coping skills that will affect learning, 
behaviour and health throughout life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The science also tells us that an additional factor for success 
is what we do at the community level.  It is not simply a 
question of socioeconomic status, it is what happens at the level 
where we all live and breath, the level of the neighbourhood. 
Social cohesion is a positive factor which goes beyond income in 
explaining why some kids do better than others.  There was a 
recent article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on Port Colborne, 
Ontario which talked about “wovenness” as being the magic, the 
secret which takes us beyond income into good results for kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first asset that we can bring to the table is the knowledge 
base which is growing exponentially in this area.  The second is 
that the provinces are increasingly on side.  It was 
extraordinary to hear the recent Speech from the Throne from 
Ontario in which the lieutenant governor said these words on 
behalf of her government: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your government believes that, to realize their full potential, 
children must get off to the best possible start in life.  The 
most important period of development is the three years 
immediately following birth.  That is why it is so important to 
nurture and support children's development from the moment they 
are born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on the pioneering work of world renowned expert Dr. 
Fraser Mustard and child advocate the Hon. Margaret McCain, the 
government is committed to a bold new initiative that ultimately 
will extend early development opportunities to every child and 
parent in Ontario.  Recently announced demonstration projects are 
merely the beginning.  Your government is determined to remain 
the national leader in early child development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Government of Ontario.  It is surprising perhaps to 
some, considering its other social policies, but that is a great 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in British Columbia the Hon. Moe Sihota recently 
announced a major new initiative in the area of child care and 
invited federal participation once again. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very familiar with the case of Quebec, which made a 
societal promise to its children, particularly its very young 
ones, with its $5-a-day child care centres.  They are a kind of 
gold standard for the rest of the country.  They are the summit 
we are all striving to reach, to use the vocabulary of social 
union. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can find allies among the provinces across the country. 
In a meeting held in Kananaskis with the social services 
ministers as recently as October 26, ministers said the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers also reviewed joint work currently under way in both 
social services and health sectors on early childhood 
development, including possible areas where governments can work 
together.  Ministers agreed that this work should form the basis 
for responding to the federal government's invitation in the 
Speech from the Throne to work together in this area.  They 
committed to working with federal, provincial, and territorial 
ministers of health to move forward as quickly as possible on 
early childhood development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day their counterparts, the ministers who constitute 
the provincial-territorial council on social policy renewal, made 
the same point: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers stressed the urgent need for action on children's 
issues, building on the leadership taken by provinces and 
territories and the co-operative work with the federal 
government.  Ministers emphasized the need to move forward on the 
national children's agenda. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now seems to be the time for us all to go forward, as we have 
the provinces enthusiastically responding to the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the assets we can bring to the table, including our own 
efforts, the knowledge base and the provinces, the greatest 
assets surely are the communities themselves.  Communities are 
where we live and breathe.  Communities are where our children 
develop through schools, through play contacts, through all of 
the things which make life worth living in our private lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this the most exciting part.  This morning I was at a 
breakfast meeting in Ottawa-Carleton with the Success by Six 
group, an extraordinary alliance spearheaded by the 
Ottawa-Carleton Board of Education and the United Way, bringing 
together 85 different entities, agencies, the voluntary sector 
and government departments, to work together to improve outcomes 
for the zero to six population.  The spirit of enterprise and 
excitement in the room of working together to produce a kind of 
seamless web of services so that all children and their parents 
will be given optimum support was tremendous.  It was heartening. 
We have in the nation's capital a demonstration project, one 
chosen by the Ontario government as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I was in Toronto with a similar group, called the 
Early Years Action Group, from North York.  It is happening 
across the country.  In Vancouver we can find Opportunities for 
Youth.  In Montreal we have Un Deux Trois Go.  In other words, we 
have a huge resource base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have allies like the United Way of Canada, which we are aware 
of this month as its flags are fluttering across Canada to remind 
us of the annual campaign.  This network covers 87% of Canada. 
There is a huge sector of civil society that wants to participate 
in the national children's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we need to do?  We need a deal which is something like 
the Canada Health Act.  The Prime Minister talks of objectives 
and principles.  We also need a deal which deals with outcomes. 
The Prime Minister talks of outcomes and accountability in public 
reporting.  We need a deal which has money.  The money has to 
come in the form of an early childhood development services fund, 
with resources coming from the provinces and the federal 
government, accessed by communities after they have determined 
what they need to do the right job for kids from birth to six, so 
that those children will be ready to learn and ready for life by 
the time they enter the school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we need to do.  It means that we have to sign on a 
group of provinces.  It means that we have to see working 
examples in the next 12 months of how communities can work 
together, such as they are doing in Ottawa-Carleton and in 
Ontario in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a plan which focuses on all children and, as Minister 
Marland of Ontario said the other day, a plan which is 
affordable, available and accessible to all children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a huge task to complete this part of the promise of the 
Speech from the Throne.  It will involve all of us in all of our 
communities doing our best to work with the provincial 
governments, the federal government, communities and the 
voluntary sector to make this dream of a national project of 
making all of Canada's children as ready to learn as they 
possibly can be by the time they enter school a reality.

of the points in the Speech from the Throne which we now think of 
as the children's agenda.  We just heard that he has a 
fundamental understanding of the area, as well as an 
understanding as a member of parliament on what needs to be done 
to push things of this sort through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it would be interesting if the member could give us 
some sense of the work and the proposals of the subcommittee 
dealing with the children's agenda and youth at risk which he 
chaired in the previous parliament.  Could he give some sense of 
that?  Also, could he give us his thoughts on how that 
subcommittee might proceed, or is it going to proceed?   What is 
it likely to do between now and the budget when we hope that many 
of the things in the Speech from the Throne will become engraved 
in stone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the subcommittee to which 
the member referred is a subcommittee of the HRD committee.  It 
is the subcommittee on children and youth at risk.  So far we

populated by real supporters of children.  It has gone beyond 
partisanship.  We are really working together on a common 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have tried to do is to understand both risk factors for 
children, but also what are the best developmental pathways; what 
can we know from the science base about what works and how we can 
make sure that that knowledge gets across the country. The task 
for us between now and the budget, should our committee be 
reconstituted by the all seeing wisdom of the chairman of the 
human resources development committee, is to focus on the 
unfinished business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must determine what it is that we can do by way of 
encouragement and demonstration to show how communities are 
already doing this and that this is not an abstract reality. 
There is a huge amount of enthusiasm across Canada for this.  The 
committee can highlight the successes and give us heart so that 
we may make national what we have been doing so successfully in 
communities across Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak in the debate on the Speech from the 
Throne.  I am very proud to have the opportunity to speak on 
behalf of the people of the Peterborough riding and the city as 
well as our country.  It is a great honour.  Each time this 
occurs it makes me proud.  I work hard so that my constituents 
will be equally proud of me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne is being described as one which sets 
out the government's children's agenda.  We assume that we are 
now moving toward a budget based on the Speech from the Throne 
which is going to be focused on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a different approach from that of my 
colleague from Don Valley West who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that there was a huge emphasis on children in the 
Speech from the Throne.  It is also true that this was not 
sudden.  It was not something that was pulled out of a hat.  It 
is something that has been developing.  We heard one aspect on 
the work of the subcommittee of human resources development. It 
is something that has been going on since the Liberal government 
was elected in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly impressed by something when we began those 
three years of cuts, those horrific years when all Canadians paid 
the price of the staggering $42 billion deficit that we inherited 
from previous governments.  One of the things I remember in that 
first year of the cuts was that in my riding, when money was 
being taken out of the system in great quantities, new money 
appeared for prenatal and postnatal care. 
There was new money to support centres in which parents could 
learn to nurture their children in the best possible way. Even in 
those dark years the foundations for this Speech from the Throne 
and for what I hope will appear in the budget were already being 
laid.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a document which summarizes the Speech from the Throne. I 
will try to give some of the context for the so-called children's 
agenda.  The context includes the fact that we have to consider 
parents and families before children are conceived and born.  I 
have mentioned prenatal care and some of those aspects which we 
have been doing.  It is mentioned again in the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have to think of the children themselves, which my 
colleague was just talking about. My colleague said in great 
detail that we have to work with the provinces and there are 
signs that the provinces are going to work with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to make a third investment in the national child 
benefit.  There are now billions of dollars in the national child 
benefit.  These funds go directly to children and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My only regret is that in Ontario the provincial government 
chose to take an equivalent amount away from those families on 
social assistance.  For whatever reason, I do not know.  It 
appears to think there is some stigma for families on social 
assistance. I do not know how children carry stigma so I regret 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit is helping children and families 
directly. The government says that there will be further tax 
relief for children and families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of parental leave, there is a great increase in 
leave for parents, a doubling of it, which I strongly support. 
This will help parents, and by that I mean quite literally 
mothers and fathers, to nurture their children.  Parental leave 
is not for the parents, it is for the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that as that provision is brought in there will be 
very real help, support and advice for smaller businesses that 
have to adjust to this new regime.  I support it strongly but I 
recognize that tiny businesses have difficulty adjusting to 
changes of this type.  I hope when the time comes to deal with 
that, there will be help for those small businesses. There are 
other things as well, such as making the federal government a 
workplace that is more family friendly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all for children. We have to think of children before 
they are born, after they are born and in their very early years 
as we were discussing.  However, we cannot leave it at that. The 
Speech from the Throne also considers children as they become 
young adults, youth, teenagers and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this agenda there is a program to hire youth to staff the 
community Internet access sites across the country.  There is the 
launch of exchanges Canada.  Every year over 100,000 young 
Canadians will have a chance to move around the country.  Many of 
us remember Katimavik with great fondness.  It is great to think 
of the children mentioned in this agenda growing up and having 
this opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very interesting program gives younger Canadians from the age 
of 13 an opportunity to produce their first works using 
traditional and new technologies in the arts, cultural, digital 
and similar industries.  What a wonderful thing.  Then there is a 
plan to give tens of thousands of young Canadian volunteers the 
opportunity to work in literacy programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are prenatal children, infants and then youth. Now we go 
to when children are a little older. The government has already 
committed to the Canadian education savings grants.  They are 
like RRSPs.  Families can buy RESPs.  This puts tax-free money 
aside to support the education of their young people.  When they 
put that money aside, in addition they get a 20% grant up to a 
value of $2,000.  That is already there for children as they are 
growing up. 
Families that are looking after their infants can be preparing 
for their children to go to college or university later on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other programs of that type, particularly 
the Canadian millennium scholarship fund.  This is a scholarship 
fund for well qualified but needy students, if that is the right 
expression, students who need the support. They will be 
academically good students who need financial support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We usually say 100,000 students a year but we tend to forget 
that the foundation is set up in such a way that it will be 
100,000 students a year for 10 years.  One million Canadian 
students.  These students are infants now and they will be cared 
for even better through the children's agenda.   One million 
students will have an opportunity to receive those scholarships 
to help them get an education so they can lead creative and 
productive lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to go even further than students in college and 
university.  We started with children at the prenatal stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in the Speech from the Throne has committed to 
increasing the funding for the granting councils.  Those are the 
councils which fund social science research, natural science 
research, medical research. They are the councils which support 
the arts and so on. Those are the ones which allow our most 
creative people to fulfil themselves so they can make Canada a 
much better place. When today's infants grow up, they will be in 
a much richer society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the Medical Research Council.  In the same vein, the 
Speech from the Throne said that we will table legislation to 
fund the Canadian institutes for health research.  This is going 
to be an extraordinary development for the Medical Research 
Council which supports medical research now.  It will link the 
Medical Research Council to research institutes and institutions, 
to practising hospitals all across the country, to local cancer 
societies like the one in Peterborough, to community colleges 
like Sir Sandford Fleming College in Peterborough which have 
programs to look after the elderly and conduct research. The new 
Canadian institutes for health research will help every Canadian 
in the whole country to become healthier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a great pleasure for me to speak in this throne 
speech debate.  I look forward to the budget which as we all know 
is necessary to put these wonderful policies into effect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. 
colleague as he discussed the throne speech. In particular, I 
found interesting the issue of the Canadian institutes for health 
research. It is a new idea to me.  Can the hon. member explain 
what exactly these institutes will be doing and how that ties in 
with a children's agenda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
her question.  I would have to say that had I been giving a 
different speech, this is one of the most significant 
developments not only in research, but in the application of 
research results in Canada in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a confederation.  The strength of a confederation is 
that all the different parts of it have a chance to be creative. 
If one lives in Nova Scotia, one can be creative within the Nova 
Scotian context.  If one lives in Alberta, one can be creative 
within the Alberta context.  In addition, because it is a 
confederation, one can be creative at the national level.  One 
can take an idea in Nova Scotia or an idea in Quebec and bring it 
up to the national level and then to the international level.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger of confederation as far as research is concerned is 
that if we are not careful we will have lots and lots of people 
all doing their own thing, all reinventing the wheel and so on, 
without this co-ordination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian institutes for health research will be linked 
centres all the way across the country that will draw on the 
expertise of their regions and feed it in to the national scene 
so that when there is a good idea somewhere it will not be lost. 
By the way, it will not simply be lost in the morass of 
information that exists in our world.  Nor will it be lost by 
someone going to the United States or some other jurisdiction. It 
will capture that idea and bring it forward to the benefit of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has always been the main engine of 
medical research, but there has always been other research. All 
sorts of hospitals, institutes and organizations are doing 
research of some sort.  The purpose of this new system of 
Canadian institutes for health is to capture all that creativity 
to the benefit of all Canadians and, I do not think it is 
immodest, to the benefit of the health of everyone on the globe. 
I thank my colleague for her question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for my friend from Peterborough about 
a very important growing problem in the country, the issue of 
homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech talked about a general vision of the country 
but there is no reference to homelessness.  Even more important, 
yesterday I was in London, Ontario, for the financial statement 
and fiscal update of the minister of finance.  When I looked 
through that statement I did not see any reference whatsoever to 
homelessness.  I am wondering whether or not this worries the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the other night I was walking toward the Congress Centre 
and there were some 1,400 Liberals at a fundraiser.  I think it 
cost $350 a plate.  As I was walking with a certain friend who 
shall be unidentified, a couple of homeless guys were standing 
outside asking for money.  It just struck me as rather ironic 
that this friend of mine, a very distinguished member of the 
House, would be stopped by these two homeless people.  They knew 
who was the Prime Minister.  They called out my name and things 
of that sort.  I did not have the heart to tell them that the 
Prime Minister was having a fundraiser at the Congress Centre, 
because it cost $350 each to get in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It struck me as strange, when we have a $10 billion surplus for 
this coming fiscal year and around $100 billion accumulating over 
the next five years, that in the 45 minute speech yesterday by 
the Minister of Finance there was not even a reference to 
homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering whether the member across the way shares my 
concern that the Minister of Finance is forgetting about a very 
important growing social problem, not only in my province but in 
his as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I share the concern of my 
colleague from the NDP about this matter, but I do not share his 
concern about the interest of the government in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give a couple of examples from my own riding.  In 
Peterborough the federal government funded the forum on 
homelessness attended by one of my friend's colleagues.  That 
forum and the study associated with it identified the nature of 
homelessness very seriously in a rural small town environment as 
distinct from some of the larger urban communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having identified those problems moneys have started to flow to 
solve them.  For example, there is in Peterborough now a housing 
resource centre which helps people, young people, older people, 
and very old people in some cases, search more effectively for a 
home.  The federal government was able to work with the county 
and the city to deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more recently we had a meeting with representatives of 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, one of the federal 
government's main arms in this regard.  Like my colleague I would 
urge the government to give Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation more resources in the social housing area. 
Nevertheless, in my riding two weeks ago CMHC was able to fund a 
substantial project, a refuge for homeless women.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that homelessness is a serious problem.  It is my sense, 
and I hope it proceeds very quickly, that the federal government 
is beginning to tackle these problems.  I thank my colleague for 
his question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start my comments on the throne speech delivered on 
October 12 in my first language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech is entitled “Building a Higher Quality of 
Life for All Canadians”.  My understanding is that we are trying 
to provide a better quality of life in the future for our 
children.  A large part of the throne speech is directed to 
children and the agenda of the government to improve the quality 
of life of children to ensure they have a good foothold in the 
new millennium, to ensure they have an economic future, an 
educational future and are wealthy, healthy Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government not to care only about certain 
sectors of the population.  It should truly live up to its 
promise that all Canadians will have the same opportunity 
regardless of where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the interconnectedness which the Minister of 
Industry highlighted.  Internet connection will be a major part 
of Canadian development in a very short time.  However, small 
communities in my riding cannot necessarily make a career or a 
livelihood by bringing Internet into their homes.   We live in 
the middle of the forest.  We live in the middle of abundant 
resources.  This is the direction we should be working toward. We 
should be training our people to be engineers so that they can 
make master plans of the resources in those regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians were told to wait a month until the House of 
Commons returned to listen to a throne speech in October we 
thought of a grand vision.  I am trying to make the best of the 
throne speech.  I understand that our children and their journey 
are a major part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must afford our children the wisdom of our elders so that 
they have the strength of their families and are connected with 
their communities.  Then children can stand with pride knowing 
who they are and where they are going.  They can figure out what 
is right and what is wrong in life and can go forward with that 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech a promise was given to a certain group of 
elders that should be truly recognized, our veterans.  As we are 
close to Remembrance Day I wanted to raise this issue.  We talk 
about merchant marines, the mariners who supplied our troops 
abroad with many provisions in times of war.  These people were 
not truly recognized in an honourable way and have been asking to 
be treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other veterans I would like to speak about at this time are 
aboriginal veterans.  Aboriginal veterans in some cases 
disenfranchised themselves from their treaty status to fight for 
peace in the world.  Upon returning home other veterans were 
afforded economic development opportunities and land grants, but 
these grants and opportunities were not given to aboriginal 
veterans.  They were not treated equally.  I ask my colleagues in 
the House on the government side to look at treating aboriginal 
veterans fairly and equally.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a child grows education is crucial in this day and age. There 
are young pages in the House of Commons who are seeking knowledge 
and gaining life experiences just by being here.  That is what I 
challenge other youth to do as well.  They should leave the 
schools, move around Canada and experience life elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech challenges all of us to experience the beauty 
of Canadian geography, history and people.  I challenge people in 
Quebec to go to Saskatchewan and to the north.  I challenge 
people in British Columbia and the prairies to go to downtown 
Toronto to see what life is like in a big metropolitan centre.  I 
challenge the Blue Jays to play rubberball with children in La 
Loche.  I challenge the Edmonton Oilers to play street hockey 
with homeless people in downtown Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should enjoy each other's lives and the gifts that we have. 
Let us not put ourselves on a higher pedestal.  We are all 
Canadians.  We all live on the same beautiful land.  Just because 
some people have a different paycheque than others, it does not 
afford them a different status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned about the economy in grade 12 economics.  Money can 
circulate as many times as it can in one region and afford a 
certain amount of value.  If the Canadian dollar is to retain its 
value in world markets, we have to circulate the Canadian dollar 
as many times as we can in Canada before it leaves the country. I 
also extend this advice to certain regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at my region and the people of Churchill River.  We have 
very few supermarkets.  We have very few butcher shops.  We do 
not have an abundance of hardware stores.  All our shopping and 
our economy are bound to the southern urban centres of Saskatoon, 
Prince Alberta, North Battleford and Meadow Lake. That is the sad 
place we are reaching in rural Canada.  Farm communities are 
evaporating as we speak.  Credit unions, schools and hospitals 
have been dismantled because the community no longer functions. 
That is the sad fact in rural and regional Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The urban centres cannot demand all the economy and strength of 
the country.  We have to share from coast to coast to coast.  We 
cannot all be Torontonians, Montrealers, or people of Regina and 
Vancouver.  It is not the dream of all Canadians to live in a 
huge city in suburban Canada.  I ask members to imagine living in 
the north, living in the wilderness.  Maybe with a satellite dish 
they could make billion dollar deals right there with e-commerce, 
as the industry minister said.  One does not have to be in a city 
to do this.  It could be done from one's home in Pierceland, La 
Ronge or Cold Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge Canadians to treat each other with respect.  I have 
seen an abundance of ill feelings among certain sectors and 
peoples in the country which just does not flow with the Canadian 
vision.  We have founded a nation where people from all over the 
world have found a home.  I say a home because that is basically 
what we are talking about.  The House of Commons is a home for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that for generations aboriginal people have 
held this country and land together, living in harmony with its 
nature and its unique gifts and challenges in a respectful way. 
That is the challenge I extend to everyone.  Let us live in that 
essence into the new millennium.  Let us live together.  Let us 
welcome people who find refuge here perhaps because of hard times 
in other parts of the world.  We have a lot to offer.  Let us not 
point them to the urban slums of our country.  Let us share the 
beauty of our villages, hamlets and little settlements of 15 
people that are so proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there is a community that built its own school out 
of logs.  One could not see a prouder student attending a school 
than those whose school was built by their aunts and uncles, 
mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the vision that a technologically innovative future 
is a school that is interconnected.  Could one of our 
grandparents connect a computer?  No.  It is our 12 and 15 year 
olds that connect the Apples and IBMs together, but we still have 
to put the two generations together.  They cannot travel on 
different journeys.  We have to envision them living in harmony 
together.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This opportunity to speak gives me the opportunity to thank the 
people I represent.  As I mentioned, this seat belongs to the 
people of Churchill River.  They are the ones who empower me to 
say these words.  That is the story I wish to tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a region that is called a boreal forest.  It is 
basically in the middle of the bush. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note:  Member spoke Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people of the woods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the highways in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
British Columbia and Manitoba go north and south.  The 
infrastructure is not the same in the north.  The north is 
basically a colony to the south.  Canadians have to stop treating 
the north like a food supply, a wood supply and a mineral supply. 
We have also at one time provided Britain with all the furs they 
needed.  All the beavers which came from the north were sent over 
there.  We cannot do that anymore.  We must be given due respect. 
We make our living in the north and envision our people and our 
children growing up in the north and sharing with the rest of the 
world. It cannot be done without us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no master plan for infrastructure in northern 
development.  We see logging roads and mining roads but when are 
the communities going to be connected?  When are the dots going 
to be connected to the northern villages?  We used to travel 
along the river east and west, but our highways are all north and 
south.  These roads do not connect our communities at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years we have had major discussions on national parks. 
I have one in my riding.  I believe six future parks are being 
committed for ecological integrity, national identity and for 
preservation and conservation.  These parks are targeted for the 
boreal forest.  However, we have to talk with the community 
members, the people who make their living off the land.  These 
people cannot be relocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC has brought in housing programs to urbanize northerners. 
Northern trappers and hunters have never been agrarian people. We 
have never lived in a commune for 24 hours a day, 365 days a 
year. We were hunters and gatherers who went 30, 40 or 100 miles 
to get the goods and bring them back to our families.  These 
people moved around.  The expanse is huge.  It is not like an 
agrarian centre where the farmers stayed in one central area. The 
hunter-gatherer society was a a totally different concept.  We 
cannot impose an agrarian principle on a hunter-gatherer.  Going 
into the bush is like going into a new world.  Welcome it because 
it is a beautiful place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the head offices of industrial and corporate developments 
in Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver but they have no presence in 
the north.  They have to leave legacies.  I challenge 
institutions such as universities, research centres and 
hospitals.  I challenge anyone in the House to identify anything 
that the Hudson's Bay Company has left in our northern villages. 
Not one swing, not one slide and not one hospital bed has been 
left by the Hudson's Bay Company in any of our northern 
communities. That is a shame.  That is not what corporate 
consciousness should be like here in Canada or in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the federal government to take leadership in 
northern development.  We have a department called Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development that has been comfortable with 
identifying north of 60 as the north.  The north is not north of 
60.  It is further south than that. The 55th parallel or even the 
53rd or 52nd parallel in some of our provinces is truly defined 
as the northern half of our provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on the agricultural crisis that is growing and 
offer my perspective on this whole process. The throne speech was 
very remiss in not identifying the farm income crisis.  The whole 
industrialization of the agricultural industry has taken its toll 
on the independent farmer.  It is beyond many of the factors that 
have come into play.  There are multinational interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four or five multinational companies that control the 
food and drug industry in the world.  They are not in this 
debate.  We have farm aid, which I just recently acknowledged. 
Country music is near and dear to many people in the country. 
Willie Nelson throws a major farm aid benefit in the U.S.  The 
non-profit farm aid corporation identifies its concerns with the 
multinational interests in farming. 
They say that no matter how much money or how much aid the 
farmers get, unless the corporations ease up on the input and 
output costs of the farm, it is the same corporations controlling 
both ends.  They basically have the farmers in the middle, in the 
crunch.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of floods, droughts and the extreme conditions 
we are getting from climate change will have an impact on the 
agricultural industry for years to come.  It is not only a short 
term problem, it will be a very long term issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of my local papers I was bold enough to raise the idea 
that maybe a royal commission should be commissioned to report on 
the family farm in order to protect it.  Let us document 1999 and 
the year 2000.  Let us show our children in documented form how 
the evolution of the farm came to be in Canada, where it should 
be going, what the factors are and who had their hands in the 
farm industry and economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers only get mere cents.  I understand that because in my 
riding there wild rice farmers, ranchers and trappers. I come 
from a generation of trappers and hunters.  When the fur industry 
fell down nobody helped us.  We had to look at ourselves and 
where we were going.  The fur industry is still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people just love living off the land.  There is pride living 
off the land and being able to provide one's family with the food 
and shelter they need.  A lot of our urbanized people who had 
lost touch with the land have regained a whole new connection 
with respect to the beauty of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father still goes out on the land, as did my grandparents 
before that.  That is the connectedness that we have to give our 
children for the future, as well.  Let us not remove them and put 
them all in an urban centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech contains grand promises for children, health 
and the environment.  We have the economy, diversity, 
technological change and all these exchanges being promised in 
the throne speech.  The challenge now for Canadians is to push 
the government to make good on its promises.  We have to make 
sure that the surpluses are spent right, that they are not going 
only into political strongholds or pockets.  We have to make sure 
that all Canadians benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to bring a message, on behalf of the people in the 
constituency I represent, that we are in northern Canada.  The 
people in Churchill River consider themselves as northerners. We 
cannot be brushed off as “those people from the west”.  We are 
living in western Canada but we live in the northern region, in 
the northern climate of the country.  It is a whole new and 
different economy with a new and different social community. When 
mining and timber industries make plans for one's backyard, it 
does have an effect on the north but does not affect the social 
or economic well-being in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of our people, I beg for a change in the freshwater 
fish marketing industry that I spoke about earlier.  The 
government is deregulating airlines, railroads, power utilities, 
telephone utilities and everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a freshwater fish marketing that does not even allow our 
people to sell across the border.  The people in the community of 
Pierceland, just a stone's throw away from the Alberta border, 
cannot even sell their pickerel to Cold Lake which is just across 
the border.  They have to sell it all the way down in Winnipeg 
which is one big fishing plant.  By then the fish is not fresh 
anymore.  It is old, frozen fish by the time it leaves that 
plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone wanting to buy fresh fish should come to the northern 
lakes and buy it right off our docks.  We will fillet it, dry it, 
even smoke it and ship it.  Maybe we can use e-commerce to make 
us economically viable as world traders.  The deregulation of the 
freshwater fish industry has to happen.  It is a far cry today 
from what it actually intended to be 30 years ago. I think a lot 
of northern fishers were blindsided by the promises of the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the government for making bold promises, but we, 
as Canadians, are here to say that we have to go through with our 
promises, especially when we are dealing with the future of 
children.  If it is a children's agenda, let us not sway from the 
promises being made.  We will hold the government true to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will ask one straightforward question and then I will follow up 
with a second question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested in knowing what language the member started his 
speech off with because I was fascinated by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member on his speech.  It is seldom that we see 
people get up in the House and speak from their hearts as this 
man obviously did.  When we speak from the heart we put all our 
political stripes aside.  We have to admire a person for being 
able to do that when we know that he truly means it and that it 
is not some canned speech that has been written for him by some 
other group.  I appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to the throne speech and the title, “A Better 
Quality of Life”.  The member may know that I spent some time in 
the Indian affairs department as one of the critics.  My mission 
was going across the country and visiting as many reserves as I 
possibly could, which ended up being several hundred, and 
visiting with grassroots people.  I did not visit with the elite. 
I did not visit with chiefs and council.  I talked to people face 
to face and tried to see the problems from their point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the member one example of the reserve in my riding. 
It is in the most beautiful spot one could ever ask for in 
Alberta.  It borders the grand Banff National Park.  It is a huge 
reserve with a tremendous amount of agricultural land and many 
hills and trees.  It has a river running through it and a huge 
lake where a lot of people gather for skiing, boating and things 
of that nature.  Highway 1, a major interprovincial highway, runs 
through the reserve.  Approximately 10 million people drive 
through this reserve on an annual basis as they head for Banff 
National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on this reserve the unemployment rate is 90%.  The debt 
load is huge.  Approximately 16% of children who start their 
education complete it by grade 12.  Most of them are in schools 
outside of the reserve.  Poverty is at its greatest. In the 
member's view, what kind of quality of life does the throne 
speech promise for the people who are suffering on many of these 
reserves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my first language is 
Cree.  I was raised speaking Cree and I had to go to school to 
learn English.  I am a very fortunate person to have that 
language.  It is a gift from the Creator.  In order to speak from 
the heart, as I did in my speech today, I had to open with my 
language.  That is how I opened the door to share that with the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member highlighted one reserve in his question and wanted to 
know what the throne speech had to offer.  The throne speech 
aside, the relationship between aboriginal communities, mine 
included, and the rest of Canada is a major challenge that 
started 500 years ago.  The challenge is whether we can live with 
each other's laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say each other because we have grown accustomed to and have 
lived under the British North America Act and the laws that came 
through Britain and this House for all of Canada.  However, can 
Canadians who came to this continent live with the aboriginal 
laws and policies?  That is where the empowerment is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people could see that giving up a way of life and 
allowing other people to live on their land was a major 
investment.  However, if those people can build their houses, 
build their roads, teach their children, preserve their language 
and make their people healthy, then they will feel a sense of 
pride that will take them and ignite them and keep the cycle of 
life going.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a linear journey; it is a cycle.  We only serve one 
cycle.  So when aboriginal people are given an opportunity to 
prove to their community that they can achieve something in a 
respectful way, that is the investment that will take us into the 
next generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the throne speech, I said that I would not get 
political in my speech, so I cannot slam anybody for not having 
anything in there.  What we have to do in the relationships we 
have in the new millennium, among our communities, is to live 
with each other and respect each other's laws and ways of life. 
That will take us forever. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, like my Reform colleague, I would like to thank the 
member for Churchill River for opening the door to the discussion 
of the diversity of this country, which is the strength of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Liberal government tends to govern from the 
point of view of urban Canada.  That creates a lot of problems. 
One of the existing rural problems is the farm crisis in western 
Canada.  It is very difficult to convince the people who live in 
urban surroundings that the problem is real.  It is much like the 
situation faced by constituents of Churchill River, who live in 
the northern part of Saskatchewan, which is different from the 
southern, rural, agricultural based economy.  We can see why 
there are so many difficulties encountered, certainly in the 
House, in getting the message through to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is much like the problems of the Freshwater Fish Marketing 
Board, which exists in my constituency.  Not only is my riding 
agricultural, but because we have freshwater lakes we also have 
fishermen.  The problems of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board 
in determining where fish can be sold can be compared to the 
farmers who face restrictions and penalties under the Canadian 
Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of problems.  If we are really going to look at a 
new way of governing the people of this country we have to look 
at new vehicles and measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have any ideas on how we can get rid of 
institutions like the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board and the 
Canadian Wheat Board, or at least make them more flexible so they 
meet the needs of the people they are supposed to serve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Madam Speaker, I had an opportunity 
to travel through the city of Dauphin.  It was the first time I 
realized that it was in the interlake area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare not compare the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board to the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  Freshwater fish have to be fresh.  We 
cannot wait for fish to go to market.  Wheat and other grains can 
wait. We see silos and holding elevators all over the prairie 
provinces.  These containers can hold their grains for months on 
end, but we cannot hold fish.  It has to be fresh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most delicate fish is pickerel.  It is the best fish to be 
eaten, right out of the lake, into the frying pan.  If we buy it 
in markets it is drowned fish.  My uncle, who is a professional 
fisherman, tells us that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fresh fish is not governed by the Freshwater Fish Marketing 
Board.  That is frozen fish.  It is like McCain's fish and chips 
in the store.  That is not the nutritional fish that comes from 
our lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot compare the Canadian Wheat Board to the Freshwater 
Fish Marketing Board.  That is all I can say.  There is no 
comparison.  The federal control that the hon. member was 
referring to is a whole different thing.  When we talk about 
freshwater fish, let us keep it fresh.  Let us sell it as 
directly as we can to the markets. 
Let us bring the processing plants back to those little 
communities.  The processing jobs, the jobs of the people who 
fileted the fish, who gutted the fish in our little plants, all 
went to Transcona.  It is a sad fact.  There could have been one 
or two jobs in Williston Lake, which has a community of 200 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is truly an honour for me to speak today on the 
address in reply to the Speech from the Throne.  Before I begin, 
however, I would like to give a bit of an explanation of the 
context of the aspect of the speech on which I am going to 
concentrate: the chairs of excellence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine there is a 
university.  It is the Loyola Campus of Concordia University.  On 
the Island of Montreal we have four major universities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Université de Montréal, McGill, the two campuses of 
Concordia, and the Université du Québec à Montréal.  I have had 
the honour and the privilege of studying at three of these: 
Concordia, McGill and UQAM. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, when the representatives of the universities came to see me 
after the 1997 election to tell me of their need for more money 
for the research councils, funding for innovation, for 
infrastructure, and for the researchers themselves, I was very 
pleased to be able to support their approaches to the government 
for this funding. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, in previous budgets the Canadian government 
announced the creation of the Canadian Foundation for Innovation 
with a $1 billion endowment fund.  The foundation was to create 
the physical infrastructure which the universities, institutes of 
research and the councils require.  However, we need the people. 
We need the researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been hearing a lot about the brain drain.  One thing is 
clear.  There has been a certain amount of brain drain in terms 
of our qualified researchers and our young graduates who, because 
of the lack of opportunities here, have been lured away to 
universities in the United States and elsewhere to undertake 
important research activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a great pleasure for me to learn that our government, 
through its throne speech, took on the challenge.  By doing so it 
has started a bold venture that will be one of the cornerstones 
of our effort as a government to ensure that Canada is the place 
to be, the place to live, the place that people want to come to 
and the place where people want to stay in the third millennium 
to take full advantage of the knowledge based society and economy 
of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is that bold venture?  That bold venture is the creation of 
the 21st century chairs for research excellence.  The government 
announced in its throne speech that through the research granting 
councils, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, 
the Medical Research Council and the Natural Sciences and 
Engineering Research Council, it will be funding the creation of 
1,200 new 21st century chairs for research excellence in Canadian 
universities over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a major investment.  We can be assured that our Canadian 
universities have received the information on this new project 
with great joy and happiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be investing in the first year $60 million, in the 
second year $120 million and in the third year and every 
subsequent year $180 million. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the objectives is not simply to rest on our laurels with 
1,200 chairs, it is ultimately to bring that number up to 2,000 
chairs of research excellence in the third millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these chairs of excellence going to do?  They are going 
to be two tiered.  One will be to attract our established star 
researchers who already have a proven record in their field of 
conducting leading research endeavours.  The second tier will be 
to attract our rising stars.  We have been losing on both fronts 
over the last years.  Everyone knows that the government in its 
fight to eliminate the deficit had to reduce funding to the 
research councils.  That obviously had a boomerang effect.  It 
meant that there was less money for researchers.  Therefore, 
researchers who wanted to continue conducting their work in some 
cases had to look elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating these 1,200 chairs of research excellence, and 
hopefully bringing them up to 2,000, we will be able to keep our 
proven star researchers and attract the rising stars.  All 
Canadian universities will be able to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To receive funding the universities will submit proposals to a 
competitive peer review process which will be administered by the 
three granting councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program sends a strong message, a strong signal that Canada 
is the place to be for research and development in the third 
millennium, that Canada is serious about fostering and nurturing 
a healthy research environment in Canada and that we are serious 
about nurturing and fostering a strong economy through knowledge 
and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we call added value.  The Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation, the expansion of the networks of centres of 
excellence and the development of the Canadian institutes of 
health research that the hon. member for Peterborough spoke about 
at great length are the cornerstones that will ensure that Canada 
will be the place to be for research and innovation in the third 
millennium.  Our renewed and increased funding to the granting 
councils is the added value, along with the 21st century chairs 
of research excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an innovative person, so I have a difficult time 
imagining what else we can do.  However, I am sure that with all 
of the bright minds in the House we will get many suggestions on 
what we can do to ensure that we are the place to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating these 1,200 chairs of research excellence we will 
have the best people doing research in Canada, which will create 
our next generation of the world's best.  The world's best will 
be here in Canada.  Our young researchers will seek out the top 
opportunities for work and they will choose Canada, both our 
young researchers in Canada as well as those from elsewhere. 
Graduate students will be looking for leaders, proven stars in 
research, to assist them in their research projects. Because 
there will be the first tier for the star researchers with a 
proven track record, they will want to come to our Canadian 
universities to complete their graduate and post-graduate 
studies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program for the 21st century chairs for research excellence 
builds on the comprehensive strategy to boost innovation that 
this Liberal government has been implementing over the last three 
years.  As I mentioned, that includes a $1 billion endowment for 
the Canada foundation for innovation, the expansion of the 
networks of centres of excellence, the Canadian institutes for 
health research with $500 million over three years and the 
renewal of funding to our granting councils. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased that the hon. member and some of her government 
colleagues have finally recognized the brain drain phenomenon. 
The number of people for instance going to the U.S. from Canada 
has grown from 17,000 to about 86,000 in I believe the last 12 
years.  It is very, very important. The fact is that Nortel is 
losing 300 to 400 software engineers per year to the U.S. This is 
very, very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member seems to believe with some level of 1970s 
Liberal economic naivete that all this can be solved with 
government intervention.  This is despite the fact that most of 
the companies that are affected are pointing to the tax system as 
having a significant and deleterious impact on our ability to 
keep people here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three areas that are raised most frequently by the 
high tech sector.  The capital gains tax system is effectively 
twice as oppressive in Canada than in the U.S. That affects those 
in the high tech sector because of stock options.  Also, our top 
marginal tax rate kicks in at $60,000 in Canada.  The equivalent 
top marginal tax threshold in the U.S. does not occur until 
$420,000 Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that some of those stars we are trying to keep 
are probably in that over $60,000 tax level, so it is very 
important that we address those issues.  I look forward to the 
hon. member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B>  Madam Speaker, I recognize that 
there has been some brain drain.  I also recognize the problem in 
Canada that there are people who have skills and training, but 
because of the lack of a standardized recognition of licences and 
diplomas from province to province, Canadians have a hard time 
being mobile from province to province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not dispute the figures the hon. member just mentioned. I 
have not looked at those figures so I cannot state whether or not 
they are accurate.  Given that your party has recently suffered— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I must interrupt the 
hon. member and ask her to address her remarks through the Chair, 
please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B>  Madam Speaker, you are quite 
correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the hon. member's party has recently suffered from 
its own brain drain with a member moving from the Progressive 
Conservative Party over to the Liberal Party of Canada, I will 
take that as an example of the hon. member having more personal 
experience about brain drain than I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about the issue of higher taxes here in 
Canada as compared to the United States.  Everybody knows that. 
Everybody knows that our personal income taxes are higher, 
approximately 10% I believe it is.  He may correct me on that. 
However, it is also known that our payroll taxes are much lower 
than those of most of the countries in the G-7, including the 
United States if I am not mistaken.  I may be corrected if I am 
mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has already been announced. The Minister of Finance already 
discussed the economic outlook for the next couple of years. 
I believe it is clear there will be a lessening of the personal 
income tax burden.  There already has been.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last couple of years $16 billion has been cut from 
personal income taxes.  That is where the 10% comes in.  It has 
come out to approximately 10% lower income taxes paid by the 
average Canadian.  There has been a steady decrease in personal 
income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget we removed the 3% surtax which the 
Progressive Conservative Party established when it formed the 
government.  That in itself is a major impact.  We will be 
reducing taxes.  However, we will not do anything which will put 
into peril the health of our economy and put us back into a 
deficit position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is a great pleasure to rise in the House today to participate 
in the throne speech debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Her 
Excellency our new Governor General on her historic appointment. 
I wish her nothing but the very best of luck in the years ahead 
with her new and important responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's throne speech is a blueprint which lays the 
foundation for the government's plans in the years to come.  As 
we approach the new millennium, there is an unprecedented 
optimism in Canada's future which is captured in the eloquence of 
the throne speech.  What an unbelievable change from just a few 
short years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the last year of the Conservative government, Canada's 
fiscal house was crumbling on its very foundation.  The previous 
Conservative government let the debt skyrocket out of control for 
years and was operating with a $42 billion deficit.  The country 
was literally teetering on the brink of financial disaster. 
Liberals understood that if Canada was to be a global force to be 
reckoned with in the new millennium, we absolutely had to get 
this country back on track. Canada needed bold leadership, sound 
fiscal policy and unparalleled political courage to restore our 
national future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six years later, we have delivered.  Canada has moved from red 
ink to black ink, from pessimism to pride.  In four short years 
we eliminated the deficit and recorded a budgetary surplus of 
$3.5 billion in 1998, the first surplus in 28 years.  We have 
regained the capacity to make choices of how we build the future. 
We are now positioned to be a leader in the new and ever 
changing global arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This throne speech for the millennium builds upon our original 
and balanced and comprehensive plan.  We are committed to staying 
the course in an effort to improve the lives of each and every 
Canadian.  Our plan includes developing our children and youth, 
leaders for the 21st century; enhancing our dynamic economy; 
strengthening the quality of our health care; ensuring the 
quality of the environment; building stronger communities; and 
advancing Canada's place in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new global economy, knowledge and technological 
innovation are the cornerstones of a higher standard of living 
and a better quality of life.  This government is committed to 
Canada's role as a global leader in high technology.  This is 
very good news, especially for my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Nepean—Carleton is situated in the hub of Canada's 
fastest growing region of high technology firms, Silicon Valley 
North, as it has become known.  This region is responsible for 
75% of Canada's telecommunications research and development.  It 
boasts almost 1,000 advanced technology companies that employ 
more than 48,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From rather humble beginnings with agencies like the National 
Research Council and the Communications Research Establishment to 
companies like Bell Northern and Computing Devices, small 
companies have grown into large companies.  These companies in 
turn have spawned other companies featuring new products and new 
technology.  This cycle continues to create jobs and prosperity 
and export dollars for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital that the government remains committed to promoting 
Canada's role as a leader in new technologies.  Month by month 
the government's policies aimed at growth in this sector of the 
economy continue to bear fruit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, Nortel Networks announced that it plans to invest 
$330 million in Canada to enhance its booming optical networking 
business, tripling overall production capacity by next year. 
Montreal and Ottawa are the greatest beneficiaries of this major 
capital infusion.  New high tech facilities will be constructed 
in both cities with approximately 2,300 new jobs shared between 
the two. 
In total, Nortel expects to invest $210 million in Ottawa and an 
additional $120 million in Montreal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last July, JDS Uniphase, which employs close to 2,400 
workers in my riding, unveiled its new 500,000 square foot 
research facility in Nepean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both announcements and the scores of others we hear on a regular 
basis from this industry are indicative of the high level of 
confidence in Canada's high technology future and the future of 
the Ottawa area as Silicon Valley North. This is a clear sign 
that globally renowned companies on the cutting edge of the new 
information technologies recognize that Canada is indeed the 
place to be in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a few words about the finance minister's fiscal 
update which he delivered yesterday.  It is clearly a fundamental 
and integral component of the government's plans for the years 
ahead as expressed in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Profound congratulations are in order for the Minister of 
Finance.  Yesterday he delivered an economic statement that can 
only be described as extraordinary.  He has done an absolutely 
superb job.  Together, the throne speech and the economic and 
fiscal update are a one-two punch for Canada that moves us into a 
class by ourselves.  Together these two documents show tremendous 
leadership and vision by the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance's economic statement is consistent with 
what the government has said all along, that the Canadian economy 
is very strong and our finances are very sound.  Unemployment is 
at a decade-long low.  Interest rates and inflation are both 
under control.  The forecast of unprecedented budget surpluses 
over the next five years is staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the finance minister's pledge to keep an open and 
transparent budget planning process.  The more Canadians know 
about and have input into our economic situation, the better the 
government can work to the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to express my unqualified support for the fact that the 
government is refusing to be complacent about fiscal 
responsibility.  The openness and care with which the contingency 
reserve funds are to be handled and the commitment to never fund 
tax relief with borrowed dollars are vitally important.  I am 
sure this is a great comfort to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about our future prosperity, the foundation for 
which has been laid by the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Finance and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and most crucial, yesterday's economic and fiscal update 
made it abundantly clear that skills, knowledge and building a 
more innovative economy remain the critical investment priorities 
of this government.  Beginning at the earliest stages of 
development right through to post-secondary education and beyond, 
the government's plan for the future displays a lifetime 
commitment to our children for their lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of the extension of parental EI benefits, of the $7 
billion national child benefit system, of the $1.2 billion 
Canadian opportunities strategy, and of the Canada education 
savings grant, as merely the beginning of the initiatives which 
the government will take on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment in Canadian prosperity does not stop there.  It 
is well acknowledged that the societies which will thrive over 
the next decade not just economically but in all aspects are 
those societies which excel at innovation.  We must foster an 
economic environment which will make our brightest minds want to 
stay and innovate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed multi-year program for sustained and broad based 
tax relief is a fundamental component of our economic and fiscal 
plans.  The underlying philosophy of the government's approach to 
tax cuts were conveyed in yesterday's economic statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the Minister of Finance directly: “There are many 
reasons for reducing taxes.  However, there is one I would like 
to mention because it is too frequently overlooked.  It is quite 
simply that Canadians are entitled to keep more of the money they 
earn.  After all, they worked for it. It is theirs”. Those are 
the words of our finance minister, a true tax cutter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reduction of employment insurance premiums for the sixth 
consecutive year will also put a further $1.2 billion into the 
pockets of Canadians.  The determination of the government to 
make our business tax system internationally competitive will 
keep jobs, and of equal importance, brain power, innovation and 
excellence in Canada where they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take this opportunity to say a few words concerning how 
the throne speech relates to Canada's place in the world.  There 
is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Canadians want their 
government to play an active, independent and internationalist 
role in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are our responsibilities as one of the most peaceful and 
prosperous countries on the face of the planet? 
There is an old saying that to whom much has been given much is 
expected.  The world has the right to expect a lot from Canada 
through our involvement in the global community and we must not 
let it down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made and continue to make significant contributions to 
peacekeeping and international development.  With Canadian 
peacekeepers in Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor, just to mention 
some of the more significant deployments, we have the largest 
contingent of Canadians abroad since the Korean war.  With the 
recent announcements of more funds for international development 
assistance, combined with our peacekeeping, Canada is doing its 
share, but there is still much to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our foreign minister's human security agenda which seeks to 
enhance the safety of civilians in armed conflicts is in my view 
one of the most important foreign policy initiatives to come out 
of this country in decades.  While we have made progress on the 
land mines issue and the International Court of Justice, the 
challenges ahead are immense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, this is a throne speech that exudes confidence in 
Canada, our economic and social future, as well as our privileged 
place in the family of nations.  It is a throne speech that 
speaks to our achievements and looks ahead to the challenges and 
great opportunities that Canada faces in the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
once again I heard about the quality of life.  The hon. member 
knows that Canada was chosen by the United Nations as being the 
best country in which to live.  He also knows that if Indian 
reserves are factored in then that moves us to 35th.  That is a 
quote from the United Nations.  It is then far worse than some 
countries, even Mexico and Jamaica, with the life on the reserves 
factored in, with the poverty, the turmoil and the difficulties 
that exist there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be told that we need to put more money into the 
department because the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development is the only department that has had an increase in 
its budget every year since the government came into power.  It 
is not more money that is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the member suggesting that the government should do 
about the quality of life of the people who are ranked 35th in 
the world?  There are third world conditions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I feel that the hon. 
member opposite has misinterpreted or misunderstood the human 
development index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the opportunity just shortly after the index was released 
and the announcement made to go to the United Nations website and 
print out a huge document covering all aspects of the human 
development index.  The place that Canada occupies in the human 
development index is based on a wide range of factors which takes 
into account things like life expectancy, education and quality 
of health care.  There are an enormous number of criteria 
contained in that index.  As a result of taking into account all 
the criteria, Canada ranks number one in the world.  It is 
extraordinary that we have been in that place for the last six 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that in certain areas we cannot do better. 
Clearly, as it relates to our aboriginal population, we must do 
better.  Some initiatives the government has taken, and I am 
thinking specifically with respect to the Nisga'a treaty, lay the 
foundation for prosperity for our aboriginal peoples.  It points 
the way in terms of the self-government process which the 
government has adopted of allowing native Canadians to run their 
own affairs and to have some control over their future.  As bad 
as things may be for our native population according to the hon. 
member, things have to be kept in perspective with respect to how 
other parts of the world live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Reform Party has never been very keen on 
international development, but I had the opportunity to represent 
this country as a special envoy to Sierra Leone.  Sierra Leone is 
ranked last of 174 nations under the human development index. 
Having seen the conditions in which the people in that country 
live, I wish in some respects that many Canadians would have the 
opportunity to go to places like that so they could see how the 
poorest of the poor live.  I am sure they would probably feel as 
I did.  They would want to come back to this country and kiss the 
very ground we walk on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are blessed in this country.  We are prosperous.  Our country 
is peaceful compared to many other places in the world.  We have 
an obligation not just to help native Canadians and aboriginal 
Canadians but to help other people in the world through our 
international development assistance programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility to assist others who are in need.  The 
government takes that responsibility very seriously.  I am 
absolutely delighted that our government has taken the 
opportunity of the throne speech to announce more funds for 
international development because I think Canada does have a 
responsibility.  We are doing a great deal but we can always do 
more. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
share my time with the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents in the riding of 
Compton—Stanstead, I am pleased to speak to the Speech from the 
Throne.  I congratulate the new Governor General, Adrienne 
Clarkson, on her new challenge, which, I am sure, she will meet 
with dignity and wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few words on several matters not included 
in the throne speech, inadvertently no doubt. 
I realize that, in the throne speech, no one expects all the 
details, but it should at least contain an outline of all the 
areas of government responsibility. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to mention two items that were not addressed in the 
throne speech.  The first was national defence.  There was one 
line at the end of the speech which basically said nothing.  I 
will quote it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will also continue to ensure that Canadian Forces 
have the capacity to support Canada's role in building a more 
secure world and will further develop the capacity of Canadians 
to help ensure peace and security in foreign land. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first line is interesting.  I think we all know a lot better 
than that.  We have a national defence system that is dying of 
equipment rust out.  Yes, we do have a few pieces of state of the 
art equipment but we are lacking in 90% of our equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments around the world all know and say that national 
defence planning is long term.  In 1994 we put forth a white 
paper with a long term affordable plan.  This plan has now been 
put by the wayside.  If the standing committee had not 
concentrated on the quality of life of our soldiers, they would 
still be living below the poverty line.  Imagine working poor in 
our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Minister of National Defence for supporting 
the SCONDVA in the quality of life report to date.  I hope he 
will continue to do so.  There will be reports coming to the 
House giving us the heads up on quality of life issues, but I 
only wish the minister would follow through on the 1994 white 
paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1994 white paper is this government's document.  I would 
understand if it were from a previous government that it would 
not honour such a paper.  We do see this a lot.  This is a plan 
to which all parties agreed.  It is not a grandiose plan.  It is 
a plan to get our military back on its feet and to give our 
soldiers a better working chance to do their job with safe and 
modern equipment.  Our military is stretched to its limit in both 
manpower and equipment.  We cannot even work under our own flag 
when we take up peacekeeping duties throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at all the peacekeeping locations in which we are 
working under another country.  Small groups all over the world 
cost far more than having one brigade group under our own flag 
with proper rotation so that all our soldiers can get proper rest 
and family time.  This is a high stress job.  Many of the 
problems we see in our military are caused from this stress. 
Regular rotation and rest would reduce many of the physical and 
mental problems.  I could go on with many more details but there 
is a lack of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to discuss another subject which I did not see 
addressed in the throne speech, immigration.  I do not think 
anyone would argue against the fact that our immigration system 
is broken.  This was evident this summer with the west coast 
migrant problem.  This is but the tip of the iceberg.  The 600 
refugee claimants on the west coast represent only 2% of our 
annual total.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister had promised a new bill on immigration for 
October 1999.  Today is November 3, and from what I can see, 
this new bill is not on the agenda of the House or the standing 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of illegal refugees is very easy to understand.  It 
is a lot easier and quicker to enter Canada this way even if the 
practice is illegal and very dangerous for those who choose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Trucking Association urgently needs 5,000 employees 
that it cannot recruit in Canada.  However, our immigration 
system is slow to react. Two-year delays are unreasonable and 
unacceptable, particularly when there is a lack of knowledge 
about the qualifications required. For instance, seeing a doctor 
or an accountant delivering pizza or driving a taxi, seems 
ridiculous to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to describe a typical case seen by the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration, another department that stands out, 
unfortunately, for its inefficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1998, one of my constituents applied to the embassy in 
the Republic of Ghana for permanent residence for his wife, who 
was seven months pregnant.  The same month, approval was 
received from the provincial and federal governments.  It seems 
very, very simple. 
Several months passed and the only information the woman 
received about her application was that she would be called to 
an interview at some point in time.  She would then be asked to 
undergo a medical examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 8, 1999, in other words several months later, her 
husband came to my riding office to ask me to try to find out 
what I could about his file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The woman gave birth on January 8, 1999.  An initial e-mail was 
immediately sent to the embassy, requesting that I be told where 
the file was at. There was no reply. 
On February 16, 1999, the man got in touch with his wife, who 
said that the interview was to take place in March 1999 or as 
soon as an officer went to Bamako.  Depending on how the 
interview went, an medical examination would follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 1, 1999, another e-mail went out from my riding office 
to the embassy.  Once again, there was no reply. 
On April 6, 1999, my office send a new e-mail, and again on April 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on April 15, I receive a reply which reads as follows: 
“The following is in response to your message of April 13, 1999. 
The woman will have to be interviewed before a decision can be 
made. We were unable to reach her on time during our last trip 
to Bamako, in March. We therefore put her name back on the 
waiting list for our next trip, the date of which has yet to be 
determined”. 
“However, if she can make the trip to Abidjan, she could be 
interviewed quickly, that is within a week's notice. If the 
applicant and the assisting relative choose that option, let me 
know so that arrangements can be made accordingly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore informed my constituent and I gave notice of the 
option chosen by this woman, who will travel to Abidjan. 
On April 27, 1999, the woman showed up for her interview in 
Abidjan. On May 19, she underwent her medical examination. She 
was declared healthy and now simply had to wait for her visa. On 
July 5, 1999, my constituent came to see me again and told me 
that he has not heard anything about his wife's visa since May.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same day, an e-mail was sent to the embassy, asking for 
information about the wife's visa.  On July 6, the embassy 
replied that the husband's divorce certificate was required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not odd that a whole year had passed before the 
immigration adviser realized this document was missing from the 
file?  Yet at the interview the wife was never informed of the 
obligation to provide this document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 9, the husband's divorce certificate was faxed to the 
embassy and my constituent has proof that it was sent. 
On July 16, 1999, I again e-mailed the embassy, asking for 
confirmation that the certificate had been received. On August 
2, I sent another e-mail to the embassy. I have still not 
received an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 17, I still had heard nothing from the embassy. I sent 
another e-mail on August 27.  What is going on?  Canada's 
embassies are understaffed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague's account.  This is 
clearly a very difficult circumstance for the people actually 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deal with 210 or 212 countries on a regular basis in terms of 
immigration.  It is an extraordinary thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, for example, live in a riding which does not consider itself 
particularly “ethnic” and yet I represent between 60 and 70 
first generation nationalities.  I know there are colleagues on 
this side from the great cities of Canada who also represent 200 
different first generation Canadians.  I mention that to the 
member, not as an excuse, but as a fact.  It is very complex out 
there and our embassies struggle with a variety of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, when I say 210 to 212, if we are dealing with a 
country like India they may well be dealing with not just five or 
six official languages but with hundreds of other languages. 
There are difficulties and I know my colleague is aware of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, like the member, work as hard as I can on immigration cases. 
Does he, as a member of parliament, ever consider dealing with 
people in the department here in Canada?  I know e-mail is a 
wonderful thing, but when it gets complicated and has gone on for 
12 months, does he ever pick up the phone and deal directly with 
the embassies?  He is clearly fluent in both of our official 
languages and can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one last question to ask the member.  What is the 
relevance of this to the Speech from the Throne? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will go through this 
very quickly and I will do it in English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer part of the hon. member's question, yes, I did do a 
lot of this myself and I did try phoning several times.  As I 
mentioned at the outset, this is just one of many cases.  I live 
in an area with a very low ethnic population but I deal with 
cases like this on a very regular basis.  I think the biggest 
problem is a lack of people in our embassies to do the work. We 
also know there has been a huge cut in the number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to what this has to do with the Speech from the 
Throne, I mentioned of course the armed forces which was very 
lightly gone over in the Speech from the Throne, but immigration 
was not mentioned at all.

of the government in general terms.  I said at the outset that we 
were not expecting to see details.  We are looking at the 
generalities.  Everything should be covered in the Speech from 
the Throne.  There was nothing about immigration, in particular 
since immigration has been one of the top problems today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case I brought forward is not a refugee problem.  It is the 
problem of getting a family back together, something that is 
supposed to have a very high priority.  At the end of the file 
the lady finally received her visa a couple of weeks ago after a 
year and a half.  She was pregnant when she applied.  In that 
time period she had the baby.  Her husband has had the 
opportunity to go there but it is very expensive to run back and 
forth.  It seems so unfair when we are trying to get families 
together that we are not doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should have been a reference in the Speech from the Throne 
stating that we should be doing something about immigration.  The 
minister promised to bring forward a bill in October.  It is now 
November.  When we look at the agenda there is nothing there. 
There is nothing happening in committee.  The bill is not coming 
forward.  That is what I am talking about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, today I am talking about what was not in the throne 
speech.  That is what we have to look at.  There were a lot of 
areas not covered and what was in the speech was vague, anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no vision in the throne speech for the unemployed who 
are dependent on social assistance.  There was no vision for our 
youth.  The throne speech made absolutely no reference to an 
increase in transfer payments to the provinces that administer 
those programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was mention of children.  However the day after the throne 
speech there were as many hungry children as the day before.  I 
am not sure that there was a lot in the speech for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfer payments have been slashed by billions of dollars since 
the arrival of the Liberal government, actually $11 billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a lot of money.  If they think that problems can be 
solved by cutting back programs, they are mistaken.  If they 
continue to take money from the provinces administering these 
programs, our children will keep on going to school hungry, and 
they will keep on saying “I cannot afford to stay in school past 
Grade 12”.  This is not acceptable, especially in a rich country 
like Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have these cuts caused in our communities?  Since 1993 we 
have 500,000 more poor children in this very rich country.  This 
means more children are going to school hungry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must take this opportunity to commend Premier Bernard Lord for 
initiating and putting in place a breakfast program in our 
schools, a program very much needed since the arrival of the 
Liberal government in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Brunswick during the Liberal regime of the McKenna and 
Thériault governments they slashed over 600 hospital worker jobs 
during their 10 year reign in New Brunswick.  With only three 
months in power Premier Lord announced 300 new jobs in our health 
care system.  Again I commend him.  It shows that if we want to 
we can.  Premier Lord is dealing with the same amount of money 
that Camille Thériault and Frank McKenna were dealing with, but 
what they were doing was slashing.  It seems to be a habit of 
theirs as it is in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our young men and women wanting to further their education 
after high school there was certainly no vision in the throne 
speech.  To be $50,000 in debt after four to six years of 
university is certainly unacceptable.  The children of our rich 
country should be given a real chance to be prepared and ready to 
lead our country in the future.  A $50,000 debt is an obstacle 
that must be addressed.  It can be addressed by the Liberal 
government increasing transfer payments to the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the reality of things.  I often hear young 
people say “I will not be going on after grade 12.  It is too 
expensive and there are no jobs.  I have to move here, I have to 
move there, I have to go to the U.S.”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our young people do not have a vision of the future.  They must 
be shown that they can find work in their province and that they 
can have post-secondary education.  Our young people can 
contribute to their community, but they will not do so by 
leaving the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the decisions made here in Ottawa targeted the Atlantic 
region. We have seen what that meant in federal elections: the 
number of Liberal members dropped from 31 to 11 here in Ottawa. 
Clearly, the decisions made targeted the Atlantic regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason for the greater number of poor in our country is 
the cuts to the employment insurance program. 
No one here can say otherwise.  It is clear that there is more 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech there is no mention of the negative impact 
felt by seasonal workers in this country.  Seasonal workers are 
everywhere in this country.  They are not only in the Atlantic 
regions.  They exist throughout the country.  They depend on the 
seasons and not on employment insurance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very important.  People have to realize that seasonal 
workers are not dependent on the employment insurance program. 
They are dependent on the seasons.  If we could have summer for 
eight months of the year in New Brunswick, believe me, we would 
take it. People would work during that season.  If it were a 
tourist season of eight months, be assured that people would be 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to stop attacking the seasonal workers. They are a very 
important group. Every day we use or eat something that a 
seasonal worker worked at. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the deficit was paid down on the backs of high 
unemployment regions, as the fund's surplus is $26 billion. 
However, people who are not eligible for employment insurance 
benefits go for weeks and months without any income. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear, with a $26 billion surplus in the fund that we did 
not get that money where the EI was not being used.  That money 
came from the regions where there was very high unemployment and 
people either did not qualify or went for two to three months 
with no income or got a $32 per week cheque.  That is how we got 
that money. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that, for every poor child, there are poor 
parents.  In a country as rich as ours, this is unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to talk about health care, a program so important 
to all Canadians.  I have done surveys and we can talk to any 
group.  Our health care program is very important. We want to 
keep our health care program.  Without increasing transfer 
payments to the provinces, health care services will continue to 
deteriorate.  Our hospitals need more doctors, nurses and other 
health care workers.  Canadians need this now.  Lives are 
depending on the government's actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also no mention of our fishery crisis.  It is a 
crisis.  Our caucus was given a presentation by Mr. Christmas 
this morning. I was very shocked to hear that the first nations 
are negotiating to obtain actually between 30% and 50% of the 
Atlantic fishery. I wonder where the government is on this.  This 
afternoon I made phone calls to different fishermen.  I asked if 
they were aware that the aboriginal people had put on the table 
that they want 30% to 50% of the Atlantic fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that finally the government will take some leadership and 
that it will talk to both groups. A lot of families are depending 
on that. I hope the government is going to do something because 
to do nothing is not an option at this point. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 6.30 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
