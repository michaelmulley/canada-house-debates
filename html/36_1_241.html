marks the centennial anniversary of the proclamation of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership, vision and commitment of the Government of Saudi 
Arabia and its people have created a society where education, 
economic development and diversification have become priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of infrastructure and the petrochemical industry 
have transformed a barren land into one of the most advanced 
nations of the world.  The Saudi Arabian people have built a 
moderate nation that is dedicated to promoting peace and 
stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues and all Canadians, I ask His 
Excellency Dr. Mohammed Al-Hussaini, the Ambassador of Saudi 
Arabia, to extend our warmest congratulations to the Government 
of Saudi Arabia and its people, the people of this exceptional 
nation.  I would like to wish them a happy anniversary.

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thousands of Canadians work in the forest industry. This 
government has failed them by allowing U.S. customs today to end 
Canada-U.S. free trade on two more types of forest products, 
reclassifying them into the softwood lumber agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lumber producers in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta will be hurt. 
B.C. alone produces 61% of Canada's softwood exports.  A 
Vancouver forestry consultant says this change will cost 1,000 
jobs in B.C. alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at the World Wood Summit in Chicago on May 19, a world 
forestry analyst pointed out that the whole deal was based on the 
false claim that Canadian forest products were not being fairly 
exported, a claim not supported by share prices of Canadian 
lumber companies.  Instead, and I quote, “In my view the trade 
dispute is all about politics and has nothing to do with `fair' 
trade”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government must not only challenge this ruling, but 
finally have the intestinal fortitude to stand up and fight for the 
people in the forestry industry in Canada.

join the chairman and CEO of Interport, Stephen Wu, as well as 
the president of CDIB, Benny T. Hu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This joint venture will develop a 450 acre light industry park 
which will generate $500 million in capital investment over 15 
years and provide 5,000 new jobs.  These relations between Canada 
and Taiwan are good for the B.C. economy, encouraging financial 
investment and job creation in western Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for months now financial institutions have been sitting 
on education savings grants from the federal government. In so 
doing they have deprived children of several months of 
investment income, no deadline having been set for the Canada 
education savings grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial institutions are keeping children's money in their 
vaults and dragging their feet.  They do not face any penalties, 
so it is all the same to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada should give financial institutions a 
maximum of five days to transfer the money from federal grants 
into the education savings accounts of the children of Canada 
and impose a penalty on those institutions that do not comply.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday morning the city of White Rock suffered a 
once in a lifetime storm when 70 millimetres of rain fell in less 
than six hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This intense rainfall, coupled with a hail storm, was more than 
the city storm drainage system could handle and, as the torrents 
roared downhill to scenic Marine Drive, dozens of homes, cars and 
businesses were flooded.  The city and local RCMP detachment 
responded quickly, rescuing a number of residents trapped by the 
flash flood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the people of White Rock are resilient. They 
immediately began to clean up their homes, their businesses and 
their city.  Schools that were closed to flooding yesterday are 
already open today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of B.C. has promised disaster financial assistance. 
I hope that those who suffered losses yesterday receive the 
required support quickly so they can get back on their feet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
youth entrepreneurship is alive and thriving in Canada.  As chair 
of the Prime Minister's task force on youth entrepreneurship, I 
have witnessed firsthand these past months just how widespread 
the determination to succeed and flourish is among large numbers 
of our young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am hosting three such young business people who 
epitomize successful young entrepreneurs.  On Tuesday, May 25, 
Albert Lai, Michael Furdyk and Michael Hayman, ages 16, 18 and 20 
respectively, sold their computer on-line company for more than 
one million dollars.  What started out in 1996 as a hobby has 
become a thriving business which not only enabled them to gain 
experience in the competitive worlds of business and cyberspace, 
but which has also ensured a future full of innovative and 
creative opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to Albert, Michael and Michael, who are with 
us in the House today.

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, May 27 was the 
date of the 1999 Fernand Séguin award ceremony.  This award for 
journalism is presented annually by the Association des 
communicateurs scientifiques du Québec and the Société 
Radio-Canada.  Its purpose is to encourage and stimulate careers 
in science writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the jury's choice was Sophie Payeur, a master's 
student at the Université de Sherbrooke.  She wrote an excellent 
scientific article about the brain's capacity to adapt.  The 
article explains that blind people have a heightened sense of 
hearing that enables them to locate with considerable accuracy 
the origin of sounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to a $12,000 grant, she will benefit from a six 
month internship writing about science, including three months 
for the broadcast <I>Découvertes</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to Ms. Payeur, who has shown that the 
complexity of scientific endeavour does not in any way mean that 
it cannot be written about in a manner that any curious reader 
or listener can understand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are tremendously proud of the RCMP's work both in 
Canada and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Foreign Affairs talked about sending 
RCMP to help in gathering forensic evidence and establishing 
infrastructure in Kosovo, but what about the RCMP infrastructure 
in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from 
the RCMP budget.  The force currently has a shortfall of up to 
20% of staff in B.C. detachments.  The RCMP is stretched as thin 
as Canada's military, and that speaks volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs minister made commitments for the defence 
minister and now he is making commitments for the solicitor 
general.  Why will the solicitor general not stand up for the 
RCMP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While RCMP officers place their lives on the line, very 
frequently for free with no overtime, the solicitor general 
slithers, dithers and talks about studies.  Officers are 
committed to combating criminal forces in Canada.  What they need 
is a commitment from this government to a strong and vital RCMP.

I have great news.  Finally a member of the federal cabinet has 
earned a University of Waterloo degree.  Joining 106,900 current 
University of Waterloo alumni, the hon. minister from 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell will receive his BA in History on 
June 17, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John English, former member of parliament for Kitchener, and I, 
the first University of Waterloo grads to become MPs in 1993, 
although yet to become honourable, wish to congratulate the hon. 
minister and to welcome him to the club.  This member has come a 
long way from bussing tables upstairs at the parliamentary 
restaurant.  His regret of leaving school after grade 11 has been 
rectified.  Next week, after 11 years of correspondence courses, 
all in relative secrecy, he will be convocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He exemplifies lifetime learning and stands as a symbol for 
adult and correspondence education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all very proud of this first ever cabinet minister to

the 17th of June he becomes a graduate of the University of 
Waterloo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague has earned his degree by correspondence while 
working as hard or harder than anyone in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many know, he began work on Parliament Hill in the 
restaurant.  Today he is the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons.  This is an extraordinary example of lifelong 
learning, an example to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, I have to say that the degree, worthy though it 
is, is in no way a measure of the level of education achieved by 
our colleague.  Through the university of life, he has achieved a 
level of education that cannot be measured by letters after a 
name.  Our colleague has a fine intellect, honed through personal 
study and through lifelong public service for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While my colleague's concern for the proprieties of the House 
prevent my mentioning his name, I say, on behalf of all here, 
congratulations D.B., BA.

Edward Island adopted a resolution calling for the Société 
nationale de l'Acadie to be allowed to represent the Acadian 
people at the Sommet de la Francophonie in Moncton.  This would 
allow the Acadians of Prince Edward Island and of Nova Scotia to 
have a voice on the international scene, since New Brunswick, as 
a governmental member of the Agence de la Francophonie, can 
represent only the people of that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Société nationale de l'Acadie already has co-operative

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

that called for renewing integrity in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The red book said “open government will be the watchword of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I gave my assets to the ethics counsellor according to 
the regulations of the administrator who is a trustee.  I did 
that before I became Prime Minister.  I sold these shares at that 
time to make sure that there would be absolutely no conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud that after six years all my cabinet has been 
managed in a way that we have absolutely no problem with that. It 
is because of my ethics since 1963 that I put all my assets in 
the hands of the administrator or the trustee before I became 
Prime Minister.  They are managed there, not managed by me.  That 
is exactly what the ethics counsellor said to members of

there to help his friends, the friends who helped him.

the days when she believed that prime ministers ought to be

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Prime Minister not at least uphold the ethical

this conflict of interest? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my ministers and I have dealt with all the work I have 
done as a member of parliament for Saint-Maurice.  It is my duty 
as a member of parliament to make sure that all the programs of 
the government to create jobs are known, especially when the 
riding has a 12% level of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the hon. member that during the last

has nothing more to add.  Well, I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had a business financial interest.  That same business also 
received a $1.5 million windfall from the recipient of a $6

<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Government of Quebec has just made public a series of studies 
commissioned from independent experts to assess the consequences 
and scope of the agreement on social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general consensus is clear: the social union is a step 
backward for the provinces, which handed over a portion of their 
constitutional responsibilities to the government in exchange 
for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this, does the Prime Minister still feel that the signing 
of the social union framework agreement represents a great day 
in Canadian history? 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that the Prime Minister of Canada and all the provincial 
premiers, except one obviously, decided to work together to 
ensure that all our efforts went to improving the quality of 
life in Canada in social terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the ability to work together represents a great step 
forward. I understand that one premier, who wants to have Quebec 
separate, must ensure that Canada does not function. He is not 
looking out for Quebec's interests, but is serving the interests 
of his party, which lacks the courage to put an honest and clear 
question in a referendum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
for honesty and clarity, I will pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Alain Noël of the University of Montreal says, and I 
quote “Overall, the agreement represents a significant step 
backward for Quebec...More importantly, the February 4 agreement 
once again isolates Quebec, confirming...the desire of the other 
governments...to redefine the country without attempting to win 
the agreement of the government or even the official opposition 
of Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister realize that others beside the 
sovereignists are rejecting this agreement, including the very 
federalist Liberal Party of Quebec, which rejects the agreement 
on social union? 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have not seen the studies involved. I would be pleased 
to read them and comment after I have read them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that the leader of the Bloc has had a lot of time 
to read them. In any case, that is not the point. Other studies 
have been made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest architect of social programs in Quebec, Claude 
Castonguay, said it was very positive. The leader of the 
opposition in the National Assembly said he could improve on it, 
but that it was positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the principal adviser, “cryptochief” 
perhaps, of the Bloc. Jacques Parizeau said “Canadian federalism 
is, with that of Switzerland, probably the most decentralized in 
the world”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to Laval University's Professor Guy Tremblay, “The 
social union agreement tends to increase the centralization of 
powers in Canada.  Almost all the areas covered in the agreement 
are exclusively provincial in jurisdiction.  The federal 
government sees the agreement as legitimizing its interference 
in these areas”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government claim that the agreement is about areas 
of shared jurisdiction, when leading experts confirm that, on 
the contrary, it deals with areas that are exclusively 
provincial in jurisdiction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Yes, 
Mr. Speaker.  The agreement says that governments must respect 
the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have recognized that federal spending authority is 
legal, regardless of what the professor may think.  It is legal, 
and has been recognized by the courts.  In fact, this authority 
exists in all modern federations, but it has fewer conditions 
attached and is used the least in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement requires the Canadian government to meet 
additional conditions before invoking the federal spending 
authority.  I fail to see how anyone can claim that this 
agreement is a centralizing measure.

one of the experts consulted says the following: “Federalism 
outside Quebec is now going its own way.  In this sense, Canada 
has separated from Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government finally understand what Jean Lesage meant in 
1963 when he said that Quebec did not defend provincial autonomy 
simply for the principle of it, but because, for Quebec, 
autonomy was the specific condition for its affirmation as a

the arguments they come up with are never their own, but always 
something someone else said.  When we come back with other

not have a complete understanding of the issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and

recent days a peace plan has been taking shape in Kosovo and is 
sure to lead to the adoption of a resolution by the security 
council. However, opinions diverge on whether bombing should 
continue, including China and Russia, despite the imminence 
of a political agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister. Does he think bombing 
must be stopped immediately to promote the adoption of a 
resolution by the security council? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there was agreement among all the countries present at the 
negotiations, including Russia, and this is the course events 
must take.  First, the Serbs have to leave Kosovar territory. 
There are currently indications of probable movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as movement has been confirmed, and the troops have 
taken to the road in order to return to Belgrade, under the 
agreement the bombing will stop and, accordingly, the resolution 
that was agreed to will immediately be put before the security 
council.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, China 
and Russia are making an end to bombing the condition for their 
support of the security council resolution. In fact, this 
morning they got the support of the Secretary General of the 
United Nations, Kofi Annan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Kofi Annan is calling for an end to bombing, should Canada as 
a member of the security council not support its secretary 
general? 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no disagreement between the secretary general, Canada's 
position and everyone else's position. There was an agreement 
that soldiers were to leave Kosovo to return to Serbia. As soon 
as their movement may be clearly determined, bombing will cease, 
and the resolution will be automatically introduced in the 
security council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resolution is being discussed at the moment by members 
of the security council. They will vote on it once the soldiers 
have begun to withdraw and bombing has stopped. There is no 
disagreement between the UN secretary general and our position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a simple 
question for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  Would she agree 
that under the new Senate amendments to Bill C-55 and her vague 
backgrounders which she calls regulations, the definitions of 
Canadian content have been changed?  Under the new Bill C-55 no 
Canadian writer, editor, publisher, photographer or printer needs 
to be involved for a magazine to now qualify as Canadian under 
the deal as long as the material is original to our magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the definition of Canadian content changed?  All the 
minister need answer is yes or no. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, prior to the tabling of the legislation, there was

content requirements are new. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the made 
in America magazine deal states that allowable Canadian content 
means “created for the Canadian market and does not appear in 
any other edition in Canada”.  How can the minister have allowed 
Americans to be considered Canadians under the law?  The 
definition of what is a Canadian is pretty simple to me: a 
Canadian is a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister allow Americans to be considered Canadians 
in the magazine deal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

my question is for the Minister of Transport on behalf of the new

</I></B></P><P align=left>A repeated request to the Minister of Transport has been denied 
by Nav Canada and the Minister of Transport to produce previously 
available safety documents.  In particular two I am looking for 
are dated May 27, 1998 and they refer to the Kelowna air traffic 
control tower.  Repeated requests have fallen on deaf ears. 
Everyone suddenly seems to have something to hide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know if the minister has these safety reports dated

<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

that one approaches the department or minister.  This is the 
first I have heard about so-called missing documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are documents that are germane to the particular issue 
of the Kelowna control tower that are available and in the public 
domain, obviously they will be made available to the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before the hon. member continues, I might

<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wrote the minister for these documents and he wrote back to me on 
May 27 and refused to give them to me.  He referred me to Nav 
Canada.  It has also refused to give them to me.  These are 
safety documents. They refer to an unsafe situation that has gone 
on for 10 years. It has never been addressed. They are trying now 
to hide it because they have never done anything about it.

the committee members for their diligent work on such a broad

would like to ensure that the federal government treat Canadian 
families fairly.  Among other things, the official opposition 
advocates extending the child care expense deduction to all 
parents, converted into a refundable tax credit available to all 
families, and that the spousal amount be increased from the 
current $5,918 to $7,900, levelling the field.  We would also 
implement across the board broad based tax relief.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to AIDA and the tree fruit industry: (<I>a</I>) what is 
the percentage differences in gross margin levels among 
commodities, e.g. perennials, tree fruits, vs. annuals, grains; 
(<I>b</I>)  can the government provide an example of the relative use 
of eligible and ineligible expenses for two different commodities 
such as grain and tree fruit; (<I>c</I>)  can the government provide 
an example of the benefits a tree fruit farmer would be entitled 
to under AIDA, should back to back below average returns be 
experienced in the base period, in comparison to that of a single 
year of below average returns; (<I>d</I>)  can the government provide 
data which would compare the inclusion of negative margins in the 
reference margins but reducing to zero in the claim year to that 
of reducing negative margins, to zero for both 
the base period and the claim year; (<I>e</I>)  can the government 
provide information to show if AIDA recognizes the special 
problems of perennial crops such as the little flexibility to 
switch commodities and varieties? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> 
(a) Agricultural income disaster assistance, AIDA, provides a common 
basis of support to all commodities.  The British Columbia whole 
farm income insurance program, which essentially follows the same 
rules as AIDA, has provided payments in different regions of the 
province where different commodities predominate.  This reflects 
the fact that the gross margin can vary as much from farm to farm 
producing the same commodities as between farms producing 
differing commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) An AIDA payment is trigerred by a change in a farmer's gross 
margin.  Adding a particular expense would have a small effect on 
the AIDA payment, up or down depending on the producer, because it 
needs to be done for both the reference period and the claim 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) A recent evaluation of the Alberta farm income disaster program 
stated that the program payments have been concentrated in areas 
with the largest decrease in farm incomes and that it responds 
well to back to back disaster years.  The impact of back to back 
years of below average returns will depend on the magnitude of 
the decline in the margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, AIDA is designed to address extreme, short term 
income declines; it is not the program's purpose to support income 
in a manner that is not consistent with each farm's recent experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) Data are not available to show the impact on AIDA of altering 
negative margins in the reference period.  Artificially 
increasing past income would raise the possibility of trade 
actions as this would conflict with international guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) The British Columbia whole farm income insurance program has 
provided payments in different regions of the province where 
different commodities predominate.  Besides farmers who have 
planted perennial crops such as tree fruits, farmers who have 
invested in essentially single purpose equipment or buildings 
such as hog barns will also have difficulty in switching to other 
commodities.  These farms can be subject to high market risks 
because their revenue is related to the price of one commodity. 
These farmers should utilize all tools available to them to 
mitigate these risks.  These include the use of government 
programs such as net income stabilization account and crop 
insurance.  Producers must also look for ways to mitigate risks 
beyond utilization of government programs.

This House sent to the Senate a bill which had as its stated 
purpose, and I quote the minister in her second reading speech: 
“Under the Bill introduced in the House of Commons, only 
Canadian publishers will have the right to sell advertising 
directed at the Canadian market”. Later in the same speech she 
told this House: “Parliament is being asked to prohibit the sale

order.  I stress this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my point of order is that 
what you are hearing is not in fact a point of order, it is 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for West Nova is 
making a point of order concerning the admissibility of the 
amendments before this House as I understand it.  In that sense, 
while it may be close to debate and he may be perhaps going on a 
little long on his point, I think I need to hear his point if 
there is some argument as to the procedural acceptability of the 
motion before the House, which I understand the hon. member for 
West Nova to have indicated at the outset of his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I would like to finish 
my point of order if I could.  I was quoting: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is being asked to prohibit the sale and distribution 
of advertising services directed specifically at the Canadian 
market by non-Canadian publishers.  Parliament is being asked to 
put in place fines for foreign publishers that attempt to violate 
these laws. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those statements are clear and unequivocal.  Prohibit, not 
regulate.  Prohibit.  We all know that any similar amendment 
proposed in the House to modify such a prohibition would not 
survive for five seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amendments, particularly the new clause 21.1, have 
the effect of breaking the prohibition and turning the machinery 
into a regulatory regime.  To regulate is the opposite of 
prohibit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate can send whatever message it likes, but so far as 
this House is concerned, the issue of an absolute prohibition has 
been settled by three readings and a committee examination which 
was concurred in by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's and Erskine May make reference to the long title of 
a bill as being a factor in establishing the scope of a bill.  If 
this were the sole criterion, it would put great power in the 
hands of those officials who draft bills and who are not 
accountable to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that a minister in setting forth the concepts, as she 
sees them at second reading, goes a great distance in setting out 
the scope of a bill.  In this instance we were told by the 
minister that this bill was not about subsidies.  We were told 
that there was to be a prohibition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amendments fly in the face of the decision of the 
House and ask the House to swallow itself whole.  Unless the 
Chair intervenes to disallow the proposed Senate amendments, 
there will be nothing to prevent a government from bringing all 
its legislation to the House in a bland form, have ministers play 
games with their credibility and then use the Senate to insert 
all of the controversial measures, remitting them back to the 
House for a one-shot vote under time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hesitate to interrupt the hon. 
member but I am interested to know, and I know he is about to 
conclude, whether he is suggesting in his point that the 
financial prerogatives of the House have been in any way impaired 
by the amendments before us.  I would be interested in hearing 
his views on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not making reference to 
the financial aspect.  If you would let me finish I have but a 
short period and you will see exactly where I am going with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask you to assert the right of the House of 
Commons to be able to believe ministers of the crown when they 
address the House.  I ask you to rule that these amendments 
exceed the scope of the bill that was sent to the Senate.  Sir, 
assert the primacy of the House of Commons.  Open the great doors 
of the House and throw these amendments out.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In that decision by the Speaker he indicated that there were two 
amendments by the Senate for which concurrence of the House was 
being sought.  The member for St. Albert had asked the Speaker at

by the Senate.  The Speaker stated, and I quote from page 6411 of 
<I>Hansard</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that your Speaker cannot stand as a procedural judge 
on what is done by the Senate.  What they do over there, they do

</I></B></P><P align=left>In his ruling the Speaker cited with great reverence the 
decision of Mr. Speaker Fraser made on April 26, 1990, which is 
published in the book whose publication we are celebrating today. 
I refer the hon. member to the decision of Mr. Speaker Fraser 
which was made on an argument advanced on a bill to amend the 
Unemployment Insurance Act brought forward in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the hon. member that the hon. member for 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell and I argued something along the 
lines he is arguing today, but with the additional argument about 
financial measures.  I can also tell the hon. member that at that 
time we lost our argument as he is going to lose his today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This argument in my view is not well founded. I quote from Mr. 
Speaker Fraser's ruling on page 10723 of <I>Hansard</I>, April 26, 
1990, where he said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Speaker of the House of Commons cannot unilaterally rule 
out of order amendments from the other place.  I can comment, as 
I am doing, but the House as a whole must ultimately make the 
decision to accept or reject amendments from the Senate, whether 
they be in order according to our rules or not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Speaker Parent said, it comes down to a decision of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid the hon. member may, by his arguments later, advance 
arguments as to why the House should reject the amendments made 
by the Senate, but in my view it is not the place of the Speaker 
or presiding officer of the House to rule these amendments out of 
order, at least on the grounds advanced by the hon. member for 
West Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Senate for 
the work it has done.  Many things have been said in the last 
number of days about the Senate and its work or lack thereof. 
However I have to say that here was one very strong case of how 
the Senate took its responsibility very seriously, dealt in a 
very conscientious fashion with a piece of legislation and 
assisted ably in helping Canada achieve an historic agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in its dealings with any nation, the United 
States has finally accepted the right of Canadian content in 
Canadian cultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that the concurrent work of the Senate while 
the negotiations were going on actually helped to show the 
Americans that we were serious about the legislation and that we 
were serious that any legislation would include Canadian content. 
That is the crux of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Senate on its very serious work on a piece of 
legislation which will prove in the long term to be an historic 
piece of legislation, not just for Canada but for our approach in 
future international trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at where we were two years ago and where we are 
today.  Two years ago Canada lost a decision by the World Trade 
Organization.  We did not like it.  Most of us thought it was an 
unfair ruling, but it was a final ruling with no right of appeal. 
There was no way around it, many people thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did that ruling give the United States?  It gave the United 
States 100% access to our magazine advertising market.  It gave 
the United States the whole enchilada.  It had everything.  It 
had a ruling which would have entitled it to crush the Canadian 
magazine industry and decimate Canadian magazines.  Those are the 
facts.  The United States won and we were left with nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are we today as a result of these amendments? 
The United States will have access to up to 18% of the 
advertising market, not the 100% it got from the WTO ruling, not 
the 100% it originally insisted it was entitled to, not 90%, not 
80%, not 50% but 18%, and that only after a three year transition 
period.

that they were mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The road was long and exhausting. I want especially to

capacity and the will to help, and we shall do so.  Yes, it will 
cost something but let us imagine the alternative.  Let us 
imagine if we had let the WTO ruling stand with no effort to find 
a solution.  The United States would have had everything and 
Canada would have been left with nothing.  Now we have claimed 
back or clawed back 82% of what we had before we were deep-sixed 
by the WTO ruling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Is this an amendment that is receivable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Dauphin—Swan 
River appears to want to continue his remarks, having posed an 
amendment.  I have not put the amendment to the House and I am 
prepared to refrain from doing so until later when it might be 
moved when he has concluded his remarks.  I think that would be 
fairer.  Otherwise, I will review the matter from the procedural 
perspective and make a ruling.  However, if I put the question to 
the House at the moment, the hon. member will lose his right to 
speak.  Which does he prefer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your guidance. I 
did make an error in presenting the subamendment at this time. I 
will certainly continue to debate the amendments from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the heritage minister indicate that there may have been 
a victory on this bill, a rather shallow victory, if it is a 
victory over the trade war; win, lose or draw or wherever we are. 
Let us not forget that Bill C-55, with the amendments attached, 
is really about trade.  As I have indicated all along, the bill 
really belongs to the Minister of International Trade and not to 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the government that with our current status with 
the United States, almost 85% of everything we produce heads 
south.  Our economy is closely linked with the economy of the 
United States.  I am sure our loonie would not be where it is if 
it had not for the vibrant economy of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just remind the House that it was Reform that stood up 
for Canadian jobs because we were concerned about a potential 
trade war.  It was Reform that stood up for the steel workers of 
Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie.  We are the ones in the Chamber 
who defended the jobs in the labour industry, the agricultural 
industry as well as the plastics industry in the country.  We 
defended the jobs of the textile workers in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, as Canadians, that we are different from our neighbours 
to the south.  We speak differently.  We have a Canadian accent. 
We say things in a Canadian manner.  Our culture is very 
different.  We are much more receptive to other cultures.  We are 
a very diverse country.  We are different from Americans, and 
Canadians know that.  Legislation is not going to make us any 
more different than we already are.  We know that we have a rich 
culture and that we will celebrate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, I would like to state for the record that 
Canadians do read Canadian magazines and they prefer to buy 
magazines that are Canadian.  Even though the publishing 
association said that 80% of magazines on the stands are foreign 
magazines, they also said that 50% of magazines purchased in 
Canada are foreign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest numbers on readership, taking into account controlled 
circulation, magazines distributed via bulk delivery, including 
newspapers, show that only 4.9% of magazines read in Canada are 
bought off the stands, which is a pretty small number; 35.7% of 
magazines read are received by paid subscription; and 59.4% of 
magazines read are received by controlled circulation.  In other 
words, 75% of all magazines read or received by controlled 
circulation and 94% of these are Canadian owned. Why are we so 
concerned that Canadians are not reading magazines produced in 
this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the House to hear what other people are saying 
about this magazine bill.

have probably been at this bill for over 12 months.  It has 
certainly developed a life of its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a fairly recent article in the May 26 edition of 
the <I>National Post</I> by Jonathon Gatehouse.  He states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than a month after the bill was introduced, Gordon Griffin, 
the American Ambassador to Canada, warned a blue-chip business 
luncheon in Ottawa that the provocation would not go unnoticed 
south of the border, calling C-55 “faulty public policy” and 
spoke openly about a possible trade war. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have experienced, this potential trade war has created 
this amendment that we are dealing with today in the House.  In 
fact, that same newspaper article states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Knives are out and as one senior Liberal told the National 
Post last week, many in cabinet blame Ms. Copps for almost 
dragging Canada into the worst trade war in memory with her 
ill-timed rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Keeping on message has been a constant problem”, said the 
source.  “Every time Sheila would come forward and say something 
particularly strident, the U.S. would fluff out their feathers”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote another article in the May 26 edition of the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> written by Valerie Lawton.  She states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Split-run publishers who opt for that route, however would have 
to go through an investment review process run by Canadian 
Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimate power to say yes or no to proposals would rest with the 
heritage minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Globe and Mail</I> of May 26, in an article by Heather 
Scofield and Shawn McCarthy, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heritage Minister Sheila Copps and International Trade Minister 
Sergio Marchi—who have often been at odds in recent months over 
how far the government could go to meet U.S. demands—are 
expected to argue the deal does not sacrifice the domestic 
magazine industry even as it averts a trade war that would have 
slashed access to the U.S. market for key industrial products 
such as steel and textiles. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement provides significant less protection for the 
Canadian magazine than Ms. Copps originally had promised.  The 
Heritage Minister will attempt to save face by announcing the 
government's plan to shift responsibility to her department for 
screening all foreign investment in Canadian cultural industries 
government sources say. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did happen in the week following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>National Post</I> article of May 26, written by Giles 
Gherson, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a senior magazine-industry representative bitterly complains: 
“I can't believe the ignominy of the complete and utter cave-in 
by the Canadian government.  They've just capitulated”.  This 
representative said that the Canadian content win by Ottawa is 
meaningless since few U.S. magazines will want more than 18% 
Canadian ads, making Canadian content a non-issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only two weeks ago, Sheila Copps, the Heritage Minister, was 
adamant that this so-called de minimis exemption would be 
restricted to split-runs with no more than a single digit amount 
of Canadian advertising—in other words 9% ceiling. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, that has ballooned to 18% over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue the quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, the feisty combative Heritage Minister settled on an 
exemption large enough to drive a pick-up through.  Crying 
sellout, the Canadian magazine industry is privately livid at the 
Chrétien government's backsliding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 27 in the Toronto <I>Star</I>, in another article by 
Valerie Lawton, she states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But plans for a subsidy package to help ease the new pressure on 
Canadian magazines still haven't been worked out.  Copps said she 
didn't know how much money will be available. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still do not know how much this deal will cost Canadian 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article goes on to state: 
<UL>

long said it never wanted to be dependent on—some magazines will 
die. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that statistically even with the subsidization that is 
currently occurring, one-third of English published magazines are 
not viable and up to one-quarter of the French magazines are also 
not viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I continue to quote the article.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Copps said repeatedly that Canada had won an important concession 
from the Americans—that for the first time the U.S. has 
recognized Canada's right to protect and promote Canadian content 
in magazines. 
But the US suggested it had done nothing of the kind.  This issue 
has nothing to do with culture.  It was simply a matter of 
ensuring competition, said a senior trade official.  The issue is 
one of commerce... The key issue here has to be access to a 
market.

Canadians' giant neighbour.

suggested, while trade officials characterized (the heritage

had there not been some extreme positions put out there”, one

strong things at the beginning of the whole issue.  It's just a 
fact that she now has to live with some of the things she said”.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her posturing nationalism and xenophobic fear of English speaking 
culture Canada shares with the U.S., Britain, Australia and a 
quarter of the world are philistine absurdities and a national

looking for a pretext to throws bones to their own native 
protectionism.

culture?  Would you even take her advice on what movie to see? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people do not agree with the amendments made to this bill 
because they really do change the intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Magazine Publishers Association is led by François 
de Gaspé Beaubien.  To be fair, I know Mr. Beaubien is a 
gentleman, and I would like to read into the record his 
opposition point of view.  It is not that I agree with what Mr. 
Beaubien says regarding the amendments but I think his point of 
view is relevant.  As the House knows, Mr. Beaubien and the 
Reform Party are on opposite sides of the fence, but in this case 
Reform is in opposition to the amendments as is Mr. Beaubien. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Beaubien wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister.  I will 
quote the last page of his letter to make sure Mr. Beaubien is on 
the record in opposition to the amendments to the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, acceding to the U.S. demand for a so-called de minimis of 
20%, give or take a few points, would gut Bill C-55. It would be 
a straight giveaway of a very significant portion of the Canadian 
advertising services market without any requirement that the U.S. 
publishers print one word about Canada. They would simply recycle 
editorial content from their U.S. editions, capturing incremental 
profits in Canada with virtually no costs.  Giving away this 
slice of our advertising services market to unfair and 
insurmountable competition from U.S. publishers would mean the 
death of Canadian magazines that Canadians want to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, giving Canadian tax benefits to U.S. publishers who 
would enjoy this cost-free access to our advertising market is a 
straight transfer of Canadian taxpayer dollars to further pad the 
incremental profits of huge U.S. multinationals like Time Warner 
with absolutely no return to Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I will make on behalf of Mr. Beaubien, whom I 
disagree with, is he says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, changing Canadian foreign investment rules to allow U.S. 
publishers to establish their magazines as Canadian publications 
with unlimited access to Canadian advertising revenues on the 
basis of a vaguely defined and unenforceable content requirement 
would be nothing more than the final sellout.  Some have tried to 
claim that the U.S. has made a concession by agreeing to such a 
requirement.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Far from 
accepting a Canadian content requirement, the U.S. has agreed 
to...legislation or regulation.  This gives them free rein to 
object in future, which they surely would, if Canada tried to 
make such a requirement stick. 
This reality would represent the last nail in the coffin of the 
cultural policy in the magazine sector that has been pursued by 
successive governments for over three decades.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read this as an example of objections to the amendments.  As 
this House knows this government went to bat for the publishing 
industry.  Here again we have the publishing industry objecting 
to the Senate amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right from the very beginning Bill C-55 had two combatants, the 
advertising industry and the magazine publishing industry.  To be 
fair to the advertisers, I must for the record state their 
position in terms of the amendments and their impact on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advertising industry has been kept out of the consultation 
process right from day one.  It is certainly not unreasonable to 
expect problems when governments put together bills without 
consulting the whole industry. It should not be a surprise that 
the government has had all kinds of problems with this bill since 
it was tabled in the House.  This alone should send the bill back 
to the drawing board as I have echoed many times during the debate 
on Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the position and point of view of the Association of 
Canadian Advertisers which I believe is only fair at this time. 
The Association of Canadian Advertisers believes that market 
conditions should prevail.  It is the association's considered 
view that the Canadian magazine industry would be best served 
through the disciplines of the market system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association does not subscribe to the doom and gloom 
scenarios of those who argue that the unfettered market is 
anathema to a vibrant and dynamic Canadian magazine industry.  It 
indicates that one needs only to look at the great success story 
of the Ontario wine industry following the implementation of the 
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember the dire predictions for the survival of the Canadian 
wine industry in the face of a flood of cheaper priced wines from 
the United States. As history has shown to the contrary the wine 
industry in Ontario has flourished in an unfettered market. 
Moreover it has become a source of national pride as the industry 
garners one prestigious national award after another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern the advertising association has is that there 
needs to be a framework for acceptable intervention.  It is the 
association's understanding that the government may deem it 
necessary to intervene in the market on behalf of the Canadian 
magazine industry on the grounds that the Canadian magazine 
industry as a public good merits assistance. Should this be the 
case, it is its view that such intervention is best accomplished 
through direct payments to publishers out of general government 
revenues, preferably based on Canadian content performance 
milestones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for the Canadian magazine industry should not be borne 
either directly or indirectly by taxation or subsidy policies 
that ultimately target Canadian advertisers.  We are still 
waiting to hear how much the subsidy will be on this magazine 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Punitive interventions are unacceptable according to the 
magazine advertisers. Any regulations that restrict advertising 
dollars to magazines meeting certain Canadian content 
requirements is also unacceptable to the Association of Canadian 
Advertisers.  This is a dangerous road to go down.  It would 
provide an indirect subsidy to the Canadian magazine industry 
which would effectively be borne by advertisers rather than the 
public. Initially it is fundamentally inconsistent with the very 
basic notion of commercial free speech.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, any such regulations would be inconsistent with the 
World Trade Organization appellate body ruling and the GATT, 
1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My belief is that the Association of Canadian Advertisers 
welcomes any new vehicles through which advertisers can convey 
their commercial messages.  Advertisers need more mechanisms to 
inform consumers as they become more discerning and sophisticated 
in their reading and buying habits.  This is clearly a void in 
the Canadian marketplace that is being filled by some U.S. 
publications.  Consumers buy them. In order to effectively reach 
consumers Canadian advertisers require unrestricted access to 
those magazines that best deliver their messages.  This set of 
amendments certainly restricts access to the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are hopefully debating this bill for the last time, we 
need to review how we got into this mess in the first place.  As 
I have indicated, we have been at this for at least 12 months and 
we still have not gotten out of it. How did we get here in the 
first place?  For the record I need to talk about some of the 
background to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the United States successfully challenged Canada's 
protectionist magazine regime at the World Trade Organization. 
The WTO panel found three components of Canada's magazine 
policies to be illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, GATT, a key trade agreement administered by the WTO. The 
panel condemned a ban in place since 1965 on imports of magazines 
with advertising directed at Canadians; a 1995 special excise tax 
on so-called split-run magazines; and discriminatory postal rates 
for imported magazines. After Canada appealed the panel's report, 
the WTO appellate body found a fourth violation, Canada's 
discriminatory postal subsidy program for Canadian produced 
magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective October 30, 1998 Canada terminated its longstanding 
ban on split-run imports, eliminated the 1995 special excise tax 
on split runs and modified its discriminatory postal rates and 
postal subsidies for magazines.  However, Canada introduced Bill 
C-55 which simply accomplished the same results as the import ban 
and excise tax and would have kept U.S. and other foreign 
produced split-run magazines from competing in the Canadian 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 would have prohibited U.S. and non-Canadian publishing 
companies and ethnic publications on pain of criminal fine from 
using the magazines they produce to advertise directly to 
Canadian readers. Among the four measures the WTO condemned was 
the compensatory 80% tax imposed by the Canadian government on 
imported magazines carrying this type of advertising.  The tax 
put U.S. and other imported magazines at a significant commercial 
disadvantage in comparison to Canadian produced magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having finally agreed to eliminate the tax on these 
advertisements, the Canadian government proposed to ban them 
altogether. Canada will continue in a slightly modified form its 
postal subsidies for Canadian produced magazines and the United 
States will monitor closely the effect of that modification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond everything, Bill C-55, inclusive with the amendments, has 
shown over and over again a lack of consultation and planning. 
Even on the issue of subsidizing magazines, basic questions 
needed to be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of subsidization, should it have been short term?  What 
are the needs of the readers in this country?  Were the readers 
in this country even asked?  We are dealing with amendments that 
have come back from the Senate which has indicated that the 
intent of the bill has changed substantially and I agree. 
It basically is a trade bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What determines success?  The survivability of magazines that 
are not viable.  As hon. members know, we spend considerable 
funds subsidizing magazines today.  What will happen with this 
set of amendments?  We already know that this deal will cost a 
substantial amount, perhaps up to $300 million will be given to 
the magazine publishing industry.  I raise the question, why are 
we doing this?  How long will this occur?  Will the magazine 
publishing industry continue to receive upward of $300 million 
from here on in, year in and year out?  Again, it will cost 
taxpayers a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are split-run editions in this country today.  As we 
informed the House months ago, there were ethnic split runs in 
this country of which the government was not aware.  I would like 
to inform the House that there are actually national magazines in 
this country that do split runs in the Canadian marketplace. 
Again, that is more information that the government probably did 
not come across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would read into the record a letter written by Ruth Kelly, the 
publisher and editor of the Alberta <I>Venture Magazine</I>. Her 
comments were published in the <I>Marketing Magazine</I>.  Her 
letter concerns split runs within her own borders.  We are trying 
to deal with split runs outside our borders, but at the same time 
we are not even aware that there are split runs in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her letter reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pros and cons of Bill C-55 have been strenuously debated in 
the pages of your magazine, among others.  As the publisher and 
editor of a business magazine that serves a regional audience, I 
thought long and hard about the ramifications of this 
legislative firewall.  Ultimately, I decided that I could not 
support Bill C-55.  The hypocrisy of a business magazine taking a 
stance that advocates protectionism for its industry, at the 
potential expense of others, was untenable for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, Paul Jones, publisher of <I>Canadian Business</I> and 
spokesperson for the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association, 
has experienced no such qualms.  I am not sure how he has 
reconciled his stance with the free trade gospel so fervently 
espoused by <I>Canadian Business</I> editor Arthur Johnson.  That, 
however, I am willing to leave up to his conscience—and the judgment 
of his readers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am somewhat more curious as to how Jones can speak so 
persuasively about the evils of split run editions even as he 
comes into my market and poaches my advertising dollars with nary 
a hint of guilt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize this point: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades, regional magazines have faced the same kind of 
competitive practices about which Jones moans.  Nationals like 
<I>Maclean's</I>, <I>Canadian Business</I> and <I>Chatelaine</I> 
create regional editions which are designated as such for the 
purpose of advertising sales only. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they are split runs. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They offer only a token, if at all, amount of editorial coverage 
to the regions, do not invest in the publishing infrastructure in 
that region, and do not participate in the cultural or business 
lives of the regional community.  Feel free to correct me if I'm 
wrong, but I believe that adequately describes the bugaboo of 
American split run magazines. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She concludes by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional magazines have learned to compete against Canadian 
split runs by developing strong relationships with our readers 
and ensuring that advertisers benefit from that relationship.  If 
Jones and his national brethren fear the spectre of competition, 
I would suggest they give me a call.  I would be happy to run a 
seminar on Competition 101—but it would have to be held in 
Alberta.  Hopefully, most of them know where that is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the letter written by Ruth Kelly, publisher and editor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not rush in to give regional magazines a 
subsidy to help fend off the national magazines when they were 
doing their split runs.  Obviously, as this letter shows, our 
national magazines, which the government has gone to bat for, 
have done the same thing that they are complaining about, which 
is that they are being preyed upon by our neighbours to the 
south, the American split runs.   Where is the justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest question that has not been answered with all of 
these changes and amendments is how much this deal will cost the 
Canadian taxpayer.  We have asked the minister in the House the 
same question, but we have received no answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will be the beneficiaries and for how long?  As I have 
indicated, the government has gone to bat for the publishing 
industry, principally two large corporations.  We have read in 
the press that a deal has been made and magazine publishers will 
receive subsidization.  This amendment points to this very fact. 
How can we support these amendments unless we know the costs 
associated with them?  The government refuses to divulge that 
information to let the people of the country know what this will 
cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been agreed to between the United States and Canada? 
That is another question we have received very little answer to 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with some of the key points that the 
government has agreed to with our American counterparts.  The key 
amendments to Bill C-55 include the following key provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada agreed to amend Bill C-55 to narrow its scope by 
exempting foreign-owned magazines that are published in Canada or 
exported to Canada and carry advertisements directed primarily at 
the Canadian market within the permissible level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially foreign magazines exported to Canada that carry less 
than 12% of Canadian ads will not be subject to Bill C-55 
penalties.  After 18 months the level grows to 15%.  After 36 
months it will grow to 18%, as we have read in the amendments to 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms incorporated in the agreement will provide new 
opportunities for foreign investment.  Very little of this 
information has been discussed in this House.  Effective 90 days 
after the signing of this agreement Canada will permit up to 51% 
foreign ownership in the establishment and acquisition of 
businesses to publish, distribute and sell periodicals, except 
for the acquisition of Canadian-owned businesses.  After one year 
Canada will permit up to and including 100% foreign ownership. 
Partnerships of foreign investors with majority Canadian 
ownership will be permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investments will continue to be subject to a net benefit review 
under section 38 of the Investment Canada Act.  Under the review, 
among other things, Canadian investment officials will consider 
contributions to the Canadian economy, the effect of the 
investment on competition and compatibility with cultural 
policies.  Publishers may be asked to undertake substantial 
levels of original editorial content in periodicals published in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original editorial content means non-advertising content 
that is authored by Canadians, including, but not limited to, 
writers, journalists, illustrators and photographers; or created 
for the Canadian market and does not appear in any other edition 
of one or more periodicals published outside Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I ask is, who won this contest?  Did we win this 
contest or did our neighbours win the contest?  Or was it a draw? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key tax provisions of concern to U.S. publishers include the 
following terms, again as impacted by the amendments to this 
bill.  Within one year of the signing of this agreement section 
19 of the Income Tax Act will be amended so as to allow 
advertisers deductions for advertisements in periodicals 
regardless of the nationality of the publishers or the place of 
production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will further amend the Income Tax Act to modify the 
amount of the allowable deduction in the original editorial 
content requirement to permit half the deduction of advertising 
costs for advertisers in publications with zero to 79% original 
editorial content, and a full deduction of advertising costs for 
advertisers in publications with 80% or more original editorial 
content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current tax deductions were not available to advertisers if the 
foreign-owned magazines were published under a licensing 
agreement with a Canadian.  As a result of the agreement, 
periodicals published under such licensing arrangements will not 
be excluded under the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another term of reference is that a consultation clause is 
included in the agreement so that Canada and the United States 
can consult annually on any matter regarding the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we have not debated the terms of the 
agreement in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party will not support these amendments as they 
basically deal with trade and not culture.  It is unfortunate 
that governments tend to wrap themselves around a flag and try to 
sell trade issues as culture.  Even with the amendments, it would 
be interesting to see how this amended bill would stand up to a 
charter challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the changes in technology that are currently occurring 
in the world, governments all have to realize that they need to 
thoroughly evaluate all of their grants and subsidies.  We have 
heard that the Internet will have a huge impact in the future, 
not only in terms of culture, but also trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canadian culture should be promoted, as many 
people have indicated, and promoted front and centre on all 
international fronts.  Canadians do things well.  We know that. 
We have a great track record.  We need to seriously believe that 
promotion is the way to save our rich and diverse culture.  We 
are not Americans.  We are Canadians and we should not give in to 
protectionism which costs taxpayers dearly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to Bill C-55, an act respecting advertising 
services supplied by foreign periodical publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was originally introduced by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage for the purpose of limiting access to Canada's 
advertising market to Canadian magazines only.  Unfortunately, 
as we see, the Canadian government has given in to pressure from 
the United States.  In effect, it has decided to open the 
domestic advertising market to foreign publishers by authorizing 
them to publish in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that by giving in to the Americans 
like this the federal government is giving them ammunition in 
their fight to reduce cultural protection measures. 
In fact, the Canadian government's concessions with respect to 
magazines are merely the latest in a series of such concessions 
that began the day after the Liberal government was elected in 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many in the House will remember the well-known case of Ginn 
Publishing and Maxwell-Macmillan.  Contrary to Canadian cultural 
policy, cabinet authorized the handover of these Canadian 
publishing houses to American interests when there were 
Canadian publishers prepared to buy them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC also gave in to the Americans in the case of the 
country music specialty channel.  The Americans had threatened 
$1 million in reprisals if the CRTC decided to cancel the 
American station's licence, in accordance with its policy at the 
time, because a similar Canadian station was already licensed in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of this CRTC policy was to counteract American 
broadcasting competition.  After the Country Music Network 
affair the CRTC abandoned the policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the DMX affair the minister also gave in to the Americans. 
In this case, we will recall, the CRTC gave a broadcasting 
licence to DMX although it did not meet quotas for Canadian and 
French language content.  The entire artistic community rose up 
in arms over this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious that the Americans are nibbling away, and 
successfully, at the scope of Canada's cultural policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had obtained assurances from the present Minister of Canadian 
Heritage and from her predecessor that Bills C-103 and C-55 in 
their original versions would conform on all points with 
international trade treaty requirements.  The ability of the 
Governments of Canada and Quebec to defend the rights of 
citizens has been jeopardized considerably by the federal 
government's errors, not on just one occasion, but two.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Canadian and Quebec governments' ability to adopt 
cultural protection measures that is being questioned here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois feels that the periodicals issue is a clear 
demonstration of Canada's inability to defend its own culture in 
a bilateral and single-sector negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's culture is the focal point of the sovereignist project. 
Quebec must therefore be at the negotiating table for the 
coming millennium talks, starting next fall at Seattle, under the 
auspices of the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill. 
It is vital, before explaining the reasons for this opposition, 
to speak to the procedure followed in this matter for the 
benefit of those watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government simply improvised in this most important 
matter. Bill C-55 was intended to keep the advertising market 
exclusively for Canadian magazine publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, the bill was sent to the Senate for ratification, but there 
the usual procedure came to a halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage, the senators and the 
witnesses who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on 
Transport and Communications debated the bill, which limited 
access to the advertising market to Canadian publishers only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an unusual occurrence in this matter. 
In fact, on the last day of hearings by the Senate committee, 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage tabled amendments to reflect 
the agreement she had negotiated with the Americans. The result: 
the Liberal majority passed Bill C-55 in its amended form, which 
now gives foreign publishers access to the domestic advertising 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, before this House, the government is asking us to ratify 
its legislation. Clearly, no committee was in a position to 
evaluate the impact of the amendments the minister made to the 
bill. No witness was heard on these amendments, which give 
foreign publishers access to Canada's advertising market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fairly unusual, indeed surprising, to have the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage table these amendments in the Senate. 
The House of Commons has always been the place for Quebecers and 
Canadians to debate legislation. The members comply with the 
rules. How did the Minister of Canadian Heritage dare to 
circumvent these rules and the spirit of this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support this bill when I have not heard witnesses speak 
to the measures the government brought to the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage. This is an unprecedented and unacceptable 
improvisation on its part. It would be more 
reassuring if the improvisation were left to the Ligue nationale 
d'improvisation, a Quebec cultural invention that enjoys 
worldwide success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Order must be established so that the government will comply 
with the rules of the House of Commons. Cultural legislation 
will have a bearing on Quebec and Canada's cultural future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main purpose of the bill was to limit advertising revenue to 
Canadian magazine publishers only.  This measure was introduced 
last October in place of Bill C-103, which the World Trade 
Organization considered incompatible with Canada's international 
commitments proposed by the previous Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that, at the time, the government 
told anyone who would listen that its bill was consistent with 
our international commitments.  Unfortunately, that was not the 
case.  The federal government was proven very wrong indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage said that the original bill 
was consistent with the government's commitments.  She claimed 
that it was still consistent with WTO and NAFTA rules. 
Why did the minister decide to give in and open the publishing 
market to foreign magazines? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT36"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT36"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of questions come to mind.  Did she have doubts about 
her ability to convince a NAFTA dispute tribunal?  If so, why 
did she then introduce Bill C-55 in its original format?  And, if 
she was certain of winning, why did she cave in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that has come back to us from the Senate is very 
different from the one it received.  It unfortunately opens the 
door to foreign publishers interested in the domestic 
advertising market. Foreign publishers who decide to publish 
their magazines in Canada, by recycling editorial content, will 
be able to sell up to 18% of their advertising space to Canadian 
advertisers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill then allows U.S. publishers to set up shop in Canada, 
provided their investment application is approved by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.  If they publish 50% or more 
Canadian content, these U.S. publishers, like Canadian magazine 
publishers, will be able to grant Canadian advertisers tax 
breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments water down the rules limiting foreign ownership 
in the magazine industry.  Now a Canadian magazine could be 49% 
foreign owned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the Magazine Association of Canada have 
expressed their disappointment with this agreement between 
Canada and the United States. 
They expressed it as follows, and I quote “In our opinion, the 
agreement puts the magazine industry at risk by allowing 
American magazines to take over an unacceptable proportion of 
the Canadian advertising services market through unfairly 
lowered advertising rates”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These concessions are unacceptable. The Bloc Quebecois cannot 
support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an interview given to the <I>Globe and Mail</I>—and I repeat the quote 
given by my 
colleague from the Reform Party—François de Gaspé Beaubien said 
that the United States has 19 women's magazines, containing 19,000 
pages of advertising. If these foreign publishers sold 18% of 
their magazine pages in Canada, they could sell 3,400 pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal Canadian magazines for women, however, contain a 
total of 4,800 pages of advertising. 
That means that 18% of the pages set aside for advertising by 
the United States represent 63% of the pages of advertising in 
Canadian magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The threat is serious. Some have estimated that the Americans 
could go after some 50% of all advertising revenues in Canada, 
approximately $300 million, with the authorization given them to 
sell 18% of their advertising pages to Canadian advertisers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc would like to know what resources will be allocated to 
administer the new proposed rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point we know very little of the support measures. 
What form will they take? How much money will be spent on them? 
Where will this money come from? Will programs be set or 
proportional to the loss incurred by the Canadian publishers? 
Will they be adaptable if, in the coming decade, the proportion 
of revenues taken away from Canadian publishers by foreign 
publishers turns out to be greater than expected? Will there be 
one office responsible for ensuring that foreign publishers in 
fact meet their quotas? Will there be resources allocated to 
ensure that foreign publishers authorized to set up in Canada 
meet the conditions for setting up on the Canadian market, 
namely that of publishing over 50% of Canadian editorial 
content? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, quite apart from the publishing industry, the minister, 
in negotiating this agreement with the Americans, though she was 
convinced she was in compliance with all the international trade 
agreements, simply reinforced the Americans' habit of 
challenging our existing and future cultural measures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, then, will the Americans react the next time a government, 
generally the Government of Canada or Quebec, takes some step 
to protect the development of its culture when we have already 
backed down in one area in which we felt we were right? Do the 
Americans just have to raise their voices a bit to scare us, to 
make us backtrack, to make us not apply our cultural measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Multilateral and multisectorial negotiations will be starting 
this fall, under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, in 
Seattle.  If Canada has given in on such an important issue, 
what will it do in the WTO negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, we no longer know what the government's position 
will be on the place culture will take in international trade 
agreements.  Does Canada favour a general cultural exception 
clause, defined by us, as it did at the time of the MAI?  Or 
does it intend to initiate negotiations on culture in some 
context other than the WTO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is concerned.  We would like to see Quebecers 
at the international negotiating tables representing our 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seriously wondering, if Canada is not capable of 
defending its own cultural measures, what will become of ours, 
particularly our Charte de la langue française? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec must be at the WTO negotiating table.  This is only 
common sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to the Senate amendments to Bill C-55, an act 
respecting advertising services supplied by foreign periodical 
publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been on my feet many times over the last year on this 
bill.  I have been asking questions, making statements and 
following it very closely.  This is kind of the 11th hour on this 
debate and I will try to say some things that mean something to 
me at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about the direction the bill has taken.  I 
will speak personally as a new rookie MP. I have watched the bill 
with great interest from its inception around a year ago.  I 
remember watching a press conference on television.  The 
ministers of heritage and industry were tanned and confident as 
they talked about this wonderful bill which had been crafted, 
which was WTO-proof, dragon-proof and was going to be able to 
defend us in the big, wide world of mega-magazines and split runs 
and all of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all felt good about that in our hearts.  We thought it 
sounded good.  It sounded like a net benefit to Canadian culture, 
as we see so much stuff coming across our border that is not 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party and I gave our cautious consent because 
there were things in it that we did not really agree with.  We 
would have liked to have seen it go further, but we did believe 
in the spirit of it.  We believed that it was an effort to say 
that we can work within the trade agreements and protect our 
culture at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now a year down the line.  The bill that was put forward 
that day was digested and picked over by all of us. 
I will talk about some of the contents of the Canadian-made Bill 
C-55 just for the record.  It is no longer there, but these are 
some of the ideas we were supporting. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 was to make it an offence to provide Canadian 
advertising services aimed at the Canadian market to be placed in 
foreign periodical publications, except for those currently 
receiving Canadian advertising.  For people who do not understand 
anything about this business and are probably sick to death of 
hearing about it without understanding it, the whole basis of 
this is that there is a certain amount of money out there for 
magazines to use to create their product.  It is the Canadian 
advertising industry which Canadian magazines are dependent on 
for their survival, along with government subsidies and the 
enormous support they get from the people who buy the magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is all about advertising.  It is about trying to 
protect this pool of advertising, this amount of moneys that is 
available to support our industry, our writers, our editors, our 
publishers, our photographers and all of the people who want to 
read our stories.  That was the intent of Bill C-55 that sunny 
day many months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an offence, which would have been enforceable by 
Canadian law, after an investigation was ordered by the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage.  This would have happened if foreign 
periodical publications used Canadian advertising.  The penalties 
would have ranged from the maximum of $20,000 for an individual's 
first offence on a summary conviction, to $250,000 for a 
corporate offender on indictment.  Offences that took place 
outside of Canada by foreign individuals or corporations would 
have been deemed to have taken place in Canada for the purposes 
of enforcement of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am using the past tense because this is no longer the bill 
that we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would have collected unpaid fines levied upon 
conviction in the same manner as a civil judgment.  The cabinet 
would have made regulations relating to the investigators, the 
conduct of the investigations and the definition of the Canadian 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole bill was based on the fact that we were going to 
protect the Canadian advertising market for Canadian magazines. 
The minister of culture had her dukes up.  She was ready to 
fight.  She was ready to stand up to the American bully.  We 
heard this over and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go on, I will say that I like American magazines.  I do 
not want to say that they have no place in this constellation.  I 
like them a great deal and I have tremendous admiration for 
American writers.  I like a whole lot about the United States and 
its talent and its spirit.  A lot of its talent and spirit 
managed to manifest itself in this deal but it was not to our 
benefit.  It was to the American's benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the talent and spirit of the Americans that I do not 
like, it is the velocity and the volume of the American product 
that just overwhelms our shores.  I think that Bill C-55 was an 
11th hour effort to protect the Canadian magazine industry from 
being swamped by thousands of shiny, glossy, sexy American 
magazines which we see row by row, bicep by bicep, cleavage by 
cleavage in our airport bookstores and in chains of American 
bookstores, which we now have all over our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we were hoping was going to happen was that we would have 
some control over this wave, which was what the Canadian version 
of Bill C-55 was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we have seen is a complete collapse of the 
government's will to stand up to the American bully in the final 
analysis.  In one of my first experiences as a rookie MP, it was 
a very sad day when I heard that the deal, which we had taken 
through the House in a democratic process, had collapsed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look around the room, I see others who might feel the 
same; that we were doing some good work in terms of looking at 
this legislation and really trying to make some amendments to 
make it as good as it could be.  We voted on Bill C-55 and sent 
it to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I was not aware of was that the democratic bills in the 
House of Commons go somewhere else.  They go to Washington where 
they are really worked on.  That was quite a shock to me. I think 
it would shock most Canadians to realize that there is actually a 
four stage journey or maybe five.  It goes from the House to the 
Senate, from the Senate to the United States, back to the Senate 
and then it comes back to the House to be rammed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that has come back here, which went to the Senate from 
the United States in the last couple of weeks, is a very 
different bill.  It is one which I will run through right now and 
then tell the House what it means to the people in the magazine 
industry, to the people who like to read Canadian magazines and 
to the cultural workers in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The made-in-America deal, which has just been penned and signed, 
commits Canada to amend our foreign investment policy so it falls 
under section 38 of the Investment Canada Act, allowing for the 
cabinet to regulate and prescribe what and how much foreign 
ownership Americans can have in our industry. The agreement also 
forces Canada to allow for increased ownership, up to 51% after 
90 days, and up to 100% within a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new made-in-America Bill C-55 also commits Canada to change 
the Income Tax Act to allow advertisers to receive deductions for 
placing ads in American publications aimed at the Canadian 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new made-in-America Bill C-55 contains a “without 
prejudice” section to diminish the agreement's ability to set a 
precedent under the WTO, NAFTA, Investment Canada Act or under 
Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the central issues that I am concerned about is that this 
deal sets out the surrender of our market by prescribing the 
formula to allow for American split runs to invade our market 
with a total of 12% of total Canadian ad content immediately, 
rising to 18% within 36 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax act shall also be amended to allow for one-half 
deductions in magazines with up to 79% original content and 100% 
for publications with more than 80% original editorial content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of Canadian content at this point in time is one 
that I am extremely concerned about because it has now 
metamorphosed into a completely different meaning than the one we 
all knew it to be, and that is one of being material written by 
Canadians or having some involvement by Canadians.  One of the 
questions I asked the minister today in the House of Commons 
dealt the issue of Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new wording for Canadian content means that as long as it is 
original to a split-run magazine in Canada then it is considered 
Canadian content.  It no longer has to be written or published by 
a Canadian or have a Canadian theme.  Nothing like that is 
important any more, as long as it is created originally for the 
Canadian market and has not appeared in another edition in 
Canada. 
The idea of Canadian content is watered down so significantly 
that I fear very much the precedent it is setting for all of the 
other Canadian cultural industries which are also very much 
dependent on the idea of Canadian content.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention right now some of the impact this is 
going to have on our industry.  We have over 900,000 Canadian 
workers in culture. This is a 1997 UNESCO figure. We have a 
responsibility in the House to protect these workers along with 
the idea of Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told by the government that we had a chance to stand up 
to the American entertainment monolith. We had a chance to defend 
this at the WTO but we did not do that.  We did not use our 
cultural exemption contained in NAFTA. We ignored our own legal 
advice regarding Bill C-55 being WTO proof.  We basically showed 
the Americans that we had no interest in protecting culture. 
I think that is coming right down to the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have simply said “It is all right, this is just one more 
product we will negotiate with you and we will in fact give in to 
you”. The only lesson the Americans have learned here is that if 
they threaten a trade war with the Canadians, do not worry 
because the Canadians will surrender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to use the existing trade rules to protect our 
magazines we are saying we will allow the Americans to make up 
international rules as they go along.  It is therefore only a 
matter of time before American interests go after Canadian 
content on television, ownership levels in our broadcasting 
industry, support for our book publishing industry, support for 
our feature films and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of this new fund, which is going to be a fund to 
augment the deathblow to the Canadian industry, is suspect.  This 
government reduced direct cultural support by over $500 million 
between 1993 and 1998. That is in the official estimates.  Any 
new fund will not necessarily restore money and there is no 
indication at this point where the money is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to read into the record a motion that I 
was going to put forward.  It is interesting that the Reform 
member put forward a motion which said the new made in America 
Bill C-55 did not go nearly far enough. I was going to put 
another motion forward. I will read it into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we would have moved would have been: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words following 
“That” and substituting the following:

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amendments subvert the intent of Bill C-55 to protect

Canadian market;

be created and aimed at the Canadian market that were not 
foreseen or discussed by the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage in their study of the bill; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) granting sweeping powers to the Governor in Council to 
define revenue levels and determine Canadian content especially 
but not exclusively in section 20 of the bill. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we believe that American made Bill C-55 is a craven 
bill and a tragedy for Canadian culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the New Democratic Party, I commend 
my colleague from Dartmouth for her tireless efforts and hard 
work in doing what unfortunately our heritage minister has been 
unable to do and that has been to remain committed to maintaining 
our Canadian culture and heritage.  I think that is a real shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the House on quite a number of occasions when I heard 
the minister make reference to this bill.  I remember one day 
specifically she made reference to the fact that she wanted to 
guarantee that her 10 year old daughter was able to continue to 
read her magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar to the minister I also have a 10 year old daughter.  I 
would like to hope that when my 10 year old daughter picks up a 
magazine and reads about Canada, that she is reading it from a 
Canadian perspective and not from the perspective of somebody 
sitting on a warm beach in Los Angeles.  I differ with the 
minister with respect to wanting to guarantee what type of 
literature my daughter has access to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Dartmouth talked about the number of concerns 
she and the New Democratic Party have with respect to Bill C-55. 
Could she tell us what she feels is the most important issue, or 
what is the most important thing we as Canadians are losing with 
respect to Bill C-55? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Madam Speaker, the most important thing 
that we are losing is our ability to protect our culture.  We are 
losing our ability to keep those Canadian titles in the 
bookstores, specifically to keep those Canadian titles on the 
magazine racks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage will say that there was 100% 
of advertising revenue and we have given away 18% and that it 
could have been much worse.  If 100 new American split-run 
magazines come in here and each one of them has 18% of its 
advertising revenue Canadian, I would say that that valuable pool 
of Canadian advertising revenue would dry up very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be Canadian magazines out there.  There will continue 
to be Canadian magazines, but there will be fewer of them.  Many 
of them will go under. We will begin to see magazines which 
purport to be Canadian but in fact are American knockoffs of 
Canadian magazines that have no heart or soul or particular 
interest in this place as an experience, as a land to live in and 
to fight for, but in fact a market in which they can extract more 
revenue.  That is the central tragedy of this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is with 
a profound sense of regret that I rise to debate the amendments 
to Bill C-55 which the government introduced in its attempt to 
appease American discontent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House have explored the merits of Bill C-55 for 
well over six months.  We met with countless individuals who 
voiced their opinions on how this piece of legislation could help 
ensure the long term viability of Canada's magazine industry in 
light of the increased presence of periodicals coming in from our 
international trading partners. We also heard many dissenting 
opinions from those who stood to be most adversely affected by 
the implementation of this piece of legislation. Throughout these 
deliberations, one thing remained constant: the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage's supposedly undeterred conviction that Canada 
must stand up to U.S. pressure by continuing to protect Canada's 
magazine industry against unfair trading practices associated 
with U.S. split-run magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all recall the minister's impassioned pleas calling upon 
all Canadians to rally against the bullying tactics of the U.S. 
and stand up for Canada's magazine industry so that her daughter 
would have an opportunity to read Canadian stories that are 
actually written by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that I was even convinced that the minister was 
sincere in her commitment to protect Canadian culture.  Like so 
many other Canadians, I found out that putting faith in the 
minister's convictions was indeed a mistake.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite serious threats of U.S. retaliation and the subsequent 
pressure all MPs must have received from concerned constituents, 
all federal political parties, except the Reform Party, agreed 
that Canadian culture was indeed worth standing up for. It is 
ironic that the minister who so vociferously criticized the U.S. 
bullying tactics during this dispute is the very minister who 
would succumb to their pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is now truly unbelievable is the fact that the minister is 
claiming victory with this agreement with the U.S. when in fact 
we all know she has effectively sacrificed Canada's magazine 
industry because she did not believe strongly in Canadian 
culture.  Not only did the minister tell her own daughter that 
Canadian culture is worth sacrificing if it means keeping 
American interests happy, she has sent a message to the rest of 
Canada that what we once held as sacred in this country has now 
become just another commodity worth trading in the open market. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to support Bill C-55 was not an easy one.  We all 
feared possible reprisals by the Americans against Canadian 
industries.  No one was interested in a war with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We nonetheless supported the bill because we thought it was 
important for us, as an autonomous country, to safeguard our 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are really disturbed to see the federal government abandoning 
our Canadian publications when, in the past, lawmakers worked so 
hard to preserve them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it became painfully apparent that the government was 
wavering in its commitment to Bill C-55, representatives of 
Canada's magazine industry suggested to the federal government 
that allowing U.S. magazines anything above 10% Canadian 
advertising without having to produce any Canadian content would 
seriously imperil a number of Canadian periodicals.  Despite this 
warning the federal government agreed to provide U.S. magazines 
with 18% free access to Canadian advertising before having to 
produce any Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the government's capitulation on its original 
commitment to stand by Bill C-55 as passed in the House of 
Commons, it should not have come as any surprise to our magazine 
industry that its government would give U.S. interests a major 
portion of Canada's advertising revenue. Even the government 
recognizes the huge impact its decision is going to have on our 
Canadian magazine industry, so much so that it has announced its 
intention to provide magazines that are most affected with some 
kind of a subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one knows any of the details associated with this subsidy. 
How much money will be available for our Canadian magazine 
publishers?  Who will qualify for this subsidy?  On what basis 
will the government allocate funds to the industry?  How long can 
our magazine industry depend on having access to this subsidy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions addressed to the minister have resulted in the 
response that the government is working on it. Basically the 
government is asking us to trust it.  It all comes down to 
credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is obvious the Minister of Canadian Heritage has lost 
credibility within her own cabinet. She has certainly lost 
credibility with Canada's magazine industry. More specifically, 
she has lost credibility among Canadians across the country. It 
is plain and simple.  The Minister of Canadian Heritage has 
turned her back on Canada's magazine industry and more 
specifically on Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look back to when the minister stood before us in this House 
and gave impassioned speeches on how we must protect Canadian 
culture. I find it very difficult to comprehend that this was 
indeed the same minister who most recently sat before the media 
to announce that her government had succumbed to U.S. pressure 
and that she was prepared to sacrifice our Canadian magazine 
industry to appease U.S. demands.  Perhaps I was a little naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I regret to 
interrupt the hon. member.  When the bill is 
debated again he will have about 14 minutes remaining in 
his time.

that Bill C-482, an act to amend the Hazardous Products Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.

opportunity to present a private member's bill before the 
Chamber.  It is the first opportunity I have had to do so since 
being elected two years ago, almost to the day.  It is the first 
time I have been successful in winning the lottery and being able 
to propose a course of action for parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that it is my first opportunity, I am pleased that I am 
able to present a bill today which deals with a matter very close 
to my heart and of grave concern to members on all sides of the 
House.  It is a matter pertaining to the question of children's 
health and well-being and the question of ensuring that we work 
now to ensure that our children are healthy today so that they 
can contribute to society in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-482 is designed to introduce changes to the Hazardous 
Products Act with the specific purpose of safeguarding our 
children from toxic additives in toys and other children's items. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to introduce a private member's bill that would 
prohibit the sale of children's toys containing lead, cadmium or 
phthalate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today dealing with the matter of children's health. 
We are also here today dealing with the matter of the fundamental 
responsibility of our government and, in particular, the 
fundamental responsibility of the health protection branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past number of years we have raised numerous concerns 
about the very serious question of whether or not this aspect of 
government is doing its utmost to ensure that the food we eat, 
the water we drink, the drugs we have to take and the toys we 
play with are safe beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have raised many concerns about whether or not the health 
protection branch is fulfilling that fundamental objective.  We 
have also raised many concerns about its apparent readiness to 
offload that responsibility on to consumers without adequate 
information and on to industry, which is obviously concerned 
first and foremost about promoting its products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here once again this evening trying to fill what would 
appear to be yet another gap in our health protection system 
created by the government's failure to stand up for children's 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time New Democrats in the House have 
spoken about toxins in children's products.  This is one of the 
first issues I brought to the attention of the government after 
being elected to the House and have raised repeatedly since then, 
particularly as evidence mounted about the dangers to children's 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About two years ago the member for Acadie—Bathurst introduced a 
motion that would have required a label so parents could tell 
which items contained harmful substances.  Despite broad support 
for that motion it was unfortunately defeated by a majority of 
Liberal members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question today is why those members did not want to step in 
to protect children's health.  It used to be that the argument of 
ignorance could be made.  We used to be able to plead ignorance 
because many did not realize there were toxins in children's 
products, but for some time now we have become acutely aware of 
what dangers are in store for children when they play and chew on 
certain toys and products. 
We have become acutely aware of three dangerous toxins: lead, 
cadmium and phthalates, which is a softener used in PVC plastics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lead is a well known neurotoxin which scientists have been 
studying for many years.  We know from all the studies that there 
is no safe level.  Cadmium is an even more dangerous neurotoxin. 
It is also a renal toxin and a carcinogen.  Phthalates have been 
linked in animal testing to liver and kidney damage and to 
reproductive developmental problems.  All these toxins pose a 
special threat to children and are addressed in the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devastating effects of these substances on children are well 
documented.  With new information and improved testing, we can 
no longer plead ignorance.  There is no excuse for exposing our 
children to these risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would do what the government has not done to date: 
protect our children. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rigorous independent science, truly independent science not paid 
for by any manufacturer, has found that lead and cadmium are so 
toxic that even low levels can cause irreparable harm to 
children's intellectual and behavioural development, including 
attention levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are quite obviously smaller than adults and what may be 
a safe level for adults can be too much for a child.  Phthalates 
as well seep or leach out of products when subjected to normal 
treatment by young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not just talking about babies or infants.  With infants 
everything goes into the mouth where it is chewed and sucked on. 
With older children necklaces and other objects get mouthed more 
as a habit.  In this normal mouthing toxins, and phthalates are 
particularly vulnerable to this, seep or leach out of the product 
into the saliva and are consumed and absorbed by the body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this is not news any more.  Health Canada has 
actually recognized the danger of these substances.  In June 1996 
it issued a warning about household vinyl mini-blinds out of 
concern that children would ingest dust as these products broke 
down in the sun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1998 there was another warning of children's jewellery 
that contained a high 1,002 parts per million of lead.  In 
November last year there was another warning of phthalates in 
children's items. In that same month the European Union 
authoritative scientific committee on toxicity, ecotoxicity and 
the environment also warned about phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no secret about toxins, but like virtually any subject 
there are opposing views.  We need only think back to the reams 
of scientific studies financed by the tobacco industry over the 
years proving conclusively that there were no links between 
smoking and cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do leading children's advocates have to say on this matter? 
In acknowledging the words and support of some of these 
organizations, I want to pay a special tribute to individuals and 
organizations that have been particularly helpful in putting 
together the necessary research and proposals which led to the 
bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular I acknowledge the work of Greenpeace which has 
certainly been front and centre of the issue.  Members will be 
fully aware of how many times representatives of that 
organization brought independent scientific advice and 
information to members of the Chamber about the toxicity of lead, 
cadmium and phthalates.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the individuals from Greenpeace who have been so 
helpful, as well as a number of other organizations that have 
been particularly concerned about the impact of toxins on 
children and have been active in raising these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me acknowledge the Canadian Institute of Child Health which 
stated as recently as June 9: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the demonstrated scientific evidence of damaging effects 
that phthalates, lead and cadmium have on children's health, 
products which contain these chemicals must be prohibited and/or 
regulated as is outlined in the proposed amendments to the 
Hazardous Products Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Learning Disabilities Association of Canada indicated 
support for the bill or for any initiative on the part of the 
government to take action to prohibit the sale of any products 
containing dangerously high levels of cadmium, phthalates and 
lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Child Care Federation has written expressing 
concern for the safety of Canada's children.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation to protect children from exposure to toxic toys is a 
necessary first step in providing a safe, healthy environment for 
our children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also mention the contribution by the Canadian Association 
of Physicians for the Environment which expressed support for the 
legislation and urged us to be vigilant on the matter.  I am sure 
it would like to leave a message with the government to support 
the bill or take immediate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the evidence from scientists.  We know the concerns from 
groups involved in ensuring health and well-being for our 
children.  Now it is time for action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people would like us to believe that there are no 
alternatives, but that is no longer a valid excuse.  Alternatives 
exist.  We now know that while 80% of new toys on the market 
contain plastic, only 4.5% of these use the type containing 
phthalates.  Substitutes are readily available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does all this lead us?  It leads us to acting.  It leads 
us to the political will to protect the health and safety of our 
children.  We have a consensus that we want to keep our children 
as safe as possible.  We have the most up to date independent 
science available and children's advocates telling us that it is 
time for urgent action.  All that remains is for us to act 
decisively.  Is that not why we are here after all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize to all members that the bill is before the 
House as a constructive proposal.  It is based on the principle 
of doing no harm.  It rejects the notion of allowing products on 
the market, particularly products that are used and played with 
by children, on the assumption that they have not been proven to 
be harmful.  We take the view on this side of the House, and I 
believe members of all parties do the same, that it is incumbent 
upon us as legislators, as members of the House, to ensure that 
products which are played with and chewed on by children are safe 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I presented to the House a bill which attempts to do 
just that.  Without legislative backup we will continue to muddle 
along with piecemeal, after the fact voluntary warnings such as 
the situation last fall when after finally testing selected 
products Health Canada recognized a danger from phthalates and 
issued a warning.  That warning was so piecemeal and ad hoc that 
it presented more confusion than actual assistance on this very 
critical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries have taken action.  I do not need to go into 
great detail about the efforts of Denmark to ban products 
containing lead or Austria that has banned products containing 
cadmium.  There is a solid record on the international front of 
countries prepared to say that enough is enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that even some toy manufacturers have been 
responsible in many parts of the country and the world for taking 
action to remove products that contain these toxins and have 
committed to producing all future toys using reliable and safe 
alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prompt action by our government, as well as protecting 
children's health, would encourage an opportunity for the 
fledgling Canadian toy industry to produce safe products that are 
marketable worldwide to health conscious consumers.  Continued 
inaction risks turning Canada into the dumping ground for the 
world's supply of toxic toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to give serious consideration to this 
bill, to consider it a very constructive proposition for the 
House, a very realistic way in which we can remove from children 
any threat of risk pertaining to the very dangerous contact with 
any kind of toxic carcinogenic material such cadmium, lead and 
phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note, I look forward to the debate.  I look forward to 
the suggestions and hope that we can move forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
comment on Private Members' Bill C-482, an act to amend the 
Hazardous Products Act.  This bill is intended to limit the 
allowable limits of lead and cadmium in consumer products and 
also ban outright the use of phthalates in products likely to be 
used by children under the age of three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress for a minute to let members know that I 
am a grandmother.  I have four grandchildren, the youngest of 
whom is just one year old.  As all parents and grandparents with 
young children and grandchildren, I believe it is very important 
for us to be knowledgeable about these issues and always assure 
everyone that our priority is the health and safety of Canadian 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on the issue of phthalates.  In recent 
years several organizations worldwide, including Health Canada, 
have informed the public of the health risks associated with the 
use of phthalates in products used by very young children.  I 
would like to take a moment to review some of the action already 
taken before I speak directly to Bill C-482. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament may recall, in November 1998 Health 
Canada issued a warning to parents and caregivers regarding the 
use of teethers, soothers and rattles containing phthalates. 
Industry was asked to immediately stop the production and sale of 
soft teething rings and rattles made of soft vinyl which included 
phthalates.  The success of this action led to the elimination of 
a major source of exposure to phthalates for young children in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people watching, phthalates is the chemical included 
in some but not all soft vinyl products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is currently reviewing industry's response to a 
voluntary phase-out of phthalates in toys and is examining new 
scientific information which was not available in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with other provisions within the bill concerning lead and 
cadmium, Bill C-482 provides the government with an enforcement 
mechanism for controlling the use of phthalates instead of 
relying on voluntary measures.  I want to point out that we 
believe to this point in time that the voluntary measures have 
been successful in dealing with an issue of concern for the 
Government of Canada and of concern for all knowledgeable parents 
and grandparents as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to lead, Health Canada has initiated a lead 
reduction strategy which will ensure that no lead is added in the 
manufacture of products for children.  As part of the strategy, 
including not only extensive consultation but also scientific 
research, it has been determined that the best indicator for 
determining if lead has been added to a product is to set a 
maximum level of 65 parts per million on a mass basis.  With 
respect to cadmium, its presence in the environment and in 
consumer products is not as ubiquitous as it is in the case of 
lead.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could support Bill C-482 if it included the 
following amendments:  one, limit the scope of included products 
from all products to products intended for use by children; two, 
change the 15 parts per million total lead to 65 parts per 
million total lead; three, limit the scope of the phthalate band 
to teethers, rattles and other toys intended for children under 
the age of 12 months and likely to be mouthed or chewed by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the member for Winnipeg North Centre for 
her continuing interest in this very important public health 
issue.  I hope that all members of the House will consider the 
issue carefully and support the amendments to Bill C-482 that I 
have suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view that it is very important when we have these 
discussions and debates that we not rely on rhetoric, that we not 
engage in fearmongering, but that we rely on valid scientific 
evidence.  That is essential if we are to act in the public 
interest, because our goal, which I believe is the goal of all 
members of the House, as it is the goal of the Minister of 
Health, Health Canada and this government, is to protect the 
health and safety of Canadians, especially the health and safety 
of Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not alone in the world in its concern about product 
safety, particularly product safety as it relates to toys, 
rattles, teethers and the sort of thing that children chew on, 
but when we draft legislation we want to ensure that legislation 
will do the job in a way which will protect the interests of all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to take this opportunity on behalf of the people of 
Surrey Central to speak to Bill C-482. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private member's bill being proposed by the NDP member of 
parliament would prohibit the sale, advertisement and importation 
of consumer products which contain a certain level of lead or 
cadmium.  This bill also seeks to ban toys used by children under 
the age of three which contain phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems like a fair enough bill and I will support it.  The 
intention, the protection of our children's health, is a noble 
cause.  We commend the hon. member from the NDP for bringing this 
matter before the House because the government does not and is 
not going to bring these matters to the floor of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government has cut $23 billion from our health 
care and education systems.  While Canadians are trying to 
protect the health of our children through efforts such as the 
one we are debating today, the Liberals are working against us. 
They are balancing the books of our federal government on the 
backs of taxpayers.  They are heavily taxing families with little 
children.  It is a wonder that young families even have the money 
to purchase these toys which may harm the health of their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health critic for the official opposition over the years has 
met many times with the Canadian Toy Manufacturers' Association, 
the Vinyl Council of Canada, Irwin Toys and many other groups and 
individuals concerned about this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed a matter of great concern when we hear that toys 
may contain toxins or dangerous chemicals.  We have all seen 
little children with plastic toys in their mouths or in contact 
with their skin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1997 the health protection branch of Health Canada 
released a report on its investigation into lead and cadmium in 
certain vinyl toys and other consumer products.  The government 
has done absolutely nothing about establishing guidelines as a 
result of that report.  In fact the Liberal majority on the other 
side of the House even voted down a private member's bill 
requiring warning labels to be placed on PVC toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report dismissed the risk posed by lead and cadmium.  This 
was met with charges that the report was a disservice to the 
Canadian people.  The branch has yet to release a report on the 
risks posed by phthalates which it promised.  Canadians are still 
waiting for the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, Denmark, Austria and Sweden are countries 
that have banned phthalates in infant toys.  The U.S. government, 
our neighbour, has told manufacturers to eliminate the use of 
lead that may be accessible to children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has no limits on phthalates, lead or cadmium in plastic 
consumer products.  The Liberals are allowing our nation to be an 
international dumping ground for these toxic, hazardous and 
dangerous toys, as well as other products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have allowed us to be a dumping ground for 
terrorists and other violent offenders because they have refused 
to fix our flawed, broken immigration and refugee system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have caused British Columbia, where I come from, to 
not only become a dumping ground but a distribution point and a 
clearing house for child pornography because they have refused to 
support our laws concerning the possession of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have also caused British Columbia, particularly the 
lower mainland area of Vancouver, including my home town of 
Surrey, to become a dumping ground for international drug dealers 
and cartels which send bogus refugees to our area to sell drugs 
to our children or smuggle themselves or drugs into the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our solicitor general leaves our RCMP, which has its largest 
detachment in Surrey, underfunded and understaffed.  In Surrey we 
have only four police officers patrolling the border between the 
U.S. and Canada.  Our police officers must handle problems 
associated with a major port of entry along with their domestic 
policing duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are waiting for a review from the solicitor general on our 
RCMP service, just like we are waiting for a report from the 
government on the risks posed by phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents I am tempted to support the bill, 
for no other reason than I can sympathize with the frustration of 
the NDP member, who sits with me on the health committee, who is 
trying to do some work and instead gets stonewalled by the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Canadians cannot wait for the Liberals.  Hepatitis C 
victims are dying while fighting the Liberal government in court. 
They cannot wait.  The Liberal health minister tried to close the 
file and ignore the conclusion of a royal commission on tainted 
blood which recommended compensating every person affected by 
federally controlled tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been accusations about the toxic level and the safety 
of certain toys.  The problem is in making sure that we are not 
hearing spurious representations on the danger of toys.  We must 
be sure that the problem actually exists and is rampant to the 
extent that we have to take legislative action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard that some claims are not so accurate.  One 
complaint declared that a child teething on a particular toy was 
actually at risk from material in the plastic of the toy because 
of dangerous and hazardous chemicals.  I then heard that science 
proved that the child would have to have the toy in its mouth 
constantly for years to suffer any bad effects.  On the other 
hand, in the research I have done concerning this bill, one 
manufacturer maintained that a child would have to have a toy in 
its mouth for three hours before it would suffer a health hazard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parents, and I am also a parent, know that it is easy for a 
child to have a toy in its mouth for three hours.  The toy is 
even more likely to be in contact with the skin.  It is not as 
though the child has a full time job, goes somewhere and does not 
have time to put these toys in its mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need good scientific studies to be accurate about what toys 
and which chemicals are threatening the health of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have two sides of the spectrum.  The onus is on the accuser 
to provide evidence of the harmful effect of anything; all of 
those hazardous chemicals and products that we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accusers need to have strong scientific evidence.  Canadians 
need to see independent, peer reviewed, double-blind studies 
which clearly conclude that something is harmful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister should have the health protection branch do 
the report on phthalates.  We cannot rely on the studies 
performed by the manufacturers which declare their toys safe. 
It would be like relying on the fox to mind the chicken coop.

telephone number to be used by parents who want to check out the 
PVC safety of their children's toys.  The health minister has 
shut down that toll free number.  The service was only set up to 
run during the big PVC toy scare of 1997.  Now the government 
acts as it if all went away and nothing happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of all the shenanigans—did I say Shawinigans—that 
I have encountered while preparing for today's debate, I will 
support the bill on behalf of the parents, the children who are 
defenceless, and all consumers of plastic products in Surrey 
Central.  My heart goes out to the private member who introduced 
the bill and fought hard to bring it forth.  The weak, arrogant 
Liberal government has refused to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how difficult it is to work with the arrogant, weak 
Liberal government which has absolutely no vision of where it is 
going.  It is not trying to do anything to protect health and

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>HAZARDOUS PRODUCTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK214">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-482, an 
act to amend the Hazardous Products Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
explain the position of the Bloc Quebecois with respect to Bill 
C-482, an act to amend the Hazardous Products Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate and thank the member for Winnipeg North Centre 
for raising this issue once again in this House on behalf of her 
party. We want to tell her that we support her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is intended to prohibit the advertisement and 
importation of consumer products that contain a certain level of 
lead or cadmium, unless they are excluded by regulation. It also 
bans the advertisement and importation of toys containing 
phthalates and intended for children under the age of three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree with me that we do not hear about phthalates 
every day, and yet we are probably in contact with them 
almost daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phthalates are chemical agents representing a family of 
synthetic compounds used in polyvinyl chloride or vinyl, 
commonly know as PVCs. For example, we can think of plastic 
covers, food wrap, furniture,  floor coverings, plastic bottles, 
knapsacks, raincoats and so on, all seemingly very innocent to 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is of concern to us today are the properties of this 
product used in toys for children to make them more flexible, 
softer and transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phthalates are often used in the manufacture of toys intended 
for newborns, such as pacifiers, teething rings, rattles, and 
other soft objects intended to be gummed and sucked by babies. 
Most of these toys for children contain between 10% and 40% 
phthalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The risk to health that these toys pose is easy to understand. 
Phthalates do not bind to polyvinyl chloride or vinyl, which are 
the toys basic material. Phthalates remain mobile, in 
suspension, and may separate from the PVCs. When a child chews 
on toys, for example, the phthalates may escape. Young children 
could therefore directly ingest phthlates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for cadmium and lead, a Health Canada study released last 
year concluded, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both lead and cadmium are toxic substances that are hazardous to 
the health and safety of children. Lead is especially hazardous 
to children's health. The latest medical and scientific research 
has shown that exposure to even very low levels of lead may have 
harmful effects on the intellectual and behavioural development 
of infants and young children.

levels of lead in certain toys far exceeded what they should be. 
It could well have added, and rightly so, that lead can damage 
the nervous system.  Lead is known to be neurotoxic, and has the 
capacity to cause permanent, irreversible brain damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might argue that there are regulations on lead, which is 
true.  However these apply only to paint, ceramic or glass 
products, pencils, crayons and artist brushes.  The Canadian 
government's altruism has led it to regulate paint more 
stringently than children's toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a question from my colleague from Drummond last 
November 16, the Minister of Health stated here in this House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today as a precautionary measure Health Canada announced as a 
warning to all parents that they should remove from the home 
certain objects that are made of vinyl and that are used or 
designed for use in the mouth of infants and young children.  We 
are co-operating with the Retail Council of Canada to remove 
those objects from the shelves of stores across the country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Austria, Sweden and Denmark are much stricter and 
have already regulated children's products, because they felt 
that children's health required more than a simple warning from 
the health department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still more, however. 
PVC containing lead, cadmium and phthalates is used not only in 
toys, but also in the manufacture of medical devices.  However, 
we feel that, even though scientists are divided on the real 
impact of using phthalates, we cannot take risks with the health 
of Quebecers and Canadians, particularly children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a responsibility, and that responsibility is 
not to sidestep the issue and attempt to discredit people 
concerned about these issues, but to ensure that all the 
scientific evidence is provided and that medical products and 
toys are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, for instance, Health Canada investigated intravenous 
transfusion and injections bags that gave off phthalates.  The 
department's conclusions were cause for concern. 
Health Canada has announced that the benefits of the current use 
of phthalates in transfusion bags outweighed the risks that 
might be associated with exposure to this product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a far cry from scientific evidence that the product is 
safe and risk free.  Health Canada is merely saying that the 
risks to health of transfusion bags are not as great as the 
product's benefits.  The benefits would outweigh the risks, but 
Health Canada admits that risks do exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, phthalates used in medical products would be even more 
toxic than those used in children's toys.  According to Health 
Canada, phthalates used in intravenous transfusion and injection 
bags would be six times more toxic than those used in toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not ironic that in Canada phthalates are labelled as 
hazardous products when they are to be shipped in barrels, but 
considered totally harmless and even edible when they are in the 
mouths of our children or in the veins of our patients? Let us 
be clear. Phthalates are as harmful in the hospital and in the 
home as they are in barrels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberal government is twiddling its thumbs, the 
private sector seems to have engaged, although very partially, 
in a self-regulation process. Baxter International, a major 
manufacturer of IV bags, is in the process of replacing PVC in 
its products. Nike, Deutche Telekom, Ikea and LEGO have all 
adopted plans to gradually reduce the amount of PVC in their 
products.

evidence that Health Canada does not have? Should we let less

by toxic substances than adults and knowing how lead, cadmium 
and phthalates can be hazardous to our health, one can see how 
the government is being totally irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time the government started to take this issue 
seriously and modernize its legislation on phthalates, lead and 
cadmium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, we are calling on the government to be 
proactive. It is a government's role and duty when it comes to 
public health. Will the government wait for tragedies to occur 
before taking action?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to commend the member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
With Bill C-482, an act to amend the Hazardous Products Act, she 
is telling us that government should always err on the side of 
caution.  That is what this bill is about.  We have heard members 
of the House talk about the present difficulties with high levels 
of lead, cadmium and phthalates in some of the toys and even 
medical devices being used in today's society.  The member has 
directed her bill primarily at young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about lead and cadmium, we are not talking about a 
very high exposure having a detrimental effect on children.  A 
very low level of exposure can seriously interrupt intellectual 
and behavioural development in infants and young children. It is 
in our best interests that we consider anything within our power 
in the House to limit the exposure of those products to young 
children.  That is exactly what the bill does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on two or three of the main points in her bill. 
It would prohibit anyone from advertising, selling or importing 
the following:  any toy, equipment or product made with 
phthalates that is likely to be used by a child under three years 
of age in learning or in play; any consumer product that contains 
more than 15 parts per million weight to weight of lead; and any 
consumer product that contains more than one part per million 
weight to weight of cadmium.  Again we are talking about very low 
levels, but enough to harm the intellectual development of a 
child.  It does not take very much to hurt a young child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if it is enough for the member but the government 
in its generosity at least is looking at some movement on this 
issue.  In somewhat of an unusual move, the parliamentary 
secretary suggested three amendments to the bill that might 
entice the government to support it. 
I want to go through those because they are worth consideration. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary mentioned three amendments to the 
bill. One was to limit the scope of included products from all 
products to products intended for use by children.  Another was 
to change the 15 parts per million total to 65 parts per million 
of lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the European standard for this is 
90 parts per million for extractable lead and 75 parts per 
million for extractable cadmium.  The key word is extractable. 
Many products could contain levels above that, but is that lead 
extractable from that very product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would say you would be high risk because watching 
you in the chair, I often notice you chewing on that plastic pen, 
almost devouring it from time to time.  It is a habit, Mr. 
Speaker, you are going to have to break because you are going to 
exceed the limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key to this whole thing is extractable.  I suppose we could 
say that children would be safe if they did not eat the toys, but 
who knows. The scientific evidence is not clear enough to 
determine whether or not that is being extracted and there is no 
question they are being exposed to high levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third amendment the parliamentary secretary suggested was to 
limit the scope of the phthalate ban.  Phthalate is a plasticizer 
in layman's terms.  It is a product that actually makes plastic 
pliable.  So when you devour those plastic pens, Mr. Speaker, 
with a little more phthalate in them they would be easier to 
digest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hoping the member may consider these amendments because 
they are interesting.  And at least it shows some movement on the 
side of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion was to limit the scope of the phthalate ban to 
teethers, rattles and other toys intended for children under the 
age of 12 months and likely to be mouthed or chewed by children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point which I think is worth mentioning is that the 
bill would not affect uses of lead and cadmium in industrial 
products or equipment, or phthalate used in consumer products not 
designed for children under the age of three, an important 
distinction.  The member's bill also provides for consumer 
products with lead and cadmium content to be excluded from the 
bill by regulation so as not to ban legitimate use of products 
that are unlikely to harm children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very commendable bill.  I encourage the member to work 
with the government.  At the end of the day every one of us on 
this side of the House can and will support this bill.  However, 
if we do not have the majority of the members in the House and 
that means the government supporting it, we know what will happen 
to the bill.  The parliamentary secretary has left the door open 
just a little bit and I am encouraged by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the member's bill.  She has put a lot of work 
into it.  As a party we are prepared to support it.  I have a 
little bit of advice for the member.  Knowing that a private 
member's bill can meet sudden death when it comes to opposition 
by the government, I am hoping that in some way she can pick up 
these negotiations with the government and find some common 
ground so that the basis of the bill can be passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of what we see before us now, we are prepared as a 
party to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I should advise the House that when 
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre speaks, she will close 
the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank all of the members who 
participated in today's discussion on Bill C-482, in particular 
the support from the members for Surrey Central, Laval East and 
New Brunswick Southwest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to put on record my thanks to the organizations that 
have been vigilant on this topic.  They have performed a valuable 
public service by raising the concerns around children's health 
and well-being as it relates to access to toys that contain 
fairly high levels of cadmium, lead and phthalates.  I want to 
acknowledge the work of the Canadian Institute of Child Health, 
the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada, Greenpeace, the 
Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, the 
Canadian Association of Family Resource Programs and the Canadian 
Child Care Federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the words of the parliamentary 
secretary.  I also listened to the words of advice from the 
member for New Brunswick Southwest.  I will certainly give the 
amendments serious consideration once I have read them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first blush and on hearing the proposed amendments by the 
parliamentary secretary, I have to express an initial 
disappointment over the proposals.  In my estimation the 
amendments being proposed drastically gut the purpose of this 
bill.  In fact they allow the government to continue its approach 
of what I classify as one of inaction, of voluntary regulation, 
of the waiting for someone to get sick or die approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find the suggestions particularly helpful.  The 
reference to changing the levels of lead from 15 to 65 parts per 
million flies in the face of significant scientific evidence 
about what is a safe level in terms of toys played with by 
children.  The suggestion of limiting this to children under the 
age of 12 months and making restrictions in terms of teethers and 
rattles in my estimation does not take us any further than where 
we are right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish one could use props in the House so I could demonstrate 
just what it means for a child to have access to products that 
would not fall under the definition as proposed by the 
parliamentary secretary.  I wish I could bring in the backpack 
which contains 321 parts per million of lead and 654 parts per 
million of cadmium that would not fall under the minister's 
definition.  The department will tell her that we are not talking 
about extractable lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish she could understand that a backpack like that would be 
out in the hot sun.  It could be placed in a hot car.  It would 
always be put in the mouth of a child.  I have seen my children 
do it.  I wish I could show the member how my 10 year old son 
will always put in his mouth the Sega Genesis cable that is part 
of a toy he plays with which has over 5,000 parts per million of 
lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about serious incidents of those toxins in toy 
products that do not but should fall under the minister's 
definition.  We have to adopt a do no harm principle, not allow 
products on the market and only react if something tragic 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to call upon the government to do 
something far more proactive in the interest of children's 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume from the parliamentary secretary's remarks that she 
will not support this bill. I urge her to look at it more 
seriously and to recommend to her government that it be 
considered in a serious way.  I think that Canadians want to see 
a government play that kind of proactive role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with such a fundamental issue involving the 
health and well-being of children.  Since there is obviously an 
interest on the part of members in the House and a deep concern 
from all parties and still a lack of indication from the 
government that it is willing to act, I seek the unanimous 
consent of the House to make this bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
bill be made votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has 
now expired and the order is dropped from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved that 
Bill C-82, an act to amend the Criminal Code (impaired driving 
and related matters), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment all House leaders for having arrived at a decision to 
expedite through the House as quickly as possible a very 
important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A unanimous report was presented to the House by a committee. 
This is the first time, in my experience as a parliamentarian, a 
committee had the opportunity to draft a piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I am the parliamentary secretary to the minister, but I 
compliment the minister and the government for having had the 
vision to make this bill drafted by parliamentarians of all 
political parties in the justice committee into government 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also congratulate all members of the justice committee.  I am 
one of the members, but I want to say that the level of 
co-operation and collaboration was of very high calibre.  I thank 
all members for their collaboration and co-operation.  We worked 
together to do something which all Canadians wanted us to do. 
They want us to stop the carnage that is taking place from coast 
to coast in Canada and to stop what we believe is a scourge on 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 implements the spirit and the intent of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights as expressed in the draft 
bill appended to its 21st report entitled “Toward Eliminating 
Impaired Driving”.  The report was tabled on May 25, 1999 in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice tabled Bill C-82 on June 7.  Taken as a 
whole, the bill confirms for the vast majority of Canadians who 
never drive while impaired the wisdom of their choice.  It also 
sends a very important message that impaired driving is an 
avoidable criminal act which carries unacceptable risks of injury 
and death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one is convicted of an impaired driving offence, the criminal 
law consequences will be onerous.  When we also consider legal 
costs, insurance costs and provincial measures, no one should 
entertain the thought of drinking and driving.  For anyone who 
has not yet figured this out, the introduction of Bill C-82 
signals that the time has come for major attitude adjustments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1981, the year in which impaired driving charges peaked, 
very significant progress on drinking and driving has occurred 
through the combined efforts of governments and public and 
private organizations.  I especially single out the hard work of 
MADD in Canada and congratulate it on the educational role it has 
played in informing all of us.  Families have also had important 
roles to play as have individuals who have lived this tragedy. 
This needs to continue and the report of the justice committee 
reflects that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal law is an important tool with which a combination of 
efforts is needed to make further progress on impaired driving. 
Where the criminal law can be improved, it must be.  The measures 
found in Bill C-82 will assist in the battle against impaired 
driving.  However, it is important to stress that only through a 
combination of criminal and non-criminal measures will we 
eradicate impaired driving in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Centre for Justice statistics indicate that impaired 
driving offences have the highest conviction rate of any Criminal 
Code offence at about 80%.  However, as recent surveys by the 
Traffic Injury Research Foundation have indicated, it takes 200 
impaired driving trips to result in one impaired driving charge. 
Obviously much impaired driving crime goes unreported and 
undetected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the general public believes that the risk of apprehension 
for impaired driving is relatively high, the hard core impaired 
drivers by comparison do not share this belief.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts in the field warn that impaired driving legislation must 
be accompanied by other efforts such as public information and 
increased visibility for police enforcement of impaired driving 
laws in order for legislative change to have its maximum impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While estimates vary, it appears that there were some 1,300 
deaths due to impaired driving in 1997.  Information from the 
Traffic Injury Research Foundation study in Ontario suggested 
impaired drivers comprised 55% of the fatalities from impaired 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Centre for Justice statistics note that 90% of impaired 
drivers are male, which is similar to the gender representation 
in crime generally.  Not surprisingly the vast majority of 
fatally injured impaired drivers are males. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 report by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia 
indicated that in each of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 more than 
80% of the impaired driving deaths in British Columbia were 
comprised of impaired drivers and their passengers.  The 
remaining fatalities were other road users in motorized vehicles, 
on bicycles, or on foot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across Canada impaired drivers are playing Russian roulette, and 
they are killing themselves, their passengers and other road 
users.  That is unacceptable to the government and to all members 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message in the standing committee's report and in Bill C-82 
is that Canadian society will not tolerate impaired driving. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the bill drafted by the committee, Bill C-82 comprises eight 
amendments relating to sentences contained in the Criminal Code 
and one amendment on investigations relating to impaired driving 
charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, the changes to sentences strengthen the message that 
impaired driving will not be tolerated.  Bill C-82 increases the 
dissuasive powers of penalties, ensuring that impaired driving 
penalties reflect the serious nature of the offence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among its penalty changes Bill C-82 includes changes for two 
crimes which are sometimes directly related to impaired driving. 
The first is the offence of leaving the scene of an accident to 
escape civil or criminal liability.  Bill C-82 would amend this 
provision to add the elements of bodily harm and death, which 
would increase the gravity of the offence.  That in turn should 
signal to the courts that more severe sentences are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that was appended to the standing committee's report on 
impaired driving had the unfortunate effect of requiring the 
crown to prove that the offence of leaving the scene caused 
bodily harm or death.  As we now recognize, it is not the leaving 
that causes the injury or death.  It is rather the collision or 
the crash itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new formulation in Bill C-82 preserves the intent of the 
committee.  Three levels of leaving the scene are created. Each 
contains different essential elements.  Under subsection 252(1.1) 
a person who leaves the scene of an accident where the damage 
does not amount to bodily harm or death will be liable where the 
crown proceeds by indictment to five years imprisonment or to an 
offence punishable upon summary conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under subsection (1.2), where the person knows that bodily harm 
has been caused to another person involved in the accident the 
offence is indictable and punishable by a maximum of 10 years 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection (1.3) in part reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left> 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the person knows that another person involved in the accident 
is dead; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the person knows that bodily harm has been caused to another 
person involved in the accident and is reckless as to whether the 
death of that other person results from that bodily harm, and the 
death of that other person so results. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum penalty under Bill C-82 is life imprisonment.  To 
the extent that penalties can discourage those who might leave an 
accident in order to evade getting caught for impaired driving, 
the changes to the offence of leaving the scene will send the 
message that running away from a collision where someone is 
injured or killed is egregious behaviour that carries a serious 
penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Driving while disqualified is the other offence that is 
sometimes related to impaired driving.  The original 
disqualification could be in relation to an impaired driving 
offence and sometimes the person driving while disqualified is 
also driving while impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The driving while disqualified offence is found in subsection 
259(4) of the Criminal Code. 
At present the maximum penalty is two years imprisonment.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 follows the committee's recommendation in raising the 
maximum penalty to five years imprisonment.  This will allow 
judges to deal more severely with the worst offenders and the 
worst circumstances.  It will be an incentive to persons who are 
disqualified from driving to abide by that disqualification, 
including those who were originally disqualified for an impaired 
driving offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remaining six penalty changes in Bill C-82 would amend the 
impaired driving provisions of the Criminal Code.  Prior to 1985 
in a drinking and driving case where there was a death the crown 
had to prosecute under the criminal negligence causing death or 
the manslaughter provisions of the code.  In both cases the 
maximum penalty is life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 parliament added the offences of impaired driving 
causing bodily harm and impaired driving causing death to the 
Criminal Code, with maximum penalties of 14 years imprisonment 
where the result is death and 10 years imprisonment where bodily 
harm is caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 would raise the maximum penalty in subsection 255(3) 
for impaired driving causing death from 14 years imprisonment to 
life imprisonment.  This provision has become quite 
controversial.  It is the government's intention to deal 
immediately with those parts of Bill C-82 that did not arouse 
controversy and to place this controversial provision in a future 
bill.  There has been all party agreement to that effect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minimum fine for a first impaired driving offence, that is, 
for driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of 80 mg, or 
refusing to provide a sample, would increase from $300 to $600. 
The minimum fine was raised from $50 to $300 back in 1985.  It 
is therefore quite acceptable for this bill to increase it. 
There was a consensus on this by all members of the committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 will add a new provision after section 255 to specify 
that a judge must consider evidence of a blood alcohol 
concentration that exceeds 80 milligrams as an aggravating factor 
when sentencing for criminal offences dealing with impaired 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision will codify what many sentencing judges already 
do in practice, but it will bring uniformity in setting the point 
at which a sentencing judge looks at a BAC as an aggravating 
factor.  This is a key aspect of the message that impaired 
driving will not be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another strong message is being sent by Bill C-82 to impaired 
drivers.  If convicted of an impaired driving offence, whether it 
be driving while impaired, driving with a BAC that exceeds 80 
milligrams, or refusing to provide a breath or blood sample, the 
person will be prohibited from driving anywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill raised the present minimum driving prohibition on the 
first conviction from three months and makes it a one year 
minimum.  The maximum prohibition on the first offence will 
remain three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first conviction only there will be a possibility to 
replace part of the driving prohibition, where a provincial 
program for an ignition interlock device exists, with the use of 
an ignition interlock device by the offender, something that does 
exist in the province I represent, Quebec.  The device would 
render a vehicle inoperable unless the breath sample on the 
vehicle mounted testing device gave a pass reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a second conviction Bill C-82 raises the minimum driving 
prohibition from six months to two years, with the maximum being 
raised from three years to five years.  On a subsequent offence 
the minimum driving prohibition goes up from one year to three 
years.  As for the maximum driving prohibition for those 
subsequent offenders, it would rise from three years to a 
lifetime ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These driving prohibition provisions are sanctions that will 
make an impression—and all members of the justice committee were 
in agreement—on every person found guilty of impaired driving. 
Experts in the field have indicated that driving privilege 
consequences, along with the treatment for harmful involvement 
with alcohol, are very important in reducing the incidence of 
impaired driving.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee has recognized the importance of the 
driving prohibition and has recommended these very significant 
increases.  Bill C-82 implements the recommendations of the 
standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee also recognized that the sanction for 
driving while prohibited needs to be sufficient to deter 
prohibited drivers from ignoring the prohibition from driving. 
Where an offender has a driving prohibition order and breaches 
that order the maximum period of imprisonment under subsection 
259(4) of the Criminal Code for driving while disqualified will 
be raised from two to five years by Bill C-82. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Traffic Injury Research Foundation indicates that a small 
percentage of drivers is responsible for the large majority of 
impaired driving in Canada.  The hard core drinking drivers 
operate their vehicles with a very high blood alcohol 
concentration or BAC level, or they repeatedly commit impaired 
driving offences.  These individuals are very difficult to reach. 
We heard a lot of testimony before committee to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A defence lawyer appearing as a witness before the standing 
committee pointed out that the public is only protected from 
certain of these hard core impaired drivers by a period of 
lengthy incarceration.  Others may respond to treatment and 
driving consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 further specifies that a judge may make a probation 
order requiring a person convicted of impaired driving to attend 
a program for assessment and curative treatment related to 
alcohol or drugs.  Experts who testified before the standing 
committee stated that the literature shows that curative 
treatment may be more important than penalties in altering the 
behaviour of hard core impaired drivers.  We have highly 
recommended that in our report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also specifies that a judge may make a probation order 
requiring a person convicted of an impaired driving offence to 
use an ignition interlock device, something that is done 
routinely in the province of Quebec.  This type of order may be 
made in a province where the provincial government has 
established, as has Quebec, a program for the use of ignition 
interlock devices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Traffic Injury Research Foundation study of the Alberta 
experience indicated that ignition interlock use significantly 
reduced reoffending and increased the survivability of those who 
were enrolled in the ignition interlock program over the study 
period when compared with convicted impaired drivers who did not 
use this device. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians agree that impaired driving should be condemned.  The 
standing committee has presented with its report a draft bill 
that clearly says impaired driving will not be tolerated in 
Canada.  Bill C-82 delivers this message.  The criminal law is 
society's strongest sanction against behaviour that society is 
unwilling and unable to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank all members of the justice committee for having 
worked very hard to arrive at a unanimous report and to come 
before the House to present draft legislation.  I applaud the 
Minister of Justice and the government for having decided to 
adopt it as government legislation under Government Orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank MADD and the other organizations which came 
before our committee for their testimony and their hard work.  I 
want them to know that we all listened and we all acted on what 
we were asked to do as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell all Canadians that this government would like to 
see zero tolerance on our streets, that there be no Canadians who 
choose to drink and drive and end up killing other Canadians. 
That is the message this bill wants to reflect.  We also want to 
reflect Canadians' condemnation of a very serious crime in this 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I very much appreciate the words of the parliamentary secretary. 
I would like to correct something.  I am not quite sure what she 
means by zero tolerance.  There is a different connotation in 
this country of what zero tolerance means.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we will all stand to take a bit of credit for this 
measure.  I wish to start, as I do in all discussions concerning 
drunk driving, by saying that whatever I say is in memory of my 
niece Sheena who was murdered by a drunk driver, and also another 
niece, Christa, who is at home suffering permanent brain damage 
as a result of a drunk driver who disabled her when she was 24 
years old.  That was three years ago.  This has not escaped my 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I too congratulate many people in the country 
who have persevered in their attempts to change the drunk driving 
legislation.  It has not gone as far as some would like. 
However, I am positive enough about this system, and a believer 
in this system, to know that regardless of what government is in 
the House of Commons changes will be forthcoming to this 
legislation in the future to reflect at least where victims of 
drunk drivers insist we head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall at the justice committee hearing the testimony of 
Sharlene Verhulst, whose sister Cindy who was murdered by a drunk 
driver, as well as Ken Roffel, whose son was murdered by a drunk 
driver.  I will read a bit of the testimony which Ken gave to 
give members an idea of why we have to go on from here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party brought this to the House on an opposition day 
on October 30, 1997.  We had been pushing for this since February 
29, 1996.  I am not here to take credit for the impetus of this 
bill, although the impetus did come from our party, but it is 
important to say to all members of the House that we all 
participated and we did what was right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not too long ago when we stood in the House to pass a 
bill concerning something very near and dear to my heart, victims 
rights.  I wrote that legislation in 1994.  It took a long time 
to get it done, but it got done.  It is incumbent upon parliament 
not to rush things but to consider things in detail and that is 
what committees are for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sharing my time with the member for Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is left undone is the issue of blood 
alcohol content.  I think that is for another day.  When the hon. 
parliamentary secretary talks about zero tolerance, I think that 
is what many people relate zero tolerance to, blood alcohol 
content, whether it should be .08 and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that is not in this bill, I think there is room.  We will 
be back in the House talking about this eventually, but right now 
we have to celebrate to some extent our perseverance, even 
through late hour negotiations, as late as last night when we 
thought this issue was dead and would not come to the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all persevered.  My colleague, the House leader for the 
Conservative Party, was as concerned as we were, as was the 
parliamentary secretary for the Liberals.  All of us were 
concerned that we had to do the right thing now and that we would 
worry about other things later, and we will deal with the issue 
of life imprisonment in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with my hon. colleague across the way that impaired 
drivers must get the message that impaired driving will not be 
tolerated.  That is an important message.  Impaired drivers 
willingly and knowingly drive impaired.  It is not a mistake when 
impaired drivers get behind the wheel.  It is not a plot to drive 
impaired.  They become drunk and they drive.  It is a wilful act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members hear me call it murder, it is murder in my mind.  I 
am not the only one who says that.  That is something that a 
young lady told me.  She wanted me to change my phraseology as to 
whether it was an accident or murder. 
She convinced me that it is murder and that is why I refer to it 
as that.

debate.  He comes from the lower mainland of British Columbia. 
He is a friend of mine.  He became a friend after I was involved 
in trying to help him go across Canada to convince people about 
zero tolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the House to know just how Ken feels about what has 
happened in his life and I also want the House to know, after 
listening to what I have to read, which came from Ken 
unsolicited, that there are things left to be done.  The justice 
system, the legal industry, has to understand how severe drunk 
driving is.  I want to read this letter to the House. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 13th 1996 a drunk driver with a blood alcohol level 
double the legal limit killed our oldest son Mark William Roffel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday April 23rd 1999 three years later the Judge handed a 
not guilty verdict to Dangerous Driving Causing Death to Todd 
Minich the driver of the vehicle that killed Mark.  This driver 
had also testified to an earlier alcohol related accident that 
very same day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That evening at the hospital March 13th 1996, the RCMP took a 
blood sample from Mr. Minich and forgot to read him his rights. 
That one single mistake by the RCMP changed the outcome of the 
trial.  Mr. Minich should have been charged with Impaired causing 
death under the Criminal Code of Canada instead of Dangerous 
Driving Causing Death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the trial witnesses came forward describing how Mr. Minich 
had driven them off the road, how he went through a stop sign on 
232nd in Langley and how minutes later they came across the 
carnage caused by Mr. Minich.  The Crown had done an excellent 
job in presenting the evidence collected to show that Mr. Minich 
had driven dangerously and caused the death of Mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Judge in his final statements said “no reasonable person 
would do this and Mr. Minich appears to be a reasonable person” 
end of quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were shocked at his remarks.  There was a fatality here with 
the death of Mark....The Law failed Mark on March 13th 1996 by 
not keeping Mr. Minich off the roads due to his past criminal 
record and activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 23rd 1999 the Law failed my family and other Canadians 
when it failed to convict Mr. Minich of causing Mark's death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know we have always taken the high road— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and I can assure the House of that— 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and tried to turn a negative into a positive.  The outcome of 
the trial means that we will continue to work toward a Zero 
Tolerance goal for Canada with no drinking and driving... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing can be more devastating than the call we received at 
10:05 p.m. on March 13th 1996 informing us of Mark's death. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to read that into the record this evening because I 
think it speaks a lot to what I am saying about the future of 
drunk driving in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come some way.  I believe we have further to go.  I 
believe the judiciary, the lawyers in our country, have to 
understand that this is indeed a much more serious issue than 
just plain drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Reform Party tabled this motion in the House 
of Commons.  We got unanimous consent and I am very thankful to 
the House and all members for that.  I am deeply appreciative of 
all those people who are victims of drunk drivers who have come 
before the House to tell us about their very difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also saying to the House of Commons that there is a way to 
go yet.  We are not through with this.  We will be back.  That is 
the process of democracy in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last year impaired driving caused 1,300 deaths in Canada 
and 90,000 injuries, in one year.  It is astounding the evidence 
and the gravity of the situation. 
The law, up to now, has been lax on the offence.  It is time to 
act and time to send a message to those who drink and drive.  I 
see the message contained in Bill C-82, as we are debating it 
here tonight:  If we get caught we will not beat the charge.  It 
will cost us a lot of money and we may go to prison for life. 
That is the message we want to go out from this Chamber.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a long time to get to this point, and the justice 
committee should be commended for getting the bill to parliament. 
I realize we, as Reformers, have been pushing this for quite 
some time, but it took many other people co-operating to get the 
bill to this point in the House and hopefully passed before we 
break for summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we getting in Bill C-82?  Right off the top, we are 
finally treating impaired drivers like anyone else who kills 
somebody.  Impaired driving causing death would now face life 
imprisonment just like manslaughter rather than the current 14 
year prison term.  What is wrong with that?  It is manslaughter 
and the weapon of choice has been too much of the bottle, too 
much alcohol and then getting into a two tonne vehicle, which is 
a deadly weapon, driving it with abandon and with no concern for 
human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to send a message that society will not tolerate this 
behaviour.  If we offend, we will pay a heavy price.  Impaired 
driving is not funny or acceptable in our civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the experience of other countries, when they got 
tough the negative results of impaired driving declined 
dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we have in Bill C-82 a new maximum 10 year jail term 
for causing bodily harm while driving impaired.  This puts some 
teeth into the act and is another signal to offenders that their 
behaviour has consequences, not just a slap on the wrist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 will double the mandatory minimum fine for a first 
impaired driving offence to $600 from $300.  The Reform Party is 
still of the persuasion that this is not enough and our minority 
report called for a fine of $1,000 for the first offence. 
However, we are moving in the right direction and that is why we 
are supporting the bill.  Let drunk drivers know we are serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 imposes longer prohibitions on driving for those 
convicted of impaired driving.  First time offenders would be 
banned from driving for up to three years, up from the current 
pathetic three month ban, which did nothing to deter repeaters. A 
second conviction for this behaviour could net the offender a 
five year prohibition, and a third time repeated would get a 
minimum of three years.  The maximum disqualification for 
repeaters would be five years and this sends a signal to them. 
Currently the maximum is only two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 gives police some tools to deal with that.  Up until 
now it was an easy rap to beat.  Police now have up to three 
hours to take a breath sample after a suspected impaired driving 
offence.  Currently, samples can only be taken up to two hours. 
The Reform Party would also argue for the police to be given 
tools like the new alcohol sensors which give them a better 
chance of determining impairment.  This also would send a message 
to those who drink and drive that their odds of getting caught 
are better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague just before me, I believe that some of these 
things that still need to be improved in the bill will hopefully 
happen in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 would give judges some further discretion.  Judges can 
now impose ignition locking systems as a condition of probation. 
This would deter the repeater at the outset.  As well, judges 
could impose mandatory treatment of alcohol abuse as a condition 
of prohibition.  Furthermore, judges have further discretion in 
imposing a stiffer sentence on drivers found to be two or three 
times over the legal limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In court right now the two beer defence is taken to the extreme 
and the defence is becoming an absurd mockery of the system.  Too 
many are beating the rap with this defence and the entire issue 
of these technicalities needs some further attention.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have some positive and powerful first step tools in 
the bill.  The message, I believe, to repeat offenders is a 
powerful deterrent to their behaviour.  After all, repeaters are 
the main problem in this scenario.  Stopping individuals who 
normally do not drink and drive from getting behind the wheel is, 
I believe, effectively dealt with in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 enhances deterrents and, I believe, the new penalties 
reflect the gravity of the crime of drinking and driving, in 
particular the life imprisonment provision for causing a death. I 
know my Bloc colleagues do not like this aspect.  I would simply 
ask them what the difference is in killing someone with a car and 
doing it with another weapon.  The results are the same.  The 
family loss and grief are the same.  It is about time we called 
this vehicular criminality for what it is and dealt with it 
appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Life imprisonment, like that for other manslaughters, is fair. 
If someone wants to drive their vehicle while impaired with such 
wanton disregard for human life then the consequences should be 
tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is disappointed that the legislation does not 
reflect a zero tolerance policy for impaired driving.  When we 
get to that point I think we have completed the task.  For now, 
we are pleased we got the legislation to this point.  We want to 
see the legislation passed before summer when the profusion of 
drinking and driving increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grant it we have some first steps on the road to zero tolerance. 
The Reform Party again thinks that incremental changes are the 
way to go.  With this, as the Reform Party has argued, we would 
have like to have seen .05 as the alcohol limit.  This is the 
first step on the road to zero tolerance.  I think all parties 
should be reflecting on the next steps on this road to recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the work of MADD in 
its request to bring some rationale and acknowledgement to the 
offence of impaired driving.  The founders of this organizations 
are the victims of the crimes of drunk driving. Their message is 
getting heard and acknowledged today in the House.  The acronym, 
by the way, stands for Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not allow alcohol to be an excuse for unacceptable 
behaviour and breaking the law.  That is the point that needs to 
be made to the general public.  We should not allow alcohol to be 
used as an excuse for breaking the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we have moved a major step today.  The Reform 
Party is pleased to have played a major role in pushing for these 
changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the committee took a very serious look at the issue of impaired 
driving.  To echo the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice, and I have been sitting on the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights since 1993, this was the first time 
since I joined the committee that I really felt that all parties 
were working together on a common cause, which was to try to 
improve the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own objective was to come up with a way to reduce, as much as 
possible, the trauma of accidents involving drunk driving, 
accidents that often culminate in injury or death. 
We had to find some way of reducing this trauma as much as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concluded that there is no perfect legislation.  No bill 
will prevent these sorts of tragedies, but we must continue to 
look for ways of attaining our objective to the extent possible. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that I really felt that all members were working 
together and that politics had been set aside.  I must say that 
this is probably the last time I will support tabling a 
unanimous report with the government and opposition parties on 
such an issue. I say that because of the wording of the report, 
particularly with respect to what members, such as the member 
for Témiscamingue and I, were supposed to have said.  I think 
this is the last time I will be persuaded to support tabling a 
unanimous report.  The next time I will be tabling a dissenting 
report, and that is that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the legislation be improved?  Not through repressive 
measures. 
It is not with tough sentences. It is not with life sentences 
for offenders that we will achieve our objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps members opposite find that funny, but I would invite 
them to read what commentators and experts in the field have 
written. There are not many people that agree with the government 
and the opposition parties that a life sentence should be imposed 
for such offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, for a long time, understood this approach in the field 
of criminal law. I am lawyer and I have studied this issue. We 
will not achieve our objective of public safety by handing out 
exaggerated sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One man in my riding brought this home to me, and I take the 
opportunity to thank him for his sound advice. He is Dr. Clément 
Payette, a physician in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, who, last December, 
lost his wife, Diane Olivier, in an automobile accident in which 
the driver was drunk. I had a number of discussions with this 
man, who has looked at the issue. He is now vigorously lobbying 
the Government of Quebec to have it change some things, but he 
said that life sentences or coercion would not ensure public 
safety on the road. It would be through prevention and 
education. There are now a number of things under way, and I 
will come back to this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After looking into the matter, I asked myself this question: 
What is the real problem with impaired drivers? The real 
problem is the repeat offenders. The real problem is not 
somebody's uncle who takes to the road with a glass or two too 
many under his belt. True enough, this is not right, and 
measures should be taken to prevent him from driving off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real scourge is the repeat offenders. We have to find a way 
to change the habits of these repeat offenders. What in the bill 
applies to them? It contains a notion—a Bloc Quebecois 
gain—called ignition interlock. I believe it is a device that 
can cause a driver who drinks and drives to change his habits. I 
congratulate the government, which included this in Bill C-82 for 
an initial offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not enough, however.  We would have liked the provinces 
to have had more leeway to impose it on repeat offenders.  The 
battle is not over. We will naturally be keeping at it, and 
examining the matter more closely.  Probably we will have a look 
at first offender statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that, in the long term, it will be beneficial for 
the federal government and the provinces to pay for ignition 
interlock devices to be installed on offenders' vehicles, since 
millions of dollars are being spent—in Quebec some $200 million, 
I believe—on the victims of impaired driving accidents.  I 
believe that, in the long term, there will certainly be a 
financial benefit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec MPs who have addressed this issue realized that there 
is another problem, that of hit and run drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that there was the Taschereau case in the riding of 
the hon. member for Témiscamingue.  The first time the 
committee raised the issue of hit and runs, members on the 
other side looked at each other in amazement, as if there were 
no connection between the two.  It is true that there is no 
obvious relationship right off.  We saw, as the bottom line, 
however, that there was indeed too great a disparity between 
sentences for impaired driving and sentences for leaving the 
scene of an accident and that the legislator needed to do 
something about it.  I will return to this point a little later 
on, as the Bloc Quebecois had some success in this area as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point is on information and the message to be sent to 
the population.  Here again, I believe that a message will be 
sent to the public with Bill C-82, and with the comments we added 
to the report.  That is a positive point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point has to do with the ignition interlock 
devices.  When the bill is passed, subsection 259(1.1) of the 
Criminal Code will provide a judge with the possibility of 
imposing such a device for a first offence.  This is an 
extremely significant advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key point I wish to make today concerns hit and runs. Right 
now, in the case of a hit and run accident causing death, if 
someone leaves the scene of the accident knowing that someone has 
been killed, the Criminal Code provides for a maximum five year 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Criminal Code now stands, an impaired driver who hits and 
kills someone can be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison. 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois members raised this point in 
committee.  We said that there was a disparity between the two 
that had to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We won out in the report, which contains the following: “Given 
that greater harm gives rise to greater penalties for impaired 
driving, the committee suggests that section 252 be amended to 
provide for similar penalties in those circumstances where the 
collision leads to injury or death”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a direct reference to a hit and run. 
The report calls for similar penalties.  What does this mean? 
It means that impaired driving causing death should carry the 
same sentence as a hit and run accident causing death.  I am not making 
this up.  It is in the report.  The committee wanted similar 
sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the Bloc Quebecois' comments, we won on one point. The 
minister decided—or she will later in the evening—to withdraw 
the section of the bill providing for life imprisonment for 
impaired driving causing death.  It will stand at 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this does not change the thrust of the report, which still 
seeks similar penalties.  The opposition parties, the wind from 
the right—sometimes it comes from the west, sometimes from the 
maritimes, but a wind from the right always blows in from 
somewhere—refuse to include the similar penalties sought in the 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee of the whole I will move an amendment. 
What we are looking for is equivalence, nothing more and nothing 
less than what the report says. It is a unanimous report of the 
committee, which I signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it is being interpreted in such a way that I am being 
told, “No, the bill provides for a life sentence. You will have 
to live with that, hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm”. But 
that is wrong. We fought for equivalence. We settled the issue 
of equivalence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy the minister finally understood from the 
comments I made and from the pressures that came from the Bloc 
Quebecois, and decided to withdraw the section on life sentences, 
to which crown attorneys are opposed. The great majority of 
litigators and those who follow court cases are against a life 
sentence for such an offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They applaud the fact that the minister is withdrawing the life 
sentence and leaving the 14 year sentence, but the principle of 
equivalence must be applied, otherwise the opposite will occur. 
The maximum sentence will be 14 years for impaired driving 
causing death. However, with Bill C-82, a person leaving the 
scene after hitting someone with their car will be liable to 
imprisonment for life. It does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members of this House will wake up when I move my 
amendments and will adopt them, even if it means reviewing all 
sentences together in September. 
If the House decides that it is prison for life that is required 
in the case of impaired driving causing death, and if voters in 
all ridings in Canada and Quebec agree with that, it will mean 
equivalence with a hit and run accident causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a professor who used to say that the Criminal Code read 
like a story, that it held together from beginning to end. It is 
true. However, with the bill before us there would be different 
sentences for two similar offences. That does not hold together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a lawyer, I cannot agree with that. Members might think that 
I am not in a good mood this evening, but I have done a lot of 
work in this area. I understand that everyone wants this bill 
passed. I also know that there were negotiations among the House 
leaders, but each party is represented by a House leader. 
Perhaps the elements of sentence concordance and equivalence in 
the sentences were not put on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope there are people of goodwill who understand the 
importance of having this equivalence between the sentences for 
impairment and hit and run accident so that the amendments I will be 
making may be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased with the work done by members, including the member 
for Temiscamingue, who gave me a hand on the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have pushed the government to do its homework on 
some points of law. I am happy to have succeeded in convincing 
the minister to remove from clause 3 of Bill C-82, for the time 
being, a life sentence with respect to impaired driving 
resulting in death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to have sold the government on the idea of including the 
new concept of ignition interlock devices in the Criminal Code. 
It was not easy to get the idea across to the government or to 
the other parties, but it was finally included in the committee 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I am pleased to have been a kind of deflector 
to the wind of the right, which blows in sometimes from the 
west, and sometimes from the maritimes, and to have cautioned 
members against going overboard.  The Criminal Code needs to 
be looked at as a whole, and sentences must be appropriate to 
the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel I was successful in several areas of the mandate given to 
me.  It is not over, however.  The debate will continue. 
I hope that all those listening to us in debate now, or who will 
follow part of the debate in the House this evening, the lawyers 
and other specialists, will make their demands known and 
clearly indicate to members of this House if they feel they 
are on the wrong track in some areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we address this issue again, I trust that all hon. members 
will be well informed and will have some understanding of the 
common sense that lies behind the Criminal Code.

evening's debate.  It is probably one of the finer moments of 
this parliament.  We hear voices from all corners of the House, 
all political parties saying that they want serious steps taken 
to remove people who drink and drive from the streets of Canada. 
This has to be one of our finer moments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are debating and what will be passed later today will 
result in lives being saved in our country.  The sooner we pass 
this legislation the better it will be.  For that reason I will 
keep my remarks brief, but I do want to say a number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not know how old you are, but I suspect you 
are at least close to my age.  I remember when I was growing up 
that it was considered to be macho or manly to drink alcohol and 
drive a car or a truck.  That was the rule of the day and pretty 
well everybody I knew did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in southern Alberta.  I do not know whether it is that 
different from most parts of Canada but a lot of people made a 
lot of money by going up and down the highways collecting beer 
bottles out of the ditches. Imagine how many people must have 
been driving and drinking with beer on the seats of their cars. 
They would finish their beer and throw the bottle out of the car 
window and people would go up and down the highways collecting 
beer bottles.  I suppose they collected pop bottles too, but from 
what I can recall most of them were collecting beer bottles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must have been thousands and thousands of people driving 
up and down those streets drinking while they were driving and 
chucking the empties out of the window.  If they were eventually 
stopped by the police they would not have an empty case of beer 
sitting in the car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that those days are over.  I would not say 
that it never occurs or that people do not drink and drive in 
that fashion any longer.  But I know how unpopular it is now to 
see someone who has been drinking prepare to drive away from a 
house party or a gathering.  People actually say “I do not think 
you should drive.  Are you okay to drive?  Should you be 
driving?” In some cases they stop other people from driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not even been one generation but we have come a long way. 
We are a much brighter society today when dealing with drinking 
and driving. This legislation will take us a whole lot further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to be part of this debate and part of this 
process.  I want to pay tribute to one of my colleagues, the 
member for Sydney—Victoria, who has worked on this legislation 
with representatives from all political parties to bring us to 
this point today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to move this legislation expeditiously through the 
House of Commons we have had to make some changes to the bill. 
One of the major changes is to take out the provision that says 
that a person who is convicted of impaired driving and takes 
someone's life will end up spending the rest of his or her life 
in jail. That is a pretty strong statement and a lot of people 
think we should talk about it a bit more.  We decided to take it 
out of this piece of legislation and we will revisit it in the 
fall.  When the House of Commons returns we will reconsider 
whether we should proceed along this rather harsh line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am familiar with other countries that have taken steps we 
would normally consider to be quite harsh.  A few years ago I 
visited a family in Norway.  There was some drinking going on at 
the dinner parties but there was always one person who did not 
drink a single ounce of alcohol. That person was the designated 
driver for the group. There were probably two or three people in 
the group. That person would drink pop and if somebody else in 
the group wanted to have a couple of glasses of wine or whatever, 
that was fine because they were not driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to them that they were obviously very serious about the 
issue of drinking and driving.  They told me “If we get caught 
driving with alcohol on our breath, we do not have to be 
impaired, just with alcohol on our breath, we will go directly to 
jail for three months”. They go directly to jail and that is it. 
They do not go to court or anything.  The policeman drives them 
to jail and there they are for three months. I suspect for most 
of us to disappear to jail for three months would cause us a 
problem with our jobs. People say “The risk is just too much, so 
I am not drinking and driving”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it stop every single person from drinking and driving?  I 
suppose not, but it certainly acts as a deterrent for most 
people.  We could say that it is almost zero tolerance for 
drinking and driving.  People who drink and drive in Norway do 
not even have to be intoxicated, they do not have to be impaired, 
they go directly to jail.  That is for the first offence.  I 
forget what the punishment is for the second offence.  Maybe it 
is torture, I do not know, but it is obviously pretty serious 
stuff. We are not going quite that far with this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that we have listened to the police forces across 
the country.  We have listened to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
We have listened to our constituents.  We have listened to 
victims rights groups.  We have listened to groups across the 
country. 
They are all saying that they want parliament to send a clear 
message to the courts of Canada, to those people involved in our 
legal and justice systems, to get tougher on those who drink and 
drive and therefore take a lethal weapon into the communities of 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it is all about.  If an intoxicated person who is 
not totally in control of his or her facilities jumps into a 
typical car or truck, it is like driving around with a great big 
cannon.  It is a dangerous object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the tragic side, I suspect most members of parliament know 
someone close to them, either a family member, a close friend or 
a neighbour, who has been impacted by someone who was drinking 
and driving.  I can think of personal friends who have lost 
children, spouses or partners as the result of someone else 
drinking and driving and ending up killing them as the result of 
an accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps even worse, they are those people who have been involved 
in very serious car accidents because of some else's drinking and 
driving and have ended up spending the rest of their lives as 
quadriplegics or being severely injured with a head injuries or 
something else.  They live very difficult lives through no fault 
of their own but because they were in the wrong place at the 
wrong time and someone who was drunk and driving a vehicle struck 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that society ought not to accept.  We do not 
condone, but we have to get a little tougher and say to folks 
that kind of behaviour is not acceptable.  This legislation will 
act as a deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the hard work done by the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and the report 
entitled  “Toward Eliminating Impaired Driving”.  I recognize 
the work of the committee in listening to people who are 
knowledgeable about this area, both in terms of victims and in 
terms of people who work in the courts, the legal and justice 
systems, and deal with people involved in these types of 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the amendments to the code we are considering 
tonight?  It will increase the mandatory minimum fine for a first 
offence to $600.  For some people that is a deterrent but for a 
lot of people it is not much of a deterrent.  It is not that big 
a deal if an average income earner has to pay a fine of $600. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will increase the driving prohibition order of not more than 
three years and not less than one year for a first offence or a 
prohibition of not less than three months, with the balance to be 
served by complying with an alcohol ignition interlock program 
where available.  That is a pretty serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will provide for a driving prohibition order of not more than 
five years and not less than two years for a second offence and 
not less than three years for a subsequent offence.  That is 
getting serious and I like that a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one point we can all agree upon.  If we look at an 
average community paper in Canada, there is always a section on 
court news which reports what has happened in the local court for 
that day.  I am always struck by the number of people up on 
drinking related offences, in particular drinking and driving 
related offences.  We have to say as a society that we will not 
tolerate this kind of behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will ensure sentencing judges consider a blood 
alcohol concentration level of two or more times the legal limit 
to be an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes.  In other 
words, if a person had three or four glasses of wine and is 
caught, that is one thing.  He or she is obviously kind of a 
dangerous person.  However, if a person has had a whole case of 
24 beer that is something else.  It is obviously a more serious 
situation.  This legislation will recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will allow the sentencing judge to require the use of an 
alcohol ignition interlock as a condition of probation where 
available.  It will allow the sentencing judge to order persons 
convicted of impaired driving to undergo assessment and to 
recommend a treatment as a condition of prohibition in those 
jurisdictions where treatment is provided.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will increase the maximum penalty available upon indictment 
to five years.  It will increase the penalty to a maximum of ten 
years imprisonment where the accident causes bodily harm, and 
life imprisonment where the accident causes death.  This is where 
we have some further work to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will allow a police officer to demand a breath or blood 
sample from an individual on reasonable and probable grounds that 
he or she has committed an impaired driving offence within the 
preceding three hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we walk up to a person who has been drinking we can normally 
figure that out pretty quickly just because of the smell. Alcohol 
has a certain smell.  We can tell if the person has been drinking 
scotch, beer or wine.  The people drinking probably cannot tell 
because they have consumed the stuff.  For those people who are 
not drinking, like a police officer, it does not take much to 
figure out that a person has been drinking.  If a police officer 
thinks a person has been drinking and can clearly smell alcohol 
from the vehicle, the legislation say that the officer has the 
grounds to request a breath or blood sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about this matter all night.  I feel very strongly 
about it, as do all my colleagues.  We are anxious to get the 
legislation passed.  It is time for society to say we are 
sophisticated enough that we will not tolerate people who put the 
lives of other people at jeopardy because they drink.  It is as 
simple as that.  To do that we have to increase the penalties 
very severely so that if a person is convicted he or she is 
penalized severely, and if the person takes someone's life he or 
she will be very seriously penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point in the legislation that I worry about is that many of 
the treatments or suggestions in terms of appropriate sentencing 
refer to where available or where possible.  If one of the 
conditions of sentencing is the seeking of treatment for an 
alcohol problem, some alcohol treatment facility has to be 
available.  If we tell people they have to do this or that as a 
way of breaking the habit, it behooves us as a society to ensure 
that those treatment facilities are available.  That is another 
challenge we have to confront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that we are into the graduation time of 
year when a lot of young students from high school, college, 
university and other institutes graduate.  A fair bit of drinking 
often occurs around these celebrations.  For years and years we 
cringed at graduation time because we knew that one morning we 
would wake up and there would have been a horrible car accident 
with a number of young people killed because of drinking and 
driving while celebrating graduation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was as regular as clockwork year after year after year.  A 
number of schools have taken a dry grad approach and made a point 
of the whole issue of drinking and driving.  As a result it 
occurs a lot less today than it has in the past.  Thank goodness 
for that but it still occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurs in the summertime because people are out celebrating, 
enjoying themselves and partying.  When a lot of people party 
they drink excessively and they are out driving boats and 
Sea-Doos. In Kamloops they actually drive Ski-Doos in the 
wintertime on the river, but that is another story.  They are 
impaired and intoxicated when they do a lot of things and that is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all parties we are trying to send a clear message 
to people that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable.  I am 
pleased to be part of this discussion tonight and look forward to 
expeditious passage of the legislation so that it becomes law as 
quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly a very important response to what can only be deemed 
a national tragedy.  It has been a very long and arduous process 
to arrive at the point where we are today.  More important, it 
has been a long and arduous process for victims and groups like 
MADD, the Canadian Police Association and many others that 
constantly kept this issue at the forefront.  Finally there has 
been a legislative response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge those groups and the efforts they made.  The 
Victims Resource Centre was another group that was instrumental 
in bringing forward important issues at the committee level.  It 
was very helpful in facilitating the testimony of many victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims themselves were those who had the most impact and 
had the most direct testimony to give.  It was helpful and 
extremely useful in the formulation of many of the legislative 
initiatives which will be very instrumental in helping to protect 
Canadians and hopefully in helping to prevent some future 
tragedies on our roads and highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many references to the fact that there are few 
members, and in fact few Canadians, who have not been touched at 
some point in their lives by some tragedy stemming from impaired 
driving, such as the hon. member for Chicoutimi, our party whip 
and the deputy leader of our party from Saint John.  This tragic 
list goes on and on.  Senator LeBreton is another example of 
someone who was very directly affected in this regard.  She has 
been a very strident advocate of necessary changes to this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarks of my hon. colleague from the NDP were quite apt. 
Summer is approaching.  Celebrations are afoot.  Families are 
spending time together.  I understand the House will be recessing 
soon and people's thoughts turn to vacation.  Sadly a lot of 
drinking is often involved in those occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can give any gift to Canadians, if we can participate in 
an effort to educate and respond in a responsible way to drinking 
to prevent tragedies and further carnage on our highways, this is 
perhaps the best and most telling thing we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts that have been put into the legislation hit some 
snags.  The non-partisan nature of this legislation is very much 
borne out by the comments we have heard today.  It is the 
implicit and intrinsic good found in the legislation which allows 
us to pass it quickly and to deliver it to Canadians in a 
meaningful way, which is what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said of the statistics that attach.  One of the 
most chilling statistics I heard during the deliberations was the 
fact that 13,000 deaths and 90,000 injuries yearly were related 
to impaired driving.  That breaks down further to 4.5 Canadians 
killed or 125 severely injured daily on our roads and highways as 
a direct result of impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics go further.  We know that the human effects are 
not borne out by cold statistics.  It is much like the sterile 
atmosphere we find in a court room where victims are often 
sitting there trying to make some sense of what has happened, 
some semblance of understanding of the effect it has had on them. 
These statistics are useful in demonstrating the need for a 
legislative response, the need for a strong deterrent message 
borne out by the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes have been brought about as a result of legislative 
initiatives and tougher sanctions.  When I speak of sanctions I 
am talking of monetary penalties, periods of incarceration and 
periods of suspension or prohibition on driving.  All three are 
very important cornerstones or underpinnings of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the statistics and the need for a speedy and 
expeditious response, I believe the provisions we see before us 
will have an effect.  I suspect their impact will be immediate in 
the sense that some of these provisions in particular empower 
police officers to do their job in a more efficient and 
protective way when it comes to dealing with the problem of 
impaired driving.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking specifically of the ability now for a police 
officer to take a sample outside of the two hour time limit which 
was a static period of time that often left officers, victims and 
Canadians generally feeling very frustrated that police were 
being curtailed in their efforts to deal with impaired drivers on 
our roads and highways.  There is obviously more that can be 
done.  There have been lengthy discussions about some of the 
changes that we will not see as a result of Bill C-82. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to highlight some of the very positive 
aspects.  Those aspects have been touched upon by previous 
speakers, such as the increases in fines and in prohibitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces in their provincial jurisdictions have taken 
their powers to the point where they are now seizing vehicles.  I 
believe that this is a very important step.  By taking away the 
car it removes from the offender the actual instrument of death. 
I believe that also sends a very important message.  It is a 
message of deterrence and a message that this type of activity 
will not be tolerated because the stakes are too high.  The human 
cost, the loss of life, the injuries and the life altering end 
results of impaired driving, is what all of these provisions are 
aimed at attacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are increased penalties and an increased ability for 
judges to mete out sentences that are more reflective of 
society's abhorrence of this type of offence.  It is also 
reflective of an overall attitudinal adjustment or shift in the 
way we have viewed this type of offence.  For some reason, for 
far too long this has been somehow an acceptable behaviour. 
Perhaps acceptable is casting too broad a net, but it has been 
tolerated by our courts and our judiciary.  Generally, we have 
not viewed this in the serious light that we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous speakers have touched on an important point.  When a 
person's life is snuffed out through a careless act and a 
preventable crime occurs, the responsibility is there for our 
judges, our judicial system and our legislation to respond in a 
very strict way.  That is what the legislation attempts to do. It 
puts more teeth into the Criminal Code.  It is a more 
proportional response to the offences that alter people's lives 
and leave people dead, injured and shattered as a result of these 
types of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to have a much different tone in the debate here in the 
House of Commons than the very arduous one that took place at the 
committee level.  The emotion that was invoked in those 
discussions and deliberations was quite reflective of the 
response and the need to respond on this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sentencing judges now have very proactive tools at their 
disposal.  They have the ability to require a convicted impaired 
driver to have an interlock device.  This is a very innovative 
approach.  It will take away the ability of drivers to start 
their vehicles unless they provide a breath sample through an 
instrument that will be attached to their vehicles.  The car will 
not start without the provision of a breath sample.  That 
technical device interprets and reads the blood alcohol 
concentration in a driver's breath before the car will actually 
start.  This type of approach is very innovative and positive in 
terms of allowing impaired drivers to get on with the 
rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk a great deal about the deterrents, the need to 
annunciate this type of offence and the need to respond in a 
harsh way.  However, we cannot lose sight of the rehabilitative 
steps that have to be taken because this affects so many people. 
We can attend any provincial court in any province or region in 
the country and time and time again, when those arraignments are 
read, a disproportionate number of those offenders will be before 
the courts for impaired driving offences. 
Statistically, we know that these offences are still occurring at 
an alarming rate.  One can only hope and pray that the steps we 
are taking here with the legislation that is now before the House 
will in some way start to curb those numbers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the numbers bear out that we are starting to see a 
decline.  It is a slow decline but it is steady.  The attention 
that has been brought to bear on this issue and the efforts that 
have been made in committee go a long way to achieving some of 
these gradual steps that are occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interlock devices are but one attempt at this rehabilitative 
process that I spoke of.  Another step is the mandatory treatment 
aspects that are now in the hands of a sentencing judge which 
gives a judge the ability to mete out a sentence that requires a 
person convicted of impaired driving to submit to counselling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This counselling aspect ties in with what is an obviously 
inextricable element to impaired driving because many of the 
offenders have an alcohol addiction problem or a drug addiction 
problem.  This is another often overlooked element of impaired 
driving.  Many of those who take a risk and get behind the wheel 
are impaired by other substances which may be prescription or 
illicit drugs.  These substances still have a very impairing 
effect on the driver which often results in tragedies; accidents 
and deaths on the highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drunk drivers should be required to submit to a form of 
counselling wherein they would receive treatment for what is 
sometimes and has been deemed on many occasions to be an illness 
and an addiction problem.  It is the repeat drunk driver, the 
hard core drinker who repeatedly takes a risk, who is responsible 
in the majority of cases for the death, carnage and loss of life 
and limb on the highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very proactive attempts and very deterrent oriented 
effects found within the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, you are very 
aware of the issue and have spoken in this place on occasions on 
this issue as well.  I think it is something that Canadians have 
waited a long time for.  We are hopeful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend all members of the committee and the Minister of 
Justice for recognizing that this as a priority issue.  We are 
thankful that now, through the co-operative efforts and the 
negotiations that are literally, as the House leader of the 
opposition has said, taking place at the 12th hour, that we are 
able to bring forth this legislation in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the elements that is missing from this legislation that 
was previously included in the report and in the draft 
legislation is the ability of a judge to hand down a sentence of 
life imprisonment where a person's impaired driving causes a 
death.  I personally have strong feelings about the deterrent 
message that this would send. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the sentencing range for this type of offence was 
previously punishable by incarceration of up to 14 years, but the 
benchmark appears to have been in the range of 8 to 8.5 years.  I 
suggest that if we raise the ceiling to life imprisonment, we 
will see judges respond appropriately and proportionately across 
the country and ratchet up those sentences to reflect society's 
abhorrence of this.  This would also send the message that this 
type of offence is no different than murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say murder, I am talking about the current murder 
provisions in the Criminal Code that allow for and permit 
sentencing judges to impose life periods of incarceration for 
manslaughter, criminal negligence causing death and second degree 
murder which do take into consideration culpability.  Alcohol, of 
course, is obviously the mitigating factor and, I would suggest, 
an aggravating factor in the determination of an appropriate 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the shocking statistics and because of the human cost 
and human element to this, I feel that empowering judges with 
this range of sentencing is an important part of the legislation. 
Sadly, we were not able to include that in the current 
legislation.  However, I have the written and verbal assurances 
of the government House leader and the Minister of Justice that 
all efforts will be made to have this included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not able to pass legislation in this session, which 
appears unlikely, we will enter a stand alone bill that would 
permit the insertion of this particular section into the Criminal 
Code empowering judges with the range of sentencing up to life 
imprisonment. 
We will introduce that this week and then return in the fall to 
again have an opportunity to bring that section to fruition and 
have a debate here in the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One expression I believe that was used by the parliamentary 
secretary was a reference to Russian roulette and the obvious 
risk that congers up in one's mind when one talks of impaired 
driving and getting behind the wheel while impaired and the 
endangerment to others' lives.  It is an apt statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a provincial court judge of Sunnybrae, Pictou County, 
Judge Clyde F. MacDonald who sits in the Glasgow provincial court 
who often used to say to impaired drivers who appeared before him 
that their actions were no different when they got behind the 
wheel of a car and drove down a highway than pointing a loaded 
gun at every car that came on to meet them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that graphically illustrates the danger that is 
involved.  One only has to pause for an instant and think about 
that scenario when we are driving home at any time of day and 
thinking that the car that is coming to meet us at a high rate of 
speed, speeding down the road, that several thousand pound piece 
of metal could veer off into our lane and take our life or the 
life of a loved one.  Sadly, that is the reality of what takes 
place in far too many instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the justice committee we heard from a young woman by the name 
of Sharleen Verhulst who lost her beloved sister in a tragic 
impaired driving accident.  She has turned the negative energy 
that would flow from that and the absolutely tragic circumstance 
into a very positive action.  She has taken her message, her very 
powerful presentation, to the committee, to high schools and 
groups across the country.  She has made very useful suggestions 
to us, as did many other groups and individuals who appeared 
before the justice committee.  They all made a very positive 
contribution which is reflected in the legislation and in the 
report that we have before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death of a victim is final, chilling and culpable. There 
needs to be greater accountability and responsibility on behalf 
of those who are willing to take the risk.  This legislation is 
extremely positive.  I have very little to say about it in a 
negative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only criticism I have is that in some instances it may not 
go far enough and in some instances I question the resources that 
will be allocated to allow for the enforcement of some of these 
provisions.  I speak mainly here of a lack of resources that are 
currently available to our municipal and federal police 
enforcement agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a degree of semantics and a degree of language 
that surrounds this discussion.  Many of the victims, including 
Ms. Verhulst, were insistent that we do not refer to impaired 
driving accidents as accidents because they are not accidents. 
There is this degree of culpability.  There is this degree of 
intent when a person recklessly consumes alcohol, gets behind the 
wheel of a car and assumes that risk.  They do so at their own 
peril and at the peril of any innocent bystander who may then 
come into contact with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vehicular homicide is perhaps a more appropriate phrase and a 
more appropriate way to describe this type of offence.  This 
legislation is going to come into effect this summer, and we are 
thankful for that.  However, as has been previously stated, there 
is still more work to be done.  There is more work to be done in 
empowering police to respond appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Conservative Party would very much like to see police 
officers being given the ability to take an automatic breath 
sample at the scene of an accident where there is reasonable and 
probable grounds to believe that alcohol is involved.  We would 
like to see a greater emphasis and experimentation for alcohol 
sensors and that type of technology. We would also like to see 
greater training for police officers to recognize drug 
impairment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all that said, I believe this is a positive step that we 
have seen.  It is a non-partisan issue that we have all 
anticipated in and embraced.  I am very thankful to have been a 
participant in bringing the legislation this far.  We look 
forward to working with the groups that have been so instrumental 
in the introduction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion in relation to the 
amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-55, an act respecting 
advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers, 
and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was 
saying earlier, perhaps I was a little naive.  After all, why 
should I have believed that the minister was sincere about 
protecting Canadian culture when she had already abandoned her 
own principles with regard to the GST? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that she was determined to rid the country of 
GST or else she would resign. Now we find her in collaboration 
with her government colleagues defending the GST as if it was 
their own initiative.  Yes, she did resign and win in a 
byelection, but is that the whole point of the exercise?  Like so 
many other Canadians, I believe that she opposed the GST as a 
matter of principle.  Obviously she was not as opposed to the GST 
as we were led to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That begs the question about what exactly this minister stands 
for.  We now know that she does not stand for Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I am being a bit hard on the minister.  Perhaps she does 
believe in protecting Canadian culture.  Perhaps it is the rest 
of her cabinet colleagues who have fettered away our Canadian 
magazine industry just to satisfy American interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that the Minister of Canadian Heritage was 
purposefully excluded from the final negotiations that were 
conducted by our Minister for International Trade and his staff 
with, of course, the direct involvement of the Prime Minister. So 
determined was the Prime Minister to exclude the Department of 
Canadian Heritage from the further negotiations with the U.S. he 
even sent the deputy minister to see greener pastures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface it would appear that by giving in to American 
demands we have averted an illegal trade war that could have 
affected the livelihoods of many Canadians.  I say illegal trade 
war because that is exactly what the U.S. retaliation would 
amount to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During question period I specifically asked the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and the Minister for International Trade 
whether Bill C-55 would respond to international trading 
obligations. Both of these ministers indicated that this was 
indeed the case. Therefore it begs the question as to why we 
would have sacrificed so much of our Canadian magazine industry 
when in fact we were simply creating legally acceptable 
legislation that would protect this vital industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did these ministers purposefully mislead the House with their 
responses or did they suddenly find out that Bill C-55 was in 
fact a violation of the WTO or NAFTA?  Perhaps we have avoided a 
trade war with the Americans but at what price to our Canadian 
cultural industries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For well over 30 years successive governments imposed strict 
regulations intended to protect Canada's magazine industry. These 
elected officials recognized the importance of this industry to 
Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently the former PC government insisted that Canada's 
cultural industries be excluded from any free trade or NAFTA 
negotiations.  Although the U.S. was very much interested in 
having Canada's cultural industries brought into the 
negotiations, the former Progressive Conservative government 
resisted those overtures. 
It recognized the importance of maintaining our own distinct 
culture for generations to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to capitulate to the Americans on this issue is 
going to have long-lasting negative effects for this and any 
future government that might want to oppose the U.S. during 
discussions on cultural issues. In future negotiations with the 
U.S. we can try to insist that we are serious about protecting 
our culture, however this Liberal government has now set a 
precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the U.S. or for that matter any other international 
trading partner take us seriously when we try to convince them 
that culture is vitally important to Canadians and that it 
deserves protecting?  They will simply look back upon this 
agreement as an example of how everybody has their price.  In 
this instance the Liberal government's price was $300 million in 
U.S. or possible U.S. sanctions, a mere one hour of trading 
between Canada and the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly is contained in this agreement?  No one has 
adequately explained what was the finally negotiated settlement. 
Now we know the Minister of Canadian Heritage has insisted that 
majority Canadian content is a prerequisite to allow foreign 
investors complete access to Canada's advertising revenue.  For 
their part, the Americans have insisted on a substantial level of 
original editorial content. What is the definition of 
substantial?  If we have never had any Canadian content in the 
past, I guess 20% Canadian content would be considered 
substantial depending on one's point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's office has indicated that the signed agreement 
between the two countries specifically states that a substantial 
level of original editorial content will be required. This is a 
far cry from the minister's insistence of majority content. I was 
told however that Canadian regulations indicate it is majority 
Canadian content.  Which one is it?  Substantial or majority 
content?  If questions or disagreements should arise with regard 
to the level of Canadian content within a particular magazine, 
then which definition are we to follow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is going to compensate Canada's magazine 
industry by giving it some kind of subsidy.  It is too early to 
predict whether this will have any long term benefits for our 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should Canada's magazine industry feel secure in believing its 
federal government will continue to provide it with these 
subsidies well after the furor over Bill C-55 has been forgotten? 
I certainly would not feel confident with the present government 
at the helm.  After all, it has shown its willingness to 
sacrifice this industry through its amendments to Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this sudden turnaround in our cultural policy meant to 
our international reputation?  We remember that during the MAI 
debate the Minister of Canadian Heritage stood up with her 
counterparts from France to denounce any negotiations that would 
weaken each other's cultural industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in Ottawa our heritage minister invited 
representatives from throughout the world to discuss ways of 
protecting our cultural heritage.  I wonder how these 
representatives are viewing Canada's capitulation at the hands of 
the Americans.  I would suspect that they are as disappointed as 
the rest of us because this decision has certainly weakened their 
position in terms of trying to defend their own cultural 
policies. How will they defend themselves against the influx of 
U.S. cultural products when they see that Canada lacked the heart 
and determination to protect its own? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface the Liberal government's decision to amend Bill 
C-55 to appease the Americans would appear to be of little 
consequence when one compares the billions of dollars worth of 
trade that is exchanged daily between both countries.  I think 
this decision will have a profound influence on all future 
negotiations with our international trading partners. Canadian 
culture can no longer be considered sacred in any future 
negotiations. The Liberal government has told the world that 
Canadian culture is a commodity like any other and that trying to 
protect it for future generations is futile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. has agreed to 18% access to our advertising revenue 
before being required to produce any Canadian content. 
I think it would be naive of us to believe that they will be 
satisfied with the present arrangement for too many years.  Then 
what?  The precedent has already been set.

like to thank the hon. member for West Nova for his presentation. 
I too am very concerned about the made in America Bill C-55.  I 
have it in front of me and it looks to me to be a three page 
letter between U.S. trade representative Barshefsky and Canadian 
Ambassador Raymond Chrétien. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What strikes me about this deal is that there is one paragraph 
after another saying that Canada will amend, Canada will further 
amend its foreign investment policy, Canada will amend its 
definition of Canadian issues, Canada will amend section 19.  It 
is all of the things that Canada will do.  There is no mention 
about what the United States will do.  It seems like a very one 
way deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only paragraph that mentions America at all states that 
Canada and the United States will agree to consult annually, upon 
request, within 20 days, on any matter relating to this 
agreement.  That is the extent of American involvement in this 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for West Nova believe that this is in any way a 
reciprocal, mutual agreement?  What can we make of this one 
paragraph outlining American responsibilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe that the whole 
issue which my colleague from Dartmouth raises speaks to how this 
was handled.  This was something about which we were not advised. 
We do not know the details.  Not knowing the details creates more 
problems, because it leads us to be concerned and scared.  Maybe 
if we knew all of the details we could be more positive, but at 
this point there is no way we can be.  There are too many 
pitfalls, too many capitulations to the U.S., and I continue to 
be concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned for the future of Canadian culture.  Our culture 
has been sold out.  I would again ask all hon. colleagues not to 
support these amendments as they are not good for our country and

positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to look at here is Canadian culture and the good of 
the Canadian people.  I am expressing an opinion, as have many 
members of the opposition.  A concern we hear repeatedly is that 
Canadian culture has been sold out.  My position is clear and the 
position of my party is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should protect Canadian culture.  We should continue to fight

welcome the opportunity to speak to the motions from the Senate 
to amend Bill C-55.  I realize that my time will be fairly short. 
I hope to be able to continue my speech tomorrow or else extend 
the time this evening in order for me to be able to complete my 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the trade critic for the official opposition I think that 
Bill C-55 has been a total disaster at every turn over the last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this all started with the World Trade 
Organization ruling which told Canada that it could not follow 
the policies which the government implemented in terms of taxes 
on split-run magazines.  It was very interesting to hear the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage today say that the government had 
to respond because Canada lost that ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree, but that is a very different interpretation than 
we heard a couple of months ago in the House when the heritage 
minister and the trade minister said that Canada did not lose 
that ruling.  It seems to me that we lost and we have to abide by 
the rules which we, in turn, put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been one of the main proponents of trade rules to 
protect our interests around the world.  Why is that?  That is 
because Canada has a relatively small population.  We have a very 
big country with a lot of exports that need to be exported around 
the world.  In fact exports account for 40% of the GDP of the 
country.  They are very, very high.  We need to be able to export 
and, in turn, we need the protection of trade rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada in the last 50 years has probably been the biggest 
influence in establishing trade rules at the GATT and 
subsequently at the World Trade Organization.  The rules work for 
us, and yet when we lose these rulings we have a Liberal 
government that does not want to accept the rulings and tries to 
do a dance to work a way around those which are against Canada. 
We saw it again in the case of the aerospace industry and export 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage has, as I said, managed this 
issue very badly, but I have to give her credit.  As the minister 
of culture she has been an amazing playwright.  She has written a 
play called Bill C-55.  I am not sure whether I would call it a 
farce or a tragedy, but it is one of those.  I do not think the 
final act has been written or played out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that there are a lot more things to come on this issue 
of culture and the dispute with the United States because the 
bill is very, very badly designed and will invite further 
challenges from the United States.  It is not only going to 
invite further challenges from the United States, it will invite 
further challenges at the World Trade Organization, the very 
organization where Canada goes to argue to have rules designed 
concerning subsidies and how they should not be applied against 
our exports.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have it both ways.  What is really going on is simply 
a matter of damage control.  Canada got beat up very badly, and 
it deserved to on this issue.  The Liberal government managed 
this issue very badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year we have intimidated a lot of industries in 
Canada, such as the steel and lumber sectors, which are already 
facing challenges from the United States.  We have intimidated 
those industries into thinking that they will have to face 
another round of retaliation.  Does the government not recognize, 
does it not realize, what it is signing in these international 
agreements?  Most people knew that the so-called exemption clause 
for culture would not hold water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government is basically misleading the 
Canadian public. It is certainly misleading the cultural 
industries.  It has misled them for the past six years into 
thinking that they were protected by the exemption clause. Look 
what it led to, a total collapse in the position of the Canadian 
government and it had to accept a very bad deal.  It is not just 
bad for the government; it is bad for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about Liberal assurances, this Hollywood movie 
set that they hide behind.  It is not just in the cultural area, 
but I want to talk about that for a moment.  We have the 
so-called cultural exemption.  The cultural industries which 
built an industry on it thought they had protection.  What did 
they find out?  That they had been betrayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World Trade Organization negotiations are set to start in 
Seattle probably next year.  What is the Liberal government's 
position?  It is going to protect the cultural industries.  It 
will have a cultural agreement, a cultural instrument inside the 
WTO agreement.  What nonsense.  It knows that cannot be 
accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it over an over again.  We saw it in the softwood lumber 
agreement with the United States.  The government accepted the 
managed trade agreement.  There would be five years of peace.  No 
problem.  It signed the agreement thinking there would be no 
disputes for five years.  What have we got?  Dispute after 
dispute after dispute because Canada did not know what it was 
doing at those negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the supply management sector?  Again the government 
is telling the sector not to worry, that it will be protected. 
It said that in the GATT negotiations in Geneva.  It said it 
would protect article 11, border closures.  There would not be 
product coming into Canada and the sector would not have to 
convert to tariffs.  What happened?  The government could not 
defend that position.  Then it came back and said it was sorry. 
It had tried to protect the sector and it had lost.  The 
government knew full well that it could not protect that sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  Upcoming trade talks will be held at the World 
Trade Organization.  The government is not only selling the same 
old story to the cultural sector, it is also selling it to the 
supply management sector.  It is saying not to worry, it will 
protect them.  There will be no movement this time.  There are 
350% tariffs, but it will protect those sectors.  They will not 
have to worry about it.  There will be a 350% tariff after it is 
finished.  What nonsense.  Anybody who believes the government on 
these issues is very naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is doing the Canadian public a grave disservice. 
I suggest that the agreement which was reached with the Americans 
will have ongoing problems which will not be resolved very 
easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the business of subsidies.  Now we are going to give the 
Canadian magazine industry subsidies of $100 million a year. That 
is the figure that is floated out there.  It is ironic that the 
subsidies are not only going to go to the Canadian magazine 
industry.  American magazines which are subject to this agreement 
will also get subsidies.  The Canadian public will subsidize the 
American magazine industry under this agreement.  What nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have said that there are current challenges which 
might happen under this agreement.  Here is the caption on the 
so-called letters that were exchanged a week ago:  “The United 
States accepts the terms of the agreement which states that a net 
benefit review by Canada on new investments in the magazine 
industry will include undertakings from foreign investors that 
result in a substantial level of original editorial comment”. 
Notice that I said substantial.  That is what the United States 
said.  Canada will use guidelines that call for a majority of 
original editorial content.  Which way is it?  It is not even 
clear.  Is it substantial or is it a majority?

just seen the tip of the iceberg.  This agreement is nothing more 
than a short term agreement that is never going to see the light 
of day in any substantial terms.  The government is deceiving the 
magazine industry yet again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I realize the hour is late, but I have to rise today to 
further discuss a question I raised in the House on April 14. The 
situation involving the Sioux Lookout Zone Hospital is absolutely 
critical.  There is no question that we are dealing with an 
emergency which the government continues to overlook and refuses 
to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put this in context.  On July 2 I wrote to the 
Minister of Health explaining to him that the situation at the 
Sioux Lookout Zone Hospital was critical.  The hospital is 
supposed to serve 28 first nations communities in northern 
Ontario, but it was in a critical and dire situation because of 
the failure of the government to ensure a contract between that 
hospital and a teaching hospital to provide the adequate staff in 
terms of both doctors and nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no question that we are dealing with a lack of action on 
the part of the federal government, a mishandling of a serious 
situation.  I have to raise this issue tonight because the 
government continues to refuse to address this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 14 I raised this question in the House. At that point 
the chiefs of two first nations in northern Ontario had been on a 
hunger strike for 100 hours over the issue of the Sioux Lookout 
Zone Hospital. They were on a hunger strike to try to get the 
attention of the government to act and act quickly. At that time 
the Minister of Health said “Do not worry.  We are looking into 
it.  In fact, I am going to visit those communities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health went to the region on April 23 and April 
24 and promised prompt action.  To this day, June 9, 1999, no 
action has been taken.  The hospital is still not open, leaving 
16,000 residents without adequate health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is supposed to be a contract between the medical services 
branch and McMaster University.  To this day, McMaster, which has 
been committed to recruit and retain 16 physicians, has only been 
able to find two or three physicians to serve at this hospital. 
Up to 75% of the nurses in northern nursing stations which feed 
off of this hospital are rumoured to be relief workers.  Nursing 
at the hospital itself has decreased significantly since the 
hospital closed and now the hospital only has enough nursing 
staff to keep 25 of its 39 beds open.  We are looking at a dire 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am raising this tonight to see if finally the government will 
act quickly so that the people of this entire region can have 
some solution to a critical health care situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to northern and remote communities and first 
nations communities, there is no semblance of adequate quality 
health care.  This situation is absolutely acute.  It is 
desperate to the point where the chiefs for two of the first 
nations communities went on a hunger strike.  They are now back 
appealing that the government do something immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know tonight, does the government have any plan to 
ensure that the Sioux Lookout Zone Hospital is up and running, 
has the necessary physician services, is able to equip all the 
related northern nursing stations and is able to guarantee the 
people of this region have some direct access to quality health 
care?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister 
shares the member's concern about the Sioux Lookout Zone 
Hospital. However, I must say that in a free society no 
government at any level can make individual doctors or individual 
nurses choose to serve in that location.  It is a matter of 
coaxing and it is a matter of offering incentives.  We have done 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1998 Health Canada signed an agreement with McMaster 
University for physician services within the Sioux Lookout zone. 
A new compensation package was developed to assist physician 
recruitment into this area.  McMaster University representatives 
remain optimistic that the number of physicians in the area will 
significantly increase in the next short while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hospital is open and is currently offering as many 
in-services as possible.  The emergency department will reopen 
when there are sufficient physicians to ensure continuity of care 
and safe practice within the hospital setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has been working on innovative strategies for the 
recruitment and retention of nurses.  It has formed a working 
group involving first nations, the Professional Institute of the 
Public Service of Canada and Health Canada representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the Minister of Health established a Sioux Lookout 
zone working group which is a partnership between Health Canada 
and the first nations to address and resolve the zone's health 
situation, including the issues of physician and nurse shortages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is also committed to working with all parties on 
the amalgamation of the existing provincial health facility and 
the Sioux Lookout Zone Hospital.  This will eventually lead to a 
new provincial hospital with a two-thirds first nations board 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health during his visit in April participated in 
a round table meeting on health care and reaffirmed his 
commitment to work in partnership with all parties impacted by 
the situation.  He encouraged all parties to contribute toward 
solutions to address the problems in the long and short term.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the House of Commons often has many visitors. Tonight a number of 
young Canadians have come to spend some time with us.  Before 
getting to my question for the parliamentary secretary I thought 
perhaps I would relate very briefly the frustration these young 
people may face when trying to get on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We click on the icon, dial up the network, enter the server name 
and password, and sometimes the line rings and rings. Call backs 
have to be made.  Then we finally get through and the home page 
comes up and very slowly the little bar at the bottom starts 
moving.  We call up the first picture and slowly another line 
will appear.  It is very frustrating for many people who use the 
Internet and whose computers do not have a lot of juice to wait 
for the information. It is very frustrating when one's mind works 
faster than the hardware and the software. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the kind of frustration I wanted to raise with 
the Minister of Human Resources Development on June 3 and I will 
repeat the question tonight. In times of need Canadians expect 
the government to be there for them.  When someone loses their 
job, the last thing they need is a thoughtless, faceless 
bureaucracy armed with confusing rules and jargon.  People need 
personal, sensitive and understandable systems. I asked the 
Minister of Human Resource Development whether he shared my 
sentiments and if so, what steps were being taken to ensure 
quality service for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament have this frustration when constituents 
call faced with problems such as program benefits they want to 
access, a job loss situation where they require employment 
insurance to pay the bills for their family. They are frustrated 
because they are faced with questions.  They are also faced with 
voice mail and electronic messages.  At times of stress, pressure 
and strain all they really want is the opportunity to talk to a 
human being who understands their crisis and who can tell them in 
layman's terms exactly how to deal with their situation.  It 
happens time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister very briefly started to outline some steps but 
unfortunately because of the time limitations in question period, 
he did not get through many of the points I am sure he wanted to 
raise.  I have come here tonight to ask the parliamentary 
secretary if she would provide Canadians with a little more 
insight into the kinds of things the government has done and is 
working on so Canadians get the kind of service they need.

officials and employees of HRDC from across Canada to discuss how 
the department could go further in terms of ensuring that 
Canadians get the very best service possible and that people are 
treated with respect, compassion and caring when they come to the 
department for help. As a result of this meeting, several 
initiatives are now underway at HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, HRDC is committed to ensuring its clients can 
better understand the rules and regulations behind various 
programs.  It will also make sure that all of its communications 
with citizens are written in plain language and in an appropriate 
and friendly tone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department will do more to look into hardship cases and 
complex EI claims to ensure a fair and consistent application of 
policies and to tell people of available resource mechanisms they 
might use.  Many of the local offices already have public liaison 
officers who help in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC is committed to adopting consistent processes for 
collecting overpayments to ensure that an individual's capacity 
to repay is respected and that the repayment schedules reflect 
individual circumstances and take into account cases of hardship. 
HRDC will also find new ways of consulting and talking to 
Canadians to ensure that our standards measure up to their 
expectations and are meaningful to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That just scratches the surface of the multitude of initiatives 
the minister has undertaken to ensure that HRDC's excellent 
service becomes even better.  This commitment is firm and honest 
and Canadians will be the beneficiaries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to follow up on a question I asked on April 
30 about the AIDA farm disaster program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point only 500 farmers had taken the time to fill out 
the AIDA forms and send them in to be processed.  There are 
100,000 farmers on the prairies.  What percentage of them have 
now filled out these forms?  How many claims have been paid? Very 
few farmers have been applying and receiving compensation. I 
would like to know if the minister thinks this program is helping 
farmers through the income crisis they are experiencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much has been paid out under AIDA to producers in Ontario, 
in Quebec, in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and the other 
provinces? Even the minister of agriculture in Saskatchewan has 
called on the federal government to scrap this program because he 
has realized it is not helping the farmers who need it.  Will the 
minister listen to farmers and get rid of the AIDA program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA was supposed to help farmers who had an income that fell 
30% in 1998 but because of the fact that it is tied to NISA, a 
farmer's income has to fall almost 40% to qualify for any 
assistance. Did the minister tie the program to NISA so the 
government would not have to pay out the $900 million commitment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked this question during question period, the minister 
said that farmers were not applying.  In essence he is blaming 
farmers for the fact the program is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long before the minister announced the AIDA program we urged him 
to keep the program simple and to make payments on an acreage 
basis.  We made that recommendation over six months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NISA is not working either for these farmers.  In NISA, 8,600 
Saskatchewan farmers have an average of $303 in their accounts. 
Another 10,000 farmers have less than $2,800 in their accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the reason the minister is not accepting negative 
margins in his AIDA package is that he does not want to promote 
bad farm management.  Due to the drop in commodity prices there 
were an estimated 10,000 farm operations with negative margins in 
1998.  I wonder if the minister of agriculture is prepared to say 
that these 10,000 operations with negative margins are the result 
of bad farm management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The calls coming in from the farm stress line in Saskatchewan 
are also an indication that AIDA is not helping producers.  The 
number of calls to the farm stress line this year is already way 
above the monthly average for 1998.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA is definitely not helping farmers get through this income 
crisis.  Is the minister ready to admit that his farm disaster 
program is a disaster?  Is he ready to sit down and work out a 
program that will help Canadian farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that the AIDA staff is also making up rules on the 
fly.  A man called my office the other day.  He and his wife have 
separate farming operations which include each possessing their 
own Canadian Wheat Board permit books, filing separate taxes and 
having separate NISA accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The husband and wife each filled out separate AIDA forms and 
sent them in.  When the AIDA staff looked at these forms it was 
determined that this husband and wife could not file separately 
because their farms were not at arm's length from one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the minister to explain how it is determined that these 
farmers who file separate income taxes, have separate permit 
books and have separate NISA accounts are not considered separate 
farms when it comes to AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also raises a number of questions as to how AIDA staff will 
deal with other types of farming operations.  Are the rest of the 
husband and wife operations to be considered as one farm?  What 
about places where father and son each have separate farms but 
work together?  Will they be considered one operation?  The same 
applies for brothers or people who work together.  Did the 
minister consider any of this when he was constructing AIDA? 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as has already 
been stated in the House, federal money is flowing out under the 
agriculture income disaster assistance program.  Program 
administrators have started processing applications and sending 
cheques to those farmers who have submitted a complete 
application package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acted swiftly to pay the federal portion in those provinces 
where the federal government delivers the program so that farmers 
could have money in their hands.  When those provinces, and that 
includes Saskatchewan and Manitoba, sign the agreement producers 
will receive the second portion of their disaster payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other provinces are delivering the program.  B.C., Alberta, 
P.E.I. and Ontario are using an existing administrative system. 
Members should be aware that Alberta has had a disaster 
assistance program since 1995 to which the federal government has 
contributed its companion program money.  Farmers in those 
provinces started receiving money several weeks ago, 
notwithstanding the federal-provincial discussions on cost 
sharing and administrative issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think our record is very good.  AIDA started out as a general 
concept just before Christmas and in a mere four months has 
become a reality.  Money is flowing to farmers for a program that 
is targeted and pays benefits to people who really need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members also realize that this program will not buy us 
trouble with our trading partners on the international scene. 
Benefits will not be captured by foreign treasuries but by our 
own farmers.  This is no simple accomplishment in such a short 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal and provincial governments should be commended for all 
the hard work that went into the AIDA program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, following the annual NAC lobby on Monday of this week I 
hoped we would see a change in attitude from the Liberal 
government concerning the impact of its programs on women, 
especially changes to the EI program which have had a specific 
and serious effect on Canadian women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own figures show that women have been hardest 
hit by modifications to eligibility requirements.  Today, 44% of 
Canadian women are not eligible for maternity benefits, placing a 
huge strain on families from B.C. to Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision the government has made is a simple one.  It has 
placed the ideology of the collection agency ahead of human 
compassion and economic efficiency.  I am sure hon. members are 
familiar with the term penny-wise and pound foolish.  This is a 
concise summary of the government's policy.  By attempting to 
balance the nation's books on the backs of the middle class, the 
working poor and the disadvantaged, the administration has 
decided to trade long term growth for the illusion of short term 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the equivalent of a family selling its house so it can pay 
off its debts.  What good does a perfect credit rating do when 
everything that matters has been thrown away? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance was designed to serve as a bridge to enable 
workers to survive while they are between jobs. 
Over the years that definition has become more and more 
restrictive.  Now one has to live in a region that experiences a 
complete economic meltdown before one will be eligible.  Even 
then, unfortunately, there are parts of the country where that 
meltdown has happened.  I base these statements on fact. There 
are people who fall through the cracks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I recall the statements made by the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Human Resources Development several weeks ago 
in the House, I am struck by the calmness with which she 
dispatched my question, the easy words about studies and about 
investigations into the problems we are facing with the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems once many people leave their communities and start to 
breathe the thin air on Parliament Hill they forget that studies, 
investigations and inquiries do not put bread on the table. 
Certainly the people of Cape Breton Island have learned that 
lesson well.  We are aware that reports do not fill a child's 
stomach before he or she goes to school or goes to bed at night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that they do not want to start 
making changes until they understand the whys and wherefores of 
the numbers.  I was left wondering what was the problem.  Before 
the government pushed through its changes to the system, there 
was no evidence that women were discriminated against by the 
system.  Surely the answers to the government's questions are 
laid out for it in the old legislation which the government threw 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make perfectly clear that my comments are not intended 
to call simply for a return to the old ways.  My party is the 
first to admit that system was imperfect and in need of 
substantial reform, but changes need to be based on an assessment 
of why a program was invented in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An unfortunate trend has come to dominate policy making since 
1993, the tendency of programs to be examined, pared down or 
eliminated because of their impact on the year to year financial 
forecast instead of on their social utility.  Using this model, 
programs like EI and other assistant agencies are portrayed as 
inefficient.  That justification has been used to whittle them 
away until they are unable to function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to act and we have to act decisively.  Canadians will 
not reward parliament for indecisiveness or a lack of action. 
Whenever the reports or studies or whatever concerning the EI 
system are delivered to the minister, I hope the government will 
be inspired into action to do what is right for women and all 
other citizens of the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human 
Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not the least 
bit embarrassed that the member opposite thinks I remained too 
calm in answering her earlier question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the electors in my riding expect me to remain calm, 
analytical and have an intellectual approach to the subject in 
front of me, and I think that is the approach of the government. 
It is only in so doing that one can be a true steward of the 
nation's resources and come up with programming that addresses 
the true needs of people and does not respond in some hysterical 
fashion to some new statistics that come out of a study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member that we too are concerned about making sure 
that EI is fair and accessible to women.  We agree with her that 
claims by women for regular benefits dropped by four percentage 
points more than claims by men in 1997-98, and this concerns us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's officials are now in the process of determining 
why the number of claims went down.  The reasons for this decline 
are not easy to see and not clear.  In fact there seems to be 
several factors at play.  Let me assure the member that we are 
trying to get a clearer understanding and we are looking at 
various options that could rectify the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House that 
several features of the EI program benefit women.  The move to an 
hours based system, for example, was in large part about helping 
women out of the 14 hour job trap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that two-thirds of the people who get the more 
generous family income supplement are women, that 58% of the 
small week claims were made by women, and that the reach back 
provision for active employment measures means women who stayed 
at home to raise their children can benefit from these measures 
for up to five years in order to help them get back into the 
workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to making sure that EI benefits are fair and 
accessible for all women, but we are also committed to helping 
women who wish to enter or re-enter the workforce.  Our efforts 
will continue in that direction.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
