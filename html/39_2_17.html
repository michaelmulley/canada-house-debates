    </p><a name="Para768896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Canada is facing a labour shortage. There is no reason why people and working families, especially those that are in the construction trade could not be allowed this deduction. Many Mexican and Portuguese immigrants in my riding, for example, would love to have the kind of tax deduction that some of the employers can have, so that they can travel a bit of a distance to find work. Whether it is travel or hotel costs, they should be tax deductible, and this is what the petition is all about.</div>

    </p><b>Hon. Loyola Hearn (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para768900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, with respect to the small craft harbours program:</div>
    </p><a name="Para768901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(a) Core harbours are harbours that are critical to the commercial fishing industry, and are either currently managed by harbour authorities or expected to be managed by harbour authorities in the future; 
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) there are 34 core harbours in the riding of West Nova, 26 in the riding of Central Nova, 5 in the riding of Cumberland-Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley and 50 in the riding of South Shore-St. Margaret’s; 
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 2006/07 total cost of program spending in the riding of West Nova is $2,594,891, in the riding of Central Nova is $4,726,711, in the riding of Cumberland-Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley is $23,979 and in the riding of South Shore St. Margaret’s is $4,944,994; 
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the total 2007 budget for the program is $97.1M (excluding employee benefit plans); 
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) the total planned spending for 2007-08 is the same as the total national budget, which is $97.1M (excluding employee benefit plans); 
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) as of October 2007, the percentage of SCH core harbours in poor or unsafe condition is 28%, or 209 of a total of 747; 
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) the SCH program estimates that $35M is required to be added to the current SCH annual budget in order to ensure proper life cycle management of assets at core harbours.

    <center><b>Question No. 50--</b></center><b>Ms. Jean Crowder</b>:<a name="Para768908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regards to commuter rail service on Vancouver Island: (<i>a</i>) how much money has the government spent in the past 20 years on the Vancouver Island E &amp; N Rail corridor; (<i>b</i>) how many funding applications have been made to support commuter rail on Vancouver Island; (<i>c</i>) how many of those applications have been granted; (<i>d</i>) what was the amount of money granted; (<i>e</i>) how many of those applications were denied and why; and (<i>f</i>) what is the government's current plan to promote commuter rail on Vancouver Island?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Lawrence Cannon (Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para768909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the response is as follows:</div>
    </p><a name="Para768910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)	The federal government has provided VIA with over $35 million between 1987 and 2006 for the operation of VIA’s Victoria-Courtenay inter-city passenger service.  No funding has been provided for a commuter rail service.  Traditionally, the federal government has not funded commuter services as they are the responsibility of municipal and provincial governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)	No applications received</div>
    </p><a name="Para768912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)	No applications received</div>
    </p><a name="Para768913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)	No applications received</div>
    </p><a name="Para768914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)	No applications received</div>
    </p><a name="Para768915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)	While urban transit is a provincial/territorial and municipal responsibility, the federal government recognizes the vital role transportation plays in the well-being of Canada’s urban centres and communities, and its potential benefits.  The Government of Canada is committed to working closely with other jurisdictions to ensure that communities have the best possible transportation systems by directly investing in infrastructure projects through the new infrastructure programs announced in budget 2007.  As well, municipalities can use the one hundred percent GST rebate and gas tax fund for commuter rail infrastructure and equipment initiatives.  Budget 2007 makes a historic investment of more than $16 billion in infrastructure, bringing federal support under the new building Canada plan over the next seven years to a total of $33 billion, including the funding provided in budget 2006.  This summer, the transport, infrastructure and communities portfolio undertook discussions with the provinces and territories and the municipal sector regarding the new $33 billion building Canada infrastructure plan and the operation of the new programs. The next steps will be to obtain Treasury Board approval of the funding programs, as well as identifying priorities, assessing projects, and negotiating the necessary agreements with the new terms and conditions for the funds. Throughout this process, funding will continue to be delivered through existing infrastructure programs, including the gas tax fund and the public transit fund.</div>

    <center><b>Question No. 60--</b></center><b>Mr. Yvon Godin</b>:<a name="Para768916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages' Preliminary Investigation Report of May 2007, “Investigation of Complaints Concerning the Federal Government's 2006 Expenditure Review”: (<i>a</i>) when is the government going to provide certain documents that the Office requested; (<i>b</i>) why did the government delay in providing a definitive response to the written request for these documents; and (<i>c</i>) are the documents still confidential and, if so, why?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Vic Toews (President of the Treasury Board, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para768917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the response is as follows: </div>
    </p><a name="Para768918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	The documents requested on March 5th, 2007, by the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages contain confidences of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, within the meaning of section 69 of the Access to Information Act and section 39 of the Canada Evidence Act, and therefore cannot be disclosed.

</div>
    </p><a name="Para768919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	The documents requested were very specific and necessitated an exhaustive search by a number of stakeholders within the Treasury Board Secretariat of all documents on file related to official languages and the expenditure review decision making process.  Once the pertinent documents were identified and compiled, they were carefully reviewed and assessed as to whether they could or could not be disclosed.  Since the documents contain confidences of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, they could not be disclosed.  A reply letter explaining this was provided to the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages on May 3rd, 2007.

</div>
    </p><a name="Para768920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	The documents requested are confidential as they contain confidences of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada and are thus protected from disclosure for a period of 20 years pursuant to section 69 of the Access to Information Act and section 39 of the Canada Evidence Act
</div>

    <center><b>Question No. 116--</b></center><b>Mr. Mario Silva</b>:<a name="Para768921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What programs, policies, and oversights does the Treasury Board use to ensure equal pay for equal work between men and women, as well as for minority groups?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Vic Toews (President of the Treasury Board, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para768922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, equal pay for equal work is ensured through the application of classification standards that results in the same remuneration for employees classified at the same occupational group and level.
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of efficient employment equity strategies, we have seen a significant increase in the number of women being recruited and promoted into professional and executive categories.  This has allowed us to reduce the global gender wage gap for the core public administration.
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We negotiate wages in good faith and endeavour to ensure that gender-based wage discrimination does not re-emerge in our wage-setting practices.

The fact that this issue was brought up during the three byelections in Quebec is due in large part to the initiative of the Bloc Québécois. Decisions were then made by the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec, during the Quebec election last March.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a great uproar in Quebec when the Chief Electoral Officer of Elections Canada, Mr. Mayrand, announced that he did not plan on using his power to address a loophole in the Canada Elections Act with respect to voting with the face covered. But the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec used the power set out in section 19—if I am not mistaken—to fix a situation that went unnoticed by parliamentarians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Quebec were therefore especially upset by Mr. Mayrand's attitude and, throughout Quebec, people wanted him to reconsider his decision and take the necessary measures to ensure that voters vote with their faces uncovered. He would not do so, however, claiming that it was up to parliamentarians to correct the situation. His was a very weak argument, since the precedent had already been set, as I mentioned. Indeed, to ensure that the general election in Quebec ran smoothly, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec had decided to use his power to correct the situation, since parliamentarians had failed to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Mayrand, revealed that he had no intention of making a decision, the Bloc Québécois, through my hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78639,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78639&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel</A>, sent him a letter, calling on him to correct the situation and to ensure that, when voting, all voters confirm their identity by uncovering their entire face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the hours that followed, if memory serves, all the parties of this House made the same appeal to the Chief Electoral Officer of Elections Canada. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> then intervened, saying that common sense dictated that voters must prove their identity when voting, which is also our position. Identification means more than just presenting documents or ID cards; it also means being able to guarantee that that individual is the same person as the one on the photo ID cards, and for that to be possible, the person's face must be fully visible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recall, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> wasted no time stating his position on the matter, and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">leader of the Liberal Party</A> took the same position.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remember that the NDP leader agreed with them initially, and that a few hours later, he started to adjust his stance on the issue. Unfortunately, I have not yet heard the NDP's opinion in this debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I do remember that all four party leaders spoke out in favour of voters showing their faces. At the time, it just so happened that I was giving a press conference to announce the Bloc Québécois' activities leading up to its convention in October 2008. Right then and there, as soon as Mr. Mayrand, the Chief Electoral Officer, stated that he had decided not to intervene, we condemned the situation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within hours, the Bloc Québécois whip announced that he would introduce a bill on the subject. That is exactly what he did. We introduced a bill requiring voters to show their faces when voting, a bill that respects gender equality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he tabled the bill, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78507,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78507&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Beauport—Limoilou</A> requested the unanimous consent of the House to fast-track it, to move it through all stages quickly, but that did not happen. The Conservative Party, for strictly partisan reasons, refused to give its consent so that it could table the bill now before us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we cannot oppose the bill in principle, because we prompted this decision by the government. We could have moved much faster if there had been unanimous consent with regard to the bill introduced by my colleague, but that was not the case. Now, we have this bill before us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, we support the bill in principle. However, the government has not tackled the root of the problem with its bill. Yes, voters will have to uncover their faces in order to be identified and be able to vote. But it is up to the Chief Electoral Officer to decide how this obligation is to be met, even though the Muslim community never made any specific request about this. This is where the real problem lies. The bill is responding to a request that was never made by a specific community that has been identified as the community to which the Chief Electoral Officer's decision was meant to respond.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the bill that is before us is that it is still up to the Chief Electoral Officer to determine how voters are to meet the requirement to identify themselves. We would not want Muslim women to ask to uncover their faces only in front of other women, because gender equality with regard to election officials would not be respected. In our opinion, religious considerations have no place in public spaces. We are not saying that religions are marginal or unimportant, but government employees have a responsibility to enforce the law fairly and equitably for everyone. In our opinion, there is no basis for this. I repeat that there has never been a request, on religious grounds, that Muslim women, for example—I am using this example because it has been reported most often in the media—be able to ask election officials to be allowed to uncover their faces only in front of another woman.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our view, this is exactly the same as if a police officer wanted to arrest a man and the man invoked his religion and said that he could not get into a car with a female police officer. It is the same kind of thing. And that is the direction in which we will be going. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In committee, we will be proposing that a number of provisions in the act be tightened to ensure that such cases do not arise and that it will not once again be the responsibility of the Chief Electoral Officer to decide the procedures relating to the obligation for people to identify themselves when they vote. We have been sent a signal: it is up to parliamentarians to provide a complete response to the problem raised in the three byelections in Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore support the bill in principle, but in terms of the manner in which it will be applied, we will want to be sure that religious considerations will not conflict with the fundamental principle, the obligation that electors have to identify themselves properly when they vote. We will therefore also be wanting to raise the question of postal ballots. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015">(1015)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para768950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will quite properly be raising the fact that while an elector has to identify himself or herself by showing his or her face in an election, there will be no such obligation for postal ballots. We will therefore want to amend the Elections Act accordingly in this regard. We will see whether this is acceptable during debate, but logically, it seems to me that we will have to move in that direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, it is mandatory to uncover one’s face and have one’s face uncovered when passport photographs are taken. In the area of airport security, the authorities are entitled to ensure that people are properly identified, by way of the passports or ID cards that are requested. Logically, for a right as important in a democracy as the right to vote, out of fairness to all electors, we have to ensure that the same methods are applied, including that everyone have an obligation, for the process of identification, to vote with his or her face uncovered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the position that the Bloc Québécois will be taking. Once again, I would repeat, on the substantive issues, we support the bill. In our view, it is crucial that we ensure that all electors are equal before the law. As I said earlier, it is those principles that we will be arguing for in committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude, I reiterate that the Bloc Québécois supports the bill in principle. All electors must be equal before the law. The Bloc Québécois and the other political parties believe that the Elections Act, as amended in 2007, was sufficiently clear. However, because the Chief Electoral Officer has refused to use his exceptional power to require that everyone who votes do so with their face uncovered, the Bloc Québécois believes that it is necessary to amend the act as quickly as possible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well, the Bloc Québécois notes that the bill presented by the government is not a complete response in terms of the principles of the equality of all persons before the law. As I said, the bill in fact opens the door to violations of the principle of the equality of men and women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first five clauses of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> were introduced in order to allow deputy returning officers and poll clerks to delegate their power to another individual. This is what I was talking about earlier, and felt was the weak point in this bill. Using that mechanism, a male deputy returning officer could accommodate a female elector by designating a women before whom the elector could uncover her face to confirm her identity. In our view, that violates the principle of equality between men and women and of equality among all electors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> at second reading but will require that the first five amendments be changed, as I stated, to ensure that everyone has the same obligations with respect to the law. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned that the Bloc Québécois acted quickly in this matter. We wish to closely monitor this issue particularly since we are aware that it is at the heart of a debate that is extremely important to Quebec—the place of religion in public space.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not all. As I mentioned, we believe that by virtue of the principles of equity and equality, and out of respect for the values of Quebeckers, which are shared by Canadians, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> must be amended to ensure that it fulfills its purpose. The government wanted to address the issue raised by the Chief Electoral Officer; however, its solution is inadequate and is not in keeping with the expectations of the Bloc Québécois and of Quebec society as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hours following the decision by the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, the parties in the National Assembly were united. Premier Jean Charest, the leader of the ADQ, Mario Dumont, and the new leader of the Parti Québécois believed that common sense dictated that individuals should vote with their face uncovered to ensure proper identification and also, as I mentioned, for security reasons, as is the norm. Therefore I find it difficult to see how, in the case of such an important right as the right to vote, these rights would be violated.</div>

    </p><a name="Para768962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like him to tell us exactly how many incidents there were during the general election in Quebec in the spring and during the three byelections in Quebec in September. How many times did the legislation fail in terms of elector identification? How many people, whose faces were covered, ran into problems when they cast their vote?</div>
    </p><a name="Para768963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the sense in asking someone to uncover their face when it is not necessary and is even impossible to have a universal photo ID card across Canada? It does not exist. We cannot ask citizens to get a driver's licence just to vote. There is no mandatory photo ID for the entire voting population. What happened to common sense? What is the link between a photo ID card and the need to uncover one's face?</div>
    </p><a name="Para768964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member spoke of principles, but what principles? Does he mean the principle of nonsense? There is no link between uncovering one's face and the need to produce photo ID, since such universal cards do not exist in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768965"></a><p>

There was only one incident: four women voted with their faces veiled, which they justified using the Chief Electoral Officer's directives. It is clear that this was an isolated incident. We should be grateful for the voters' sense of responsibility and wisdom in the three ridings that held byelections. If not for that, this issue could have been blown way out of proportion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not about specific issues; it is a matter of principle. If we offered a group of voters the opportunity to vote with their faces covered—except for medical reasons, obviously, as set out in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>—we would be violating the principle of gender equality. Moreover, if we are talking about a specific religion, the Muslim community never asked for this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote part of an interview with Mrs. Ibnouzahir on Radio-Canada:</div>

      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>These women have been voting for years. They have never asked for special treatment, even though they know they have the right to do so under current legislation. They themselves took the initiative to show their faces, just as they do at customs or at the passport office, because they believed it made sense for security reasons. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para768970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not think it is unreasonable to show their faces when they vote. Why create an exception that goes against the values of Quebec society and, I think, Canadian society, to act on a request that was never articulated by any group in Quebec or Canada?</div>
    </p><a name="Para768971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois wants to engage in a real debate between a vision of society known as multiculturalism, which seeks to bring all cultures and ethnicities into society, and Quebec's intercultural approach, which seeks to integrate all members of a society into a common culture. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that it is essentially the Trudeau legacy that is making the federal Liberals go back on the approach developed by their leader when these incidents happened. If I remember correctly, I think that the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada felt that common sense and the need to respect the right to equality between female and male electors dictated that it was necessary to vote with the face uncovered. Now, it seems as though some comments were made within the caucus or the core electorate of the Liberals that led the party to change its approach, reverting to the approach of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Society is made up of individuals and groups that join together rather than stand apart. So we will not wait for the incidents to happen. We are happy there have not been more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parliamentarian is responsible for addressing concerns as they arise, and not waiting for there to be a problem. It was the Chief Electoral Officer who asked parliamentarians to fix and clarify the situation. This is why we want to go further than Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> to ensure that the Chief Electoral Officer has all the necessary parameters to enforce the law as it should be, and as the parliamentarians in this House thought it would be. I think that the Liberals should start to seriously reflect on this. Perhaps this explains their problems in Quebec. They are completely disconnected from the way Quebeckers think.</div>

It is a basic principle in public life. As I mentioned before, a man who does not wish to be arrested by a female officer is denying this right. Religion is of no consequence in a public space. The police officer, whether male or female, has the same responsibilities, the same obligations and the same rights under the law. The same principle is true for elections. In addition, I repeat, this has never been an issue for the Muslim community. We had testimony in this regard from several witnesses, including members of the Muslim Canadian Congress.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the answer to the member's remark and question is very clear. Here we see the legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a view of society that is outdated in several respects. In fact, citizenship issues have been clarified over the years. In this regard, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, although incomplete, uses a much more modern approach to the integration of newcomers than that of multiculturalism, which has led to problems not only in Canada and Quebec, but also in Great Britain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be time to wake up and realize not only that public spaces must respect rights and values in a manner that is equitable for all individuals but also that public spaces are secular spaces.</div>

The problem is that there is no problem. He just told us that in the Quebec general election a grand total of four people showed up wearing veils and they were dealt with under the existing law. Where is the problem? </div>
    </p><a name="Para768981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that we are going to correct the situation. What situation? There is no situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that we are being asked to pass a law that is entirely unnecessary. It makes no sense. It was not a problem during the Ontario general election, which has exactly the same rules. It was not a problem during the Quebec general election nor during the Quebec byelections. We do not have a problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a method of dealing with it. We ask for pieces of identification, which do not need to be photo ID. We ask, in case of doubt, that people take an oath that they are who they are and they will suffer the penalties if they are not who they are supposed to be. We are not here to pass unnecessary legislation where there is no problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse than that, we are not here to pass coded legislation, legislation that singles out only one group. People often use the phrase “the veiled voting bill” as opposed to the visual identification bill or whatever other Orwellian phrase we are currently using.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is singling out a specific group of people, Muslim women, who are not part of a problem, who have not asked for this and who are now being asked to say that even though they did not ask for it, they will go along because they want to go along. Why should any group of innocent people in Canadian society who are being singled out for a non-problem be asked to swallow themselves whole simply to get along? What we want is for everyone to participate in society as full members, certainly for newcomers, including Muslim women, veiled or unveiled.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, there are real problems. One real problem is being addressed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, which is leaving a million people off the voters lists. That strikes me as a bit of a problem and yet we are investing all of this energy in a non-problem that has the sideswiping effect for a group of innocent women in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para768987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a totally ridiculous bill and it is, of course, completely illogical. People can vote by a postal vote and there is no problem at all. People can vote stark naked. They can vote with a blanket over their heads. They can vote under water blowing bubbles as long as they do not get water on the paper. They can do all of that and there is no connection with visual identification. We cannot insist that every Canadian needs to have photo ID because there is no photo ID that all Canadians are required to have.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78587,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78587&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Don Valley East</A>, who has much to say on this point.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we cannot insist that all Canadian citizens have a driver's licence or any other standard visual identification, there is no connection between showing one's face and the forms of ID that are available to people. People may as well be told to show their left foot or their belly button. None of them make any sense. We are not here to promulgate laws that are unnecessary nor are we here to deal with illogicality and a lack of principle.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if we want to get into the general oddity of this bill, there is what I call the English patient clause. For those who saw the film <i>The English Patient</i>, they will remember the guy lying in his little villa covered with bandages. Apparently, we are worried about him. There are four references to <i>The English Patient</i> in the bill. One is “bandaged people”. Bandaged people will not be treated like anybody else. There will be discrimination between people who are bandaged and those who are not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para768993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bandaged people will need to produce a piece of ID saying that they really need the bandage. One has a sort of strange image of people getting off their deathbeds, crawling out from their Italian villas, like in <i>The English Patient</i>, and casting their vote. However, it does not treat all voters the same, so why do we have <i>The English Patient</i> exception and yet we go on about this other non-problem? </div>

    </p><a name="Para769011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my esteemed colleague from Don Valley West has said, this is a flawed bill. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects the rights of an individual to freely practise his or her religion without interference from the state. Regretfully, the Conservatives are proposing legislation that not only will divide Canadians, but also targets a religious minority for no other reason but to pander to the politics of fear and ignorance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are showing their disdain for rights and freedoms, and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act</A>, is a flawed piece of legislation. It represents a knee-jerk reaction that would require Muslim women to unveil their niqab or burka for the purpose of visual identification at the ballot box.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians could be forgiven for thinking veiled Muslim women pose an urgent threat to the integrity of our electoral system, and therefore it appears that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has made it one of his priorities to force voters to show their faces at the polls. But is there any shred of evidence that such a problem existed in the first place? The Conservative government has admitted there was no apparent case of fraud in three federal byelections that were held in September in Quebec when unjustified hysteria over veiled Muslim women first boiled over. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is it that the Conservatives are trying to fix? If a problem does not exist, what are they trying to fix? I think what they are trying to fix is that “if you do not look like me or act like me, then you are a problem”. I think that is really unfair to a large population of over a million people who have been law-abiding citizens, who have voted and who have never faced discrimination of the nature that they are seeing at the moment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation was not crafted in response to any incident involving fraud. Rather, it is irrational and hysterical. If a problem did exist, why did the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> not include these provisions in the electoral bill that was passed by the House less than six months ago?</div>
    </p><a name="Para769016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have tried to dress up this bill as a means to enhancing public confidence in the democratic process. But it has nothing to do with electoral integrity and everything to do with pandering to the narrow-minded fears about minorities, particularly in Quebec, where this troubling debate over reasonable accommodation is now raging.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if there is a requirement for visual identification? At the moment visual identification is not required by law in a federal election. In fact, Canadians have the option in this country to vote by postal ballot, where no identification is required, yet the Conservative government firmly believes that veiled Muslim women are a threat. I challenge any member of the House to document one single incident of electoral fraud in Canada that was committed by a veiled Muslim woman.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canada's Chief Electoral Officer has pointed out, over 80,000 Canadians voted in the last federal election through the postal system and none of them were required to provide photo identification. Why? Because the law does not require it. These people are snowbirds and other Canadians who are out of the country during a federal election. Should we therefore disenfranchise 80,000 Canadians based on irrational fear?</div>
    </p><a name="Para769019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may interest members to know that Muslim women currently serving in the Canadian Forces are permitted to wear a hijab on duty. Is the government therefore trying to say to Muslim women that it is okay to serve on the front lines of the Canadian military, but it is not okay for them to wear a veil when they vote?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045">(1045)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forces wants to recruit more Muslim women because we desperately need them. We are in Afghanistan, and really, the Conservatives have no idea of what they are doing there. They do not even know what pluralism or diversity means, so what is the message the Conservatives are trying to convey? Is the government trying to uphold the rights of only certain citizens and succumbing to fear and sudden whims that pose no threats? As parliamentarians, we are elected to represent our constituency, and I feel obligated to resist policies that are made on irrational impulses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are elected to look at and consider legislation. If it is based on reasoning and rational thought, then we approve it. On this occasion, the bill as it currently reads unfairly targets a religious minority. Also, not only is it contrary to my beliefs, but more important, it is contrary to the law as it currently exists.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would strongly urge the government to reconsider this legislation and reflect on its responsibility to uphold democratic rights in the country. Considering how flawed the bill is and considering that it is targeting only one community, it is important that it be tightened up, the flaws reviewed and the bill not passed, because it will never pass the charter challenge. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is another example of the Conservatives' agenda of divisiveness and discrimination against one group. There are glaring inconsistencies and this is shamefully playing cheap politics at the expense of Canadian Muslims. It will not achieve anything. It will not achieve its stated goal of improving visual identification except in wanting one group to lift its veil. Really, it is a veiled attempt at discrimination against one group.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that committee, we heard from a number of representatives from the Muslim community, and every single one of those who represented numerous communities across this country were absolutely ashamed of this becoming a race issue. The revealing of faces is not a religious issue; it is a custom. They were appalled at any insinuation that this had anything to do with race.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have the member stand in this House and suggest that anyone else's comments besides her own are dividing this nation is absolutely rejected. It is shameful. The Muslim community wants this legislation. This legislation was debated. Witnesses were heard. The members opposite were completely in favour of this legislation at the time.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had counted the words in that speech in order to mention the number of times the member is wrong and how she should be ashamed of making this into a race issue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, as a Muslim woman, take pride in whatever garb I wear. I do not wear the hijab or the niqab. That is not the issue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been quite articulate in her positions, but the Liberal Party was very clear at committee, or at least the leader was very clear, that the Liberals wanted this.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I have a question for the member. Is this her position on the matter or is it her leader's position? If it is her leader's position, then I have a follow-up question: why has he changed his position on this? We have seen consistent flip-flops on this. Is this a stalling tactic?

The Liberal Party believes in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it will uphold the Charter of Rights and Freedoms whether one is a veiled woman or not a veiled woman or whether one is white, purple, pink or black, because that is what the charter states.

    </p><a name="Para769039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these early hours of this debate here in the House of Commons, the whole issue surrounding this bill is a very emotional one. I see that my colleague who spoke this morning and gave a speech filled with emotion is now leaving the House. I can see this is a very emotional issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to begin by saying that I have a great deal of difficulty, after hearing the first comments by the Liberals, in understanding the Liberal Party's position today in this House. As recently as September 7 of this year, the Liberal Party of Canada was calling for amendments to the act. It called on the Chief Electoral Officer to take action and to reverse the decision he made concerning voting in the byelections that were to take place on September 17 in Quebec. Indeed, it is hard to understand today's statements by the Liberals on this matter, when we heard the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">leader of the Liberal Party</A> stating the opposite on September 7.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the debate here is not new. We must remember that it is part of the debate that has been taking place in Quebec in the context of two recent votes. I think first of the byelection that confirmed the election of Pauline Marois. As it happens, while the issue of veiled women voting was not at the heart of the campaign it certainly was raised during that byelection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also recall that this debate was also raised during the September 17 byelections in Quebec. As a matter of fact, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada announced that women wearing veils could vote in the next federal election and in the Quebec byelections on September 17 without being required to uncover their faces. The following day, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party—I emphasize that—and the Bloc Québécois intervened, calling on the Chief Electoral Officer to reverse that decision. Later, naturally after some pussyfooting and hesitation, the leader of the NDP thought better of it and also demanded that the Chief Electoral Officer's opinion be reviewed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result is that we are now considering Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> which seeks to amend the Canada Elections Act to require male and female voters to have uncovered faces when voting or registering to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the bill before us today includes some exceptions, one of which involves allowing voters to keep their faces covered for health reasons, but only on the condition, of course, that two pieces of identification be presented.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, certain exceptions would determine under what circumstances—and these are the cases for which the law provides flexibility—a voter must uncover his or her face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that this kind of debate has already been raised this year, when we amended the Canada Elections Act in order to be able to confirm the identity of voters. As I recall, we thought that the problems raised in the context of the two byelections—especially the one on September 17—had been resolved by that amendment. However, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which we examined clause-by-clause in February 2007, made it mandatory for voters to produce photo identification in order to vote.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100">(1100)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it seemed sufficiently clear that voters were obliged to prove their identity. Fundamentally, that is the spirit of this bill. It is not a racial question, as some members have said here today. Rather, it is a question of verifying the identity of voters. At the time, we thought that amending the Canada Elections Act through Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was enough to clarify the situation regarding voter identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House, however, that the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada refused to use his special authority to require all voters to uncover their faces in order to vote. The Bloc Québécois would like to see that legislation amended as quickly as possible. This is why my hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78419,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78419&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord</A> introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075666,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075666&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-465</A>, to amend the Canada Elections Act: in order to ensure that voters vote with their faces uncovered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that this accommodation, which would allow certain voters to keep their face covered while voting, is not the sort of reasonable accommodation called for by the Muslim community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember that, during an interview on Radio-Canada on September 10, 2007, Ms. Asmaa Ibnouzahir said that Muslim women had decided themselves to take the initiative and unveil their faces because they thought it was a normal thing to do so as a security matter, just as they do at the customs or the passport office. The Muslim community itself, therefore, as represented by Présence musulmane Montréal—an organization that is quite representative of the community—said that these women had been voting for years and had never asked for special treatment, although they knew they had the right to do so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no demand or request for this kind of accommodation, which would mean that women would not need to uncover their face. That is why we need to act as quickly as possible. Is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> perfect? No, it is not, but it has the advantage of dealing with the situation in principle, in view of the fact that the Chief Electoral Officer refuses to use his powers under the Elections Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the imperfections in Bill C-6? We think that it does not abide by the principle of equality between men and women. Under the first five clauses in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, deputy returning officers and poll clerks can delegate their powers to another person. Under this provision, a male deputy returning officer could therefore accommodate a female elector by designating a woman before whom the elector could uncover her face to confirm her identity. This is totally unacceptable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as if citizens of Arab or Muslim origin came into my riding office but refused to be served by my assistant because she is a woman. I would tell these people that my assistant is perfectly competent and is there to serve the citizens. There is no possible doubt in this case that the equality of men and women is a basic right. I fail to see why this principle of the basic equality of men and women cannot be upheld in the bill. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will finish by saying this is clearly an emotional debate. It is a debate that we need, though, because of our responsibility for democracy. We need to find the right balance in our ability to accommodate people. It is important to be able to identify people when they exercise their voting rights. Of course there can be some exceptions for medical reasons, but in general, we should ensure that when a citizen comes to a polling station, he or she must address the deputy returning officers or poll clerks who are there, regardless of whether they are men or women, and identify himself or herself, in accordance with the legislation that we are trying to amend today. </div>

    </p><a name="Para769057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that we might have expected some minimum of consistency this morning here in the House. I say this very humbly and without wishing to play political games. We can support this bill in principle. As I said, the bill is not perfect. It is certainly subject to being amended in committee. However, on the principle of the bill, we must be in favour, because there is a virtual consensus, apart from the NDP flip-flopping, having changed its mind on its position. It seems to me that we had a degree of consensus among the opposition parties, and that the Liberal Party was in agreement at that point. Now I am finding it difficult to explain the first speeches by the Liberal Party.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he insists that there is no racial element in this entire matter. And yet the next minute he is talking about this bill concerning voting with one’s face covered. That is not the title of the bill, but that is what he is talking about. What is being referred to when he says voting with one’s face covered? Is it women who belong to religious orders? I do not think so. It is in fact a group: Muslim women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also ask him to make a logical connection for me between visual identification and the fact that in Canada we cannot insist that everyone have a piece of photo ID. Given that fact, why insist on people uncovering their faces? If it is not mandatory to have a piece of visual identification with a photograph, why compare that to a face? There is no logical connection, and so that is the question I am asking him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I would ask that he think a little about the distinction between passports, which people must have in order to cross borders, and the right to vote. It is a choice to get a passport and leave the country, but we have the right to vote as Canadian citizens and there is still no mandatory piece of photo ID.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to conclude, I would ask him what the problem is, and how many incidents this bill will resolve? Instead of answering, we get told about principles. What are these principles? There is no problem, and so there is no need to have this bill.</div>

We cannot have people going to polling stations wearing veils, whether they are Muslim or not. Showing one's face is the simplest way of identifying one's self.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague is in fact proving that it might be time for us to have elector ID cards. That might be the way to resolve much of this problem. As far as passports and crossing borders are concerned, I did not give that example; Présence Musulmane Montréal did during an interview on September 10. Let me say again to the hon. member: Muslims have never asked for special treatment even though they know they have the right to do so. They have taken the initiative to uncover their faces because they thought it was perfectly normal to do so as a matter of security. They do so at the border and at the passport office. It was not a member of Parliament who said that; it was Présence Musulmane Montréal.</div>

Some people are even trying to give it a racial slant. During the last election, I was in Saint-Hyacinthe, where several people were wearing veils and others were wearing grocery bags on their head. It was absolutely despicable because people were abusing the situation and even sharing bags. I think this goes against the purpose of one person one vote.

    </p><a name="Para769068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member's example was the same as one I mentioned before. A voter who arrives more or less disguised at the polling station must identify themselves, as must any Muslim woman who wears a veil. It is purely a matter of identifying the voter. My colleague is right; there are even precedents in Morocco where some accommodations can be made. However, when a citizen appears before a deputy returning officer, he or she must be able to identify the voter. This is the purpose of the act, a principle which the Liberal Party should support this morning.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we debate various legislative proposals in the House, we are most often dealing with what we would describe as the “what” question. What is the bill designed to do? What does it change? What does it replace in terms of current law? However, I must confess, like many of my colleagues in the House, that I am asking the “why” question when it comes to the Conservative government's Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. Why has the government brought forward this legislation and why at this time?</div>
    </p><a name="Para769078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, one could ask whether there is a pressing and widespread problem with respect to the integrity of the voting process in regard to women who choose, for religious reasons, to wear a veil. Quite frankly, this is simply not the case. If it were not for the fact that some politicians have raised this issue, I am not sure it would have materialized as a major concern for Canadians, their elected representatives or observers in the political arena in our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read with interest a quotation from the head of the Islamic Association of Nova Scotia, who said of this issue:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not dwell too much upon the possible reasons for the government to bring forward Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, but let us consider the normal motivation for legislative initiatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary and appropriate motivation is based upon a sound and pressing policy requirement. In other words, the introduction of a piece of law is based upon sound public policy and the greater good of our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and less acceptable motivation is for political purposes. In view of the fact that this issue is not of concern to Elections Canada and was not clearly in need of urgent remedial action, I can only leave members of the House to draw their own conclusions in regard to what has motivated the government to introduce Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe a number of my colleagues have already raised the issue of mail-in ballots in regard to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. While the government seems preoccupied with respect to the issue of veiled women having to remove their veils in voting stations, it seems to be perfectly comfortable with the concept of mail-in ballots.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 2006 federal election there were approximately 80,000 mail-in ballots. Obviously it is, by very definition and practice, not possible to visually confirm the identification of a voter using a mail-in ballot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> and current election law do not even require the presentation of photographic identification for the purpose of casting a ballot in a federal general election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practical terms then, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> could create a scenario where veiled voters are required to unveil themselves after having presented several pieces of non-photographic identification.

The practical realities of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> are simply absurd.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also take note of the fact that in nations like the United Kingdom there has been talk of addressing voter turnout issues by permitting voting over the Internet. Clearly, the future will likely include the use of such tools to facilitate easier voting by citizens in Canada. When and if this comes to Canada, it will only further relegate to insignificance legislation like Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>.</div>

We have only to look to the termination of the court challenges program or the government's opposition to the equal treatment of gays and lesbians as examples of its approach to governing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reality is this is a non-issue that the government has whipped up into tempest for its own narrow and limited political objectives. If the government wanted to address real issues facing our country in terms of elections, it could look to ways of addressing very serious concerns like ever shrinking voter turnout at election time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In federal elections we are averaging only 66% voter turnout. At the provincial and municipal levels of government it is even worse, where turnout levels are in the 50% and 25% ranges, respectively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, there is need to reform our electoral system to encourage more Canadians to vote, not to find or create situations that discourage voting. Simply put, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> is another example of the government's pattern of targeting specific groups of Canadians. It is just not appropriate or fair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of simply aiming laws like Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> at one particular group in our country, we should be embarking upon a thorough and comprehensive review of our electoral system. We need to look at broad based issues. This could include the issue of photographic identification. Is it something we should require? Is it practical?</div>
    </p><a name="Para769099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that current law, as noted before, does not require photographic identification. This is something we can look at in the context of a comprehensive review of voting regulations. Similarly, there are other means of voting that we need to look at in order to encourage Canadians to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an aging population that finds it increasingly more difficult to vote. As the number of older Canadians grow, there are real challenges to their ability to exercise their right to vote at polling stations. This is especially true during winter campaigns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are some processes available to allow people in these situations to vote, they are cumbersome and act in reality as a deterrent to voting. Likewise, many Canadians travel during winter months and in winter elections may not have the opportunity to exercise their right to vote at polling stations. Again, while there are mail-in ballots, we should look at the process to determine how it might be made easier for overseas Canadians to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major and ever increasing issue is that of apathy found among young Canadians in exercising their right to vote. These Canadians are the future of our country. What can we do to encourage them to vote?</div>
    </p><a name="Para769103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to address issues like these because they are issues of substance. They speak to the heart of the issues facing our electoral system. Instead of playing political games with issues like those found in connection with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, we should be looking to address these real and pressing concerns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charter of Rights and Freedoms is a compelling document. However, it is not only a document; it is the spirit of our country. It is the expression of the values we hold dear to our hearts as citizens of our great country. It is also something the government finds an inconvenience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charter of Rights and Freedoms speaks to our equality and the right to the free expression of our religious beliefs. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, in essence, is looking upon the issue as some kind of cultural matter. The use of the veil is not cultural. It is an expression for Muslim women of their religious beliefs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the fact that the current election law does not require photographic identification, in view of the fact that mail-in ballots are permitted by the election law, in view of the fact that this issue has not been raised by the Muslim community that it directly affects and in view of the fact that voters can simply vote using a utility bill or a bank statement, why is the government raising this issue?</div>
    </p><a name="Para769107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really my original question once again. Why? The government needs to answer this question truthfully. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the great philosopher Aristotle who said, “Democracy arises out of the notion that those who are equal in any respect are equal in all respects”.

    </p><a name="Para769110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe it was the chief electoral officer who insisted that this be done and it is about the integrity of democracy and of the vote. Therefore, I do not understand why the member would not want to see this go through and be settled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals are making this into a cultural or religious issue but it has nothing to do with that. It is asking for visual identification to get a ballot. That is all it is. It was not an issue until the Liberals made it an issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am trying to think of all the things that come up on an election night. Perhaps, as the member from the Bloc tried to stress, these kinds of things become an issue on election night when these people do not have a great deal of time to seek out some sort of guidance on this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member is trying to make a religious issue out of this, then perhaps he should go back to the people who he is saying are affected. They have already said to the committee that they are not affected by this legislation and that they would be glad to take off their veils. They are not unhappy about it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties at the procedure and House affairs committee agreed to have this legislation for the integrity of the voting system. Therefore, why not just pass the bill. It does not sound like it will hurt anyone or cause any problems throughout the Muslim communities. This has nothing to do with just religion or culture. It has more to do with showing ID at the polls.</div>

It is quite important for the integrity of the system that there be proper identification when people are casting a ballot. I have argued, in fact, for photo identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the government, in its haste, has brought a series of laws into the House without carefully looking at all the ramifications. A case in point was the law it put into place that looked at voter identification and missed out a piece of it, and several other pieces were also missing that are very important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised in my debate the fact that one can show a phone bill, which has no photo ID, and cast a ballot. My deepest fear and concern about this specific legislation is that it appears more and more to be targeting one group and omitting all the other issues that are equally important to the whole process of voting in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if the government wants to table legislation that reviews the whole system of how we vote, how to get more voter participation and how to bring in a photo ID card system for every Canadian who casts a ballot, I am willing to look at that and study that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769119"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no. What the government has decided to do is target, and it is really targeting, one specific group. It cannot deny the fact that it is targeting one group, and that is what I find most offensive about this law.</div>

However, I would like to explain to the House my concerns about this legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. parliamentary secretary said that it will not hurt anyone. She may be right but I am concerned that we are on a slippery slope here. We do one little thing, which the member says is not targeting, but I believe it is targeting. Catholics and Hindus do not wear burkas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure the legislation intentionally targets anyone. However, since 9/11, the Muslim community has been extremely patient. They have been targeted at borders and targeted by police. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourteen members of a food security company, which was doing testing for the government, needed RCMP clearance. They were all immigrants. It took about four months longer to process the security clearance for the only Muslim in the group, Dr. Eshaq Shishani. To me the reason was fairly obvious. It was because he was a Muslim. He was stopped by the police one night. They opened the trunk of his car and found some documents on food radiation. Food radiation is a scientific process being done in the lab. Since the documents concerned radiation, the police officers handcuffed Dr. Shishani, strip-searched him and threw him in jail. He was allowed to wander home the next day with no apology being given. Can anyone tell me that is not targeting? </div>
    </p><a name="Para769131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just concerned that we continue to go on thoughtlessly without really considering how these people are feeling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard so much debate on burkas. Other women have said that Muslim women should not wear burkas because it is the subjugation women. I thought being an independent woman was about having a choice, a choice to be a cookie baker, a choice to be a member of Parliament or a choice to wear a burka without condemnation and criticism. It is not a matter of saying who is right and who is wrong. We do too much of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious school funding was an issue during the last provincial election campaign. Who was targeted in Ontario? Who did the newspapers show as wanting this religious school funding? It was the Muslim schools. It was non-white schools. It was the Sikhs. News reports would do a little clip on religious rights or on Jewish schools but the target was fear and it was using the Muslim community and its schools as a weapon.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier: </B>The news did that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that oftentimes we do things because we think we are going to curry favour with ethnic groups. I do not believe that Christmas trees should be taken down at Christmastime. When I send a Christmas card, it should say Merry Christmas. As a matter of fact, a Muslim imam once said to me that I was the only politician who sends him a Christmas card that says Merry Christmas. I asked him if he was offended by that and he said no. He said that if people cannot respect their own religion and customs, how could he expect them to respect his. I have learned much from the Muslim community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now learned that “jihad” is a dirty word. It is a word that means terror, death and vengeance. However, it is not. Jihad is a holy war within oneself and yet we continue to misuse this word, which is a very precious word to Muslims, and we use it in such a negative way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the Muslims have been targeted. I do not really see what the big deal is about four women in Quebec wearing burkas. If I can go in and not have proof that I am a Canadian citizen and I can take an oath, why can they not take an oath to say who they are? </div>
    </p><a name="Para769139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may be wrong but, and this is from my heart and soul, I believe this. I have watched many of these people stand with dignity while they were being put down and I am afraid this is just another example of that. </div>

However, as a whole, she and her party are going places that are really unnecessary. This is really about the integrity of democracy. If people are allowed to vote with covered faces, then how do we ensure the integrity of the identifying of voters. This is only about identifying voters. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are really good stories about going through airports and being targeted but that is another issue in another debate. This is just about fixing a little glitch in the Elections Act. It has nothing to do with targeting voters or whatever. If we were going there, then we would have a lot of bigger issues. It certainly has nothing to do with that and I am sorry that is what it is being made into. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot imagine people listening to this today and even listening about the religious schools funding and the way the media, as she says, handled it. That issue is with the media and I would quickly take her debate out there and talk to the media. It has done a disservice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think she has good intent and really believes what she said but she needs to look at the big picture. This is about voting from coast to coast across Canada. It is about showing identification. We need to fix it. The chief electoral office must have had a reason for asking that it be fixed. It cannot just be put on hold. We need to do it now before it becomes an issue, before voters decide to show up in any sort of disguise at the voters' booths. Those things are not easy to deal with on election night, as I tried to express. What we are trying to do is avoid all these problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We just went through an election in Saskatchewan, so we know what it can be like. My daughter had to find two pieces of ID when she was a university student. She had to find a place to vote. It was not easy. She needed the ID.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what we are trying to do is prevent a lot of problems on election night and we do not want to make it into a cultural issue or a targeted group issue.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sincerely do not believe that anyone believes they are targeting another group.

    </p><a name="Para769148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This applies to so few people. With the problems we have on voting day with the lists with duplicate names at same addresses, this presents more of a likelihood of fraud, and fraud in large numbers, than something like a burka or having a bandaged face.</div>

Accordingly, I have decided that I should speak on this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As politicians who have to face the electorate, we always state that the right to vote is not only a right, but should also be an obligation. So it works both ways. From that statement it follows that we must be able to establish the identity of the people who come to vote and to express their democratic choice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard many comments. They all came back to the fact that one could—at least, that is how it appeared to me—attack some segment of the population. In other words, the comments were discriminatory in some respect, which should not be the case. To exercise the right to vote, one must at least be capable of satisfactorily proving one's identity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would, perhaps, be interesting to look at the chronology of the events concerning voting with the face covered. We have gone through a similar situation in Quebec. Let us start at the beginning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 22, 2007 the chief electoral officer of Quebec confirmed that women wearing veils could vote in the provincial election on March 26, even if they refused to uncover their face. Radio program hosts launched a campaign to persuade voters to go and vote with their face covered as a protest against the decision of the chief electoral officer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 23, confronted with a public outcry and the possibility of seeing the election turn into a masked ball, the chief electoral officer of Quebec changed the electoral act: all voters would have to have their face uncovered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 19, the members of the House of Commons adopted Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> to amend the Canada Elections Act. The bill provides for a photo identification procedure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 6, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada announced that women wearing veils could vote in the next federal election and in the September 17 byelections in Quebec without being required to uncover their face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 7, the Liberal party, the Conservative party and the Bloc Québécois called on the Chief Electoral Officer to reverse his decision. The Muslim community of Montreal also expressed its disagreement with the new policy. The following day, of course, the New Democratic party reconsidered and demanded that the position of the Chief Electoral Officer be reviewed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 10, at a news conference, Marc Mayrand, the Chief Electoral Officer, stated that he had no intention of using his exceptional power to reverse the situation before the September 17 byelections. On that date, at least four women voted in the byelection in Outremont wearing a burka, to show their disagreement with the Chief Electoral Officer. One man, in a wheelchair, voted wearing a balaclava.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 17, in his Speech from the Throne, the Conservative government gave notice of its intention to introduce a bill prohibiting electors from voting with their face covered. On October 23, as we had already announced, the Bloc Québécois introduced a bill to prohibit people from voting with their face veiled. On October 26, the Conservative government came up with a bill to prohibit anyone from voting in an election with his or her face covered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Bloc Québécois supports this bill in principle. However, we feel that there are certain provisions which, while not absurd, will have to be reviewed and probably amended. We are finding that the bill introduced by the government does not fully reflect the principle that all are equal before the law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the bill opens the door to violations of the principle of equality between men and women. The first five clauses of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> were included to allow deputy returning officers and poll clerks to delegate their powers to another individual. This means that a male deputy returning officer could accommodate a female voter by designating a woman in front of whom she could uncover her face to confirm her identity. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150">(1150)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois feels that this is unacceptable. We will, of course, support the bill at second reading, but we will demand that the first five clauses be repealed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also includes some exceptions. For example, a person who must keep his or her face covered for medical reasons could still vote by providing two authorized pieces of identification and by taking an oath. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> also adds new provisions to the act that allow returning officers to appoint additional persons in polling stations, and to also delegate some of their responsibilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, I heard some very strange comments, primarily from Liberal members, who said that this is a witch hunt, that we do not have the right to prohibit people from voting with their face covered, and that we were directly targeting a community. In fact, our position is based on the very principle of democracy, on the right to vote, and on the need to make it practically impossible to use someone else's identity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, it would have been unthinkable for any voter to show up with their face veiled or otherwise covered, preventing their identification. Now, in a specific context where there is much discussion everywhere about reasonable accommodations, a common knee jerk reaction in some people is to often use certain pretexts to find fault with those who wear a veil or cover their faces otherwise. In Roberval, a veiled woman showed up and voted. We are not necessarily talking about a burka here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes to show how the door can be opened for individuals who are probably looking to make a mockery of the whole situation and to demonstrate that it is possible to vote without proper identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was quite surprised by the Liberals' reaction, especially given what the leader of the Liberal Party had said. The <i>Canadian Press</i> quoted him on September 9 as saying, “We disagree with Elections Canada decision and we ask them to revisit their decision. At the end of the day, you must be able to identify yourself when you vote”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Liberal leader who said that. Later, he stated that, on the one hand, he disagreed with Elections Canada's decision not to reconsider the issue of uncovered faces but that, on the other hand, he might be able to live with the provisions of the existing legislation. This means that, at one time, all political leaders in this House were singing the same tune, saying that identification was necessary to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several principles guide the Bloc Québécois' position on this issue. As I said earlier, the Bloc Québécois supports the bill. All voters should be equal before the law. I also indicated that, in 2007, the lawmaker amended the Elections Act to tighten the requirements with respect to voter identification. Among other things, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which was passed by the House of Commons in February 2007, no longer allowed people to vouch for more than one elector and required photo ID to be able to vote.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois and the other political parties believed that the Elections Act was clear enough and that by requiring voters to prove their identity, it was implicitly requiring them to uncover their faces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because the Chief Electoral Officer refused to use his exceptional power to require that all voters uncover their faces, the Bloc Québécois believes that the act needs to be amended as soon as possible, as we are doing. That is why we introduced our own bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that groups representing Muslim women assert that they have never asked to be accommodated in this regard. In an interview with Radio-Canada, Asmaa Ibnouzahir of Présence musulmane Montréal said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para769177"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>These women have been voting for years, and they have never asked for special treatment, even though they know they could. They themselves took the initiative to show their faces, just as they do at customs or the passport office, because they believed it made sense for security reasons. So for them, it is perfectly natural to uncover their faces.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para769178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this quote is enough to put an end to the debate about the requirement to uncover one's face when voting. I therefore ask the Liberal Party to reconsider its position and face facts: in the interests of democracy, people must vote with their faces uncovered. </div>

    </p><a name="Para769184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking that question, she is opening a door, because it takes me back several elections. Although no one has ever really wanted to admit it, it was a time when people had become experts at identity theft in an attempt to win additional votes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people can vote with their faces covered and their identity cannot be proven, obviously all sorts of things can happen. In a democracy, these sorts of things must be avoided as much as possible. Every effort must be made to prevent people who do not qualify to vote from voting. These people might have been able to cover their faces in order to vote for someone else.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the principle that is driving me. At no time have I thought of religious considerations. I am thinking only of democratic considerations. Voters must uncover their faces, and election officials must be able to correctly identify voters, who are not only exercising their right to vote, but also doing their duty as responsible individuals and, in so doing, are participating appropriately in the political process, with their faces uncovered.</div>

It is important for me to put things in context as to how this bill came about and why we are debating it here today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all started in the last session with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, the integrity of voters, in which we debated at committee and in this place on the plans for the government to introduce legislation that would require voters to produce identification before voting at a polling station in their riding. This was something that was unique. Prior to the bill being passed there were no requirements for visual identification or identification of other sorts prior to voting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to make sure that we took appropriate steps to ensure that there would be no voter fraud at any election in the future because we had heard many times from many sources information suggesting that there had been perhaps isolated incidents, but incidents nonetheless, of individuals fraudulently casting ballots in federal elections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at committee we heard several examples of how this could occur. Very simply it could occur because someone who wished to impersonate or fraudulently vote in an election could pick up a voter identification card. These are the cards that are sent out to Canadians by Canada Post with their name and address indicating that they are to vote at a certain polling station or certain location in their riding. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an example what would happen in some cases. These voter cards would be sent to apartments and many apartment residents might see it in their post office box, pick it up and just discard it in the garbage bin located in the foyer or their mail box location within their apartment complex. Some individuals then could literally go and take one of these voter cards, walk to the appropriate station on voting day, identify themselves as the person whose name appeared on the voting card, get a ballot and vote. Of course, that is fraud and we want to prevent that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had other identified cases in committee where one voter might get three or four voting cards. How would that happen? Simply someone may be named “John Doe” and at another address such as a business location might be named “Johnathan Doe”, or maybe “J.D. Doe”. So there are cases in which the same individual might be listed multiple times and that individual, should he or she wish to do so, would have the ability to go to different polling stations within his or her riding with these various voting cards and say “I am this person”, and then vote multiple times.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to take steps to ensure the integrity of the voting system and that was the genesis behind Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. When the legislation was drafted, it contained two provisions in terms of identification. One was that in order to be eligible to receive a ballot and cast a ballot, an individual would have to either show one government issued photo identified piece of identification such as a driver's licence or provide two pieces of identification that Elections Canada had prescribed, one of which would have the residential address on it and both of which would have the voter's name on it. Those two then would suffice and the individual would be able to receive a ballot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I want to inform all members of the House and all Canadians who may be watching that if people did not have proper identification, they still had the ability to get a ballot and cast a ballot by way of vouching. This quite simply was if someone came to a polling station and said “I live here, I am a resident of this riding, I want to vote and I would like a ballot”, but they did not have proper identification in one of the two prescribed forms that I just identified, they could get someone to vouch for them.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205">(1205)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, someone who was eligible to vote, who had proper identification and who lived in the same polling division would be able to say to the returning officer, “Yes, I know this person. This is the person who is who he says he is and he lives in this riding”. In that fashion that individual, without identification, would be able to cast a ballot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thought that this was an appropriate piece of legislation. It would sort of cover off all of the bases. It would ensure that there was integrity in the voting system, but at the same time it would place some requirements on voters to actually produce identification ensuring that the integrity within the voting system was paramount.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We debated this. We brought in witnesses. All committee members examined this bill very rigorously. We had officials from Elections Canada come in. We eventually passed this through committee I believe on June 20, 2007. It was later given rapid royal assent, which is unusual with some pieces of legislation in the Senate. I believe it received royal assent on June 22, 2007. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason we wanted to get this bill passed as quickly as we could, even though we gave it due diligence and we wanted to make it as expeditious as possible, is because as everyone knows in a minority government situation an election could occur at any time. Also, there were several byelections that were pending. We wanted to ensure that this bill was passed into law before any election took place, whether it be a general election or a byelection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in the fall of 2007 there were three byelections in Quebec and this bill was in effect. People were required to produce identification. After the election of the three new members of Parliament, Elections Canada then took a look at how this identification requirement worked and whether it was sufficient. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo and behold, Elections Canada found a glitch in the system because the bill contained the phrase “residential address”. In other words, proper identification required someone to produce ID that gave the name and residential address of the voter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Canadians, approximately a million across Canada, who reside primarily in rural ridings or rural portions of a riding at least, who do not have a “residential address”. They have addresses that are contained in the form of a post office box number or a rural route number or even perhaps a land description. Technically, the way Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was worded, those people would be ineligible to vote. Although they had an address, it was not considered to be a residential address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the government discovered that we wanted to take rapid action to correct it. Once again we could be on the cusp of a general election. Once again there are several byelections pending. We wanted to ensure that there was no disenfranchised voter in Canada because of this glitch in the legislation that we had passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we started a very rapid consultation process. I know I personally met with my democratic reform critics from the other parties with a suggested wording and a suggested change to correct this glitch in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. We also consulted with Elections Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, what we came up with was a very simple but yet very effective fix to the problem at hand. It is quite simply that anyone who can produce identification at a polling station, name and identification of course, and whose address on their identification was the same as the address on the voters list, regardless of whether it was a residential address or a non-residential address, then that individual would be eligible to vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, and I will use myself as an example because I would have been or I am currently I suppose, because this legislation has not yet passed this House, I am one of those disenfranchised voters. I live in a small community in Saskatchewan called Regina Beach. We all have civic addresses. I live at 308 Sunset Drive, yet no one has at home mail delivery. We have post office boxes. So on my identification it says P.O. Box 458, Regina Beach, Saskatchewan. Every single resident of Regina Beach has the same non-residential address, a P.O. box of some fashion and some number. </div>

However, by introducing Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, which we are speaking on today, the address I have on my identification is the same that appears on the voters list. Therefore, I would be able to get a ballot and vote. It is a very simple and effective fix. We feel this is something that, if all members in this assembly agree, could be passed quickly and I think we should.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have argued that it still does not deal with the entire problem and there still may be the odd person here or there who is disenfranchised or potentially could be disenfranchised. For example, if he or she moves into a community and does not have proper identification because the election was held within days of moving to a new location, the individual does not have a new driver's licence or any other identification that shows his or her new residential or non-residential address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we still have the ability, as in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, to vouch for individuals. If people are able to provide another person who is an eligible voter to vouch for them, they would be able to cast a ballot. I would suggest that in rural Canada this probably would be easier to do than it would be in urban Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. In urban Canada or larger cities, people come and go as houses are sold and new residents move in. It has been my experience that a lot of people in the larger cities do not know their neighbours well. Some do, but in many cases they are very insulated. They have a cocoon-like mentality. They go home at night, lock their doors and do not really notice what is happening around them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if voters in urban Canada or in a larger city have just moved into a new neighbourhood and do not have proper identification showing their new residential addresses, they may find it somewhat difficult to have someone vouch for them because their neighbours may not know who they are. That is usually not the case in rural Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can use my own small town as an example. If someone new moves into our community, it seems that within hours everyone in the community knows it. They know who the person is, where he or she came from, how many children there are and what the person does for a living.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Royal Galipeau: </b> What their favourite dessert is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Tom Lukiwski: </b> And what their favourite dessert is, that is right. That happens in rural Saskatchewan. It happens in rural Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the argument that this bill still does not quite capture all of the potential problems or glitches I think is something that has been captured by this vouching system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there ever be a system where absolutely, without question, 100% of individuals who live in this country and are eligible to vote will be able to cast a ballot unimpeded? I do not think so, but I think the chances are very remote that a lot of people will be in that situation. I think that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> and this new Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> will have captured the vast majority of people who are eligible to vote and who wish to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would strongly urge all of my colleagues to stand in this place and give this bill speedy passage. I know that none of us in this assembly want to disenfranchise anyone who lives in rural Canada because of something that was an error, something that was missed in the first piece of legislation, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak of that for just a moment, Canadians watching this debate may ask how this could have happened. How could this bill contain such an obvious error and omission and still get passed into law? I think that is a shared responsibility, quite frankly. It was simply something that was missed. When we were first discussing Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, the procedure and House affairs committee gave its unanimous consent to bring the bill forward to be presented as a piece of legislation and we just simply missed this. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215">(1215)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also had officials from Elections Canada come before the committee on two occasions to examine Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. They missed it. No one picked up on the fact that the term “residential address” might cause some problems for Canadians who had a non-residential address. Bill C-31 went through the whole legislative system, passed this place, passed through the Senate, was granted royal assent and became law. It was only after the fact that we found out there was a gap in the legislation. That is why we are taking swift action to rectify this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would certainly hope that individuals in this place would recognize that and pass this bill speedily and get it to the Senate, where I hope the other place treats it in a similar fashion and gives it speedy passage so that we can get royal assent for Bill C-18 prior to any impending election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point I should probably touch upon deals with the non-government issued photo ID requirements that I spoke of earlier. If hon. members recall, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> contained two provisions for identification. One is to produce a government-issued photo ID stating a person's name and address, such as a driver's licence. Also, if people do not have photo ID, they can give two other pieces of identification, both of which must have their name on it, but only one of which needs to have an address on it. Those pieces of identification come from a list approved by Elections Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would ask what kind of identification would be approved by Elections Canada. There are many pieces of identification that would suffice: student ID cards, hospital cards, library cards or even a government-issued cheque stub with a person's name and address on it. Those are the types of things that would be eligible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, because I know the NDP has questions about this and has problems with the fact that we are even asking Canadians to produce identification, what about people in homeless shelters? The NDP says that homeless people do not have identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we have attestation, whereby a manager, for example, or a supervisor at a homeless centre, could attest to the fact that a person is who she says she is and she resides in that homeless shelter which is part of that riding. We have even gone to those lengths to ensure that, not only for the homeless but for senior citizens who may reside in seniors' centres and who can be attested for by the supervisors or managers of those seniors centres if they do not have proper identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have done as much as we possibly could to ensure that there are no individuals disenfranchised, but also to respect the spirit of the original Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which is voter integrity to try to prevent voter fraud. The only way, in our estimation and in the estimation of the procedure and House affairs committee, to ensure that voter fraud is eliminated or at least curtailed as much as possible is to have identification presented at the time the individual goes to a polling station.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, I believe Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> and now Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> strike the proper balance between the ability of individuals to exercise their franchise and vote in federal elections and, on the other hand, the fact that we want to respect the integrity of the voting procedures and the voting system by ensuring there is no fraud in the voting system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in a nutshell, is the genesis of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> and it is why we introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> to try to correct that gap contained in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>.

It is now called <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3088135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3088135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bill C-16</A>, which used to be called <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2908681,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2908681&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bill C-55</A>, and is on expanded voter opportunities.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would point out one other flaw or misinterpretation the member is trying to foist upon members of this place. She said, quite correctly, that in committee the NDP voted against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, but it was not because NDP members identified the flaw of the residential address. NDP members voted against it strictly on the basis that they felt the homeless would be disenfranchised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak to that, but the NDP voted against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> not because, as some of the NDP members have tried to suggest, they discovered before the bill was passed that there was this flaw on residential addresses. Nothing of that sort occurred in conversations in the procedure and House affairs committee. Every single member missed this one gap, this one little glitch that eliminated or disenfranchised rural voters who did not have a residential address. I want to correct the record on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically on the question of the homeless, I spoke to that in my main address. We have taken great pains to try to make it as fair and as equitable as possible. Yes, many homeless, perhaps the vast majority of homeless, do not have proper identification. However, if they are members of or frequent attendees at a homeless centre, they can get the attestation, whereby the manager can say, “I verify this person's name and the fact that he or she resides in the centre”. Secondly, they do have the ability to have someone to vouch for their identity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would say, again as I mentioned in my main address, is there any legislation in this place which will ensure that absolutely, without question, 100% of eligible voters will be able to cast a ballot? Probably not. There probably never will be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have taken great steps to ensure a balance between the ability to ensure voter integrity and the ability of everyone who possibly can vote to do so.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only at that time that the Office of the Chief Electoral Officer, Monsieur Mayrand, had discovered that there was this gap. It was upon that discovery that we decided to take decisive action.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I can assure my hon. colleague and my friend that the first time I heard of it personally was in a phone call when I was back in my home riding. They had just received information from the Office of the Chief Electoral Officer that this gap had occurred. They had identified it. Within days I contacted my hon. colleague and the other democratic reform critics from the other opposition parties asking them to get together for a meeting to see if we could come up with the proper wording. Literally within days of that we had introduced the legislation we see before us today.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was this legislation not given priority over a number of other bills that have achieved headlines far and wide across the country?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might remind all members of the House and some on the other side of the lack of fanfare or even notice of the fact that we have a Charter of Rights, and that the Charter of Rights is celebrating its 25th anniversary. I, as a relatively young member of Parliament, am a child of the charter. The charter in section 3, and I bet if I had a quiz on the charter, people could not pick the section that guarantees this right, which is the basis upon which this debate should begin and end, the democratic right of citizens, states that every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein. It is a very short section. I actually counted the words. That section has the fewest words in the whole Charter of Rights, but it is so succinct.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it kind of interesting when we look at the democratic reform ethos of the Conservative government how it has been interpreted by the courts has largely been with respect to the rights of inmates and judges to vote. Who would have thought that those two groups would be put together in terms of rights?</div>
    </p><a name="Para769272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been significant court cases on whether inmates have the right to vote. People convicted of serious crimes are now determined by our courts to have the right to vote. So fundamental is this right, yet it would seem that the government, in its wisdom, by forging ahead with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>, might in effect be depriving a few unconvicted, uncharged citizens of this country who profess their religious beliefs of the right to vote, but inmates have the right to vote. I find that a curious turn of events given the government's very strong and strident support of an anti-crime agenda. The irony, of course, is quite delicious.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other irony in the theme of my discussion and how it is not a case where once again the government is showing real leadership on that white horse is that in fact the Senate of Canada, one of those institutions that the government does not seem to really support, did in fact during its deliberations on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> raise questions with respect to the qualification of voters, which as I indicated is guaranteed in the Charter of Rights. A group of senators reviewed the legislation, and let us remind ourselves that the other place has a duty to review legislation passed by the Commons. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78960,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78960&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> parliamentary secretary for democratic reform</A> in this House stand up and say, “Everybody missed it. Everybody in the Commons, all parties, missed it. It is just a big old mistake and a million people might not be able to vote. We are sorry. We put a whole bunch of bills ahead of this one because we care so much about those million voters in rural Canada who cannot vote. We are going to put a whole bunch of other bills ahead of this one and we are going to blame everybody equally.”</div>
    </p><a name="Para769275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so fast. Let us work backward. On June 27, the bill itself, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, received royal assent. Prior to that, in the month of May and before that time, the Senate of Canada was wrapping up its hearings. A number of questions were had of the Chief Electoral Officer at that time. Those questions went to identifying individuals who did not have addresses. The Chief Electoral Officer is another person who seems to be on the government's hit list. If we add it up, there are Muslim women and minority communities, the Senate of Canada, and now the Chief Electoral Officer. These are targets of the new government and its parliamentary secretaries, who wield such great power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend who spoke to this bill today should be very mindful that the Chief Electoral Officer offered solutions himself, which came up as a result of the Senate's verification and review of legislation. He wrote, “In light of comments that I have already received”--as a result of Senate hearings--“I am considering broadening the list”--and he referred to identification--“to include attestation letters that could be signed by a person of authority in homeless shelters and student residences. Such letters would establish the residence of the individual and constitute one of the two pieces of identification required under section 143(2)(b)”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also suggested there were problems, generally speaking, in ethnic communities with respect to voter turnout and verification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote to the questioner:</div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> You had also suggested that Elections Canada should advertise in ethnic media to communicate the requirements for voter identification to the electorate and, in particular, ethnocultural communities. As part of its commitment to communicate clearly with a variety of groups within the electorate, Elections Canada has sought to tailor the information provided to ethnocultural communities.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para769280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to describe what Elections Canada in fact had done in the ethnocultural communities and he talked about the attestation letters. The attestation letters prove the point that the Elections Canada officials are doing their job. The attestation letters were an afterthought as a result of the Senate hearings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have is the Chief Electoral Officer, mindful that this is the act under which he is empowered, attempting to accommodate the law as written as a result of a verification and review in the other place. As a result, attestation letters are now, in practice, what prevails for homeless people, people in student dorms and other such facilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would we not think that the question might be that in its thorough review of this legislation the government ought to have addressed the issue of attestation letters and made it, rather than a practice, the law? And would we not think that, and we may get to this when we send this to committee and correct it, in a thorough review, having had the experience of the byelections, the government would make it a priority to fix whatever flaws it had seen in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In effect, do members not think the minister responsible, who wanted quick and decisive action, and the parliamentary secretary, who lives in a semi-rural riding, might have thought it very important to review what was already on the books in terms of committee work, or does the world for the Conservative government and the officers of democratic reform for the government end when the bill is presented to the Senate? </div>
    </p><a name="Para769284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, not. I suggest that whatever happens in the Senate in the review of a bill is very much within the purview of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105837,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105837&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister for Democratic Reform</A>. If he were not so busy taking questions for the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and other people who are ducking issues, he would probably have time to do that. It also falls within the purview of the parliamentary secretary. He should have reviewed the work done by the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not here to defend the Senate on this item. I am here to defend the Chief Electoral Officer, who responded to a Senate inquiry. It is almost as if the democratic reform team over there did not exist. The real work was being done in the trenches by the Chief Electoral Officer and by serious senators who were involved in the review of the legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, it is very important for us to remember that the bill will, when taken to committee and fixed in a number of ways with the leadership that other members of the committee will offer to the bill, attempt to fix a problem that was actually created when it was decided we all must have forms of identification to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could be non-partisan for a minute, we have to realize that we made a change when we decided in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> that everybody had to show identification to vote. We owe it to ourselves to understand that in some countries this is the case and in others it is not. Clearly with respect to the over million rural voters, it effectively disenfranchised them. One has to ask the question we asked throughout the Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> debate. What was the problem before? Was there widespread abuse or fraud, concealment of identity or multiple voting in the rural ridings of Canada? I do not recall complaints made to Elections Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is like Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> where we do not have a single complaint to Elections Canada about voter fraud. We have the hums and ha's of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A>, who may have been driving by and saw people with pumpkins on their heads and somehow this became a very large issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have in this case is probably what will be the rub of the discussion. The serious rub of the discussion for members of Parliament is whether we will go to full identification, meaning photo identification. Countries in the democratic reform capacity not as sophisticated and not as developed as us have gone to that way. There are countries in west Africa that require photo identification to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have photo identification and a comparison against it, as said in legislation, to have a passport, which will allow us to enter other countries and to re-enter Canada. We have photo identification required by law by many provinces to have a driver's licence. We have photo identification requirements in many administrative and quasi-administrative instances in the country where government agencies are involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we want to take that bold grand leap toward photo identification for voting? It is a question with which we must all come to terms, be mature about and decide whether we want that. However, if we do not go there, if we do not jump in that large ocean, then we have to stay on the shore. There is no half-way on this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that whatever happened at Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, whatever happened in the Commons during the debate and in the Senate during its purview, with the poor Chief Electoral Officer trying to keep the middle ground, we have a situation where we are half wet. We have a situation where the first means of voting is to show one's picture ID, but the law does not say that the returning officer in charge has to compare one's face to the photo ID. It seems to be assumed that people would do that, but after all we are here to make law. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245">(1245)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not here to just to recount our personal experiences. We are not here to talk about pumpkins at polling stations. We are not here to talk about multiple votes without proof. We are not here to talk about the anecdotes. This is a serious place where laws are made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to have a debate, the debate should be that if we say photo ID is one way of proving people's ability to exercise their charter right to vote, then we should also say that the photo ID should be compared to people's faces, which requires people to show their face. The law does not say that. Worse, the law goes on to say that the person only has to produce, as a second means of voting, two pieces of ID which have an address on it. As interpreted, those addresses have to concur with the list of electors. That is yet again a situation where no person's face is required to be shown. We are half wet on this issue. It is incongruous and very difficult for the Chief Electoral Officer to be sure that everyone who votes is voting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have to ask the question about our history. I would think that this particularly applies to rural Canada. In our history do we have such widespread voter fraud and multiple voting situations that we have to go that far? I would think not. What we have to rely on are the principles of trust, that when a Canadian citizen comes to the voting box, then in our heads, as lawmakers, as government officials and as the delegated responsible persons from Elections Canada, we should think of section 3 of the charter, “Every citizen in Canada has the right to vote”. It should be written large in both official languages at every polling station. We should do our utmost as parliamentarians to ensure that has been put into effect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened here is, in our rush to be half modern and half photogenic, we have said that one has to fit with the other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the positive side, the bill will go some way to cure a problem that exists because of our zealous pursuit of attempting to get rural people, our large rural population, to conform perhaps to a metropolitan view of how we identify ourselves. I think it is an identity issue. I think it is an issue that defines us as a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our country we have had periods in some cases of rapid urbanization and we have had periods of slow urbanization. I submit that in this history of our country, and what better place to do this than in the House, parts of western Canada were rapidly de-ruralized and rural Canada lost a lot of its character in the period which we now know as the dust bowl period.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in periods of economic recession, parts of eastern Canada were denuded of its people. One only has to look at the outport situation in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador to know that people were pulled away from their rural roots.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of de-ruralization is occurring much slower in my province and in the rest of the Maritimes, but it is happening. We are becoming, as the last census showed, an urban nation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> did was it added insult to injury to rural Canadians by saying, “We are going to apply a city standard to rural Canadians. We are going to apply a metropolitan standard to rural Canadians. You shall be like us”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the good part of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> suggests is that we are apologizing, as parliamentarians from all sides, to rural Canadians. We are saying that we were a little too hasty, a little too urban in our thought and we apologize. We are saying that rural Canadians have the same rights as we do as guaranteed by section 3 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kudos to rural Canada and kudos to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about the charter of rights, which everyone upholds. The government also has an obligation, including opposition parties, to ensure that those rights are not abused, which does not suggest for a second that any rural voter has abused those rights.

One practice would raise the voter turnout, and that is door to door enumeration. We used to do that for many years. When the Liberal Party was in government, it got rid of door to door enumeration. Now tenants, students, young people who just turned age 18 and new immigrants who have just become citizens are no longer on the list. They have not been enumerated. Because they are not on the list, often they scramble to try to get to the polling station if they even know where their polling station is. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key element that would help to increase the voter turnout is not in this bill, not in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> and not in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a few months ago, in the spring, the Liberal Party said that there was all kinds of voter fraud and they suggested we ask Elections Canada to examine a few ridings in Toronto, for example. Therefore, a lot of money and time was spent to check whether there was fraud. Elections Canada said that there was no massive voter fraud. There was no fraud at all. A few people had made mistakes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we all agree there is no voter fraud, then why did the different parties pass Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>? We said that it would not fix anything and it created other problems. Now we have another bill. I have no confidence it will fix all the problems or that voter turnout rate will go up. I know people will be disenfranchised because of the problems that are still inherent in this whole debate, which is the lack of door to door enumeration in the first place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see how, after a lot of time, energy and money spent on these papers to study this bill and that bill causing embarrassment, the bill will fix these problems. It will fix the problem for those people from rural Canada who have been left off the list, but I guarantee we will encounter other problems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope we return to door to door enumeration so people who need to be on the list will be on it and they can then have a chance to vote.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing this speech, I wondered how many voters in my riding might be affected. We inquired with the office of the Chief Electoral Officer. So far, all we were able to obtain was an acknowledgement of receipt, conforming that my inquiry had been referred to the appropriate branch. That takes some doing. Having been made aware of a problem, Elections Canada is unable to tell an elected member of the House of Commons how many voters in her riding might be affected. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if an election were held today, nearly one million voters across Canada, including 15,000 in Quebec, would be prevented from casting a ballot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of voters in the various provinces who do not meet the new requirements of the Elections Act. A journalist from <i>La Presse</i> also tried unsuccessfully to obtain an explanation from Elections Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At various stages of the electoral process, electors are expected to provide undeniable proof of identity, particularly at the time of casting a ballot. Identification systems may also be used for registering voters or granting staff members access to their place of work or to a computer system. Some countries rely on the honesty of voters and do not require them to provide any documents as proof of identity. Other countries do require proof of identity, hence the need for personal identification systems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, the use of ID cards is widespread, while in others, ID cards are not intended for everyday use. The public's response will determine whether or not this is an appropriate practice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For electoral purposes, voters may produce ID cards when registering or at the polling station. Such cards may also be useful to give election officials access to their place of work or to other restricted access areas such as polling and ballot counting stations. They may also be used by the personnel responsible for voter registration or verification of voters lists.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most ID cards used when voting do have the advantage of helping reduce opportunities for fraud. The ones that include a photo, a signature or a fingerprint ensure an even tighter control, but they must be used with caution, while taking into consideration the country's cultural context. Some security printing processes, such as holograms or coloured illustrations that are hard to copy, also reduce the risk of false ID cards, as do identification procedures that rely on biological information.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its present form, the Canada Elections Act requires all electors to prove their identity and their residence before being allowed to vote. The new requirements on voter identification are based on a unanimous recommendation made by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prove his or her identity, an elector must: provide a government issued identity card with his or her photo, name and address—a Quebec driver's licence, for example; or provide two pieces of identification authorized by the Chief Electoral Officer, with both pieces showing his or her name, and one piece showing his or her residence; or ask another elector, whose name appears on the list of electors for the same polling division, to vouch for him or her, after having provided the above-mentioned pieces of identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern expressed by the Chief Electoral Officer, which we share, is that some electors may not be able to provide pieces of identification to prove their residence, as required by the law, because they live in an area where there are no municipal addresses, or in a region where such an address is not usually indicated on the driver's licence or other identification documents. This concern is the topic of the current debate, and we must find a solution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legislation needs to be corrected to ensure that a million citizens are not deprived of the right to vote. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> will allow electors in regions where pieces of identification do not contain a civic address, just a post office box, general delivery or a rural route, to use identification with an address other than a street address to verify their residence on condition that it is consistent with the information on file in the National Register of Electors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same rule will apply to people who vouch for another elector. If the address on the voucher’s identification is consistent with the information in the list of electors, it will be deemed sufficient proof of residence. I would like to look a bit more closely at this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would allow electors to present identification with an address other than a civic address to verify their residence on condition that it is consistent with the information on file in the National Register of Electors. This is meant to cover people who live on rural routes, for example. The bill also authorizes an election officer, a candidate or a candidate’s representative to require the elector or the voucher to take an oath in order to prove his or her place of residence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these cases, the residence of the elector or voucher will not be deemed proven unless the person takes an oath. We believe that it is reasonable to require an ID card with a photograph, if available, in order to verify the identity of electors and ensure the integrity of the election system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People whose names are not on the list of electors but who want to register on polling day or at an advance polling station will have to prove their residence by presenting identification with a civic address because the list of electors does not have any information in it that would make it possible to compare a mailing address or an incomplete civic address. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government’s purpose here is to adjust our aim. The verification of residence bill makes the identification requirements more flexible for electors who do not have a piece of identification with a street address on it when they have to prove their residence in order to vote. We what we wanted to do with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was not to restrict the criteria for qualification as an elector but to change the way in which the elector exercises the right to vote. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume the voter is a senior who does not drive. Right off, he or she does not have a driver's licence with a photo.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The identification card can be a health insurance card, social insurance card, birth certificate, driver’s licence, Canadian passport, a credit card to identify the name, a Canadian Forces identity card, a health card, employer card or old age security card, or a public transportation card. There are also documents that can establish name and address, such as a credit card statement, a bank statement, a utility bill such as a telephone, cable, hydro, gas or water bill, or a bill from a public utilities commission. This can also be a local property tax assessment, a residential lease or, for students, a school report card or transcript; and the list goes on. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary spoke about the fact that the NDP opposed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> simply because it was concerned about homeless people. There are a couple of things I would like to say about that. I am sure the parliamentary secretary could not possibly be suggesting that homeless people should not vote. We know that homelessness is a rising crisis in this country and that there are increasing numbers of homeless people in Canada. I would be very surprised to hear members of the House say that homeless people should be disenfranchised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point to the preliminary report of the UN special rapporteur, Miloon Kothari, that was released on October 22. It talked about the fact that Canada has a crisis in housing. We have a national crisis that is in an emergency situation. We know that independent sources are talking about increasing homelessness. We know homeless people often do not have identification that would allow them to vote.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NDPers are certainly very conscious of maintaining the integrity of the voting system and of ensuring there is no fraud, but I am also very aware that the Chief Electoral Officer also indicated that fraud is by no means rampant in this country.

However, when we do things hastily and without adequate consideration for broad ranging impact, we end up not only delaying the process, but we end up spending far more money than we needed to spend in the first place.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the parliamentary secretary speak about the fact that the primary reason that New Democrats opposed the original bill was because of our great concern for homeless people. We are absolutely concerned about people who are homeless. Whether it is their right to vote, their right to adequate shelter, and everything in between like health care, liveable wages, adequate education, we are concerned. I am very proud as a New Democrat to stand up and speak about these things in the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Democrats identified a number of issues in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> which are not being addressed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> and are still going to continue to be a problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about the fact that the bill would result in thousands of individuals not being able to exercise their right to vote because of a lack of proper identification due to poverty, illness, disability or having no stable address. This also included people who were temporarily housed in transition shelters. We put forward a recommendation around the statutory declaration as an alternate means of identification for an elector to prove his or her identity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also talked about the fact that there were some serious problems with the vouching system. With the vouching system, one person can vouch only for one voter. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330">(1330)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, for example, there may be someone who lives in a riding and works a lot with people who are homeless, some of the street workers, who often have daily contact with people who are homeless. That person would only be able to vouch for one of those people who he or she works with on a regular basis. We were arguing that using that vouching system is a legitimate way to say that someone should be able to prove who they are and that one should be able to vouch for more than one person. That seems perfectly reasonable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, if one's credentials are good enough to vouch for one person, they should be good enough to vouch for five, six or ten people. What difference does it make?</div>
    </p><a name="Para769394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to highlight the fact again that when New Democrats were speaking about the problems with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which have not been fixed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, they were identifying more than homelessness as an issue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the member for Vancouver East, who is a very experienced member of the House and has been a tireless advocate for homeless people, was also talking about people who are not only homeless but who lived in small and remote communities and aboriginal people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think that is a very good example of how New Democrats talked about issues that included the homeless and others. Further on in her speech she talked about a solution. She said:</div>

At present, it is acceptable for a voter to make a statutory declaration along with a person in the community who can identify the voter. In the downtown east side, it has often been a street worker, someone who knows many of the people in the community, who vouches for the individual. Under the new bill, [Bill C-31], this would no longer be allowed.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member goes on to talk about solutions. People in the House have said that New Democrats only oppose things, not propose things. That is wrong. We talked about the fact that enumeration, which has been cancelled, would have been a very good way to ensure that we had the best possible electoral list so that people would be accurately reflected on that voters list.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are isolated cases from time to time but the chief electoral officer and Elections Canada have a very good system for following that up and actually zeroing in on where there may be potential fraud. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this bill, in its previous form, was never required in the first place. What it did was it disenfranchised millions of rural voters, as well as those who live in an urban environment who may not have the necessary ID. There was nothing wrong with the way people in my riding of Vancouver East voted but they were suddenly disenfranchised by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, as they will be by this new bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite astounding that a problem that never existed has now become a problem because of legislation that has been created by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know about the rural voters and the fact that is why this new version of the bill has come forward, but is it also not the case that there are other voters who will be disenfranchised? Unfortunately, there is nothing in this bill that will correct the situation for those people. They are mostly people in inner cities, homeless people, people without ID and who have every right to vote. As a result of this legislation, they will still find it difficult to vote, if not impossible. They will, in effect, be disenfranchised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I and my colleagues have pressed very hard to get this message through. It is quite alarming that not only did the government not listen, but the Liberal Party and the Bloc Québécois rejected those arguments as well and went along with this bill. Now we have the second version of the bill back and it is still a flawed bill.</div>

I spoke earlier about the UN special rapporteur's report on housing and homelessness in Canada, and it is no wonder. People are facing a crisis.

I live on a small Gulf Island off the B.C. coast. We were recently assigned house numbers for this island but pick up mail on a different island and our voting stations are on a third island.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a question of voter fraud? We had four cases of voter fraud in the last four elections. That is not sufficient to bring forward an act to this Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a question that somehow our system of voting is under scrutiny, that the elaborate system of returning officers, scrutineers and the complete system of Canadian voting, which is probably one of the best in the world, is somehow under suspicion? Are we letting too many people through the gate? Is it because some people walking into the polls are unable to identify themselves in many instances?</div>

Is the bill one of the steps that is leading us toward a more authoritarian state where everything we do must be qualified with some form of identification, where we are moving toward government identity cards and where we are taking the steps that will lead us to a society that Canadians will not like?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the bill is to close some of the loopholes in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. All of our colleagues who have spoken to Bill C-18 talked about problems that resulted from the adoption of Bill C-31. People did not pass it in bad faith to cause problems, but, as is frequently the case, they realized after the fact that there were some problems. That is what happened with Bill C-31, which attempted to minimize opportunities for fraud or error by strengthening requirements related to voter identification. People were asked to produce identification that included their home address. That was when a pretty serious problem surfaced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections Canada revealed that at least one million Canadians do not have a proper residential address, that is, an address with a civic number and street name, as required by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. This might seem strange or unusual to someone who lives in the city and has always had a civic address with a street name. This does not mean, however, that these other people have nowhere to live. We are familiar with the plight of the homeless. However, there are also people who live in a rural setting who do not have that kind of address. It is not the same thing. They do not have a civic number and street name. They may simply have a rural route number. For instance, in the case of first nations peoples, their address might simply be the name of the reserve and nothing else. The address is just as valid, but it is not the kind of address that city dwellers tend to have. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One million voters represent 4.4% of all eligible voters in Canada. As I was saying, in rural settings, addresses often consist of post office boxes or rural routes. On first nations reserves, residential addresses often consist only of the name of the reserve. In order to ensure a healthy democratic process, everyone must, if possible, have the right to vote, which is an inalienable right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have a rural route as their address, for instance, cannot call upon a vouching elector from the same polling division, because he or she will have a similar address. If a voter brings along their neighbour or their roommate because they do not have all the documentation required by the law, the problem is that the other person will have more or less exactly the same address. They will have the same problem, that is, no civic number or street name. Therein lies the problem in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation affects about one million people in Canada. Fortunately, the number is much smaller in Quebec, but there are people who do have that problem. Indeed, 15,836 voters, or 0.27% of all electors in Quebec were found to have an address that can be described as incomplete. They find themselves in the situation that I described earlier, in that they do not necessarily have a civic number or a street name. So, a solution had to be found to allow the greatest possible number of people to exercise their right to vote, a right—and I am saying it again, because it is important—that is unalienable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> was drafted. However, the democratic process must be conducted while trying to prevent fraud as much as possible. Now, we joke about the days when people used to say that political parties would sometimes make dead people vote. We laugh, but it is not funny, because it was the reality. Some people did use that ploy at one time. Whenever the possibility exists, dishonest people will try to use all sorts of schemes to win elections in a fraudulent and illegal manner. That was done in the past. People would go to the cemetery, write down the name of a dead person, find his old address, and then go and vote while using the dead person's identity. This really happened. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more recent times—unfortunately, this may still be happening, but it definitely did in the rather recent past—some people would vote by doing nothing less than to steal another voter's identity. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe I am mistaken in saying that this happened in the borough of Anjou, in Quebec. In the very recent past, it was proven that people were engaging in this fraudulent practice. Someone was elected because people—called floating voters—had been paid to vote for that person by stealing other voters' identities. This is a serious problem that must be prevented. That is why the NDP's suggestion that people simply take an oath in order to have the right to vote is highly problematic. It is not enough.</div>

The bill provides that if the mailing address on the pieces of identification provided does not prove the voter's residence, but is consistent with the information related to that voter on the voters list, the voter's residence is deemed to have been proven. For example, a voter whose identification shows an address limited to a rural route can prove his residence if that mailing address matches the information on the voters list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of someone who is vouching for another voter, the bill requires that the voucher first prove his or her own identity and residence. If the address on the voucher's identification matches the information related to the voucher on the voters list, that address can be used to prove the voucher's residence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by saying that if there is any doubt, the deputy returning officer, poll clerk, candidate or candidate's representative can ask the voter to take the prescribed oath.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair spent his lifetime helping others and was strongly committed to his family, his community and Canada. He was active in many capacities, key among them being past owner and director of Cutcliffe Funeral Home. He was a provincial MLA and deputy speaker, a stalwart Liberal activist, a founding member of the Hillsborough Rotary Club, provider of ambulance services and first aid training to nurses and firefighters. For his years in first aid he won the highest honour, the Order of the Red Cross.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he never sat in this chamber having made one attempt to do so, he still had an influence on this place and federal policy through his active connections with Prime Minister Trudeau and the Liberal Party. The stories he could tell. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and Prince Edward Island are a better place because of Sinclair Cutcliffe. We thank his family and we wish them well.</div>

    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para769730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began the week by debating the bill on visual identification of electors and we hope to examine the bill on rural electors without a municipal address shortly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have concluded debate at second reading on the first bill to enhance the electoral process and improve the integrity of the electoral system and we hope to conclude debate on the second bill as well.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para769732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I am pleased to say that we will begin debate on our bills to make the Senate more democratic and accountable. We will begin with the debate on the future of the Senate by discussing our bill to limit the terms of senators. Our bill will put an end to the comfortable 45 year terms for senators, limiting those terms to eight years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Liberals in the House do not follow the lead of their colleagues in the Senate who did everything they could to block this bill, especially since the Liberal leader is on the record numerous times supporting term limits for senators.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After concluding debate on our term limits bill, we will start debate on our bill to ask Canadians who should represent them in the Senate. For the first time ever, Canadians across Canada will have a direct say in who should represent them in the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a serious effort to work with the opposition, we will be seeking to send this bill to committee before second reading. This will allow a wider consideration of the bill and amendments at committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next week will be safer communities through tackling crime week. We will start on Monday by debating our security certificates bill. While we expect vigorous debate on this bill, we hope that all parties will act in a responsible, reasonable way, mindful of the advice that the Supreme Court has given in this matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we will also be welcoming back to the House our bill to make our streets and communities safer by tackling violent crime. Pursuant to a special order, our tackling violent crime bill will be reported back to the House by Friday of next week.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other bills addressing important changes needed to make our streets and communities safer will be introduced next week.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the problem, more or less. Elections Canada recently revealed that 1 million Canadians do not have a proper residential address under the terms of the original legislation. In other words, they do not have an address with a street number and a street name.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reality both in Quebec and Canada. We have big cities, but we also have, numerically speaking, a large number of rural communities. Rural addresses quite often consist of post office box numbers or rural route numbers. For example, an address might include the name of the person, “Rural Route 1”, and the name of the municipality. We know that in most cases in rural areas, mail carriers deliver the mail to mailboxes along the roadside. Such is the case in my riding on Île d'Orléans, in Côte-de-Beaupré and in Charlevoix, where farms are very large. This makes mail delivery quite challenging.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Elections Canada realized that the addresses of residents of aboriginal reserves often consist of nothing but the name of the reserve. In my riding, there is a very dynamic aboriginal community, the Innu of Essipit. I am proud to salute the leadership of grand chief Denis Ross, as well as all of the band council and the negotiating team. In some aboriginal communities, then, the address consists solely of the name of the person and the name of the reserve. We can imagine that makes the process of identification somewhat complicated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse still, those people could not appeal to another voter in the same polling division to vouch for them because most of the voters would not have the documents required to prove the address of their residence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is as follows. If you live in a township and your address is just “Rural Route 1”, it is very likely that the people who know you best or most intimately are your neighbours, and it could well be that those neighbours are your relatives. So, if your sister, your brother or sister-in-law lives on the same rural route as you, they have the same problem of identification. Their own address is incomplete for the purposes of Elections Canada. This measure has the same goal of improving the conditions for identification of voters.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Elections Canada, there are 1,012,989 voters, that is 4.4% of eligible voters in Canada, who do not have a residential address that meets the requirements of the Elections Act as amended. The situation is very disquieting. What is more, Elections Canada tells us that 80% of the residents of an area such as Nunavut do not have a personal address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are statistics for Saskatchewan, Ontario and for Newfoundland and Labrador. In Quebec, it is a matter of 15,836 voters or 27/100 of 1%, or more than 0.25% who could be facing the same problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, which are now debating, the government is amending the Canada Elections Act to provide more flexibility in the regulations concerning the verification of residence in the case of voters who live in areas where the municipal address appearing on a piece of identification consists of a postal box, general delivery or rural route. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515">(1515)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill provides that where the address indicated on the items of identification presented does not establish the residence of the voter but is consistent with the corresponding information on the voters list, the residence of the voter is deemed to have been established.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, a voter whose piece of identity contains an address consisting only of the rural route could establish his residence if that postal address matches the information recorded on the voters list. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill also provides that in case of doubt the deputy returning officer, the poll clerk, a candidate or candidate's representative could ask the voter to take the prescribed oath if there is any doubt in the opinion of the election officials. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois supports the principle of the bill because we believe it is necessary to correct the law to avoid having 1 million Canadians deprived of their right to vote. Even though, numerically speaking, we are talking about a smaller number compared to other communities and other provinces, I believe that those 15,836 voters in Quebec also have the right to exercise their right to vote. Not amending the act would amount to depriving them of their right to vote, and voting is a democratic exercise in which we elect the representatives who will speak for us in Ottawa. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are of the opinion that the NDP proposal to grant the right to vote to every voter who swears an oath is unacceptable. This proposal was already rejected by the three other political parties when Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was studied in the previous session of this Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that it is reasonable to require at least one piece of photo ID, if available, to verify the identity of voters and to ensure the integrity of the electoral system. There must not be any ambiguity: the NDP proposal could result in some fraud. The NDP proposal runs counter to the principles of identification required to vote in a general election or a byelection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the NDP is criticizing this bill because it believes it will not resolve all the problems created last spring by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. We recall the discussions of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs where the NDP pointed out the situation of homeless people. I wish to reiterate what I said at that time: our party is not oblivious to the situation of the homeless. On the contrary, it is proof that despite economic prosperity, despite the fact that the dollar has reached its highest value in 30 years, there is the reality that there are poor people and homeless people in Canada and Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem for the homeless is that they do not always have an identification card. Yet, they must be able find someone to vouch for them and prove their identity. To adopt the NDP position would be to ensure that anyone at all could vote. We cannot support that position.</div>

On December 7, 2006, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, former Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, appeared before our Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and warned parliamentarians about the address problem.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say hastily because I know the committee heard from many witnesses. They heard from Elections Canada, first nations, students, homeless advocates and the members of the committee, including the NDP member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa Centre</A>, who was the critic at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know a lot of issues were raised on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. Unfortunately, some of the flaws that were pointed out were not addressed. They were overruled by the members of the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are trying to fix a problem created by the Conservative government. The problem is the new stringent regulations, as set out in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, on the cards to prove one's identity ultimately will lead to the disenfranchisement of over a million voters, as we have heard. This was pointed out by Elections Canada after the fact. Basically that has forced the government to come up with this new bill to try to undo the damage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new regulations of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> being considered today, voting will still be more difficult for many cross-sections of Canadians, including people with rural addresses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why I am here today to speak to the bill. I represent a riding that is probably 50% rural. We have a lot of small towns and a couple of large centres that get home delivery, but most of our communities get rural mail delivery. It is for them that I am worried.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have to include myself in that group of people because I live in a small town. I have a box number. Fortunately for me, my residential address is also on my driver's licence, as well as my box number. If that were not the case, I might find myself on election day unable to vote, or having to prove who I am.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In areas of Courtenay, where there is rural mail delivery, many people living on small farms and on lots outside of the city limits. They do not have home delivery. These people get their mail at the side of the road in a box, and it is an RR number. It has been like that for many years and a lot of the people have lived there for many years. This includes the area of Royston, which is just south of Courtenay where my aunt lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has been in that place for over 50 years. She just turned 80 years old. She has always lived in the same place. She may find herself at the polling station unable to vote because she does not drive. She does not have a driver's licence with a picture ID on it and probably could not prove who she was. All her neighbours and the people who she knows would be unable to vouch for her because they might find themselves in the same predicament without the ability to verify who they are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also areas of Comox and outer areas of that town do not get home delivery. Up in the Lazo area, many people living in the little communities of Merville, Black Creek and Oyster River may be disenfranchised from their vote. Again, these people do not get their mail delivered to a box in a central post office. Because of what happened with Canada Post over a number of years, we have found that our mail is delivered to small community grocery stores, gas stations or other places where people have to pick up their mail. The mail does not come to their residences, so they usually have a rural mail delivery address or a box number in those places. Many people are going to find they have a problem.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke a little about box numbers. Most of the communities in my riding, for example, Cumberland, Gold River, Sayward, Tahsis, Port McNeil, Port Hardy and Port Alice, Zeballos, have very small post offices. They are a long way from Ottawa and the larger geographical centres of British Columbia. People in these small towns rely on the post offices as the place to get their mail. Pretty well everyone's mail is delivered to a post office box. Many people live on roads that may not even have a name or a sign and their residence address would not be listed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other interesting thing is that there are a lot of little islands, Hornby, Denman, Quadra, Cortes, Alert Bay and Sointula, all those little islands we travel to and from. The people who live on those islands also get their mail delivered to a box at the local post office which in many instances is in the local community grocery store. These people may also find themselves disenfranchised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a lot of communities, in fact most of the communities in my riding. There are only two main communities where people would get their mail delivered to their home and their home address would be on their card. We are concerned about what might happen with the people in the small communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I have to highlight is all the first nations communities in my riding and there are a lot of them, including places like Owikeno, Kingcome Inlet and up in Simoom Sound. These places are very remote. People do not get their mail delivered to a post office box or to their home. Their addresses are bag number such and such in the closest town and the mail is flown in on small airplanes or taken in by boat whenever the weather is good. That is how they get their mail. If they were issued a card that said bag number such and such, or whatever, obviously they do not live in a bag, they live in a beautiful community up the coast, but they could find themselves disenfranchised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already hard enough for some people in our smaller communities and especially first nations because until recently they did not even have polling places on reserve, so they were feeling disenfranchised that way as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to find more opportunities to increase the vote among first nations people in our communities. I know in the last election we worked very hard with Elections Canada to make sure that there were polls on reserves so that people would have an opportunity to vote where they live. That is so important. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people in our rural communities have to travel quite a distance to exercise their franchise. We take it for granted when we live in a larger centre, in that we can just take a few minutes to go to our polling station and vote. We need to make sure there are more opportunities to do that, not less.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I talked about homeless people and transient populations. My colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78973,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78973&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver East</A>, spoke passionately about how we would be disenfranchising many of those people in the inner cities who live in shelters or who are homeless. There were some provisions made to identify them and to make sure that they were not left out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my community we do not have big shelters. We have a couple of small ones, but we also have many homeless people in my riding. Many of these people are couch surfing. They are living in cars. There are families who are living at campsites. There are people who are double bunking, a couple of different families living together trying to make ends meet, trying to find suitable housing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what will happen to those people if they have no address at all and they cannot prove where they are living. It is going to be really difficult for them at voting time. It is something that we should have addressed before.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530">(1530)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At committee we also heard from students who were living away from home. Aboriginal representatives who came to committee brought up some of the flaws that were ignored at the time. As I said, here we are debating a bill that fixes another bill that was rushed through the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP critic at the time who worked on the committee made presentations to our caucus. We understood the problems. We were the only party to vote against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very unfair that all the groups that I just mentioned, aboriginals, students, rural residents, people who live in small towns, will have to jump through hoops in order to carry out their democratic right and civic duty to cast a ballot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constituents have called me to ask what is going on with respect to paragraph 3, proof of identity, in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>. They will have to provide proof of identity and residence. If a person cannot prove his or her residence, then the person may lose his or her franchise to vote. That is a problem. That is basically what brings us here today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions were introduced in order to combat voter fraud that allegedly was taking place in Canada. However, no meaningful evidence has been put forth to prove that fraud was occurring in any systematic or widespread way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">colleague from Ottawa Centre</A> mentioned that candidate fraud is a bigger problem than voter fraud, with the floor crossing that goes on. A candidate representing a certain party will get elected. People commit to a certain candidate. They work hard for that candidate to make sure that the candidate is elected and when that person gets to the House of Commons, that person might cross the floor to another party. That act in itself is what turns off a lot of voters. It is a shame that these things are allowed to happen in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that the objective of stamping out voter fraud is an honourable one, but unfortunately, it is being pursued at too high a price under these bills. It basically alienates many honest Canadians and disenfranchises them from their opportunity to vote. It is too high a price to pay for something that really is not a huge problem in the first place. The most important thing is for Canadians to have easy and open access to the ballot. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put forward a motion on electoral reform because I wanted to hear from more Canadians. More Canadians deserve an opportunity to vote and their vote should count. I wanted to hear from Canadians to find out how we could change and enhance our electoral system with proportional representation, but unfortunately that motion was hijacked by the procedure and House affairs committee. It basically turned into a process where the government could hear about Senate reform. I heard from people who attended the focus groups that came out of that procedure. The whole agenda was pretty much taken up with talk about Senate reform. There was very little talk about electoral reform. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535">(1535)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is sad because I know that in the province of British Columbia where I come from, electoral reform is something that a lot of people wanted. When we had our referendum in 2005, it did not pass, but it did not lose by much either. We had over 50%. Unfortunately, the way it was set out it had to have 60%, but 57% is more than 50% plus one. That is what we need to have a majority in this House. I think a majority of British Columbians did want some sort of change in our electoral process.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the bill at hand, the NDP critic for democratic reform, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78395,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78395&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Timmins—James Bay</A>, is taking an active role at the committee. Other NDP MPs are rising in this House to ensure that the rights of all Canadians are protected at the ballot box.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78395,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78395&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Timmins—James Bay</A> also is in jeopardy of losing his vote. There was an article a number of weeks ago in the paper about that. His driver's licence has a very strange address. That is how things are done in his riding. It does not list his residence, but only lists the number of a road. He is willing, as I and others are, to jump through the procedural hoops that the government has placed before us to make sure that we get to vote on election day. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to ask how many of my constituents would be willing to find someone to go to the polling station with them to declare that they are who they say they are. Seniors, people with disabilities, young people who are voting for the first time, are they going to show up at the ballot box with the people necessary to prove who they are, or will they walk away? I think most people would say, “Forget it. This is too much trouble. Why bother”. Such a procedure is going to turn people away from the voting process. This is something that we ought not to do. We should be encouraging people to get out and vote, not making it more difficult for them. We should not be setting up roadblocks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already voter turnout is too low. I think that voter turnout hovers at around 65%. That is quite shameful. It means that members were elected to the House with the support of 65% of the population, and the percentage of the vote that we received makes it even smaller. That is something we need to address in this country. Again, that could be addressed through changing our electoral system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that only the NDP caucus stood up in opposition to the original bill when it was being expedited through the House last spring. The Conservative Party introduced this troubling legislation and both the Bloc and the Liberals got on board on the condition that all voters' birthdates would be included in the voters list that is provided to the political parties. My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa Centre</A> fought hard against these provisions, but he was ultimately outnumbered at the committee where these amendments were made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that we are here speaking to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>.

I know the hon. member has her own committees and is not on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. I would request that she check the minutes because at no time did the NDP raise the issue of these riding addresses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the NDP brought forward a number of witnesses from a number of organizations who were concerned, as they should have been, with how homeless people would have the right to vote. The committee grappled with the issue at great lengths.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one, including the folks from Elections Canada, the witnesses, the members of Parliament who were at the committee or the Senate, saw the rural address issue, and here it is. Nobody from the NDP raised this issue. They missed it completely, as did everybody else. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the member to be correct on her facts, and perhaps I could lend her some research assistance for her next speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee grappled with fraud and the integrity of the system. We heard stories from witnesses, and again I can help the member get the research, where people would phone in to radio stations to register their votes. We heard situations where dead people voted. We heard situations where there was a 150% turnout at some of the polls. Therefore, the fact that nobody has been charged by Elections Canada does not, in itself, preclude that there may have been fraud. It is balancing the integrity of the Canadian voting system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a rural address problem for which we have come up with a solution. I just want to point out that the NDP provided no solution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we did grapple very hard and very long to ensure homeless people were able to exercise their right to vote, despite the fact that evidence showed that in one area where there were an estimated 600 homeless people, 1,800 votes were cast by those homeless people. Therefore, the suggestion is that they voted three times.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we have had comments from the NDP that to add extra voting days and give Canadians more choice when they vote would ultimately, questionably, cost a little bit of money. It has been suggested that it would increase it moderately. The NDP's comments now are that it would not be worth the expense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the member tell us at what point we balance the integrity of the system, making sure that people who have a right to vote do vote and nobody else, not people who are vacationing in Canada and not my in-laws who perhaps are not citizens of the country? How do we protect that? How does she answer the question that we must do everything for the homeless, and I agree we must, but not anybody else because it is too expensive?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned that because, from what I understand, it was the first nations people who raised that issue at the committee. However, it does not really matter at the end of the day who raised it. I do not know why we need to play a blame game. We are raising it now and it is before this House. Suffice it to say that the NDP voted against Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> and we were the only party to do so, for many reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP did provide solutions, such as providing a statutory declaration for voters so that they could declare themselves when voting.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the member's point on more voting days, I do not hear too many people asking for more days to vote. We have advance polls that have been extended over the years, and that is great.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do hear from a lot of my constituents and Canadians all across this country, through petitions and other things, that they want their vote to actually count at the end of the day.

    </p><a name="Para769821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we all want a voting system that has integrity, the question of voter fraud was not something that seemed to be rampant in Canada. We had this legislation in the last session of Parliament to purportedly deal with this problem. What it did cause was the disenfranchisement of almost a million Canadians.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this has been an area of particular concern to my colleague because she has been very active on the whole question of democratic reform and proposing significant measures. While I appreciate her comments directly on this legislation, I wonder if she could elaborate on some of her broader concerns about democratic and electoral reform in Canada, those which are not dealt with in this legislation but would be important issues for Parliament to deal with and look at in the future. </div>

I chose electoral reform because it is something that is fundamental to how members are elected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many British Columbians went through a process of meetings and discussions over a period of a year. We made presentations to a committee that was struck by the provincial government to talk about electoral reform. People began to understand that there were problems with our electoral system and they wanted to make changes. Come election day, when the referendum was on the ballot, after the votes were counted we found that 57% of British Columbians wanted to change the voting system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the voting system that was put forward by the provincial government was not necessarily the system that everyone wanted, but because 57% of people voted for it tells me that they want some sort of a change. When we have that many people in my province wanting to see a change in their voting system, it is significant, and that translates federally as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Ontario just went through the same kind of process and the percentage was not as high but I think it was a different system. Ontario did not have the same kind of citizens assembly that B.C. had, where people were able to learn about the changes. Sometimes all it takes is educating people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the motion I put forward, I wanted to ask Canadians how they would like to see their voting system changed. I received a lot of letters and petitions from people all across the country agreeing that we should have some kind of debate in this country, a citizens assembly that would reach out to the grassroots and talk to Canadians, not the sham of a process that we had with one meeting in each province to basically talk about Senate reform.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is something that would have changed the look of Parliament. It would have opened up the doors to people, especially young people who do not vote in great numbers. That is one of the least represented demographics at voting time. If we had some kind of system where people felt their votes actually counted, they might be more willing to participate.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to thank all the parties for working together to bring forward Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, verification of residence of voters, so quickly, particularly on behalf of people in the north because inappropriate wording or an inadvertent mistake would have disenfranchised a lot of northerners because of their addresses. I used to have an address like RR 1, Site 2, Comp. 3. Other people have box numbers. Most northerners do not have a verified street address. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I express appreciation to all members of Parliament and all parties for getting this technical change through quickly. A large percentage of the people in the rural areas of Canada in particular, and I will speak for rural areas being the chair of the rural caucus, would have had difficulty voting, technically, under the definitions and would have needed special provisions. These are very warranted changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the amendments, I am not positive that the issue of residential street addresses has been addressed. I just want to make sure that the voting rights of certain people in relation to their residential street address are protected. One example would be military personnel who are away. Hopefully, this provision would allow them, as long as they have the proper identification, to vote in the riding that they have chosen, as has occurred in the past.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in places like my riding, a number of people, especially seniors, go south for a portion of the winter and therefore end up having to vote on occasion from down there as, of course, elections are seldom in the summer. Once again, I am assuming that if the residential address that is on the voters list is the same as the address on their identification they would have no trouble voting. However, I want to make sure that the people on the committee who are investigating this in line by line detail make sure those people are protected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final category of people in similar situations are students. As there are no universities north of 60, in the northern half of the country, people who go to universities in the south are often there on federal voting day. So once again, I am assuming that if they are on the voters list, as per this act, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, and their identification matches the information on the voters list they would be able to vote. I would like the committee to confirm that in its deliberations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one other item I want to bring forward. If there is a member of committee in the House perhaps he or she could just answer this question for me during questions and comments. What is the number of people a person can vouch for? In my reading of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, I do not see any conditions on that. There may be conditions back in the original act that were not amended. I am thinking of particularly small polls where there may be a number of people in the situation where they need people to vouch for them and there may not be enough of those eligible voters to swear in those people who are not on the voters list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps someone could clarify for me the number of people an eligible voter can vouch for under these new amendments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I again thank everyone. We will certainly be doing everything we can to get this through as quickly as possible because everyone in Parliament agrees that this is a necessary amendment so that no one is disenfranchised, although the chief electoral officer would never let that happen because he has the flexibility to make sure everyone can vote anyway. However, it should be done properly.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I congratulate all members in the House for making these corrections as quickly as possible.</div>

He has done a lot of work and has been very concerned about this issue, as all of us are, and he quite rightly points out that all parties appear to be cooperating and not playing games to get this through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member's comments about folks who travel is a very good one because a lot of folks in my riding too when the weather gets bad, head down to Florida. We want to ensure that wherever Canadians are in the world at the time of an election, that they actually have every availability to them to express their franchise to vote. The member should know that special ballots, mail-in ballots, allow folks that are in another country to go to the Canadian embassy and vote there. Those ballots can be sent home as our troops have done, et cetera. So none of those are affected by this legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member may not be familiar with the most current piece of legislation whereby the government wants to ensure that every opportunity is provided for Canadians to vote and vote with integrity within the system. We have added an extra couple of days where Canadians can vote. That would help some of the folks in my riding who perhaps might be in Florida on the day of the election. They can mail in their ballots as I have said in a special ballot situation, but it is convenient for Canadians to have these extra voting days.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member would not mind to comment on his intentions to support the other legislation that I am sure would help folks in his riding too by having a couple of extra couple of options. I suspect in the member's riding that having an extra couple of days might be a great idea because I know his riding is very large and that would help folks to have a few extra days. Would he support that legislation?</div>

First of all, in reference to the students and people who travel south and the military, I know about special ballots and everything will be there to vote in the same way. My question was regarding the requirement for a street address and whether that would negatively affect that procedure, would they now need to have a street address where they did not before? Hopefully that is covered by the amendments in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the extra voting days, because people can vote by special ballot the day the writ is dropped, I am certainly in favour of having a system that is very flexible with good advance polling days because one or two days does not always help my constituents. As the member said, I have a huge riding and voters could easily be outside their poll and still in the riding, but impossible to get there. It is five or six hours in three directions to get back to my riding and a lot of people would not do that to vote, especially driving in minus 40°. As we discussed earlier, a lot of them travel outside the territory. They often go south for reasons of work, to visit family or other reasons so that one day or two days is not necessarily enough. There needs to be flexibility over the whole system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other problem that arises, and hopefully the committee will look at this. I was in a hospital last election day visiting people who were sick and a couple of people were there who had come from out of town for a couple of hours to visit people in emergency. They could not vote because people have to be at their poll to vote. That is disenfranchising people and hopefully that problem can be addressed in the future.</div>

It talked about the very serious situation that faces women who are homeless in Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems that we know existed with the legislation that was passed in the first session of this Parliament, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, was that it did not go out of its way to assist people who were homeless to register and vote in elections. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the bill that we are currently debating tries to fix one of the glaring problems created by the previous legislation, which is the disenfranchisement of rural voters, I wonder if the member might comment on how the legislation that we are debating now does anything to ensure that homeless people will be able to vote in federal elections. For instance, it does not allow for statutory declarations. It does not allow for someone to vouch for more than one person at a poll. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a woman finds herself in a transition shelter, it would not allow the person who operates that shelter to vouch for all the women who happen to be living at that place at the time of a federal election. The person who vouches also has to be someone who is on the voters list in that poll, so it is a very limited possibility for ensuring that those people who are homeless or in some kind of a transition at that moment are able to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member might comment in light of this very disturbing report that came out yesterday on women's homelessness in the north.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised the question about homelessness during the original debate, urging the committee to make sure that as much as possible was done there. It is also the reason I asked the question, which has not been answered yet, that the member raised about the number of persons an eligible elector can vouch for. We have to make sure that people in those situations can vote and I know the committee is looking at that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was delighted to be present for the release of the report, having read the executive summary, and to be there with the Liberal critic for women's issues. We were two MPs who attended the release yesterday. It contains horrific stories which, living in the north, I see all the time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was delighted that a number of things requested in the report were in the Liberal leader's anti-poverty plan. For instance, with regard to poverty for children, the Liberals would make the non-refundable tax credit refundable so that the poorest of poor could be helped by that tax credit. It does not help them at all now because if they do not pay taxes, they cannot receive the credit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we would expand the national child tax benefit which has been a widely acclaimed program in Canada, but we would make it even bigger and better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also do three things to help seniors, which are part of poverty and homelessness in the north. First, we would increase the old age supplement, which goes to the poorest of poor; second, we would try to ensure that if one spouse dies, the other does not get dragged, for bureaucratic reasons, below the poverty line; and third, we would try to reward people who wanted to go back to work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also work with other orders of government on items like affordable housing, which is obviously a big need, and continue our support for homeless shelters. There are a lot of good projects in my riding, I do not know about the rest of the country, through the SCPI program. There was no shelter at all before and now there is one, but it is certainly not totally suitable for the needs of women and, as the report said, 16 to 18 year old women. There are not enough services related to substance counselling and, in particular, in local areas there is not enough legislation related to landlord and tenant acts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I highly recommend that everyone in Parliament look at this report. It is very thick. It dealt with the homelessness and poverty of women in all three territories and the excruciating effects it can have, particularly where there are excessively cold, harsh conditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 50° or 60° below, as the member who used to live in Dawson knows, people cannot be homeless and lie on the streets. They have to go somewhere and probably somewhere they should not be, such as where their children can be abused or they have to provide services they do not want to just so they can survive the night. These are horrendous conditions in the north. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769860"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a very wealthy country with the amount of surpluses that we have, I would highly recommend that each party look at the recommendations in the report and try to put those into their platforms.</div>

I would like to provide a bit of background on why we are seized today with this bill. In February 2007, the House of Commons passed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which changed the Elections Act to reduce the chances of fraud or error by strengthening the requirements around the identification of electors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of these changes, Bill C-31 became more like the Quebec Election Act. It was nothing new, therefore, for us in the Bloc Québécois. Bill C-31 will be in effect in the next election campaign and came into force at the time of the last byelections in Quebec. Voters now have to present a piece of government-issued identification containing their name, photograph and home address, for example a driver’s licence. Voters who do not have identification containing a photograph must supply two pieces of acceptable identification in order to establish their identity and home address. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief Electoral Officer will issue a list of the acceptable pieces of identification that electors can present at polling stations. We had one during the last byelection in Quebec. The identification can range from a credit card or credit card statement to a telephone bill or any other document that makes it possible to quickly identify the elector. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potential electors who go to a polling station without two pieces of identification will be required by law to take an oath that they are who they say they are. In addition, a person who has already met the voting requirements can vouch for them. So it is very simple. If a person does not have two pieces of identification, someone who has already voted and met the requirements and who has his or her identification can vouch for that person. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This seemed very acceptable to us. Of course, there are always exceptions to any good rule. We had to review the situation in light of the recommendations by the Chief Electoral Officer, who told us that more than 1 million Canadians do not have a home address in due form. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can understand that in Quebec. Until 2000, I was the mayor of a small town. I was given the opportunity to be the warden of the MRC and one day the president of the Union des municipalités du Québec. I can say that in the 1980s, a number of the smallest communities in Quebec did not have street numbers, door numbers, etc. The Government of Quebec asked all these municipalities to have addresses with street numbers and door numbers. This required a major investment. People had to go through the Commission de toponymie to get street names and so forth. The effort was made in Quebec, in areas that had municipalities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are still some areas not organized in municipalities. In Quebec, there are thought to be about 15,000 people who are affected. This figure also includes people with no fixed address, the homeless and so on. According to the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, there are about 15,800 electors who do not have an address consistent with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, passed last February. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at what happened in the other provinces, such as Newfoundland and Labrador, we see that approximately 23% of voters would not be able to vote because they do not have a home address with street number. This means that they have rural addresses with only P.O. box or rural route numbers. This was the case 20 years ago in Quebec. So we can understand why other communities decided not to invest in this. In Ontario, 150,000 voters are affected and in Saskatchewan, there are 189,000. In Nunavut, approximately 80% of residences do not have individual addresses. So we can understand why this bill aims to regularize the situation and enable these people to vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the proposals in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> seem acceptable to us. In short, the bill amends the Canada Elections Act to make the rules more flexible, making it possible to verify the residence of voters living in areas where the municipal address on ID cards is a P.O. box, general delivery or rural route. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610">(1610)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill states that if the address on the ID card provided does not establish the voter's residence, but corresponds to the information found on the voter's list, the voter's residence would be deemed established.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a voter whose ID card shows only a rural route address would be able to establish his residence if that address corresponds to the information on the voter's list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, if the voter's list shows that a person lives on rural route #2 in a particular place, and the identification shows the same address, it would be possible to make the connection and the bill would not require a street name and number as it did before. There would be enough information to make the connection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the case where one voter vouches for another. I gave an example of this earlier. Under the current act, someone who has an address and knows someone who does not have an address with a street number or does not have two pieces of identification can vouch for that person. People without addresses cannot be vouchers under the current act. Now, people who have proven to scrutineers, Elections Canada workers or the people responsible for supervising the vote that their general delivery address is the same as the address on the voter's list—and who therefore have previously exercised their right to vote—may vouch for another voter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, these people can be allowed to vouch for voters who have no identification. The current bill keeps the references to pieces of identification, but allows rural routes in lieu of addresses with street numbers as addresses that match what appears on the voters list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, it is good that this bill can make things better for 15,800 voters in Quebec with no fixed address. The same problem exists in the other provinces, so the bill makes things better for the million voters the Chief Electoral Officer mentioned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have heard from members of other parties in this House. This measure must not nullify the whole principle of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which was introduced in the last session. We want to be able to avoid fraud by requiring two pieces of identification. We must not allow statutory declarations. What some members are trying to say is that we should go back to statutory declarations. A person simply has to take an oath to be entitled to vote. What we want is evidence, identification or someone who can vouch for someone else. Otherwise, this bill would call into question or have the opposite effect of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which was passed in February 2007.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want Quebeckers who are watching us to know that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> of February, 2007, is identical to the Election Act of Quebec. In Quebec, when we vote, we have to show identification. The federal legislation was much more lax. In the past, this resulted in mistakes and possibility for fraud. Quebec has always been a leader. Since René Lévesque, who overhauled the entire electoral system, political party financing and so forth, Quebec has always led the way in electoral legislation. We must applaud the Government of Canada for yet again modelling its legislation on legislation in force in Quebec and for the decisions it makes here in this House, with tremendous support from the Bloc Québécois. We are always proud to help the rest of Canada benefit from the good things in Quebec. Often, the best things come from Quebec. I am sure that the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',113961,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=113961&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</A> can attest to that. As a former mayor, he knows quite well that we are always leaders in Quebec, but lately with the Conservative government, we have been falling behind in forestry and the development of the manufacturing sector.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the federal government would agree to invest in its jurisdictions in economic development, if it would agree to listen to the recommendations of the Government of Quebec, of Premier Jean Charest, who is not a sovereignist, things would be better. Premier Charest asked the federal government to intervene and help the manufacturing and forestry sectors.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw that the Conservative government's recent policy statement, its mini-budget, offered absolutely nothing to deal with the crisis in forestry and manufacturing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, which follows on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, is a good piece of legislation. It modernizes the Elections Act and is based on legislation that has been in force in Quebec for almost a decade.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be nice if, in other matters such as aid programs for the forestry and industrial sectors, the Conservative government reacted to and relied on the good advice it is being given by the Bloc Québécois MPs and the Government of Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, it is sad to see our colleagues from Quebec who agree to sit here, to sit at the same table as the hon. members from the rest of Canada, who do not have the same interests as Quebeckers. What can I say? They might understand, one day. There are seats available here on this side of the House for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we always have to pay attention and be alert. After all, we are here to stand up for citizens. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> was introduced in response to a complaint from Canada's Chief Electoral Officer, who wanted voters with no fixed street address to be allowed to vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois intends to stand up for their interests and supports the government in helping the Chief Electoral Officer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the Chief Electoral Officer, however, we always have to be very careful. When he asks for something, that is one thing, but when we do, that is another thing entirely. Let us not forget what happened during the last election campaign in Quebec, for the byelections. All of the parties in this House asked the Chief Electoral Officer not to allow people to vote with their faces covered. He did not comply with the unanimous decision of the members of this House who asked him to act in a timely and efficient manner like Quebec's chief electoral officer did.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make sure this message reaches Canada's Chief Electoral Officer. This bill can help him. However, when all of the parties decide to recommend something, he should comply with that. After all, he is a public official. We want him to be neutral, but the position is a political appointment. That raises some questions. The Conservatives appointed him. They were very upset when he allowed people to vote with their faces covered. But since they were the ones who appointed him, they played it down later. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, by introducing a voter identification bill in this House, they are trying to correct one problem by creating another. The Conservatives are often conflicted like that. They want to solve the problem of veiled voters, but that means staff at polling stations will have to be women. Clearly, by solving one problem, they are creating another. That is often the case with the Conservatives. That is why they are languishing in the polls. In my opinion, they will continue to languish for some time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we hope here today to help those who do not have a fixed address. I explained this at the beginning. Something like this happened in Quebec in the 1980s. The tiniest communities did not have street names or civic numbers. That is understandable. Now, out of seven million residents in Quebec, there are only 15,000 people who do not have one. We understand that not all provinces have invested in this way. We can respect that reality, and help those people, while respecting the fact that they must produce identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> states that, even if a voter does not have a civic address, he or she must bring identification. If that identification indicates rural route number 1, without a house number, and if the voter registration indicates the same information, that is, rural route number 1, that is considered a match.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, this bill would allow these people to vote. That is the aim of the bill, and we support it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give an example of the identification required. A list, which can be updated for every election, was drawn up by the Chief Electoral Officer.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620">(1620)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it was not included directly in the bill. However, concerning ID cards, for all the voters listening here today, it could happen sooner than one might think. One never knows. There could be a federal election any time. With a minority government, any little slip up could trigger an election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to know that the identity cards that will be accepted must include a photo and address, like a driver’s licence. Otherwise, it will be necessary to produce two other pieces of identification; in particular, those with a photo but without the address, such as a health insurance card in Quebec. It could be a matter of a health insurance card, a social insurance card, a birth certificate, a driver’s licence, obviously, a Canadian passport, a certificate of Indian status, Canadian citizenship certificate or citizenship card, a credit or debit card in the voter’s name, a Canadian Forces identity card, a health care card, an employee identification card produced by an employer, the old age security card, a bus pass, a student card, a library card, a liquor store identity card, a card from Canadian Blood Services or Héma-Québec, a hospital card, a fishing permit, a wildlife identification card, a hunting licence, a firearms acquisition certificate, an outdoors card or permit, a provincial or territorial identity card, or even a card from a local community services centre. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, these pieces of identification are accepted. Original documents with a name and residential address are also accepted; credit card statements, bank account statements, public utility bills, municipal property tax evaluations, school report cards, residential leases, statements of benefits, as well as income tax notices of assessment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be understood that there is no shortage of pieces of identification. Obviously, the easiest is to present an identification card with photo and address, like a driver’s licence; however, not everybody has one and we are well aware of that. Next, there is a whole list of documents with name and address, two of which could be presented in order to vote, whether they have a photo or not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The residents of Quebec should recognize that it is the same thing for the provincial elections: they must always bring their pieces of identification when they go to vote. As for the people who are responsible for applying the law, they should know that it is done out of respect for the institution; that is to say to ensure that the right people are voting. The procedure is very respectful. It will help election workers prevent fraud and error.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all, we are not falling into the trap where we allow the famous declaration under oath, without requiring any piece of identification, as was previously allowed. A voter could declare that he or she was the proper person without those who were working at the polling station really knowing that person’s identity. It was enough just to make a declaration. From now on, that will not be tolerated. An eligible voter will have to vouch for someone who does not have the proper identification. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not have identification, you must be accompanied by someone who fulfills all the conditions—an individual who has identification, who was able to vote and who can vouch for you because they personally know you. This is allowed but you have to be accompanied by someone who knows you. Therefore, if there was fraud or whatever, the person who vouched for you would be responsible and liable to legal proceedings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is pleased to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> at second reading. We hope that amendments will be made quickly because elections can be called earlier than anticipated when a minority government is in power, particularly when the government acts like a majority government, as is the case at present, and is very arrogant towards the other parties. As the chief organizer of the Bloc Québécois, I am in a position to say that we will be pleased to go head to head with the Conservatives anywhere and anytime.</div>

    </p><a name="Para769906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bill before us, it is clear that the person who goes to vote, but who does not have an address and wishes to vote, can do so provided that they are accompanied by someone who fulfills all the conditions and who vouches for them. That has always been the case. My colleague would like a voter without an address to be allowed to swear an oath.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us here today allows people who do not have an address to vote, on the condition that they have a vouching elector who meets all the requirements. This changes nothing. This is how it is done in Quebec and no one has lost their right to vote. A voter simply has to know someone in the same polling division. Voters cannot report just anywhere, and at any time, to vote. Even in the case of homeless people, someone nearby usually knows them. Someone will be used to seeing that homeless person on the street corner. If they report to a polling station, someone who knows them can vouch for them. That is how it works. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague is trying to say that the scope of the bill must be expanded to include those who do not have identification and who know no one. Evidently, this already exists in Quebec, and we are not having this problem.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some measure, we are not prepared to allow just anyone to go and vote. What the hon. member is proposing is even worse. It would be more advantageous for them to never produce any identification. It would be much easier to enforce the NDP's solution. In Quebec, this would mean turning back the clock 10 or 15 years, which we are not prepared to do.</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para769926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some of those statements. He said “Improve the accuracy of the national registry”. Where, in any of the discussions we have had over the past while, do we see a better enumeration system? Clearly, that is one thing we need. Many of the problems we have in the voting system in Canada come from the attempts of the current government and previous governments to reduce the work and the effort that is put into the enumeration system across the country. That is one of the serious problems we have with voting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> will not change that. They will not make the system more complete. They will not ensure that people are carefully enumerated and that we have the kind of system that our parents and grandparents built up over many years.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it facilitate communication with the electorate? I do not see how that will happen with these two bills. What we are going to see is a situation in which many people will find, for one reason or another, that they do not have the proper identification or the proper address or that the address does not match. They are going to be turned off voting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is going to happen with a lot of very young voters. That is going to happen with voters who are in disadvantaged situations across this country, the homeless, the poor and the people who have to work long hours and do not have the opportunities that others do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that federal employees have consecutive hours off work in order to vote. The people who are less advantaged across this country will find it more difficult to vote. They are going to have to ensure that on voting day they carry their identification and make even more of an effort than they are accustomed to in many cases to carry out what is their fundamental, democratic right in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is responsible for the bills that it brings forward and for the accuracy and the scrutiny that should go into every piece of legislation that is as important as this one, as important as this legislation that goes to the fundamental nature of our democratic system, which is the right and the ability to vote and the certainty that a voter has when he goes into the voting booth. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has completely failed Canadians here. It has brought forward another piece of legislation wherein they are attempting to fix their mistakes yet it does not go far enough. Our party says that if the government wants to fix the mistakes in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> then it should go back to what the NDP said previously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we proposed previously was to allow the voters to swear that they are who they say they are at the polling station. Then, if there is doubt about the identity of the voter, the voter would put forth sworn testimony that they are who they are and they have the eligibility to vote in that riding. That is trust in Canadians and Canadians deserve our trust.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last four elections, where probably in excess of 60 million votes were cast, there have been four cases of voter fraud. All this work that we have been doing in Parliament is taking a big sledgehammer and knocking down a tiny gnat. That is voter fraud in Canada. This bill is a huge sledgehammer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as for improving the administration of elections, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> is going to turn the next election day into a fiasco. We are going to have hundreds of thousands of people, millions of people, standing at polling stations across the country, people who do not understand the rules, who do not have the proper identification and who do not have everything lined up. Canadians are used to voting one way and they will come out to vote and find that the rules have been completely changed. The administration of elections in this next period will be a mess. It will reflect badly on this country and on the voting process of many citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find these reasons to be bogus at best.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what is going on here. We are taking the time now to bring a bill forward that will assist Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> and some of the errors that were made in that bill in terms of the layout. I heard the comments today from the Conservative government that the opposition did not pick up on these mistakes in committee and therefore it is the fault of the opposition that the bill is not correct.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we doing this? The most cynical bone in my body says that this is a social conditioning exercise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be followed by other social conditioning exercises to ensure that Canadians slowly give up their individual freedoms and slowly find that they have to show identification for whatever they are doing at every step of the way in this country. I do not like that. I still feel that Canadians are trustworthy and that we should encourage trust among Canadians. The concept of continually asking Canadians for their identification at every possible opportunity is the wrong road to go down. Those are my views on dealing with those issues. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640">(1640)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to move on now to issues that concern my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month I had the opportunity to attend a meeting at Paulatuk, a community high on the Arctic coast. We talked about photo ID and identification. There is no place in Paulatuk to get identification. The residents have to go to Inuvik, which requires a plane flight, to get any kind of identification. Quite obviously, many of the residents do not have current identification. They do not need it in Paulatuk because everybody knows everybody. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people in Paulatuk go to the polls on election day, the returning officer is going to ask for verification for all kinds of people and they will not have the required identification. They do not have the opportunity to go to Inuvik. They do not have the opportunity to get that set up. That will make a travesty out of a community's life. People who have known each other throughout their whole lives will have to show identification to each other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a difficulty. That is a fundamental problem within this legislation. It does not deal with the honest and trustworthy nature of Canadians. It does not consider that. Unless someone proves who they are, says this legislation, they must not be who they say they are. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if an elector has identification but it is not quite what is wanted, as I have said, what happens is that under proposed subsection 3.2, “a deputy returning officer, poll clerk, candidate or a candidate's representative who has reasonable doubts concerning the residence of an elector” appearing in front of them “may request that the elector take the prescribed oath”. We are putting it in the hands of all those people to decide the trustworthiness of that Canadian, but we are not allowing the Canadian himself to say that he is trustworthy and give his oath that he is a citizen and is legally within the jurisdiction and has the right to vote. To me, that is the solution we should be going forward with. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes that are going to be made with this bill will help a problem that has been created by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, but will not help the problems inherent within it. They will also discourage Canadians from voting. They will reduce the already pathetic voter turnout in this country. They will probably reduce it among those who should vote, those who are disenfranchised from the system, those who need to express their opinions on politicians and the people who run this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult situation for anyone who did not support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. We are being asked to repair some damage that the bill caused, not nearly all of it, but we are still going to leave our electoral system in chaos in the next election. The government is still not providing a decent rationale for its actions. It is not coming clean with Canadians about what it is trying to accomplish here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> is totally inappropriate because it does not go far enough toward fixing the problems that have been created with the other bill. Until the government realizes the fundamental mistakes it made in the previous legislation, how is it going to fix them with this patchwork? How is the government going to make the changes that are going to make this work for Canadians in the next election and elections in the future? It is not. That is the problem.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can send this bill to committee. We can try to work with other parties in Parliament to fix errors in a bill that is not appropriate, but that is not good enough. For Canadians, one of the only hopes we have now is what is happening with the charter challenge on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. It is being challenged in our courts for its unreasonable nature in terms of our fundamental rights as Canadian citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to wait and see. Perhaps this problem will be solved for us by the courts, but that is a crying shame when we look at what has happened here in Parliament with this kind of legislation and the direction the government has taken. It is a real shame.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am disappointed in the government. I am disappointed for my constituents. I do not want any of my constituents not to be able to vote, whether they are students travelling from one community to the other or transient people who have changed their address but have not changed it on their identification. Whatever the problem is, we will see problems with this bill that are hard to judge today, but they definitely will show up on election day. It will cast the whole system into some considerable doubt and will create a lot of pressure for change after the next election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what we were doing when we brought forward Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> or what the thinking was there, but as a Canadian, as someone who prizes my right to vote and the right of every other citizen to vote comfortably and cleanly without any conditions put on that right, I am not happy with this. I do not think the bill is appropriate. I certainly hope that the courts will adjudge the same. That will solve the problem for us and bring it back to the reality of our electoral system, our voting system, which has worked well for us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were examples of large scale fraud that came before the courts, we might have a case to say that we needed to be more vigilant here. We should have opened up the whole act and looked at how to review it to ensure that deputy returning officers and poll clerks all have the proper authority to deal with the issues that come in front of them. Instead, we took this course. Is it a course that is going to work for us? I do not think so. I think we have taken the wrong course and we need to right it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this Parliament does not do it, perhaps the courts will. I hope the voters realize this when they go into the voting booth in the next election and realize which parties caused the problems that they see in front of them, when they see the lineups and the people rejected from voting. I hope they think about it when they are going in to vote and I hope they cast their votes accordingly, realizing what the government has done to the system that was working well and was in place, a system that needed more work on the enumeration side and that needed the electoral act to be looked at in certain ways to ensure that the performance of the officers involved in conducting the elections is proper in this day and age.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the things we should have looked at. We can attempt to fix this in a small fashion with this bill.

I will go this far with my hon. friend from Western Arctic in saying that the government has the responsibility to bring forward legislation in various areas, including, in this case, democratic reform. However, it has missed the boat substantially. It did not take heed of loopholes or gaps in the legislation as it was reviewed by the Senate.

    </p><a name="Para769965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I differ from my friend from Western Arctic, although I deeply respect his comments.

    </p><a name="Para769966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I respect his philosophical point of view but will he and his party not be blamed if thousands--in fact we know it is millions in the affected ridings--of people in his riding show up and cannot vote because his party did not act to do the band-aid approach, which is what this is, but will, nevertheless, put more voters back on the list by pushing it along and improving it in the committee and bringing forward the concerns that are deficiencies in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> that my friend has raised?</div>

We have proposed a solution that would deal with the issue. We have proposed that voters would be permitted to take an oath as to their legitimacy in voting in a particular riding at a particular poll. It is a simple solution. Why is it not adequate for the government? Why is it not adequate for the very small number of voter fraud cases that we have in this country? Why are we creating this convoluted mess in this country? Why are we not taking the simple solution?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bill goes forward to committee, we will still be asking for a simple solution to this. I do not know whether the amendment would be possible at this point in time. If we have to go ahead with an amended bill that is not amended in a simple fashion but in a more complex fashion, then we will be talking about it when the voters go to the polls. We will be talking about the failure of those parties to deal with the voters' rights.</div>

The only reason this bill is in front of us is because of what I said Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was from the beginning, which is a solution looking for a problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found a couple of bills to date. We have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, which is what we are debating today, and we have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. I suppose we will have a couple more bills before it is all over.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go through the bill, one clause states that when swearing an oath to prove someone's identity, the person who vouches for another individual does not necessarily need a civic address on his or her ID if the information on the voters list matches up with the information on the ID.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee heard from groups of advocates, people representing the homeless, people representing aboriginal people and people representing students. The people representing the aboriginal people were very clear on this issue of civic address and all members of the committee heard it. They said that we would have problems identifying voters because some people do not have a civic address. I invite all members of the House, including members who may have been on the committee, to look at the blues and read the witnesses' comments where they invited us to look at this concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they were saying is that if we were to go ahead and do this, we would be disenfranchising people, and did we disenfranchise people. We disenfranchised not a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand, but probably millions of people. Why? It is because the House, in its infinite wisdom, passed a bill that was not sufficient. It was not sufficient because the committee, I would submit, did not do its homework. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the committee for more time to hear from witnesses beyond the list that we had in front of us and I was told, in the instance of the privacy commissioner, no because it had already heard from her. I had to take it upon myself to write to her and obtain a response about the whole issue of privacy and birthdate information. She readily supplied me with an opinion of the bill contrary to what members of the committee had believed, which was that there were concerns about privacy in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would submit that we have in front of us a bill that is trying to mop up the mess that was created by a bill from the government. I would like members, perhaps during questions and comments or to seek me out afterward, to provide me with an explanation or an instance where Parliament has passed a bill and, within months of it coming into force, has had to come up with further bills to deal with the problems in the initial bill. We are now up to two bills, and counting, based on the flaws and problems in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know members of the government will say that I did not raise these problems in committee and that I did not have the wisdom of knowing that these things would come up. I would suggest that I did not foresee all of the problems but I certainly saw the problem, which was the way Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was crafted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crafting of the bill was taken from a committee report. What seems to be the Conservative Party playbook is that committees are used to put forward one's agenda. A fairly lengthy report was written by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, there was a government response and within a week a bill was in front of us called Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para769987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was introduced because there was a concern about potential voter fraud, and I triple underline “potential”. When this was put in front of parliamentarians, they said that it had to be dealt with right away and cleaned up. In fact, that is what the committee did by way of hearing from a limited, in my opinion, number of witnesses. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705">(1705)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para769988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It heard from witnesses like the Chief Electoral Officer who was asked if voter fraud was a major problem. They all heard quite clearly that it was not and that there had been approximately four cases of potential voter fraud in the last three elections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent a large amount of time on it and we are spending more now trying to deal with this outrageous problem of voter fraud, but I have to give the government credit because it was clear in saying that it was potential voter fraud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to submit that the concerns of my constituents are around cleaning up politics, ethics in politics, and integrity in the system. There is much more concern about candidate fraud, when candidates say they are with one party one day but wake up the next and lo and behold they are not a Liberal candidate anymore but rather a Conservative cabinet minister. Constituents are more concerned about how to deal with that kind of lack of integrity, where people can run for a party, cross the floor, and virtually within minutes it seems jump into government or into cabinet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about going from the backroom of the Conservative Party into the Senate and then vaulting into cabinet? Those are the concerns that my constituents have around the integrity of our electoral system. They are not concerned about potential voter fraud other than not to make matters worse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding my party, what Parliament has done is pass a bill that disenfranchised so many people. In committee we talk about this often and say we should always be vigilant for the unintended consequences of legislation. We all know this. We heard from people who were advocates of the homeless and from aboriginal people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about people who are living in rural areas. We identified that what we have now in front of us is a concern about actual addresses. We heard from people who were representing students. The surprising fact is that when we were at committee they told us quite clearly this would be a problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did we do? We did not consider it to be that big a problem and that it would all be fine because we knew better. Well, we did not know better and here we are with a bill to prove it. It is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we did not do is consult. I have said it before, that our job is to consult and after we have consulted, consult some more until we are absolutely sure we have done our homework. That is not the case in the instance of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. We in fact had worse than that. It was not unintended consequences but some intended consequences with birth date information. It bears repeating that in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> there were unintended consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not hear this from witnesses and everyday people at all, this need to have birth dates on the voters list as an oversight requirement. However, what was really strange and quite disturbing was that we had intended consequences at committee. Not only would the bill have one's birth date information on the voters list but it would be shared with political parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance it was not unintended consequences but very intentional. Our friends from the Bloc brought forward a motion at committee supported by the Liberals. The government joined me in opposing the amendment but lo and behold by the time it got to the House for third reading, it lost its courage to fight for the privacy of Canadians and it collapsed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para769998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my friend from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A> said the other day, the government folded like a cheap suit. It just said, oh well, for the interest of getting the bill through it needed to ensure that it let the amendment go through. My goodness, we had the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, in a letter that I gave to the committee, ask: </div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Is the problem of voter fraud so serious and sufficiently widespread to require the use of additional personal information?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was clear in saying that we should not, but again we had the government and the opposition parties saying that it was okay, that they would let date of birth information go through and share it with political parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of information is analogous to giving people, who would like to use this information for fraud purposes, a little kit. I was calling it a government sponsored identity theft kit. That is what we are giving people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members know that there have been recent reports about concerns regarding credit card theft and people who are able to access bank accounts. What do they need? They need a date of birth and an address, and a lot of harm can be done. We were going to give this not only to poll clerks where, with all due respect to them, that information might get lost, but also to political parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the Liberal Party wanted it because it needed to do a little more in terms of fundraising. The Bloc said that is how it does it and that it had done it before in Quebec. I have no idea what the government was going to do with it. I guess one day it will tell me or it will be written in one of its member's memoirs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, what we have is a privacy problem within this bill. Then we have a problem with leaving hundreds of thousands of people off the voters lists, and now we have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> in front of us. I submit that not only did the government not get the job done and did not do its homework on this bill but that we also opened it up to having the unintended consequence of invading people's privacy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really have to question why, at a time when all politicians and all parties are saying we want more people to vote and we want to get young people interested in politics, we put up these barriers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to give the example of Ontario, where Ontario has made some changes to the requirements to vote. It did not do a very good job at all in telling people that when they go to the voting stations now they have to provide some ID. Voters have to tell the poll clerks their names, their postal codes, et cetera. Having taken part in the most recent provincial election, I know of a senior in my riding who, when I knocked on her door to ask her if she was going to vote, said “I tried to vote but they would not let me”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exactly what is going to happen in the next federal election and I am not sure that this bill is going to solve that problem. The reason she said that is because she did not have the required ID and she had no one to vouch for her.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can guarantee members that that will be the situation for hundreds and thousands, if not more, Canadians if we do not change the law. The law needs to be changed for people who do not have the requisite identification, in this case a senior who had lived in this particular domicile for more than a decade and did not have the requisite ID. We are going to see people disenfranchised like never before. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what we will see unless we change the law, with something like a statutory declaration, is people who are disenfranchised in the rural areas, in the north, in the urban areas, as well as homeless and transient people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do is take a good look at this bill and at what the poison pills are in this bill. We saw the poison pills in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. Are there any in here? I would submit there are a couple and I would just ask the government to do a very simple thing and look at enumeration. Why in heaven's name is it not going to engage in universal enumeration at every election for the universal suffrage of all of our citizens that we so obviously respect?</div>
    </p><a name="Para770011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is not only to have universal enumeration and spend money there, but to make sure we train people properly. Those are nuts and bolts things, common sense things that we put forward at committee. The statutory declaration was another thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, regarding the voting cards that everyone is so concerned about, and I am one of them, that are ubiquitous in some of these lobbies, put them in envelopes for goodness' sakes, address them to the voters, and if the voters are not present at those domiciles, they would be returned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, these cards are left around and open to potential voter fraud, I agree, but for goodness' sake, use this terrific new technology called an envelope, address it to the elector, and if the person does not live there anymore, it will be returned to sender, in this case to Elections Canada.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715">(1715)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para770014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is yet another way we can improve the system. It is another suggestion the NDP had. We should clean up the voters list, make sure we have actual human beings going door to door to clean it up, put the voters cards in envelopes, and ensure that there is a safety gap with the statutory declaration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that some of the critiques about statutory declarations are ridiculous. It suggests to me that there is mistrust among some members of everyday people, of citizens of Canada. As I said, there should be more scrutiny of people who cross the floor than citizens who are trying to engage in their franchise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to go to committee and try to fix yet another government bill, a mess that was made with the mélange of the three parties to ensure that Canadians will not be left out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should read the blues of the committee. We were told by the Chief Electoral Officer that the way Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was written and the way this bill is written now, goodness knows the way this bill was put through without us trying to fix it, people will show up at polling stations and will be sent away. They will not return.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what will happen at five minutes to eight or five minutes to nine, just before the poll closes, if people have to go get more ID because they do not have sufficient ID or they have to find another person to vouch for them. I can guarantee that people who have been voting all their lives, particularly people like the senior referenced in the Ontario election who had voted all her life, will just plain give up, and that is pathetic. It says that we have not done our job here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not willing to do that, to allow our government to provide legislation that will disenfranchise. My party will not and I will not. We will make sure this bill, from our perspective, will make sure that Canadians, every day people, will not be disenfranchised. Then we will have some semblance of common sense in our electoral system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sincerely hope that the government will engage us this time in some of the ideas I have put forward, three straightforward ideas, and that it will take a look at it with honesty and sincerity, and say that maybe this is not a bad idea.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are talking about our democracy, the foundation and the franchise, people fought for it, as we just celebrated on Remembrance Day. To just let it fray away, to watch it be torn apart because of either ill-conceived notions or worse, as I said before, conceived notions, is not something we in this party will stand by and see happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just wrap up with a couple of comments about what can be done to ensure, through witnesses at committee, that we not have the fiasco and the mess we had with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> yet again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask that parliamentarians go to their ridings. I have done this already. I have talked to people about the proposition of not only Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, but further to Bill C-31, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A> and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>. I am not sure as many people were engaged with Bill C-31. There has been a wake-up call, clearly, because of the mess of Bill C-31, and the fact that we have disenfranchised in a blink hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, hon. members should talk to everyday people in their constituencies and ask them what would happen tomorrow if they had to follow the requirements of the present legislation before us. Would they be able to vote? Would they have a problem finding someone to vouch for them? Would they have the requisite ID?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I underlined the point that at committee we heard from people who said that there would be a problem with civic addresses for people in rural areas.

That is not ideological, or maybe it is ideological. It is about what I thought was a liberal value. I mention John Stuart Mill. Perhaps the member might want a reference on the protection of privacy and look at why we would have birthdate information on the voters list and with political parties.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not want to get into an ideological discourse here. Simply put, of course we will try and clean it up. My point was how did we get here?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed that the government wanted to fix a non-problem when there are so many real problems, such as the prosperity gap, the environment, an Americanized foreign policy, but no. The government chose to fixate on a non-problem and thereby created real problems, and as my colleague has pointed out, both the Liberals and the Conservatives supported the bill. Now they agree that there are perhaps some problems that we pointed out during the debate on <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bill C-31</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder, when I go back to some of the solutions that my colleague pointed out, why not have a clearer, stronger enumeration process that would give us real lists? Why not accept a statutory declaration that would address some of these problems? Could he explain what the government might have been thinking in choosing such an obtuse solution, whereas we could be dealing with very clear and simple solutions?</div>

It is very appropriate that the House return its attention to the proposal in the bill to create August 9 of each year as National Peacekeepers' Day in Canada, especially as all of us have just finished helping our legions and our communities celebrate Remembrance Week and Remembrance Day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to underline that August 9 would not be a holiday, but a day of commemoration, a day of celebration of what our peacekeepers have done in the past and what they are doing today and what they will be doing in the future. On that day our citizens will have a chance to be reminded about what Canada has done in the world and what it can do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill proposes that on that day the Peace Tower flag be lowered to half-mast. It is quite appropriate that the Peace Tower flag would be lowered at half-mast to recognize peacekeepers who have been lost in action throughout our 50 years plus of peacekeeping participation around the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to my colleagues that my riding, now called Algoma--Manitoulin--Kapuskasing, contains the old riding of Algoma and Algoma East which was held by the late Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson. It is a special honour for me to bring forward a bill to honour our peacekeepers. This year, 2007, marks the 50th anniversary of Mr. Pearson's Nobel Peace Prize for his initiative at the UN.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why in the first place should we remember and honour our peacekeepers and why on that day? </div>
    </p><a name="Para770051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 9, 1974, nine Canadian peacekeepers deployed to the Middle East were killed on a routine supply flight from Beirut to Damascus. The airplane was shot down by ground-fired missiles and nine Canadian UN peacekeepers were lost, along with the crew of the airplane. We could have picked many dates. Some suggested, with great respect, May 29, which each year is celebrated as International Peacekeepers' Day, but August 9 is very much a Canadian day and reflects the most significant single loss of Canadian peacekeepers in one day. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the House continues its willingness to support the bill, I am inviting Canadians, especially students, who would not be in school on August 9 but would be preparing for school, to take some time to reflect on what peacekeeping is all about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this place and Canadians in general who think about these things recognize that peacekeeping today is not like it was 30, 40 or 50 years ago. Peacekeeping evolves with the nature of conflict. It evolves with the changing regions wherein conflicts are taking place. The reasons for local conflict change. Demographics change. The types of warfare and conflict change. Therefore, peacekeeping has to change and we have to change with the times.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced, and I am sure my colleagues are convinced, that ultimately peacekeeping and its related peacemaking are the ultimate, albeit altruistic sometimes, goal of our military and in fact of our Parliament and of our own individual work in life. If it is not about finding, making and keeping peace, then really, what is it all about?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take a moment to mention a constituent of mine, Robert Manuel of Elliot Lake, who inspired me with this idea. He helped to promote the idea in Ontario, which has celebrated August 9 as peacekeepers day for a number of years now. With his encouragement and support, we gathered the support of legions across the land. We now have the support of the Royal Canadian Legion Dominion Command for the proclamation of August 9 as peacekeeper day.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will reference speeches made just over a year ago in this place by colleagues, speeches which I reread recently, and I was very impressed. I refer to the speech of the parliamentary secretary who made an excellent speech in support of the bill. She raised some very good points, but she reminded us that a day of recognition for peacekeepers, as is noted in the resolution by the Royal Canadian Legion in last June, was warranted because the government respected the views of Canadians on either side of the issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is right to have said there is a concern. I recognize it and I think we deal with it head-on. When we have a day separate from November 11 to recognize some aspect of our military history, some aspect of our legacy, does that take anything away from November 11? I think the Royal Canadian Legion Dominion Command and local legions everywhere have recognized, no. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliament secretary was quite right in raising the question. The response is, and I think she agrees with this, any day we can establish as a day of recognition of our current soldiers, men and women serving in any capacity around the world enhances the spirit of remembrance. We are focusing on peacekeeping, but in a way all soldiers are peacekeepers regardless of the nature of a conflict.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure if my colleagues would agree, but in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79017,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79017&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</A> the spirit of remembrance is getting stronger. The number of people coming out to events is larger and larger every year. That is because the remembrance brand, a brand promoted effectively and with great strength by the legions and the Dominion Command, is spread out throughout the year. Hence, the movement to Remembrance Week. I am not suggesting a remembrance year, but it is very important that we dot throughout the year other occasions throughout the year where people could be reminded and that helps focus attention even more so on November 11.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciated the parliamentary secretary's comments in that regard. I was most impressed with my colleague from Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, referring to our peacekeepers, who said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I recommend all these speeches to my colleagues in their complete version. I am only able to quote a little bit.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Victoria, who spent time in the military, said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go on to my colleague from West Nova who is fortunate to have in his riding the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre. He spoke eloquently in support of this bill. I will quote from his remarks. He said:</div>

    </p><a name="Para770068"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para770070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point out to my colleagues that in the “Whereas“ section, along with members of Canadian Forces, the bill specifically includes police services, diplomats and civilians. Yes, we are recognizing on August 9 the loss of nine soldiers in 1974 in the Middle East, because the beginning of this was focused on the military. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned we are evolving and now we engage Canadians in a broad range of professions and skill sets to assist, whether they are members of the NGO community, or municipal policemen who volunteered to help, or ambulance or first aid workers. Any Canadian, military or not, who supports Canada's efforts to bring peace, keep peace or make peace is a peacekeeper.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bill I deliberately did not define “peacekeeper”. Each person who thinks about these things can define peacekeeper in his or her own unique way. It is a comprehensive. That is actually the view of the Legion Dominion Command. It has an expanded view of peacekeeper, and I laud it for that. Somebody else may have a restricted view of peacekeeper. It does not matter, as long as what we are recognizing is the spirit of what peacekeeping is all about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite this place from time to time, whenever we have debates on military and peace matters, and I invite Canadians every August 9 in particular to take a few moments to reflect on our legacy and where we are going as a nation of peacekeepers. Imagine being called peacekeepers. It is not the same as avoiding conflict. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would include in peacekeeping the need to be strong and to root out the enemy where necessary. It is not simply sitting back all the time and letting local combatants fight things out. Each situation requires its own solution. It is important that we do not limit ourselves by a specific definition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to underline too that this is not about what we are doing in Afghanistan whatsoever. That is a whole separate debate. I went to a support the troops rally on November 2 in my riding and I was glad to be there. I am sure many of my colleagues were at rallies in their ridings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a non-political event. It did not matter if people believed that we should be in Afghanistan for years or, like so many of us, that the military should pull out of a combat role in February 2009 or tomorrow. That is not the debate. When people support their troops, they support their troops. They are doing a job for us. They are there with a mandate and while they are there in our name, we support them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pay tribute to Sandy Finamore and Bob Tardif of Elliot Lake who sponsored that rally. I commend them for the excellent work they did.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that the bill at report stage had a few very minor amendments. It was made very clear that in Quebec les casques bleus is the standard terminology for a peacekeeper. Therefore, we made sure there was no misunderstanding between gardiens de la paix and casques bleus. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make it very clear that this is not a holiday. It is not even a day of heritage. It is a day of recognition, of commemoration, a day to take time to understand what our peacekeepers throughout history, in the present and in the future will do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the chamber will continue its support of the bill when it comes to a final vote in the not too distant future.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 9 had a special meaning for me. I was driving down the autobahn in Germany, between Baden and Lahr, when I heard the news on the radio of that incident. In fact, the pilot of that airplane was a friend of mine named Keith Mirau. He and I had been flying instructors together in years previous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admonish my hon. colleague just a little. Keith would bristle at being called a soldier. He was an airman, but I know there was no intent there.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not so much a question, but a comment to reinforce something my colleague said. Everything every member of the Canadian Forces does every day is about peace in one way of another, peacekeeping, peacemaking, bringing peace, as my colleague said. I would like people to, as he mentioned, broaden their definition of peacekeepers.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The folks in uniform and the folks out of uniform, who he mentioned, contribute incredibly to peace around the world in one way or another. We owe them our thanks and August 9 is a great day to do that, to just pause and reflect.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1919, Canadians from coast to coast to coast have paused each year on November 11 to remember their brave countrymen and countrywomen who have given their all in the service of Canada. Through this national act of remembrance, we honour all veterans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We honour those who served in war and those who served in peace. We honour those who served in all theatres of war. We honour those who have served in Canada, helping our communities respond to and recover from natural disasters. We honour those who continue to stand for peace and freedom in operations all over the world and most recently in Afghanistan.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation constitutes a specific recognition of Canada's peacekeepers, who have so selflessly contributed to international peace and security. The concept of peacekeeping was a Canadian innovation. Our sterling reputation for peacekeeping is well-earned and is based on a long tradition, indeed, one that spans over five decades.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, Canada played a leading role in the first United Nations Emergency Force, which was established to secure and supervise the end to hostilities in the Suez crisis. That operation distinguished our country and earned us the Nobel Prize for peace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our effectiveness in upholding peace was recognized once again in 1988, when Canada shared in a second Nobel Peace Prize as part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our peacekeepers, and in fact all peacekeepers, continue to be recognized internationally on the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, May 29.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been suggested that we should adopt this day as Canada's Peacekeepers' Day, but as we all know, it is August 9 that resonates nationally for us as a day of recognition for peacekeepers, for it was on August 9, 1974, that nine Canadian peacekeepers serving with the United Nations Emergency Force in Egypt and Israel were in a Canadian Forces Buffalo transport aircraft that was shot down as it prepared to land at Damascus on a regular resupply mission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that day, there were no survivors. This represents the greatest loss of Canadian lives in a single day on a peacekeeping mission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we also know, nine provinces have now designated August 9 as Peacekeepers' Day. Ceremonies are held in communities across the country in honour of our peacekeepers, and now, with legislation, we will have a National Peacekeepers' Day.</div>

Their contribution is commemorated in a very prominent way not far from this chamber. <i>Reconciliation</i>, the peacekeeping monument that sits on Sussex Drive, is still, I believe, the only monument of its kind in the world.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our peacekeepers are also recognized by the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal. This award was created in 1997. It honours Canadians, primarily members of the Canadian Forces and members of Canadian police services who have served as peacekeepers. The Peacekeeping Service Medal is in keeping with Canada's traditional expressions of honour to members of the forces for their service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tens of thousands of veterans of Canada's peacekeeping and peace support operations wear this medal with pride. It is treasured by the families of those brave Canadians who have made the supreme sacrifice in the cause of peace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of these brave men and women who have died in the service of Canada can be found in <i>The Seventh Book of Remembrance</i>. This sacred book, along with the six other <i>Books of Remembrance</i>, is found in the Memorial Chamber here in the Peace Tower. It is a special place of commemoration and reflection.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Seventh Book of Remembrance</i> is a testament to the often very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which our peacekeepers have served. On many deployments, there has been very little peace to keep and, unlike in times of war, the rules of engagement have been much less clear, if defined at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the circumstances, Canada's peacekeepers have strived to demonstrate exemplary discipline and professionalism. Often they must leave their families and homes behind, just as our veterans of the first world war, the second world war, the Korean war and the gulf war did.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With each deployment, they know their mission may require that they put their lives at risk. Canada's peacekeepers have courageously and selflessly served the cause of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. They have prevented wars and saved lives and they have contributed to international peace and security.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Winston Churchill who said, “Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees all others”. That is the legacy of Canada's peacekeepers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than 50 years, our peacekeepers have gone to the far corners of the world to help preserve peace. Their courage has given Canada a well deserved reputation for standing up for the values of freedom, tolerance, respect, dignity and the rule of law. We can only imagine the gratitude of those whose lives have been saved by the intervention of Canada's peacekeepers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterans Affairs Canada has a special mandate to tell the story of those who have served our nation, both in times of war and times of peace, and to keep alive the memory of those who have made the supreme sacrifice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by thanking my colleagues on the Standing Committee of Veterans Affairs for their support for this legislation. I would encourage all my hon. colleagues to help tell the story of our peacekeepers so that more Canadians, especially our youth, will better understand the significance of August 9, National Peacekeepers' Day.</div>

The Bloc Québécois is in favour of this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strengths of this bill are the following: it recognizes the important role played by UN peacekeepers, which should be highlighted here, in this House. The Bloc Québécois is very much in favour of multilateralism as a method of settling international conflicts, and UN peacekeepers embody this approach. The peacekeepers who have died on UN missions deserve to be commemorated. This bill will also give our current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> an opportunity to discover that the peaceful use of our army is something that must absolutely be encouraged.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only shortcoming is the date of the commemoration on August 9, which is not the first choice of the Bloc Québécois.We would have preferred a date that is already universally recognized as the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers: May 29. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a great many reasons to pay tribute to peacekeepers. They are a central element in multilateralism, a principle of conflict resolution that is dear to Quebeckers. The essentially international characteristic of the peacekeeping missions authorized by the United Nations Security Council grants unparalleled legitimacy to any intervention and attests to the determination of the entire international community to take tangible steps to deal with the crises that occur from time to time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, peacekeeping operations alone are not the appropriate instrument for every situation. They must be accompanied by a peace process, not replace it. United Nations peacekeeping operations are an impartial and very widely accepted way of not only sharing the burden, but acting effectively. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacekeepers are present throughout the world. The 18 operations directed by the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations are being carried out on four continents in 10 time zones, employ more than 90,000 people and have a direct influence on the lives of hundreds of millions of others. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to 64,200 people are currently serving as soldiers and military observers, and roughly 7,500 are in police forces. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations also employs nearly 5,250 international civilian personnel, over 11,300 local civilian personnel and approximately 1,720 United Nations volunteers. One hundred and eight countries contribute military and police personnel to UN peacekeeping operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN is the largest multilateral contributor to post-conflict stabilization worldwide. Only the United States deploys more military personnel in the field than the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. There is therefore still a long way to go before multilateralism is the most commonly used form of conflict resolution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005 alone, UN peacekeeping operations rotated 161,386 military and police personnel, made 864 flights into or out of the field, and carried 271,651 cubic meters of cargo.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actions of peacekeepers are usually effective. Since 1945, UN peacekeepers have undertaken 60 field missions and negotiated 172 peace settlements that have not only ended regional conflicts, but also enabled people in more than 45 countries to take part in free and fair elections. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations successfully completed peacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste, and fulfilled its mandate of helping to establish domestic institutions and providing these as yet fragile societies with the opportunity to establish lasting peace.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805">(1805)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para770141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demining operations managed by the UN Mine Action Service, part of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, facilitate the deployment of peacekeepers to Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of security, recent peacekeeping missions have been carried out in some of the most difficult and least governed areas ever encountered by international missions. These operations have provided practical assistance on the ground to extremely vulnerable populations. Peacekeepers are deployed to areas where others cannot or will not go and play a vital role by paving the way for the return to stability and, ultimately, for peace and long-term development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a clear correlation between the decrease in the number of civil wars and the increase in UN peacekeeping missions. The number of UN peacekeeping operations has more than quadrupled since the end of the Cold War. Since 1990, this renewed international activism has grown in scope and intensity, and the number of crises, wars and genocides has begun to diminish accordingly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to peacekeeping and security, the peacekeeping forces have, with increasing frequency, been responsible for supporting political processes, building legal systems, creating law enforcement and police forces, and disarming former combatants. For example, through their disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program, the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone alone has destroyed 42,330 weapons and more than 1.2 million bullets and shells. It has also disarmed 75,490 combatants, including 6,845 child combatants, and provided an allocation to and ensured the reintegration of nearly 55,000 veterans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations mission in Timor-Leste has created a business women's group that trains women entering the public service and ensures that they are heard in the new government and structures of civil society. Today, women represent over 25% of parliamentarians in that country. That is one of the highest percentages of female parliamentarians in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UN peacekeeping is cost-effective. A survey by Oxford University economists found that international military intervention under Chapter VII of the UN Charter—action taken when peace is under threat—is the most cost-effective means of reducing the risk of conflict in post-conflict societies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approved Department of Peacekeeping Operations budget for the period from July 1, 2005, to June 30, 2006, was approximately $5 billion. This represents 0.5% of global military spending. A study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated that it would cost the U.S. about twice as much as the UN to conduct a peacekeeping operation similar to the UN stabilization mission in Haiti.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will end here with those statistics and illustrations, because it has been proven that peacekeepers are a necessity and the Bloc Québécois is very proud of that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para770150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time in this place we have initiatives on which everyone can agree, and I think we all welcome those opportunities. This day to honour peacekeepers is one initiative I fully support and I believe everyone in the House supports. It is one that is in step with what we all came here to do, which is to certainly represent our constituents, but to also represent what makes our country distinctive, what we can be proud of as Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians, from time to time, are noted for being modest, which is a good thing, but there are times when we need to celebrate our history, our institutions and what makes us so different and unique.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the former prime minister, Lester B. Pearson, who came up with the idea, and if he were still living he would certainly say that he had a lot of help with the idea, but he clearly was the person who was able to capture the imagination at the right time to come up with a different way of solving conflict.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members will know their history. In 1956, when there was a problem in terms of how to deal with the Suez conflict and how to have a proper troop withdrawal at the time the French, British and Israeli troops were extricating themselves from Suez, the brilliant idea of peacekeepers came forward. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, we were suffering from a lack of imagination about how to deal with conflicts. It was the post-World War II era. There were, quite frankly, conflicts similar to what is going on in the world now. We did not have the capacity, the ideas and the institutions to deal with conflicts in a creative way. It was in 1956 that the idea of what is really the first modern peacekeeping initiative took place. Lester B. Pearson was given the Nobel Peace Prize after that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly hope we figure out a way that this day, notwithstanding that it is in August, can be brought in to our school curriculums across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that if members have a chance, they should travel down Highway 7. Not far from Tweed is the Pearson Peace Park and the Pearson Peace Award is given out every year. Those are extremely important ideas and touchstones for our country. The Pearson Peacekeeping Centre is an important well from which to draw, particularly now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that many veterans are working in support of this. In fact, the Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans Association will be more than delighted to see this initiative. It happens to have its own mission statement: “To be a strong and leading advocate for all veterans, to create and nurture a forum of comradeship for veterans and to govern the CPVA democratically and effectively on behalf of all its members”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does that because it wants to ensure that the idea of peacekeeping is not seen as something just thrown into the history books, that it is something that stays with us, that the important historical concept not only is referenced, but is something we employ.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that presently we are at a crossroads where we do need to invigorate our commitment to peacekeeping. We see that now and we know that Canada has, in terms of peacekeeping commitments, fallen behind. However, I will not get into a long discourse about that. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815">(1815)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para770160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the idea of honouring peacekeepers might invigorate the debate about Canada's role in the world. There is no question that peacekeeping has changed. Things change and evolve, but the idea of having blue helmets resolving conflicts throughout the world and dealing with human security is an important one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reference an initiative that actually falls in line with honouring peacekeepers. It was something that was presented to the previous government but it still has merit. It is the idea of the United Nations emergency peace service, a proposal that is in keeping with our tradition of peacekeeping. The proposal is straightforward. It states that when we see a humanitarian crisis, such as a genocide or massive human rights abuses, we should have a United Nations emergency peace service, a rapid response to: first, take action to prevent war and dire threats to human security and rights; second, to offer secure emergency services to meet critical human needs; third, to maintain or reinstate law, order, penal and judicial processes with high professionalism and fairness; and fourth, to initiate peace building processes with focused incentives to restore hope for local people, their society and economy so they may have a promising future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN emergency peace service proposal would be designed to provide a rapid response to these needs. It would possess five unique strengths. It would be permanent and based at UN designated sites, including mobile field headquarters, and be able to act immediately to cope with an emergency. The proposal goes on to talk about all the other things the service could do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of having a United Nations emergency peace service is to take the concept that is a Canadian one of peacekeeping, and see it evolve. It needs to be resourced and to be given a little more permanence and structure but it is something that would honour the history and veterans of our peacekeepers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an idea that has been discussed. I know that Dr. Peter Langille, who is presently with an organization called Global Common Security, which happens to be here in Ontario, has promoted the idea. He has worked with other stakeholders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be interesting to take this opportunity for a peacekeeping day to have a conference on the idea of a United Nations emergency peace service to see if we can engage not only our government but other stakeholders in the possibility of doing that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a terrific idea and I hope it is one that we can use to leverage more support for the idea of peacekeeping so that it does not become a footnote in our history books but it becomes a very robust and important institution that we have for our present day.</div>

    </p><a name="Para770168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, 120,000 Canadians have been killed in conflicts since World War I. This includes several hundred peacekeepers who have been killed serving Canada and the world in this capacity. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79017,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79017&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</A> for recognizing our Canadian peacekeepers who have earned the respect and admiration of the international community. His speech was as erudite and articulate as ever. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is a continuation of our strong support for veterans across our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was honoured to speak at the Thunder Bay South cenotaph ceremony and then I visited five other legions across my riding. For those who may not be aware, that is about a 1,000 kilometre round trip.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we discuss Canada's role in Afghanistan, it is especially appropriate to remind ourselves that peacekeeping is an honourable aspiration for us and brings us to the point of our current role in the world. That we support our combat troops in Afghanistan is unequivocal. Their end goal, as mentioned, is peace. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an expanded role for Canada's military in this troubled world?</div>
    </p><a name="Para770174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I was one of two Canadian members of Parliament who were part of the team to ratify the compact with Iraq in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Besides the secretary general of the United Nations, the prime minister of Iraq, Condoleezza Rice of the United States, there were many other presidents and heads of state representing 80 countries. Canada is very fortunate to have a capable team in its foreign affairs department, and thus most of the hard negotiations had already occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has contributed $300 million to assist in five areas, including: security reform, such as training police; governance in electoral processes; humanitarian assistance, such as landmine removal; basic social and economic needs, such as safe water and new classrooms; and democratic development, such as building a free press.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our participation in Iraq is minor, it is a chance for us to reaffirm our role as independent peacemakers. Several diplomats told me off the record that Canada's role has been diminished by our doing whatever the president of the United States tells us to do. Canada has a way to go to restore the damage this has inflicted on our reputation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These meetings set in motion a process to help rebuild Iraq into a free and democratic nation. As with all peacekeeping, there can be no illusions about how difficult and lengthy this process can be, but this is a model that can serve to restore freedom to other oppressed countries. The reconstruction of Europe, Japan, and more recently Croatia, are examples of what can be achieved through sincere international cooperation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What troubled me the most as I discussed our role in the world was the loss of our neutrality by snuggling up too closely to the United States. This has cost us, in some measure, our position as a peacemaker in the world. Some say they agree with this and that might sound acceptable, except I truly believe that the world needs more negotiators, arbitrators and neutral referees to settle these conflicts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our loss of status by becoming a mini clone can only be overcome by asserting ourselves as a nation that knows its own mind as a sovereign country. We used to be the country the rest of the world trusted because we were independent thinkers. We do not need to be in lockstep with the United States. In fact, we are undermining our own foreign service by becoming essentially parrots of American foreign policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do value our relationship with the United States, but if we do not make our policies as an independent free nation, we lose the respect of the rest of the world. Americans are our best friends and great neighbours, but I believe they also want to respect our sovereignty.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives at Sharm el-Sheikh described the importance of these conferences, “that finding stability in Iraq is the key to world peace”. Many leaders of national delegations stated frequently that these were historic meetings that could only come about as a result of people who do peacekeeping. Yet Canada did not even send a senior minister and my job as an observer was to study and report. I returned to Canada quite troubled by the loss of reputation. People representing other countries asked me what has happened to Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap up, a National Peacekeepers' Day will be part of the process of restoring our national pride as we honour those who died in the cause of peace and those who continue to strive to make our world a safer place.</div>

They all spoke eloquently and I appreciate that they spoke in favour of this private member's bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to use my concluding few moments to thank, as I thank all the members of this House, the veterans affairs committee for its support. It took its responsibilities seriously when Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073167,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073167&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-287</A> was on its agenda. We had a good discussion and some very helpful changes were made. I appreciate that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to thank the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78979,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78979&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</A> who was the seconder at third reading. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to underline that this is another way to say that we support our troops. It is a way of saying that Canada's role in the world, while not easy in terms of its military presence, is not easy to define. If we start from the premise that we are at our core peacemakers and peacekeepers, and however we define what a peacekeeper is, if we start out from that philosophical premise, from that spirit, then we will ultimately do the right thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to pay homage to the veterans in my own riding and the ridings of all of my colleagues, and especially aboriginal veterans who have often been unsung heroes in Canadian military history. I just want to remind the House that our job is to represent everyone, not just those who voted for us, but between elections everyone in our ridings. We have people on all sides of the spectrum. If there is one thing we can agree on, it is that as our country moves forward and as our quality of life improves, it is incumbent upon us to do what we can to share our values, our wealth and our vision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our peacekeeping efforts, whether they are through the military or whether they are through our NGO communities, our police forces, our diplomatic corps, in all ways we are serving our children and our grandchildren, indeed the future generations who will depend upon how we conduct our business at this point in the history of the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to a successful vote in the near future.</div>

    </p><a name="Para770203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, when my hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A> asked a similar question regarding the problem of tobacco smuggling in Canada, I was disappointed that the parliamentary secretary was still unable to answer the question or demonstrate that he truly understood the problem we were talking about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even more surprising because he had nearly two weeks to do his homework, to examine the issue and provide us with a reasonable answer. Since he knew that I would be asking him for further clarifications here today, I imagine his staff must have had a few minutes to brief him, so he can finally answer our question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, obviously, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',114001,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=114001&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence</A> did not understand the file we were talking about. However, tobacco companies, citizens and representatives of all kinds want to prevent smoking and are lobbying for action to tackle this problem. He should have known, first of all, that the main problem with tobacco smuggling has to do with the fact that it involves domestic smuggling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his responses to both my colleague from Marc-Aurèle-Fortin and me, the parliamentary secretary did his very best to talk about border services and customs seizures. The problem is not contraband getting through customs. That is not the issue. The problem is that cigarettes are being made on Canadian territory and, in most cases, are intended for distribution only within reserves to aboriginal people who have the right to consume them. However, they are being bought, distributed and consumed illegally outside of reserves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we will not catch these people at the border. These people are not involved in cross-border contraband operations. They are operating on our own soil. In light of that fact, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',114001,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=114001&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence</A>'s suggestion is a strange one. It makes me think of a police officer standing on a sidewalk in front of a bank, arms crossed, watching the street and thinking everything is under control while people are robbing the bank behind his back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must act. I hope that in the response the parliamentary secretary will provide shortly, he will show that he understands that the problem is not at the border, but on our own territory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something else I found surprising was that when I suggested the possibility of seizing vehicles belonging to people involved in contraband activities, he said that was not allowed. Yet the 2001 Excise Act enables police to seize a vehicle when they have reason to believe that it is involved in contraband activity. Here, we are talking about contraband activity taking place with the full knowledge of the general public. That makes it very easy for the police to know or have good reason to believe that a person has products intended for illegal sale, such as cigarettes, in his vehicle.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken several measures to help address the issues of contraband tobacco.

In fact, with funding from the 2006 budget the RCMP is adding another 70 customs and excise members between now and 2010. These new RCMP members will be strategically deployed to enhance enforcement of cross border crime including tobacco smuggling and illegal tobacco operations elsewhere. We have also increased audits of tobacco manufacturers and growers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP conducts a wide array of enforcement activities to combat contraband tobacco in close cooperation with first nations police services, where a lot of the problem resides, the Canada Border Services Agency, as well as other domestic and U.S. law enforcement agencies, not just at the border.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian law enforcement agencies are working hard to combat the trade in illicit tobacco by reducing both their supply and demand.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the federal tobacco control strategy, the RCMP and CBSA have dedicated intelligence analysts and officers to closely monitor the illicit tobacco market. This information helps develop a complete picture of the illicit tobacco trade and helps identify the highest priority threats.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House may know, demand for illegal cigarettes remains strong despite the health and safety risks of such products. The RCMP is aware that illicit trade in tobacco products in Canada stems from a variety of sources and closely monitors emerging trends in the manufacture and sale of illicit cigarettes. The RCMP is working in close collaboration with law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border and in the local communities to combat illicit tobacco trade and related crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result seizure levels are currently at their highest level since the early 1990s and are a direct result of successful operations conducted across the country. In 2006 more than 500,000 cartons of illicit tobacco products were seized along with vehicles, goods and money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCMP strategy outlines concrete actions that are being undertaken over the next three years. These include: collaborating with domestic and U.S. partners to interdict key criminals and seize their proceeds of crime through innovative cooperative law enforcement models, and heightening awareness about the public safety and health consequences of the illicit tobacco trade, whether cross border or in the local communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These collaborative measures taken by the RCMP, CBSA and domestic and U.S. partners are concrete actions to reduce the availability and the demand for contraband tobacco products.</div>

    </p><a name="Para770225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to know is whether the government plans to make more systematic seizures by going into areas where this illegal trade is going on in the open, for example, in small shops at the side of the road, where people drive up, fill their trunk and leave. It is very easy to identify these people. Does the government plan to take real action and go further?</div>
    </p><a name="Para770226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this trade has a huge impact. The loss of revenue for governments is in the order of $1.6 billion. A lot could be done with that money.</div>

I agree with my hon. colleague that it is a difficult problem for police forces, whether it is at the border, the RCMP, or local forces, to catch some of the folks who are doing it in these local areas. All police forces, the RCMP and local forces, are stretched quite badly with respect to resources. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have increased the capacity of cross border agencies. We have increased the capacity of the RCMP. It is going to take a little time to do that. The size of the force has been allowed to degrade over a number of years. We are building that back up. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a lot of cooperation, as there is today, and that will improve as forces have more resources, local and RCMP, to combat these kinds of activities and that will only improve as time goes on.</div>

    </p><a name="Para770231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers in the beef industry are taking historic income losses, with prices at the farm gate absolutely tumbling into negative levels for the last several months. Many are faced with no choice but to attempt to refinance or even close down their farm operations and many are taking that option, which is very serious. These farmers are watching in fear and frustration as their life's work disintegrates before their very eyes and the government does nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I asked the question, the response I received from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105844,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105844&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Secretary of State (Agriculture)</A> was nothing short of idiotic. The secretary of state showed absolute disrespect on the government's part for struggling farmers, farmers losing their life's work because of events beyond their control, farmers who put high quality food on Canadian tables, farmers who are the key generators of wealth for all others in the food chain, and farmers who contribute to export dollars and Canada's positive balance of trade.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope the parliamentary secretary tonight, on behalf of the government, has some positive program and financial dollars to announce for suffering beef and hog farmers in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How serious is the crisis? As one producer in my riding told me, for several months now he has been losing $20,000 in equity every week as the dollar goes up in value. Another sold cattle for $1,400 per animal in April and in October for $900. We certainly have not seen prices come down on consumer shelves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fed steer prices in Alberta fell by 13% in the last eight months while costs rapidly escalated. It has been noted that 40% of the cow-calf herd operators in Alberta could be out of business by Christmas. Bred cows are being sold at disaster prices, if they can sell at all, at between $300 and $700. This is a nationwide disaster and the government has a responsibility to act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not just numbers. These are people. These are farmers. These are people who live in communities and are in serious financial trouble while the Government of Canada sits on huge surpluses. In fact, many are saying that this income crisis is worse than that caused by the closing of the border when we were struck by BSE. </div>
    </p><a name="Para770237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during the BSE crisis cattle producers had the support and understanding of the Canadian public. It is not the same today and there is a huge difference in Ottawa. During BSE farmers had a government that cared and acted while the new government seems struck by inaction at best and incompetence at worst.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to emphasize how governments can respond, let me draw a comparison when BSE happened. The previous government acted. Yes, there was CAIS, but it was inadequate to do the job and instead of using safety nets as a crutch for inaction as the new government is doing, the minister of the day, Andy Mitchell, acted with the following: $520 million for the BSE recovery program, $200 million for the cull animal program, $680 million for the transitional industry support program and 10 others--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, since taking office, the government has announced a number of programs that will benefit farmers and processors.

    </p><a name="Para770242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government has also eased labour shortages in processing plants. We gave $51 million to improve the temporary foreign workers program.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, our government, along with the provincial governments, is providing $130 million to minimize the costs of Canada's enhanced feed ban. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working with industry to come up with solutions that will meet its needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The national Beef Industry Value Chain Roundtable continues to work hard to address the various competitive challenges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we put farmers first, targeted advanced payments are starting to flow. This will give farmers much needed cash.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January, $600 million for NISA-type programs will come into play. As we know, farmers have requested this type of payment since the previous Liberal government scrapped NISA.</div>
    </p><a name="Para770248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government is providing carefully planned and strategically implemented support to the beef industry. Support must be provided based on a viable plan to ensure a sustainable future.
