<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SALES TAX AND EXCISE TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 2001 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (for the Minister of Finance)</B>  moved 
that Bill C-13, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
introduce second reading of Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 reaffirms the government's commitment to making our 
tax system simpler and fairer, not only for individual Canadians 
but for Canadian businesses as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin setting out the measures in the bill, I would 
like to mention that the consultative process leading to its 
introduction is an excellent example of co-operation between the 
government and the business and tax communities to achieve the 
shared objective of improving our tax system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government, allow me to take this opportunity to 
thank those interested parties that brought forward their views 
on the many issues addressed in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 implements measures relating to the goods and services 
tax, the GST, and harmonized sales tax, HST, that were proposed 
in budget 2000, as well as additional sales tax measures proposed 
in a notice of ways and means motion tabled in parliament on 
October 4, 2000.  These measures are aimed at improving the 
operation of the GST-HST in the affected areas and ensuring that 
the legislation accords with the policy intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also implements two amendments to the excise tax 
provisions of the Excise Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first clarifies provisions relating to the deferral of 
excise taxes on automobile air conditioners installed in new 
automobiles and on heavy automobiles at the time of importation 
by or sale to a licensed manufacturer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second provides discretion for the Minister of National 
Revenue to waive or cancel interest, or a penalty calculated in 
the same manner as interest, under the excise tax system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will set out the proposals of the bill as contained in 
the 2000 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST-HST is designed to ensure Canadian businesses and goods 
are competitive in the export markets.  Some of the measures 
proposed in the 2000 budget and contained in C-13 are intended to 
achieve these objectives.  These measures concern, more 
particularly, the following: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST-HST treatment of export distribution activities; the 
provision of warranty services by Canadian businesses to 
non-resident companies; the provision of storage and distribution 
services by Canadian service providers in relation to goods 
imported on behalf of non-residents; and finally, sales of 
railway rolling stock to non-residents. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a few moments to briefly summarize each of these 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registrants engaged in export distribution activities involving 
the limited processing of goods for export face a cashflow cost 
that may be significant in relation to the level of value added 
to the goods.  This can be the case where goods are imported for 
minor processing and subsequent export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cashflow issue arises because tax is paid on the importation 
of the goods but no offsetting tax is collected on their export. 
As a result, the business must finance the tax until the receipt 
of a refund from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal for an export distribution centre program contained 
in the bill addresses the cashflow issue faced by low value added 
export oriented businesses by allowing them an export 
distribution centre certificate to purchase or import inventory, 
or to import customers' goods on a tax-free basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure will help ensure that the GST-HST does not present 
an impediment to the establishment of North American distribution 
centres in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would note that a national consultative process took place on 
this issue that involved many interested parties from all regions 
of the country, including constituents in my area near Pearson 
airport.  We think the prospects for this are very exciting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Canadian businesses supplying warranty repair or 
replacement services, Bill C-13 contains a measure that would 
help protect the competitive position of these Canadian 
businesses relative to their foreign, particularly U.S., 
counterparts. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, import duty relief is accorded in the case of 
goods imported into Canada for repairs under guarantee, provided 
the goods are exported once the work is done.  However, when the 
good imported is replaced rather than repaired, the import duty 
relief does not apply. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to extend the relieving rules to cover 
situations where a replacement good is provided under warranty 
and is exported in place of the original imported defective good, 
for example, where the original good is destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal would ensure that the GST-HST does not make 
Canadian suppliers of warranty repair or replacement services 
less competitive relative to foreign suppliers when these 
services are provided to non-residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 also expands on a program known as the exporters of 
processing services program.  This program allows the tax-free 
importation of goods by a Canadian processor for the purpose of 
processing the goods in Canada and subsequent export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program ensures that the GST-HST does not impose prohibitive 
cashflow costs on Canadian service providers by their having to 
pay tax on their customers' goods at the time of importation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the program does not apply where a Canadian processor 
only provides storage or distribution services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to expand the program to allow access to 
businesses that provide only storage or distribution services for 
non-residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another proposal relating to cross border transactions contained 
in the bill concerns sales of goods delivered in Canada to 
non-residents who intend to export the goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special rules under the GST-HST system allow an unregistered 
non-resident person to acquire goods, and most services in 
respect of goods, in Canada without paying GST-HST, where the 
goods are bound for export and remain in the possession of 
registered Canadian service providers before being exported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 proposes amendments in order to ensure that this 
objective is met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, an amendment is proposed relating to the sale of 
railway rolling stock to non-resident businesses.  The current 
rules do not permit the sale of the rolling stock to be tax free 
if there is to be any use in Canada of the rolling stock prior to 
its export.  This restriction does not reflect current industry 
practice because rolling stock is rarely shipped empty to its 
U.S. destinations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes an amendment so that the use of railway 
rolling stock to move goods outside the country in the context 
of the exported rolling stock does not of itself result in the 
stock not being exempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations on the proposed amendments I have just mentioned 
were conducted with a number of businesses operating in the 
transportation of goods from and to Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fruit of these discussions is in the proposals contained in 
the bill which will improve the operation of the tax system in 
these important export sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to an important sales tax initiative that 
budget 2000 proposed for the rental housing sector which is 
likewise contained in Bill C-13.  The bill contains a measure of 
significant benefit to builders and purchasers of new residential 
rental accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing sales tax system, tax applies to new 
residential rental property when the property is acquired by a 
landlord from a builder or on a self assessed basis when the 
builder is the landlord.  For purchaser landlords, the tax 
becomes payable upon purchase of the residential complex.  For 
builder landlords, the tax becomes payable as soon as the first 
unit in the residential complex is rented.  As a result, both 
purchaser landlords and builder landlords finance the tax 
liability up front and recover the tax over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill implements the new residential rental property rebate 
which is a partial rebate of the GST paid in respect of newly 
constructed substantially renovated or converted long term 
residential rental accommodation.  The rebate is payable to the 
builder landlord or purchaser landlord who paid the tax.  This 
will help increase the stock of rental accommodation in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the new rebate will reduce by 2.5 percentage points the 
effective rate of tax on new residential rental property, which 
is the same as the federal tax reduction that applies to new 
owner occupied homes under the existing new home rebate program. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that in addition to the measures proposed in 
the 2000 budget, Bill C-13 contains other sales tax measures 
designed to improve the operation of the GST-HST.  Three of these 
measures are also in the area of real property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill proposes a refinement to the existing new 
housing rebate program which reduces the cost to consumers of 
building or purchasing a mew home.  Refinements are proposed to 
allow new homes to qualify where they are used primarily as a 
place of residence, as well as to provide short term 
accommodation to the public in certain circumstances as the case 
is with many bed and breakfast establishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-13 would address a problem that arises when a 
consumer who has purchased real property from a vendor and has 
paid GST or HST subsequently returns the property to the original 
vendor without having used it.  Currently there is no mechanism 
by which the consumer can recover the tax paid on the initial 
purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment contained in the bill would allow a 
consumer in this circumstance to recover the tax paid on the 
purchase of the property if it is returned to the original vendor 
within one year and pursuant to the original contract.  This 
would place a consumer returning real property in a similar 
position to a person who returns new goods to a vendor and 
receives a credit or refund for the GST or HST that was 
originally paid on the goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third real property measure contained in the bill relates to 
the sale of land by individuals.  Hon. members may know that 
sales of real property by individuals or personal trusts are 
generally exempt from the GST-HST, provided the individual or 
trust has not used the property in a taxable business.  The bill 
proposes to ensure that a sale of real property cannot be treated 
as exempt from sales tax if the seller was previously leasing it 
to other persons on a taxable basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these amendments relating to real property transactions 
reflect the government's commitment to ensure that our tax system 
is fair and efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will recall, last year's budget contained proposals 
that reflect the government's commitment to continue to work 
toward improving the quality of life for all Canadians.  Quality 
of life has many dimensions, including access to quality health 
care and education.  Bill C-13 builds on the spirit of that 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of health care, the bill proposes an amendment to 
continue in force an existing GST-HST exemption for speech 
therapy services that are billed by individual practitioners and 
that are not covered by the applicable provincial health care 
plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to education, Bill C-13 contains a measure that 
will extend the sales tax exemption for vocational training to 
more situations, including cases where the training is supplied 
by a government department or agency rather than a vocational 
school.  Specially, the amendment will do away with existing 
conditions on the exemption that required that the training or 
the resulting certifications be subject to certain government 
regulation or that the school be run on a non-profit basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed change will ensure that vocational training 
provided in different provinces receives the same GST-HST 
treatment regardless of the regulatory regime that exists in each 
province with respect to vocational schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further amendment would add the flexibility for providers of 
vocational training to elect to treat their services as taxable 
where their clients are commercial businesses that would prefer 
to pay the tax and recover it by way of input tax credits. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for charities, our government is also taking into account the 
major role played by these agencies, which Canadians by 
enriching the lives of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes amendments so that the GST-HST legislation 
accurately reflects the government's intention to generally 
exempt charities from having to pay tax on rent and related 
goods. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated at the outset, Bill C-13 also contains amendments 
relating to the non-GST-HST parts of the Excise Tax Act which 
deal with excise taxes on specific products.  Among those 
specific taxes are excise taxes on automobile air conditioners 
and on heavy automobiles which have been imposed since the 
mid-1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1984, these taxes have been payable by the manufacturer at 
the time of delivery to an automobile dealer.  Payment of the tax 
is effectively deferred at the time of importation and on 
immediate transactions between licensees until the sale to an 
automobile dealer in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several manufacturers have recently challenged the longstanding 
interpretation and application of these provisions with respect 
to automobile air conditioners installed in imported new motor 
vehicles and are seeking substantial refunds of tax.  They argue 
that the relief provided on importations by licensed 
manufacturers does not simply defer payment of the tax but 
permanently exempts these goods from tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly contrary to the well understood policy intent 
and longstanding interpretation and administration of these 
legislative provisions.  Bill C-13 therefore proposes clarifying 
amendments to ensure that there could be no misinterpretation of 
these provisions with respect to importations as well as 
intermediate transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The retroactive application of these amendments is consistent 
with the criteria that were laid out by the government in 1995 in 
the response to the seventh report of the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts.  For nearly 20 years these provisions have been 
interpreted and administered by both Revenue Canada, now the 
CCRA, and manufacturers and importers in a manner consistent with 
the underlying policy intent.  The tax charged on automobile air 
conditioners has routinely been included in the price charged to 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the amount of government revenue at risk is 
substantial. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Practical measures must therefore be taken so that there can be 
no doubt as to the application of these provisions to both 
future and past operations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 contains one other amendment relating to the excise 
tax system.  The bill provides authority for the Minister of 
National Revenue to waive interest otherwise payable under the 
non-GST-HST parts of the Excise Tax Act.  This amendment will 
achieve greater harmonization of the administrative rules under 
the excise tax system with those under the income tax and sales 
tax systems which already provide for this waiver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment will further help ensure fair administration of 
the excise tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with the manner in which this discretionary power has 
been used under the income tax and sales tax system, the Minister 
of National Revenue would have the ability to waive interest in 
circumstances such as where, despite a taxpayer's very best 
efforts and as a result of extraordinary circumstances beyond 
their control, the taxpayer has been prevented from meeting 
certain deadlines and thus has incurred the interest.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 contains another improvement regarding the application 
of the tax system. Hon. members may remember that the Prime 
Minister recently announced a federal on-line initiative, which 
is a key component of the government strategy called Connecting 
Canadians, which is designed to make Canada the most connected 
nation in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, at the outset I would seek consent of the House to 
split the balance of my time with my colleague, the member for 
Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast have the consent of the House to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to Bill C-13, 
amendments to the Excise Tax Act which is, as the hon. the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance has indicated, 
essentially a series of technical amendments to the GST, its 
collection and its administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would like to set down some principles from 
which the official opposition judges all tax related legislation. 
First, we believe that government should take not one penny more 
in taxes from Canadians through any source than is absolutely and 
strictly necessary for the efficient operation of necessary 
programs.  That is to say, programs that are necessary to provide 
core services which are the exclusive jurisdictional 
responsibility of the federal government and, in a sense, to help 
those who cannot help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that basic point, the one test with which I approach all 
fiscal matters is this: I ask myself if an extra dollar spent, 
collected by us through parliament and spent by politicians and 
bureaucrats in Ottawa, will do more good than that dollar left in 
the hand of a resident of my constituency who owns and operates a 
small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, the answer to that question is a resounding no.  The 
dollars we collect, including the approximately $20 billion net 
which we collect through the goods and services tax, is money 
which would be more powerfully used for social good if left in 
the hands of the creative men and women who earn that money and 
create that wealth in the first place.  That is the first premise 
by which we judge all of these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then ask ourselves, if we are going to have taxes to finance 
necessary limited government programs within federal 
jurisdiction, how can we raise those taxes in a manner which is 
least destructive to the economy and which has a minimal 
distortional effect on the choices made by people freely in our 
economy every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House of the dictum that the power to tax is the 
power to destroy.  All through history we see this lesson.  There 
is a brilliant book about the history of taxation and its 
destructive power called <I>For Good and Evil</I> by Canadian 
author Charles Adams.  In the book he relates through the 
centuries, beginning in ancient Egypt, how governments, monarchs, 
parliaments, congresses have imposed taxes which have had 
enormous unintended consequences, and how governments frequently 
do not understand that the power to tax will distort human 
behaviour, often for the worse.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me provide one interesting and humorous example.  In the 
16th century the British crown decided to bring forward something 
called the window tax.  This was during the Tudor era of 
architecture.  All of a sudden, one of the new luxuries which 
indicated social status was the capacity to install glass windows 
in one's residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Windows 98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Yes, 1598.  The government was looking 
for another way to collect more money for the crown or for the 
treasury, because even in 1601 it had the same insatiable 
appetite for revenue as it does in 2001.  It imposed a window 
tax.  It had assessors go across the land to count the number of 
windows people had in their domiciles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, if we go to small English towns today and look at 
some of the Tudor homes, we will see over and over again these 
very clear window shaped spaces that have been plastered over and 
filled in or bricked in.  Why?  It was because 500 years ago 
people understood that they could protect their economic best 
interest by avoiding taxes legally and so they bricked in those 
beautiful glass windows all across England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just one example which demonstrates how the unintended 
consequences of bad tax policy can shut out the light and leave 
people in darkness.  That is the kind of tax policy we too 
frequently see from the Liberal government.  We look from a 
historical perspective at trying to construct a minimal tax 
regime which allows for maximum human freedom and creativity and 
does not distort the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect we, like many Canadians, have many grave 
concerns about the whole range of taxes imposed by this place, in 
particular today with respect to the goods and services tax.  We 
all recall back in 1990-91 when the then Progressive Conservative 
government imposed what at that time was, and probably still is, 
the most despised tax in Canadian history.  It did so over the 
overwhelming opposition of the majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you will remember this, Mr. Speaker, because I believe 
you were a member of this place.  If so, you were certainly 
sitting in these benches vigorously opposing the tax.  You ran in 
the election campaign in 1993 where the central promise was not 
just to amend the tax through technical amendments such as those 
before this place today, not just to tinker with its 
administration and collection, but to kill, eliminate, abolish, 
get rid of and scrap the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However here I am in the House in the year 2001, eight years 
after those solemn promises were made and those undertakings were 
given, and I have in my hand a bill to continue and amend the 
goods and services tax.  It is like Alice in Wonderland.  The 
bill comes forward from the same government which said that the 
tax, which it is now amending, would no longer exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I will put on the record the dismay of so many 
Canadians that the government thinks it can get away with, and 
continues to get away with, perpetuating a tax which it promised 
to kill, slash, abolish and eliminate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point I will make with respect to constructing taxes 
of maximum efficiency is that we must have a tax system which 
allows for accountability on the part of government because, as I 
said, the taxing power is such an awesome destructive power. 
Arguably, next to the criminal law power exercised by parliament, 
the taxing power is the single most weighty and onerous power 
that it wields.  It really can destroy people's economic 
well-being.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often that power can be wielded in a reckless fashion by tax 
collection bureaucrats.  I have in my files literally hundreds of 
cases where law-abiding, well meaning, well intentioned citizens 
have acted in good faith to try to comply with tax laws like the 
one before us today and have found themselves harassed, audited, 
chased down, investigated, abused, and have had their assets 
frozen by the agents of revenue Canada, now the revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why my colleagues and I have brought forward a taxpayer 
bill of rights that would seek to enshrine in legislation, in a 
very clear way, definitive rights of recourse and appeal and 
protection for taxpayers in the assessment and collection 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary says that it is already there but it 
is not.  There is a preambular statement with no sanction and no 
statutory power which is a goodwill statement.  We propose to 
legislate specific standards of performance on the part of the 
CCRA and its employees and clear items of recourse so that people 
do not need to go to court to enforce their common law rights for 
fair consideration under the application of the tax laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn to the specifics of the bill.  We strenuously object 
to the fact that the government continues to reject its 1993 
election promise.  We believe the GST itself collects too much 
revenue as the government does overall.  In fact, we are now 
looking at very substantial taxpayer overpayments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to call them surpluses and pat itself on 
the back.  The only people who deserve credit for these surpluses 
are hardworking men and women.  Notwithstanding the highest 
personal income tax burden in the G-7; notwithstanding that we 
have the highest corporate tax burden in the G-7, according to a 
recent study by KPMG; notwithstanding the fact that the 
government and its predecessor have burdened them with the second 
highest level of public indebtedness in the OECD; notwithstanding 
that we have seen our standard of living, our per capita GDP, 
fall relative to our major competitors for the past two decades; 
and notwithstanding the enormous burden of red tape and all of 
the anti-growth policies of the government; notwithstanding those 
substantial facts, hardworking men and women of Canada have 
managed to produce growth.  The government by raising taxes has 
benefited from that hard work, wealth creation and growth, and of 
course it shamelessly takes credit for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That constitutes a huge amount of overtaxation, well over $120 
billion of overtaxation, that should be refunded to the people 
who earned it and overpaid it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we recognize that the government has failed to accept its 
commitment with respect to the GST, that it continues to overtax 
and that it still fails to bring in something like a taxpayer 
bill of rights which enumerates taxpayer  rights in the 
assessment and collection procedures, nevertheless there are some 
technical improvements to the GST in the bill, to which I now 
turn my attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first point, the bill's primary goal is to correct some 
administrative oversights in the February 2000 budget.  With the 
thousands of bureaucrats in the Department of Finance and the 
40,000-some in the Department of National Revenue, why do we have 
significant administrative “oversights” in key tax legislation? 
That is part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak about administrative oversights, I want to comment 
on the manner by which the bill comes to us.  We in the official 
opposition got notice of the bill about 48 hours ago.  It is a 
detailed technical bill.  We have very limited resources at our 
disposal.  It is absurd for the government to expect the 
opposition properly to execute its oversight function of 
legislation with 48 hours notice on a major technical bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons we end up with administrative 
oversights.  It is one of the reasons the government always 
brings in legislation like this one to correct the mistakes it 
made.  It does not give parliamentarians the benefit of time to 
become properly acquainted with the legislation it proposes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had more time to analyze this, and if the government were 
more generous in accepting and considering opposition amendments, 
we would not find ourselves again and again wasting parliamentary 
time correcting mistakes the government has already made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the mistakes the Liberals have made, which they now 
propose to correct, consist of, among other things, implementing 
new rules to ensure the GST does not impede North American 
distribution centres in Canada.  When businesses import goods 
from the United States or from any other country, rather than 
taxing the goods when they are imported and then applying for a 
GST rebate, they can go through tax free.  That is sensible.  It 
should have happened a long time ago.  It is something industries 
have been asking for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill ensures that no tax is payable on the 
importation of defective goods imported solely to be replaced 
under warranty.  If somebody here buys an alarm clock from a 
Japanese manufacturer and it does not work and they return it, 
the new clock can be shipped back into Canada without GST 
applying on it again.  That is a sensible administrative 
efficiency which should have been in the act a long time ago. I 
see the secretary of state is once again congratulating himself. 
I am not surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also seeks to implement the new residential rental property 
rebate, which is a partial rebate of GST paid in respect of newly 
constructed or substantially renovated long term residential 
rental accommodation.  This is a measure, which my hon. 
colleague, the learned and distinguished member for Wild Rose, 
has long sought to obtain in the legislation.  He has fought for 
it on behalf of constituents for some time, so this section we 
can call the Myron section.  This is a victory for the 
constituents of the member of parliament for Wild Rose.  Let the 
record show that he is getting spontaneous applause even in his 
absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also continues to enforce the existing GST exemption 
for speech therapy services that are billed by individual 
practitioners and not covered by the applicable provincial health 
care plan.  This is also a sensible improvement which should have 
happened a long time ago under the minister's watch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state who applauds sat without acting for I do 
not know how many years while this measure was not in place.  He 
should not applaud his tardiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also seeks, with respect to education, to ensure that 
vocational training across the country is provided the same 
exempt treatment regardless of how vocational schools are 
regulated in each province.  This is an incremental improvement 
in the tax treatment of vocational schools.  I hope the 
government will also use its authority to bring the provinces to 
the table to ensure that credentials provided by such schools are 
recognized from coast to coast.  That is one useful role the 
federal government could play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to electronic filing, the bill removes the 
requirement to apply to the Minister of National Revenue for 
permission to file GST returns electronically and therefore 
allows anyone to do so provided they meet the criteria set out by 
the minister.  This would streamline the ability of people to 
file electronically.  That again is something that should have 
happened long ago.  There are also miscellaneous administrative 
amendments clarifying interpretations of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say on that point that far too often the government makes 
tax policy by news release.  The primary power of this place, 
based on the long history of parliamentary government, is to 
approve the taxation, the ways and means of the crown.  However, 
over and over again very significant amendments are made to tax 
law by news releases coming out from either the Department of 
Finance or the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we will see in this section a number of 
administrative interpretations being clarified but which were 
given the effective force of law by mandate of news releases from 
bureaucrats months if not years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say on the record that it is time we ended this 
usurpation of parliamentary authority and brought it back to this 
place through those kinds of amendments. 
All in all, we in the opposition have a tendency to be opposed to 
any amendments to the GST on the clear premise that the 
government promised to abolish it, not tinker with it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we do support some of the incremental 
improvements in the bill but we believe it could go a lot further 
in improving the administration of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the opposition I want to say that until the 
government finally begins to truly understand—and not just mouth 
platitudes about it—the negative impact that its tax policies 
have on our economy, our families and our small businesses, this 
opposition will continue to be a clarion voice for tax relief and 
tax reform.  While we support elements of legislation like this, 
we will not support the continuation of an overly onerous, 
burdensome and destructive tax regime which the government uses 
to finance its overspending and its wasteful and inefficient 
practices.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to stand in the House on a Friday morning and 
enter into this debate on the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the GST that brought me here.  I do not know whether that 
is widely known.  The most common statement I heard while 
knocking on doors in 1993 was “we are going to get rid of those 
Conservatives who brought us the GST”.   A bunch of people asked 
me why they should vote for Brian O'Kurley when he did not vote 
for them.  Brian O'Kurley was the Conservative predecessor in my 
riding.  It was Brian Mulroney and Brian O'Kurley who campaigned 
for me in 1993 and undoubtedly delivered more votes for me than I 
could possibly have got by myself.  The GST has a history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a very interesting experience the other day.  I was 
preparing to speak on the fact that the government was invoking 
closure in its motion in order to reduce the ability of the 
opposition parties to do their work in the House.  My staff and I 
did a bit of research at the Library of Parliament.  Among other 
things, we looked at some of the newspapers circa 1989 and 1990, 
in that era when the GST was being debated.  It was absolutely 
incredible to read some of the newspaper reports of the day.  I 
was amazed by the outrage expressed by the present Minister of 
Industry at that time.  He was on this side of the House then. 
The outrage he expressed toward the Conservative government that 
was proposing the GST was absolutely amazing.  Also, the present 
Prime Minister was then travelling around the country telling 
people that his government would kill the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as I got here because of the GST, I wonder how many 
Liberals got elected on that same hatred of the goods and 
services tax, sometimes called, in our part of the world—I am 
going to say this real quickly, Mr. Speaker, and then you can 
stop me afterwards—the gouge and screw tax.  That is what it was 
called out west.  The amount of animosity generated by that 
particular tax was absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not aware until last week that the finance critic from 
this side of the House took a number of Liberal MPs with 
petitions out to the Sparks Street mall.  It was recorded in the 
newspapers in 1990.  Those MPs asked citizens to sign a petition 
to stop the GST.  The newspapers had huge headlines about all of 
the overt opposition to the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the history of it.  The Conservatives finally were 
persuaded to reduce the rate from 9% to 7%.  That, they claimed, 
was a victory for the people because they listened to the people. 
I guess they listened like these Liberals listen when it comes to 
tax policy and other issues.  They reduced the rate and then 
proceeded to put it through the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I was researching the use of tactics to prolong 
debate in the House.  Members would not believe what the Liberals 
did on that side of the House in order to try to stop that 
legislation.  They did not introduce 4,000 amendments—I guess 
they were not bright enough to think of that as a tactic—but 
they did all sorts of other things.  Finally it was pushed 
through in a whipped vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, our own member of parliament for Elk Island at that 
time, my predecessor for whom I have a great deal of respect, was 
a real gentleman in the campaign.  I have talked to him several 
times since then.  He is a nice guy, but sitting on the 
government side he had no choice about representing the wishes of 
his constituents in that vote, because it was a whipped vote just 
like pretty well every vote on the government side of the House 
is a whipped vote.  That does not give members of parliament the 
opportunity to represent their constituents.  He was an 
honourable guy, but he was pushed into the system and I suppose 
had no choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in 1993?  I told my friend—and I will call him my 
friend—Brian O'Kurley that he went down with the ship but that 
he as an individual did not take down the ship.  It was the whole 
crew that took down the ship.  Ten years later we now have a 
group of Progressive Conservatives represented over on that side 
of the House in a double file along the wall, five deep on two 
sides.  People just did not ever come back to the PCs.  In the 
last election, the PCs lost some 86% of their vote in Quebec. 
They have very little market share, whereas there is a great 
attraction to formerly the Reform and now the Canadian Alliance 
because we have explicitly as one of our policies that it is our 
primary duty to represent our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to think that had we had a Canadian Alliance type of 
government in 1989 and 1990, that tax either would not have been 
implemented or would have been greatly improved before it was 
implemented.  It would not have been implemented until we had the 
consent of the people.  As it was, the tax was jammed through by 
an arrogant government, with 85% of Canadians opposed to it. 
That was an error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really commend my hon. colleague from Calgary for his speech. 
We must be geniuses who think alike because I was going to use 
the Tudor example as well.  The only difference in the story that 
I remember was that they did not count the windows, they measured 
the windows.  They measured the area.  That was why the windows 
were so small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had a dream that could be fulfilled, because we know there 
are some private members' bills that commemorate this day or that 
day, I would like to have a private member's bill passed in the 
House such that every time people saw a Tudor style small window 
they would be encouraged, not forced, to incant these words “I 
hate huge taxes”.  If every time we saw one of those buildings 
we were to say “that is the result of an arrogant government 
that overtaxes the people”, then perhaps we would start putting 
pressure on the government to reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about the GST and taxes in general, I 
should also say that I have little doubt in my mind that it is 
the presence of the Canadian Alliance on this side that has 
actually made reduction of taxes an issue of debate and has made 
it respectable to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we came along, it seemed to make no difference whether it 
was the Liberals or the Conservatives on whatever side of the 
House.  Each of those governments increased records of the number 
of times they increased taxes and the amounts by which they 
increased taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to think that we on this side had some considerable 
influence on the direction the government is now taking in 
gingerly starting to reduce tax rates.  The government knows that 
the public is starting to hear our message and it knows that the 
public will vote for us if the government does not do what we are 
promising to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at some of the issues the federal government has 
approached, especially in the major campaign document it 
introduced four days before the election was called, namely the 
Minister of Finance's mini statement, and I note that the reason 
those issues were in there was that the Liberals realized without 
them we would make huge gains, and so we would have if they would 
not have stolen from us.  I suppose I should commend them for 
stealing our ideas and tell them to steal more because that is 
the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example of how taxation policy affects human 
behaviour.  One of my favourite stories is that of my own father 
who is now in his 90th year.  My dad was a hard-working farmer. 
He taught us to work hard when we were kids growing up on the 
farm in Saskatchewan.  These days he sees that farmers are 
farming so well and so efficiently, including my brother, who has 
taken over the family farm and expanded it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My dad is deeply distressed and concerned about the fact that 
these farmers farming so well with big equipment on a large scale 
and getting good crops, basically four times as much per acre as 
he was able to raise with his boys when he was a farmer, are now 
struggling for their very existence, with many losing their 
farms.  It is absolutely despicable.  My father has been a farmer 
all his life and still loves to get out there at harvest time and 
watch that grain come roaring out of the chute on the combine. He 
is one who is very practically minded, I can assure members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the GST coming in and my dad breaking the pattern he 
had had for a number of years.  After I left home, my Dad's 
financial situation  somehow seemed to improve.  I wonder whether 
there was a correlation there.  We were very poor when I was 
young growing up on the farm in Saskatchewan, exceptionally poor. 
When I graduated from high school, went on to university, got my 
own job and ceased being dependent on him, somehow at that stage

for a sentence of life imprisonment for the crime of impaired 
driving causing death where aggravating factors are present.

put into force by the Liberal government.

driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak not only for the victims of this senseless crime but for 
all Canadians in demanding that the Minister of Justice get this 
bill into law to help deter impaired driving, to ensure that the 
penalty fits the crime where death is a result, and to help save 
the lives of thousands of innocent Canadians.

just as it did during the ice storm in Quebec or during the 
Saguenay or Red River floods.  What nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence minister should talk to the Prime Minister who knows 
from his many overflights of B.C. on his way to China that much 
of the province is mountainous.  There is only one highway into 
the lower mainland.  It and the two rail lines are vulnerable to 
slides and slumping, which could close them indefinitely during a 
major quake.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that the Canadian position is very

The minister simply expressed the frustration that ought to be 
shared by all members on both sides of the House, which is 
certainly shared by the people in the lumber business from coast 
to coast to coast, that we are interested in a free trade 
arrangement in softwood lumber with the United States, which 
claims to be a free trading nation.

<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the finance minister.  According to the auditor 
general, the Liberal government is hoarding $35 billion in the 
employment insurance fund.  Hardworking Canadians pay into EI 
expecting it to be there when they need it, but because the 
Liberal government has taken $35 billion from the fund most 
unemployed Canadians who paid into EI while they were working now 
cannot get a dime of it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the real world this would be called an insurance scam.  What 
does the finance minister call it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister calls it a very important program 
to sustain Canadians through downturns in the economy.  It has in 
fact done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have substantially improved its benefits.  Parental benefits, 
as an example, are only the most recent indication of what the 
government has done.  The bill before the House is another.  I 
would also say that the accounting treatment of the employment 
insurance fund is exactly that recommended by the auditor general 
in 1986. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal government is not fooling anyone.  Some $35 billion were 
grabbed from the EI fund to make the finance minister's surplus 
look good.  One million unemployed Canadians who paid into EI 
cannot get benefits.  Many who do qualify still cannot make ends 
meet because the benefits are so low.  Bill C-2 will not address 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister is like the princess with the pea.  No 
matter how thick his cushion is he wants more, more, more.  The 
auditor general says this sort of financial mismanagement causes 
waste and inefficiency.  How much more does the finance minister 
plan to take from the EI fund.  If $35 billion is not enough, how 
much is? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member ought to simply take a look at the 
treatment of the fund.  We treat it the way the auditor general 
recommended in 1986.  There has never been a separate fund of 
cash since its beginning.  The hon. member ought to know that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian

amend the Criminal Code (selling wildlife). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, this bill is an attempt to make the 
killing or capturing of wildlife and wildlife parts an offence 
under the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that the bill would not apply to acts 
carried out with a licence, permit or exemption order.  The bill 
is not meant to replace provincial wildlife laws but rather to 
complement them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the bill as dealing only with the most serious offences in 
the same manner that the criminal code is used for the most 
serious driving offences.  It has become apparent that provincial 
laws are not a sufficient deterrent to deal with the 
multimillion dollar illegal trade in animal parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would give provincial wildlife authorities and crown 
counsel the option to proceed by way of provincial wildlife 
legislation or the new section of the criminal code.  Anyone who 
is convicted of an offence under this section would be guilty of 
an indictable offence and subject to a maximum two year sentence 
for a first offence and three years of incarceration for a 
subsequent offence.  If the animal in question is a threatened or 
endangered species, the maximum sentence is four years for a 
first offence and eight years for subsequent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would include such activity as an enterprise 
crime so it would be subject to the proceeds of crime section of 
the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we make every effort to protect 
endangered species and animals from the misuse and abuse of 
hunting and fishing as we know it.  People are making extremely 
large amounts of money by poaching and by illegally killing or 
capturing species that are sometimes endangered.  We need to do 
more to see that it stops.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SALES TAX AND EXCISE TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 2001 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK170">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-13, an 
act to amend the Excise Tax Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was in the middle of an exciting discourse when we 
were interrupted for members' statements and questions and all 
that other exciting part of the day.  I was in the middle of 
telling the story about how taxation policy affects behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary spoke about the fact that rich people 
being taxed on the size of their windows put very small windows 
in their houses in order to reduce taxation.  The tudor type of 
architecture with the small windows was the result of a taxation 
policy many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the middle of relating the fact that my father, who 
bought a new car every three or four years, thought about buying 
a new car in 1991 when the GST came in.  He went to the dealer 
and found one he liked.  He was ready to buy it until he looked 
at the bill.  It had a huge amount for GST.  My dad said that he 
had already paid income tax on the money he had earned and that 
the government now wanted him to pay what was left on the GST. He 
decided not to buy the car.  He walked away from the dealership. 
He did not close the deal.  He said that he would keep his old 
car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local dealership lost business, the salesman lost his 
commission and the owner did not make a profit on the sale of the 
car.  The result of that, I believe, ripples down through the 
whole economy.  My dad, being a frugal person who spent his money 
wisely over the years, made that decision because of the GST.  I 
believe hundreds and probably thousands more Canadians postponed 
purchasing decisions based on the GST.  The GST thereby has had a 
huge effect on the economy of the country.  Taxation has a huge 
effect on the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today discussing the GST.  We are making small 
changes to it in order to improve it.  I believe to this very day 
that there is a lot of anger out there about this most hated tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are businesses in Edmonton close to where I live that 
advertise sales in the papers that are called GST events.  They 
do this today, 10 years after the tax was imposed.  Just about 
every week one of the furniture companies or car dealerships will 
have a GST sale.  In smaller letters, the ads say that the 
company will pick up the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies could simply say that they will give buyers a 7% 
discount.  Some people will show up and pay attention to it. 
However, when a great big sign says “We will pay the GST”, even 
though it is only 7%, people will go to the sales.  It makes them 
feel good when they do not have to pay that hated tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the province of Alberta where we had no sales tax 
until the GST.  It was wonderful.  If an item was marked $4.99, 
we would pay with a five dollar bill and get a penny back.  It 
was very healthy for our economy.  Why is it that Alberta is a 
province which is so well off compared to some of the others?  I 
contend that one of the reasons is that over the years Alberta 
has had a much more rational and less offensive tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It affects me to this day as I spend approximately half of my 
time in Ottawa as a member of parliament and the other half in 
other parts of the country, most of it back home in Alberta. 
Perhaps I should not say this, but whenever I need to buy 
something I buy it in Alberta and bring it back here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not usually have time during the day to go to the stores 
around here, but even if I did I would postpone it.  Not long ago 
I needed some videotapes in my office to record one of my 
colleagues giving a speech in the House.  I bought them in 
Alberta because I did not have to pay a provincial sales tax. The 
provincial government may look at all the money it gets from this 
tax, but we should look at all the money it avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of years ago the provincial government of Saskatchewan 
imposed a tax on fuel.  It then made a rule that every farmer and 
every businessman who submitted their receipts at the end of the 
year could get a rebate of that tax.  In other words, the purpose 
of the tax was simply to tax people from out of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and hundreds of other people responded to that.  My family 
still lives in Saskatchewan.  I go to visit them.  What did I do? 
I used to drive from my home to Swift Current where my family 
lives.  I would visit with them, fill up and drive home again. 
After this tax was brought in I drove to the last gas station at 
the Alberta border.  I filled up, drove to Saskatchewan to visit 
my family, drove back to that town in Alberta and filled up there 
in order to avoid this tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Introducing that tax did nothing for Saskatchewan.  The numbers 
show that its revenue went down as a result.  Meanwhile it had a 
huge administrative boondoggle, taking money and giving it back. 
How am I relating this to the GST?  Let me just finish the 
Saskatchewan example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its revenue went down and its local businesses lost business.  A 
local business used to sell me a tank of fuel every time I went 
down there.  After the tax was brought in, and in fact I do not 
know if it still has this tax, I got into the habit of filling up 
in the last town in Alberta, whether it was Wainwright or 
Provost; driving to Saskatchewan; and making sure to get back 
there before I was out of fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not give them the business any more so they lost the 
profit.  They could have made some profit from me, but they lost 
it because of their government's tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST does the same.  I do not know whether Canadians are 
aware that the GST brings in approximately $50 billion a year of 
gross revenue.  Members will be amazed when I tell them that 
approximately $25 billion of it is sent back in refunds and 
rebates.  That is absurd.  Why have a system where the money just 
spins in circles in a huge centrifuge?  The only thing we are 
supporting by it is a huge army of government bureaucrats whose 
only job is to process the payments of people who have put money 
into a pot when in fact they will get it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago a lady in my riding phoned me and said that her 
small business was in trouble.  It had a couple of gravel trucks 
to haul snow in the winter and to help with road construction 
projects in the summer.  Its old trucks were just about worn out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that small business were to buy a new truck, the value of the 
truck could be depreciated over time, but when it is purchased 
the GST must be paid in full upfront, even though it was entitled 
to some of it back in terms of the way this money goes swishing 
around.  It is a terribly silly, useless, ill conceived and badly 
administered tax.  It was then and it is now.

concerning changes to the excise tax and to the payment of 
GST-HST refunds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have appreciated it if the Minister of Finance had used 
this reform of the excise tax to abolish, at least on a 
temporary basis, the gas tax, in order to give a break to 
independent truckers, in particular, and everyone working in 
industries that rely heavily on gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Way before the last election, we urged the Minister of Finance 
and the Liberal government to take this measure to help those 
who are being badly hurt by the ups and downs, but mostly the 
increase in the price of gas, natural gas and heating oil. Since 
the minister was tinkering with the excise tax, we would have 
expected him to suspend on a temporary basis the excise tax on 
gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are disappointed by this omission given how serious the

the independent truckers who have been having a lot of trouble 
these last two years to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we would have liked to see—and it is sad to say that we 
would have liked to find certain things in Bill C-13 that are not 
there—the Minister of Finance, in this harmonization exercise 
between the tax provisions on GST and harmonized sales taxes or 
the provincial sales taxes like the Quebec sales tax, remember 
that the GST and the Quebec sales tax were harmonized several 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government footed the bill for the harmonization of 
the GST and the QST. 
It was never compensated for the subsequent tax revenue losses. 
It was a disappointment to us, three and a half years ago, when 
the Minister of Finance signed agreements with three of the 
maritime provinces for harmonization of the provincial sales 
taxes and the GST and, moreover, gave these provinces $900 
million in compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has been demanding the same compensation since the 
federal government, that is to say the Minister of Finance, 
announced this $900 million compensation package for the three 
maritime provinces for the harmonization of their sales taxes 
and the GST. 
We are entitled to such compensation. According to calculations 
made by us and by the Government of Quebec, the amount of the 
compensation could be in excess of $2 billion, if we use 
the same figures the Minister of Finance used when three of the 
maritime provinces accepted to harmonize their provincial sales 
tax with the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find nothing about this in the bill, even if it deals 
with harmonization of the GST and of harmonized or provincial 
sales taxes.  This is great disappointment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our arrival here in 1993, we have been asking the federal 
government for real tax reform. This is not to say that the 
harmonization provisions contained in the bill are not valid; 
quite the contrary. The bill contains very good provisions, and 
I will come back to them later. The bill deals with issues 
which should have been dealt with years ago, namely 
the harmonization of federal and provincial sales taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have asked the minister for real tax reform. We did 
not ask for this on a partisan basis. 
Since 1996 we have bein conducting studies and 
making serious proposals to the finance minister regarding an 
indepth reform of personal and corporate taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our proposals were so devoid of partisan thinking that when we, 
in the Bloc Quebecois, tabled our analysis reports, the 
government was delighted and considered them as serious 
proposals for tax reform. Unfortunately, since 1996, apart from 
having congratulated us for our excellent work, the Minister of 
Finance has not undertaken any real tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year after year, in all his reports and more recently again, 
the Auditor General of Canada, 
Mr. Desautels—whom I congratulate, by the way, on his excellent 
work over the past 10 years—spoke of the need for a real tax 
reform.  In his 1992, 1996 and 1998 reports, he also mentioned 
the disastrous effects of certain federal tax provisions and of 
the tax agreements between Canada and other countries throughout 
the world, the result of which could be to erode the federal tax 
base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means certain provisions could decrease the tax 
revenues the federal government could collect if the Income Tax 
Act were properly enforced and if fiscal co-operation accords, or 
tax treaties, were signed with countries whose tax rates were 
similar to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important.  It is so important that in his final 
report, which was a sort of legacy, Mr. Desautels, the auditor 
general, said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest threats to the tax base lies in the 
international activities of Canadian taxpayers, particularly the 
use of tax havens. 
This is not unique to Canada; many nations are working 
individually and together to find solutions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In report after report since 1992, the auditor general has 
spoken about the danger to the tax base of Canadian taxpayers' 
international activities, which are based on tax agreements 
signed with countries not considered to have a normal tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are seen as tax havens, countries whose rates of taxation 
are so minimal and their tax treatments so preferential compared 
to what we have here and in the United States, that these 
provisions, which are permitted under the tax agreements between 
Canada and these countries, lead to a substantial amount of tax 
avoidance. 
It means that, because of investments made elsewhere throughout 
the world in these tax havens, the federal government has been 
losing tax revenues at an alarming rate, particularly over the 
past 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote some figures to give members an idea of the size of 
this phenomenon. In 1999, the last year for which this kind of 
data is available, money invested by Canadians abroad totalled 
$257 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly $28 billion of the $257 billion were invested in three 
countries considered as ideal tax havens, that is countries 
where the corporate tax rate, for example, is nil in some cases. 
It is 0% in some countries, and 2% to 3% in others. Three as 
the countries at the top of the list as ideal tax havens have 
received nearly $28 billion in Canadian investments abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that 10% or so of direct Canadian investments abroad 
have gone to three countries considered as tax havens, with tax 
rates that are ridiculously low or non-existent. 
They are Barbados, the Bahamas and Bermuda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian investments in these three tax havens are larger than 
all the Canadian investments in the whole of Asia. Barbados, in 
particular, accounts for $17 billion in direct investments, and 
these investments are larger than those made by Canadians in 
Japan, France and Mexico taken together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it normal that a country like Barbados, with a very small 
population, can account for that much direct investment by 
Canadian taxpayers? As I mentioned, Canadian citizens have 
invested $17 billion in this small country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to investments in tax havens, they have been growing 
considerably over the last 10 years. 
I will give some revealing figures. I think the finance minister 
should have dealt with tax reform long ago, and he had a good 
opportunity to do so, and should have reviewed the tax 
conventions Canada has signed, particularly with countries 
considered as tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 28,000 companies, subsidiaries of Canadian, British 
and other corporations, operating in the Cayman Islands, the 
population of which is only 30,000. Members will admit that 
there is something odd about the way the Cayman Islands attracts 
businesses in view of its population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British colony north of 
Haiti, there are 7,000 people living in the whole of the Turks 
archipelago—not to be confused with the country of Turkey—but 
there are 16,000 companies, Canadian for the most part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something odd about the way these countries attract 
billions of dollars in Canadian investments. The federal 
government's inaction on this issue has been condemned not only 
by the Bloc Quebecois and sovereignists, but also by 
the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, which published a report a few months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report says that OECD countries that have relations with 
countries that are considered as the worst tax havens, the worst 
contributors to tax evasion—the money that does not go into 
federal coffers, but rather into investments made by the 
wealthiest Canadian taxpayers in these countries—should denounce 
or cancel tax conventions signed with these countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three worst countries mentioned in the OECD report—we have 
nothing against the people of these countries, but it is the 
OECD that says this—were Barbados, the Bahamas and Bermuda. It is 
Canadians who are making these foreign investments in the 
Bahamas.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD condemns these countries as being the worst in terms of 
tax evasion and as being ideal tax havens. The OECD is asking 
its members—Canada is a prominent member—to cancel tax conventions 
that might exist between Canada and other OECD countries and tax 
haven countries. Far from abolishing them, Canada is promoting 
these countries that are considered as tax havens and promoting 
Canadian investment there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a long story short, a tax convention is an agreement 
between Canada and another country to avoid double taxation of 
the profits of branches of Canadian corporations abroad, in 
other words, to avoid the profits being taxed in the country 
where the branch is located and taxed again by federal tax 
authorities when they are brought home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally tax conventions are very useful and perfectly 
justified. A corporation cannot be taxed in the United States on 
the profits its branch generates there and taxed again when 
these profits are brought back in Canada. It would be absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since tax levels in Canada, in the United States and in most 
OECD countries are more or less the same, give or take a few 
percentage points, we can justify the existence of and need for 
tax conventions. Profits generated by Canadian branches abroad, 
in Europe, for example, cannot be taxed at 30% in Europe and 
then taxed again at the same level here. It would not make any 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to countries that are considered tax havens, with 
tax levels of 0% on corporate income—in the Bahamas—or 2.5%—in the 
Bermudas, we have to ask why Canada should sign tax conventions 
with them, especially since the OECD has just condemned this 
practice, which the Bloc Quebecois has been criticizing since 
1993. 
It does not make any sense to sign tax treaties with countries 
where the tax levels are so totally different from ours that 
they are considered tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind that what is invested in these countries is 
not taxed in Canada and that Canadian taxpayers must therefore 
make up for this loss in tax revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not because we now have a budget surplus that we should 
let go of some of our tax revenues by signing tax treaties with 
countries identified as tax havens, let go of hundreds of 
millions, if not billions of dollars, in current and future 
taxes on investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing against wealth or against the wealthy, but there 
is a limit to being the laughing stock of the world, when our 
taxpayers have to compensate for the inaction of the Minister of 
Finance in the area of tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it before and will say it again, the Bloc is no longer 
the only one to urge the government to terminate the tax 
treaties signed with some 30 countries that are considered the 
worst tax havens in the world. Since the release of its recent 
report, the OECD is going after governments that are unfairly 
attracting investments and are hurting most member states of the 
OECD with their tax provisions, which are much too lax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is rather strange—and I will be able to ask the 
Finance Minister about this later—that we still have a tax 
convention with the Bahamas, for example, while the OECD 
financial action task force on money laundering, or FATF, in a 
report tabled on June 22, 2000, points the finger at countries 
that are not co-operating in the fight against money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among these are two countries with which Canada has tax 
conventions and where Canadian investments are astronomical, not 
to say unbelievable. 
I am talking about the Bahamas and Bermuda, the two countries 
Canadian investors like best.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be explained that, the OECD having condemned these 
countries as being rather lenient with regard to money 
laundering, Canada still has a tax convention with them, 
especially the Bahamas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere in all of this there is a problem bordering on the 
ethical. If it were the Bloc Quebecois saying so, one could say 
that these are partisan comments, despite the fact that we have 
tried since 1993 to act in a non-partisan way to propose real 
measures and to speak for Quebec and Canadian taxpayers on tax 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, now the OECD has just released a report that points the 
finger at 35 countries meeting the criteria of tax haven.  The 
finger points as well at countries which do not co-operate in the 
area of money laundering.  Yet we continue with our tax 
conventions with these countries.  There is a serious problem in 
this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we retain the tax conventions but we encourage 
Canadian investors to use these tax havens to swell Canadians' 
savings.  The government is encouraging this tax evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 16, 1999, for example, the Canadian Departments of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade published their calendar 
of special events for 1999-2000 in <I>CanadExport</I>, the departments' 
major trade publication. 
Included was the title of a conference, a seminar given by the 
Departments of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
“Demystifying Tax Havens”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal departments and the Government of Canada promote tax 
evasion, promote the outflow of capital to tax havens.  These 
are the topics covered, in broad terms, in this seminar 
organized by the federal government.  They discussed the origin 
of tax havens and their use as a financial strategy imagine that. 
They encourage the use of tax havens to avoid federal tax 
abroad.  Great morality, this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also discussed the criteria for selecting a good tax haven. 
Not only was the use of tax havens being promoted but they also 
said “Listen, the best one is probably the Bahamas. There is no 
corporate tax. You can do whatever you want. There are no labour 
laws and no environmental laws to speak of. Use the best tax 
haven”. This is the message that was conveyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth theme of the conference—and this is shameful—was “Tax 
havens and Canada's tax laws and how to get the most out of your 
tax havens”. Unbelievable. A seminar organized by the federal 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade teaches 
investors how to save as much federal taxes as possible. 
They are told to take their money abroad, to the best rated tax 
havens, while the taxpayers who are here and who cannot afford 
to pay for financial planners and to invest in tax havens 
continue to pay, continue to be choked by the tax system in 
spite of the tax reductions recently announced by the 
government. These reductions are totally inadequate, given the 
margin available to the government to lower taxes. The middle 
income taxpayers, middle income families, are the ones paying, 
not millionaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millionaires and billionaires use the federal government's 
services to send money abroad without having to pay any taxes to 
the federal government. The result is that we, the majority of low 
and middle income taxpayers, continue to pay taxes and to be 
choked by the tax system. This is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the OECD report that provides a picture of the 35 
countries considered to be tax havens. There is also a report 
from the task force on money laundering, which says that Bermuda 
and the Bahamas are among the countries that do not co-operate in 
the fight against money laundering.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two countries are considered by Canadians as tax havens 
par excellence. Not only do they choose them themselves, but the 
federal Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
tells them how to use them. One day we will have to wake up. The 
members will have to wake up, put on the brakes and say that 
this is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax system has to be changed. We have to make sure that 
there will be no tax treaties with countries considered as tax 
havens in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once read a statement made by David Dodge, the former 
deputy minister of finance and now governor of the Bank of 
Canada. He said that we have to maintain our tax treaties with the 
underdeveloped countries because they help to create jobs and 
wealth in those countries. Fat chance. They have nothing to do 
with job creation or economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that tax treaties with those tax havens do is 
give millionaires and billionaires a chance to get even richer. 
Those who already have money manage to escape taxation here and 
to make even more money because they pay very little, if 
anything, in income tax in the host country. That makes 
absolutely no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 we have been denouncing the existence of tax 
treaties between Canada and the worst tax havens in the world. 
Despite our criticism and despite recent criticism by the 
OECD, which is not a branch of the Bloc Quebecois, or the Parti 
Quebecois calling for the elimination of tax treaties with 
countries that favour tax avoidance, we are here dealing with 
bills aimed at rectifying certain situations or harmonizing 
certain taxes. Obviously, we support this type of measure, but 
there is a fundamental problem with regard to our tax system and 
tax treaties that needs to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the election, considering the fact that the fight against 
the deficit had turned into a surplus accumulation exercise by 
the finance minister, I expected a little more decency, a little 
more serenity with regard to tax reform. 
I expected the government to announce a thorough reform of our 
tax system and a review of problematic tax treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of that, we heard statements of intention and statements 
based on the government's past actions. It says that it has indeed 
brought in tax reform but that there is always room for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not known for being mean but there is a great sense of 
urgency here. When we know that it is not only the opposition 
parties that are calling for a thorough reform of our tax system 
and a review of tax treaties but also the OECD, it means that 
the whole industrialized world unanimously agrees that we need 
to review our tax practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that this has not been done earlier because all the 
evidence is there.  Since 1993, use of these tax havens has 
climbed sharply.  However the example has to come from the top down 
and, in this regard, the Minister of Finance is not setting a 
very shining example.  He himself has companies in countries 
considered to be the worst tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has companies in Liberia, the Bahamas and Bermuda.  How can 
someone have any political will to reform the tax system, to 
review tax agreements between Canada and Bermuda or the Bahamas, 
for instance, when he himself is involved in these countries 
and benefits from the tax agreements between Canada and these 
tax havens?  It seems to me that such a person does not have a 
very strong political will to reform and to review tax 
agreements.  That is the result.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite should stop looking so shocked every time 
we raise this problem.  This is directly related to what the 
Minister of Finance is.  He is a shipowner.  He owns companies. 
He has 13 subsidiaries in other countries considered to be tax 
havens and identified as such in an OECD report.  He is taking 
advantage of this tax avoidance.  How could he be expected to be 
interested in reviewing all this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cannot review it because he is both judge and judged.  That 
is why, given what we know, we should be asking questions.  Is 
it urgent to review tax agreements?  The answer is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should review all tax conventions Canada has 
signed in recent years and, in particular, conventions with 
countries which are on the OECD list and are considered the 
worst tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, talking about the preservation of the tax base, the 
auditor general has made it crystal clear. He said that one of the 
biggest threats to the tax base lies in the international 
activities of Canadian taxpayers, particularly the use of tax 
havens. The situation is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem if we do not act immediately to review and, if 
need be, cancel tax conventions with countries which make tax 
avoidance easier, something rich Canadian taxpayers take full 
advantage of, and with countries which do not co-operate 
adequately in the fight against money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, if the finance minister feels he is both judge and party 
to the case because of his companies and subsidiaries located 
in countries considered to be the worst as far as tax havens and 
tax avoidance go, he should step aside and let somebody else do 
what has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is however doubtful that the Minister of Finance will start a 
movement to reform tax conventions and taxes which could enable 
us to ensure that the most serious threats to the tax base, as 
criticized in 1992, 1996, 1998 and recently in the auditor 
general's report, which covers the past 10 years, are 
countered.  Until they are, I do not think this objective will 
be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government to truly reform taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 deserves some praise.  Taxation is harmonized, 
especially the GST and the HST, which have some value and which 
were long expected.  However, the minister and the government 
must do more than that.  That is important but reform of the 
tax conventions and of taxation is vital and fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surpluses are piling up in government coffers. 
It is a simple arrangement.  Everyone is cut off and it piles 
up.  Do the people not entitled to employment insurance, who 
call for more money for health care and are cut off by the 
government, the students wanting more money for education and 
who are cut off by the federal government, realize that there need 
not have been cuts, if we had had responsible government and a 
Minister of Finance who was not both judge and jury in 
recent years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would have kept their tax base.  We could have built up 
surpluses, but ones paid for by those with the means to pay and 
to fund and not have them accumulated through savage, drastic 
and inhuman cuts to employment insurance, savage cuts to health 
care and savage cuts to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must realize that every time a billionaire invests money in 
the Bahamas with the help of the federal government and of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, that 
money is no longer in the federal treasury. The Minister of 
Finance then gets new money from the poor, from the unemployed, 
from students who have a hard time making ends meet and from the 
sick. 
Is it not indecent to maintain the status quo because the 
Minister of Finance is both judge and jury here?

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming weeks, we will continue to harass the government 
regarding this important issue since the future of the federal 
tax base is at stake. It is an unbelievable injustice that this 
government is promoting when it uses tax havens to tell 
millionaires and billionaires “Such is the Canadian tax system; 
here is what our tax treaties with the Bahamas, Bermuda or 
Liberia provide and what you should do to take advantage of 
these tax havens to the fullest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is telling rich taxpayers how to avoid paying 
taxes in Canada by using tax havens that are being condemned by 
the OECD and that often do not co-operate in the fight against 
money laundering. This is serious stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support Bill C-13 because some provisions are worth 
supporting, we are sending a wake up call to the public and 
asking the Minister of Finance to stop looking after his own 
interests, to stop being judge and jury and to let someone else 
undertake a true tax reform, a comprehensive review of all the 
tax treaties signed by Canada with countries that are considered 
to be tax havens. We will fight tooth and nail for that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to say a few words on Bill C-13 which is before 
the House today.  It deals with a whole number of taxation 
issues.  I only want to make about three different points to 
facilitate this bill going before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the tax bill deals with the GST.  It is rather ironic 
that between 1990 and 1992 the party across the way, and I 
remember it so well, promised to get rid of the GST.  I remember 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage even resigned her seat to go 
back and get a mandate from the people in Hamilton East because 
of the promise to scrap the GST, the goods and services tax.  Now 
we have a government that is bringing in amendments to the GST 
and a taxation regime that includes the GST.  No wonder people 
are cynical of this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If elected, the Liberal Party promised to get rid of the GST.  I 
notice almost every Liberal has left the Chamber in shame.  There 
is only one Liberal left in the House and he is hanging his head 
because of the embarrassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sure the hon. 
member, who has been in the House longer than I have, knows full 
well we should not talk about the presence or absence of other 
hon. members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, you are absolutely 
accurate.  The rules of the House say we should not do that.  I 
just wanted to point out the truth to the Canadian people.  I am 
sorry that is a violation of the House rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that the only member in the House is hanging his head 
in shame because the promise on the GST was broken by his party. 
I remember that so well.  There is a second Liberal over there 
and she is hanging her head in shame as well over the broken 
promise on the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a promise they made.  It was a solemn commitment to the 
Canadian people.  I remember the leader of the opposition at the 
time, who is now the Prime Minister, getting up in the House and 
talking about getting rid of the GST. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would say that it was is time to get rid of the GST, that it 
was not a fair tax at all and that if Canadians elected the Liberal 
Party the GST would disappear”.  The GST is still here for Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is still here.  It is a very unfair tax.  It is a tax 
that is really like a flat tax.  No matter what one's wealth is 
one has to pay the same 7%.  When we buy some hardware goods, or 
a car, or get a haircut or buy a new tie, there is a 7% tax that 
everybody pays.   Even a really wealthy member like the member 
across the way from near Toronto has to pay 7%, the same as some 
poor guy in Kamsack, Saskatchewan.  It is a very unfair and 
unjust tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has said that we should start reducing the GST, 
starting with 1%, and take it off books and necessities. 
Eventually we should eliminate the GST because it is a very 
unfair tax.  That used to be the position of the Liberal Party 
before it was influenced and terrified by the Alliance and the 
Reform, so it moved to the political right.  That is the first 
point.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to mention deals with the comments made 
by the finance critic from the Canadian Alliance.  He stated that 
taxes are horrible, that taxation is an awesome power in the 
hands of parliament, said that taxes are much too high and that 
taxes should be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases taxes are too high, and the GST is a good example 
of that, but instead of talking about a general across the board 
tax cut, we should be talking about a progressive tax system that 
is based on the ability to pay.  It use to be that way but it was 
changed a number of years ago by the Mulroney government and 
continued on by the Liberal Party across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent CBC poll released a few days ago asked Canadians what 
they felt was the most important issue in the country.  Over 40% 
of them said that investment in social programs, in particular, 
health care, was the most important issue, whereas only 7% said 
lowering taxes was the most important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Alliance have said time and time again 
that there should be a radical reduction in taxes across the 
board.  Canadians do not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance Party is really an anti-government party.  It does 
not believe in government nor in public institutions.  It wants 
to privatize almost everything.  It probably even wants to 
privatize the post office and go to pony express or whatever.  It 
does not believe in the Canadian Wheat Board, the CBC or a public 
one tier health system that is supported by the tax system of all 
Canadians.  That is where the Canadian Alliance stands but it is 
not where the Canadian people stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out in the debate today that we need a 
taxation system that is progressive and based on the ability to 
pay.  We need a taxation system where wealthy people pay more 
taxes and ordinary people pay less taxes and get a decent tax 
break.  The position of the New Democratic Party and an 
overwhelming majority of Canadians is that we should have a 
taxation system where the wealthy and the large corporations pay 
their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance stands up for the very wealthy and the 
large corporations.  It is getting more and more of its money 
from those large corporations.  It is no longer grassroots party 
of ordinary Canadians.  People should realize that as we talk 
about this issue today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want to make is in regard to household debt. 
Household debt is at an all time high.  When big tax cuts are 
made they mainly go to the wealthy people not to the ordinary 
people who have huge household debts.  The Vanier Institute 
recently stated that during the decade of the 1990s, the 
wealthiest 20% of Canadians saw their incomes go up by about 6.6% 
and the poorest 20% of Canadians saw their incomes shrink by some 
5.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a number of years, throughout the fifties, sixties and into 
the seventies, there was a gradual reduction in the gap between 
the rich and the poor.  In the 1990s, at the end of the Mulroney 
years and into the years of this government, the gap between the 
rich and poor has widened once again.  The rich are getting 
richer and the poor are getting poorer.  The Canadian Alliance 
wants to spread it even wider by having a flat tax where 
everybody would pay the same rate.  This would mean that the rich 
would get richer and the poor would get poorer.  That is exactly 
the way the Alliance Party wants to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a progressive tax system with five or six different tax 
brackets based on the ability to pay.  We have to eliminate flat 
taxes like the GST.  We have to phase them out because it 
discriminates against the poor.  That is exactly what Canadians 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a progressive tax system based on the ability to 
pay.  They also want to make sure that there are enough taxes in 
the country in order to invest in infrastructure, social programs 
and into the institutions that are important to them.  They want 
enough money raised through taxes to make sure that we have not 
just $500 million for farmers but a couple of billion dollars to 
help farmers.  That is what taxes are all about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we get the Alliance Party saying that there is spending 
madness going on by the Government of Canada.  What is that?  Is 
it too much money for the old age pensioners, the poor, the 
farmers, the fishermen and the health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Squandering money on the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  As my friend from Winnipeg said, 
squandering money on the poor.  That is the position of the 
Alliance Party.   My goodness, the Liberal Party is not too far 
behind in its shift to the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a tax system that is fair and just.  We need a tax 
system that raises enough money to support public institutions 
and the infrastructure of the country.  Infrastructure has been 
cut back over the last number of years, particularly in the 1995 
budget, and it is time to reinvest in ordinary people.  That is 
what the debate is all about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the member's 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually I rise on points of order when members do not get the 
name of our party right, but I will simply say that member from 
the CCF has really misrepresented our position.  When he talks 
about our party not being concerned about those who are less 
wealthy, he is misrepresenting what we actually believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that it is best for people to have a job.  We have a 
tax policy that would reduce taxes according to our actual 
numbers.  If he were to be intellectually honest enough and 
actually look at them, instead of just spewing about them, he 
would see that the greatest tax reductions in our plan are for 
exactly the people he is talking about.  In other words, when 
some of the rich people get a tax reduction, those who are in the 
lower brackets get a 100% tax reduction.  That is not good enough 
for him.  I do not know what he is asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the tax for the rich, we believe that those who 
are well off should not be punished for their successes.  Those 
are exactly the people we need to drive our industries, to 
produce jobs, to hire people and to take poor people, give them 
employment and get them off the welfare rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our view is that the measure of the effectiveness of our economy 
is not how many people we have on welfare but rather how many 
people we get off welfare.  That is what our position is and 
frankly I do not care whether the member from the CCF has a 
response to that or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member over there 
is the author of the hidden agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, do members not remember when he 
made the great statement about privatizing old age security and 
the Canada pension plan?  He said that if the Alliance Party was 
elected it would privatize those things, that people would have 
monster RRSPs.  He said that would be the panacea to get the 
government off the backs of Canadians, that everyone would be in 
the private sector investing in the stock market.  Do members 
remember that in the campaign? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember picking up the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and reading a big 
headline about privatizing pensions and getting rid of old age 
security and the CPP.  The member for Elk Island was the author 
of that hidden agenda.  He even took his own leader by surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of member we are dealing with here.  When he 
talks about these kinds of issues he fails once again to mention 
the tax policy of the Alliance Party.  It is a flat tax policy. 
It wants a single tax rate.  With a single tax rate, someone who 
is making $300,000 or $400,000 a year will get a bigger break 
then the ordinary citizen who is making $30,000 or $40,000 a year 
teaching at an elementary school in Churchill, Manitoba.  Those 
are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly where that party stands.  It wants a big break 
for the wealthy.  It believes that the free market will look 
after the poor.  It believes in what is called the trickle down 
theory of economics, that if we feed enough oats to the horse, 
eventually enough will trickle through the horse to feed the 
sparrows.  That is exactly the philosophy of the Alliance Party 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, how grateful I am for the 
opportunity that the member from the CCF has given me to say that 
during the campaign I too was grossly misrepresented in that 
case. 
I bear part of the responsibility.  By giving an interview to a 
member of the press, I made the gross error of forgetting that I 
was not in a debate in the House of Commons.  I got into a debate 
with the interviewer and I probably said some of the things that 
were reported about me.  I greatly regret having given him the 
interview because it gave him, during the time of the debate, the 
two or three quotes that he needed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My apologies to you, Madam Speaker, the Canadian people and to 
everybody for that.  It was a misrepresentation of what we really 
want to do.  We want to fix things and improve things for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the hon. member's statement on taxes for the 
rich, it just is not true.  Let us say, for example, that I was 
walking along with my little grandson and we were carrying some 
stuff.  Let us say that I had a load of 100 pounds on my back and 
my little grandson was carrying five pounds.  Somebody else comes 
along, maybe my grandson's dad, my son, and says that he will 
help carry that.  He takes half of my load and he takes all of 
his son's load.  My grandson had a 100% reduction in his load, 
from five to zero, and I had a reduction in my load of 100 to 50. 
Sure I got a bigger reduction but it equalizes it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just totally intellectually dishonest for that member and 
the members opposite to so misrepresent our tax policy because it 
just is not on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I wish to respond to 
the hon. member from the time warp who was talking about the CCF. 
That was about 40 years ago.  However, I realize he is a bit 
behind the times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the policy of the Alliance Party to have a flat tax, a 
single tax rate.  The former Reform Party and now the Alliance 
Party both have this idea of a flat tax.  Even the great 
socialist in the United States, George W. Bush, has rejected that 
as being unfair and unjust and yet the Alliance Party is 
advocating a single tax rate so that a wealthy person making 
$300,000, $400,000 or $500,000 a year or a millionaire making 
over $1 million a year would pay the same tax rate as a high 
school teacher making $40,000 or $50,000 a year.  That is not 
fair and it is not just. It is not equality of condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that party is saying that because I now know where 
that party stands.  It is a party of the past.  It is a throwback 
to the forties and fifties when the rich would get richer and the 
poor would get poorer and be grateful for it.  That is the 
Alliance philosophy.  Thank God about 90% of Canadians reject 
that philosophy and that attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the more Canadians hear about it, the smaller and 
smaller the Alliance Party will get because it represents a very 
small point of view.  Even the leader of the Alliance Party has 
put that member so far back on the backbenches that he is always 
hiding behind the curtain because of his points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad this issue has been raised today.  I am glad the 
people are now seeing where the Alliance Party stands.  It stands 
for wealthy people.  It stands against public institutions such 
as the wheat board.  It stands against a one tier health care 
system.  It wants two tier health.  It wants private clinics.  It 
wants whatever is good for capital and whatever is good for the 
wealthy people.  It does not want pensions for senior citizens. 
It wants to get rid of the Canada pension plan.  It wants big 
RRSPs, which will help the wealthy, and to hell with the poor, 
the ordinary citizen of Canada.  That is exactly where it stands. 
Before long, it will become an historic artifact in the history 
of Canadian parliamentary annals, just like the Social Credit 
Party so many years ago.  Its hero was Bill Vander Zalm in 
British Columbia.  We can see what has happened to Mr. Vander 
Zalm and the Social Credit Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the member from Vernon is getting up on his feet.  He was a 
member of the Social Credit Party.  He is a worshipper of Bill 
Vander Zalm.  That is the kind of politics that was rejected by 
the people of B.C., and it will be rejected by the people of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I cannot just sit and listen to the 
ramblings and the ravings of the hon. member from down on the far 
reaches of the opposition benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I should explain a little bit that there is a big 
difference.  I know it is hard for the member to comprehend so I 
will say it very slowly so that maybe he will really understand. 
The difference between a single rate and a flat rate tax is 
deductions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a single rate tax standard deductions are allowed.  That is 
the policy.  Those making over $100,000 are taxed more.  It is 
unfortunate to say but it is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go into the history of the NDP.  We are all well aware of 
how the NDP got ahead in British Columbia and how it stole from 
the blind and from charities through bingo hall services.  That 
is common knowledge.  We have also seen its socialistic attitude: 
the more people work, the more will be taken away from them.  We 
are well aware of that attitude in British Columbia under the NDP 
regime in place there now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have far to look to see what NDP members think about 
private medicine.  Their own leader uses private medical services 
in Canada.  The hon. member knows that, yet he will stand here 
and tell the world that NDP members do not do that.  That is 
their policy.  What is good for them is good for them, and the 
rest of Canada can do without. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, thank goodness there is no question attached to that 
statement.  My colleague from the NDP would be on his feet until 
at least supper hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an interesting debate today.  We are talking about Bill 
C-13 which proposes technical adjustments to the GST.  As my 
colleague from the NDP mentioned, it is probably a debate that 
under normal circumstances we would not be having.  Witness red 
book one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether or not  red book one brought you to this 
place, Madam Speaker, but it certainly brought a number of 
Liberal MPs to the House of Commons.  The election of 1993, among 
other things, was based on the promise to eliminate the hated 
GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government received dividends from the GST in more ways than 
one.  It obviously received political dividends, because it 
brought a lot of its members to the House under what in the real 
world are called false pretences.  It is probably unparliamentary 
to say that, but I am being more generous than I should be. 
Obviously it worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in power now for over seven years and we 
are still saddled with the hated GST.  Just by way of comment, I 
should mention that we supporting the technical changes to the 
GST.  We will not hold them up.  At least one person is 
applauding over there.  I did not hear the parliamentary 
secretary applauding yet but I am sure he will before the day is 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about fooling the Canadian public.  During the 1993 
election I fought the issue as a government member, as a 
Conservative.  It was the last year of the manufacturers' sales 
tax.  Before the 7% GST we paid a hidden 13.5% federal sales tax 
on automobiles and other goods.  It was hidden in the cost of 
automobiles and every other commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We paid a price for our intellectual honesty.  We said that we 
would eliminate the hidden tax and that from then on Canadians 
would see it at the point of purchase.  In other words, if they 
bought a $10,000 car, 7% of it would be GST.  Seven hundred 
dollars would be seen upfront.  Someone buying a $20,000 car in 
1991 would pay $1,400 in tax upfront.  They would see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians were surprised.  They did not believe we had a 
hidden federal sales tax, which we did, but the old sales tax 
restricted our capacity as an exporting country. 
It was all part of the parcel. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also brought in the free trade agreement, but that alone was 
not enough.  We wanted to restructure how we did business in the 
country.  We revised the tax rules.  We brought the number of tax 
divisions down from a high of nine to around five in one fell 
swoop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then brought in the GST which levelled the playing field for 
exporters.  It made us competitive in the international world, 
which we were not under the old system.  The last year we had the 
manufacturers' sales tax was 1989-90.  In that year that tax 
brought in $17.8 billion, which is quite a bit of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the GST will bring in $55 billion compared to the old 
system that brought in $17.8 billion.  It is interesting that we 
will take $32 billion of that and pay it out in GST rebates to 
Canadians outside the higher income levels that the NDP sometimes 
mentions in terms of unfairness.  It is a fair tax policy because 
a lot of the money is distributed to Canadians who need it via 
the GST rebate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an astounding figure.  When we do our research we find 
that the government talks about a $22.8 billion revenue from the 
GST.  It excludes the gross.  It only talks about the net.  The 
gross income for the government under the GST is $55 billion and 
$32 billion of it is distributed to Canadians who need it. That 
is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is that taxation must be fair.  It must be 
perceived as being fair.  My NDP colleague talks about it being 
unfair because the 7% applies to everyone.  It is true that a 
millionaire or someone at the poverty line pays the 7% GST, but 
lower income Canadians get the benefit of the GST rebate which 
makes up for the lack of fairness.  That was not present under 
the old system when the tax was actually hidden.  That is a major 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is that we can never lose sight of fairness in 
taxation and what has to be taxed to make the system fair for 
everyone. A fair system must tax consumption.  It must tax 
capital and incomes.  We cannot simply take a tax and cover one 
base.  Some people would argue that we should do away with the 
GST and just tax incomes, which would be completely unfair and 
unacceptable and would not work.  It has never worked in any 
jurisdiction that has tried it and it certainly would not work in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must spread out the way in which we collect taxes because if 
the government is smart and considerate in how it spends the 
taxes it takes in, at the end of the day it will benefit all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about tax bills as we are today we should 
point out that the government should consider bringing in a 
budget.  It is March 2 and we do not have a budget.  We are still 
working with a mini-budget from last fall, which was very 
convenient because it was brought in on the eve of an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the Prime Minister was smart enough to call the 
election knowing full well that some of the danger signals were 
out there, that we may be heading into a recession come early 
winter, late winter or possibly early spring.  That was one of 
the things that motivated the Prime Minister to call an early 
election. Much to his credit he won it.  We were right in terms 
of what might be happening in the economy.  Some of the danger 
signals are out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point I will read into the record a comment from Don 
Drummond, the former assistant deputy minister to the Minister of 
Finance. 
He now works as an economist for TD Bank.  Just last week in his 
article entitled <I>Using the Federal Budget Surplus: Is there 
any left?</I> he wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confused about the fiscal prospects of the federal government? If 
so, you are not alone.  The October 2000 Economic Statement and 
Budget Update provided fiscal projections to 2005-06. However, 
those projections do not reflect the tax cuts promised in the 
Statement, nor the spending commitments made subsequently in the 
Red Book III and the January 30, 2001 Speech from the Throne.  In 
addition, the economic assumptions underpinning the October 
Update now seem decidedly optimistic for the short term.  To 
date, no attempt has been made by either public or private bodies 
to cut through the confusion.

reality because we are in the midst of layoffs.  As we speak, the 
new president of the United States, George W. Bush, is proposing 
huge tax cuts which will put pressure on Canada to do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must attract business to Canada.  We must do what it takes to 
keep the economy moving.  It appears the U.S. wants to do that, 
but we are in a period of suspended animation: the world is good,

horizon and we must move to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I hope the government will at least take that into 
consideration in the next few days.  We must do something.  We 
cannot stand still.  We must move to reflect times as they now

the last election.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>RIGHT OF LANDING FEE 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK180">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, 
the government should eliminate the Right of Landing Fee 
(ROLF) on all classes of immigrants to Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to debate 
this important issue of national interest.  A growing group of 
Canadians is calling on the government to eliminate the right of 
landing fee on all classes of immigrants.  To the government's 
credit, about a year ago it eliminated the right of landing fee 
for all refugees.  The same reasons why that was a good idea 
apply to all new Canadians and all immigrants.  We believe it 
should be done away with altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This marks the sixth anniversary of the right of landing fee. It 
was introduced on February 28, 1995.  At that time we were in a 
deficit situation, the government was in a cutback mode where all 
programs were being reviewed and a great deal of effort was being 
made to enter into cost recovery mechanisms.  When it introduced 
the right of landing fee the idea was that it would help offset 
the costs of some of the services new Canadians use, whether 
language training or settlement services. 
In actual fact, that money was never considered a dedicated fee 
for service.  The money went into general revenues.  It never 
really did get directly connected to the services it was meant to 
fund.  In fact, during that period, program spending was being 
cut, hacked and slashed in the immigration department. 
Therefore, there was no direct correlation.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is frankly why many critics of the right of landing fee 
call it a tax.  The term that is being used is a head tax.  The 
government does not like to hear that but this has become the 
same as the much loathed head tax of recent history.  I remind 
the House that from 1885 to 1923 the government imposed a head 
tax on all Chinese immigrants to Canada.  It started at $50 and 
rose to $500, specifically to bar entry to Chinese people coming 
to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people view the head tax in the same way.  It is a racist 
head tax because it is selective by nature.  In other words, the 
$975 fee that is charged to every landed immigrant does not seem 
like an insurmountable barrier for a person coming from western 
Europe, Australia or the United States.  However, for a person 
from the Sudan, the Philippines or Southeast Asia, that could be 
two years' salary.  Therefore, it is an actual barrier to 
immigration.  This is why we feel not only is it a financial 
burden on people who might choose to make Canada their home, it 
is a real blow to their morale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Canadians are wondering what kind of message we are trying 
to send out.  The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration says 
they want to open the door wider and invite more new Canadians to 
this country.  At the same time they put financial barriers that 
are true obstacles to many people, especially from certain parts 
of the world.  In other words, the door is open if one can afford 
this fee for the privilege of coming here.  The door is not so 
open for people who come from some parts of the world, such as 
the developing nations.  These people need the refuge and the 
sanctuary that Canada offers arguably more than people from 
developed countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out, there is a growing movement around the country 
of people who feel very strongly that the government should 
eliminate the head tax on all new Canadians, like the Ad Hoc 
Coalition Against the Head Tax.  In fact, there is an 
organization of organizations that formed specifically around 
what it felt to be an unjust head tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Ethnocultural Council has been working very 
aggressively on this issue.  The Canadian Council of Refugees has 
made representation to the Canadian government demanding or 
strongly advocating the elimination of the head tax.  The 
national Filipino association is on the record.  The Maytree 
Foundation, the Canadian Labour Congress, the getting landed 
project and the Caledon Institute of Social Policy are on record. 
In fact, the Liberal Party of Canada, at its 1996 federal 
convention, passed a resolution for a review which would lead to 
the elimination of what we call the head tax.  A lot of ethnic 
minorities within the Liberal Party were horrified when their 
government sent the message to the world that it was not as open 
a door policy as was thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has a fee for service type charge associated 
with becoming an immigrant to that country.  However, for a 
family of four in the United States, the total fees and charges 
would be about $1,580.  In this country it would be about $3,150 
for a family of four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the revenue.  If immigration is supposed to be 
some kind of revenue generating service that we are offering 
here, let us be honest about that and say it.  If the money is 
not going into settlement services and into actual language 
training or whatever it might be but is going into the coffers of 
the government to do with whatever it pleases, then it is another 
tax.  As a matter of fact it is a lot of money.  The government 
gets about $200 million per year from this head tax.  Over six 
years, that is $1.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance crows about getting out of the 
deficit situation and showing a surplus, let us look at where he 
is looking to find the revenue. 
There is $8 billion a year from unemployed Canadians with the EI 
fund surplus and $1.2 billion over this period of time from the 
poorest of the poor, those struggling new Canadians who might 
seek to make Canada their home.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe the time has come for the government to act 
unilaterally.  We do not need a change in legislation to 
eliminate the head tax.  In fact, the minister has the right to 
implement, to raise, to lower or to eliminate any service charge 
or fee under the Finances Administration Act, I believe, section 
19.  The minister can simply act unilaterally because it is the 
right thing to do.  She does not have to wait for the House of 
Commons to direct her that way.  Enough Canadians have spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to cut my remarks short in a moment or two in the 
hopes that members from other parties will add their voices to 
emphasize the overwhelming support for the idea of eliminating 
this right of landing fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned when it was first introduced, the idea was that 
it would directly offset the cost of running the immigration 
department.  Now we have seen that there is no direct connection 
to the fee being charged and the service being rendered.  It is 
not a fee for service as such, it is in fact a tax and an 
imposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most damaging thing about this head tax is not the 
financial burden it places on those who might seek to make Canada 
their home, it is the blow to the morale of recent newcomers to 
this country and those who would seek to reunite other family 
members and bring them here.  They are having this hurdle thrown 
in their way, this unnecessary and I believe unwarranted obstacle 
to something that the government claims it is very interested in. 
It is always saying that family reunification is one of the three 
pillars of the immigration policy of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made it far more difficult since 1995 for any 
family to hope to bring other family members here, especially if 
they are struggling in a financial way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to end my remarks now.  I hope to have some minutes 
at the end of the one hour and at that time I would be happy to 
conclude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Being that this is private members' hour, I would like to 
seek unanimous consent to make Bill C-234 votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill that would amend the Supreme Court of Canada Act 
and require the supreme court to consult parliament in the 
context of its deliberations on charter challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have numerous representations from all sides of the House, 
from MPs who would like to speak to this bill.  If I could get 
unanimous consent, I would be deeply grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House to make Bill C-234 
votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak on Motion No. 231 from the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Centre on the right of landing fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past week the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
introduced Bill C-11 in the House.  The bill does not change the 
right of landing fee provisions and the reasons are rather 
simple.  It is meeting the legitimate policy goal that the 
government has set for it and other fees for a range of federal 
services.  There is no meaningful evidence that it has harmed 
Canada's ability to attract immigrants.  Moreover when it comes 
to questions of how best to use money for our immigration 
program, dropping this fee is far less important than putting 
funds into better and faster processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us be clear on what we are talking about and where 
this fee comes from.  Back in 1995 the government made a series 
of important decisions that were necessary to get Canada's public 
finances back into shape.  One of the most fundamental was that 
we decided that we needed to do more so that people who clearly 
and directly benefit from programs and services pay a portion of 
the costs associated with those services. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how the right of landing fee was introduced and set at 
the reasonable rate of $975. It was decided that fee would be 
paid by newcomers to Canada aged 19 and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is charged to people coming to this country as qualified 
workers, entrepreneurs, business people, investors or members of 
the family class, regardless of the country of origin and the 
province of destination. If for some reason someone who paid 
the required fee does not get permanent residency in Canada, 
that amount is reimbursed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government decided to introduce the fee because the direct 
beneficiaries of immigration are those who come to Canada 
themselves. These people benefit from efficient immigration 
programs and services. They certainly benefit from the 
opportunity to prosper in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1990s, the immigration program was subjected to the 
same budget cuts as the whole of government. Then, in the 
consultations the government undertook in 1994 about what 
improvements should be made to immigration, it asked Canadians 
what they thought about the idea of introducing a fee that would 
help support immigration programs and services. According to a 
poll conducted on the subject in 1996, at least 72% of the 
respondents were of the opinion that this was a good idea and 
that the amount was reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government examined the costs of providing these services 
and came to the conclusion that an amount of $975 was fair and 
reasonable. Therefore, in the 1995 budget the Minister of 
Finance announced the creation of the right of landing fees. 
Under this initiative, a loan program was introduced to help 
those who were unable to pay the fees immediately but could 
repay it later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that was a very important element. It was not 
considered as a burden for the newcomers. They could take their 
time to pay back this amount, as they were now living in a much 
more prosperous country than the one they had left. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, not everyone gets admitted, while others decide not 
to continue their application for different reasons.  Citizenship 
and Immigration Canada had to manage a substantial refund 
process.  It had to work with fluctuating currency rates and 
similar difficulties.  From April 1997 we allowed clients to pay 
the fee at any time up until they received their visa.  That has 
made financial arrangements simpler for everyone concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second major change came in the 2000 budget.  That was when 
the government lifted the right of landing fee requirement from 
refugees.  Effective February 28, 2000, the government recognized 
that these people have faced enormous difficulties and hardships. 
It knew that lifting the fee would help their resettlement and 
yet mean just a reduction of about $15 million a year in revenue 
from the fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre thinks we should go further.  He 
wants Canadian taxpayers to pick up the whole tab for services to 
immigrants.  He would be happier to take away the $131 million a 
year from settlement programming to implement his proposal.  He 
is quite happy to see the people who directly benefit from these 
services, most of whom are skilled workers, entrepreneurs or 
business immigrants, not paying any kind of fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we cannot agree.  The facts tell us there is no 
compelling argument to change a system that works.  Has the right 
of landing fee reduced Canada's attractiveness to potential 
immigrants?  Far from it.  There is no evidence that the fee has 
had any impact on application levels at all.  If anything, the 
application levels are rising.  There is no evidence that 
potential applicants are ignoring Canada as a possible 
destination in favour of places that might have lower fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recognize that there are many fees being charged by other 
major immigrant receiving countries, much higher than those in 
Canada.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public still strongly supports these fees, which 
ensure that those who benefit from a very important service help 
to pay part of the costs involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we decide to eliminate an entire source of revenue in one 
area, there are in fact only two options left if we do not want 
to modify the general financial balance. We can compensate by 
digging a little further in somebody else's pockets, or we can 
reduce the services that this revenue is supposed to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consultations on immigration carried out recently by 
the government, the following question was asked: “If we had 
more money for immigration, what would you like to be done?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three suggestions came out: to reduce or eliminate the landing 
fee; to direct spending on faster processing of the immigration 
applications submitted by the men, women and children who want 
to settle in Canada; or to sustain higher levels of immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The top priority by far was to accelerate the processing of 
the immigration applications, which speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, most of us hear complaints from 
constituents and can see just how long it can take sometimes to 
process an application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the people on the front line of our immigration 
system work real hard but there are often delays due to the 
background checks, health information and security assessments 
that are required. It is not surprising that reducing processing 
delays is a top priority. In fact, the delays are mainly due to 
the great number of applications. Those who travel around the 
world know that Canada is the best country in which to live. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has said that the 
new bill and some associated changes will lead to the system 
working better.  Of that we are convinced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several client service improvements are already being tested. 
This will lead to faster processing and is entirely consistent 
with what the minister has learned from Canadians, including 
people who deal with immigration issues on a daily basis, like 
most of the members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, there is no reason to accept this motion.  Let me 
summarize some of the reasons.  The right of landing fee applies 
to people who receive the direct benefit of immigration to 
Canada.  That in itself is a tremendous benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not apply to refugees who come from badly stricken areas 
of the world.  It has no impact on immigration levels, far from 
it, and where necessary people can take out loans to cover the 
immediate cost of the fees, loans that are repaid.  Canadians 
agree strongly with the principle of ensuring that immigrants pay 
at least some of the direct costs of their programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, people have recognized that we would gain far more 
important impacts and benefits from any new money for immigration 
by putting it into a faster processing system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this has been a concern for many people, but I would like 
to point out that in the last few years we have seen people coming to 
Canada under incredible conditions, in the bilge of boats. We 
know that real criminals brought these people here by boat. 
These people paid $8,000, $10,000 or $15,000 to come here under 
extremely terrible conditions. This shows that $975 is very 
little compared to these amounts.

<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, excuse me.  I am honestly laughing at the last remarks 
of the parliamentary secretary.  He compares criminals, human 
smuggling, and says that is more expensive, and the $975 the 
government is charging is justifiable.  I cannot believe he is 
tying these things together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I object to the hon. member taking my words out of 
context.  That is not what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, he can read 
<I>Hansard</I> to find out what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague from the NDP, whom I 
personally know.  I know of his compassion for this issue.  I 
would like to congratulate him for bringing forward this motion. 
He can count on my full support.  He very eloquently stated his 
reasons for bringing forward the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I listened to the parliamentary secretary I 
started shaking my head.  What he fails to realize is that I also 
happen to be an immigrant who came to this country, so I can 
relate to what he is trying to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first make one thing very clear, one thing the 
parliamentary secretary neglected to say, and that is that every 
potential immigrant pays over $500 as a processing fee.  The 
government is already charging every immigrant a processing fee 
of approximately $545, so when he says that this fee is for 
speeding up the system, he is wrong.  It is not.  It is a head 
tax.  It is a tax that goes into general revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the parliamentary secretary said that this tax has not 
harmed people coming into this country.  I would like to remind 
him of something.  When a country has a law and a system that 
starts discriminating one way or another, is that right just 
because other people are taking advantage of it?  It is not 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House why I say the system discriminates against 
others.  I will speak about a family of four who have to pay $975 
each.  That is close to over $3,000 for that family to immigrate 
to Canada.  Add the $575 processing fee to that amount and each 
individual is paying approximately $1,500 to get into this 
country, and the parliamentary secretary wants to tell me that 
those who arrive with their family cannot afford to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good people from all parts of world who want to 
immigrate to this country.  Do they need to have money to be good 
people, to be skilled people?  No, they do not.  They can come 
from any part of the world, but if they do not have money, how 
will they come here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of course says it has a loan program.  Yahoo.  So 
before people arrive here they are in debt.  They can come to 
Canada but they will be in debt.  The government will say it is 
giving them money.  Perhaps the parliamentary secretary should 
tell us how much interest the government is charging and how much 
money it makes out of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government introduced the bill in 1995, I think, it was 
for everybody, including refugees.  In 1997 I brought forward a 
private member's bill asking for this tax to be removed for 
refugees.  Now the member stands up very proudly and says that 
the government removed the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell members what compelled them to remove it, because I 
happened to be here in the House.  The tax was removed because of 
the 5,000 Kosovo refugees who were brought to Canada.  I am glad 
they were brought here.  Five thousand refugees suddenly came 
into the country and suddenly the government knew this was the 
wrong system.  The government could not charge 5,000 people who 
were refugee war victims the right of landing fee. 
All of a sudden a bright light went on, and the government said 
it couldn't charge it.  That is when it was abolished.  It was 
not abolished out of compassion but because the right of landing 
fee could not be implemented.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has stated that the government has 
listened to Canadians.  This surprises me.  How has it listened? 
By a poll.  What that means to me is that the government is run 
by polls.  It is interesting how the government is run by polls. 
The government takes a poll and justifies its actions by saying 
that Canadians have said this, so it applies a fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary says the government is assisting 
immigrants.  I would like to ask him a question based on my own 
experience when I came to this country and on the experience of 
thousands of others who have come here.  How many people who come 
to this country actually use the so-called settlement services he 
is talking about?  I did not when I came here and I can tell the 
House that the majority of immigrants who come to Canada do not 
use settlement services.  Why is it, then, that the money is 
going into general revenues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is wrong when the government wants to justify this by 
saying that this is a service provided to every immigrant.  That 
is absolutely wrong.  Does the parliamentary secretary have the 
figures?  I would love to have figures from the department to see 
what percentage of the total number of immigrants uses the 
settlement services for which the government is justifying this 
right of landing fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument the government has made in justifying this does not 
hold water.  Every immigrant group in the country has stated that 
this is a discriminatory tax.  It is a head tax, despite what the 
government says.  It is hated.  The fact of the matter is that it 
is a tax because immigrants are already being charged a 
processing fee.  We are not talking about a processing fee.  We 
are talking about a head tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This head tax is wrong.  It gives money to the government for 
general revenue.  There are thousands of applications coming in 
and despite the member's claim that the government wants to 
improve and speed up the processing system with this extra money 
it is getting, that has not happened.  I can tell the House that 
any member of parliament here who deals with immigration is 
seeing longer and longer delays.  The government's argument for 
having this tax does not hold water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleague in the NDP for 
bringing out this issue.  Although this is non-votable, it has 
given us an opportunity to show the weakness of the government's 
argument as to why it has this head tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise today on Motion No. 231 tabled by my colleague from 
Winnipeg Centre, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should 
eliminate the Right of Landing Fee (ROLF) on all classes of 
immigrants to Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know in this House that Quebec and Canada are the number 
one destination for many immigrants. 
Thousands of immigrants choose Canada or Quebec as their adopted 
country to improve their lives and reach their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Quebec and Canada both need immigration to at least 
maintain their current population. Therefore, the government 
regularly sets targets regarding the number of immigrants to be 
received. Last year Canada received 226,837 immigrants and 
refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 2001 we should be receiving 200,000 to 225,000 immigrants 
and refugees and these numbers will increase by 10,000 for 
2002.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However these people must pay certain fees which we think limit 
the possibility of immigrating to Canada and constitute an 
undisguised form of discrimination for some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also think that the right of landing fee, or 
ROLF, also known as head tax, is an unacceptable constraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the term head tax comes from a 
tax imposed on Chinese immigrants by the Canadian government at 
the end of the 19th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in 1880, many Chinese workers took part in the building 
of the CPR. Once the railroad was built, the Chinese Exclusion 
Act was passed. Between 1885 and 1923, Chinese immigrants, 
unlike European immigrants, had to pay quite a substantial head 
tax to come to Canada. From $50 per person in 1885, the head tax 
increased to $100 to finally reach the astronomical amount of 
$500 by 1903. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say it was a staggering amount of money at that time is an 
understatement. In fact, it is estimated that by 1923 that 
awful tax had generated $23 million for the Canadian government, 
which would translate into about $1 billion nowadays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current landing fee of $975 per adult immigrant coming to 
Canada was set by the current Liberal government in 1995. 
At the time, the fee applied to both immigrants and refugees. 
Public outcry prompted the government to stop collecting that 
fee from refugees in February 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it still applies to other immigrants who have other 
expenses to pay when they come to Canada. Besides the landing 
fee set at $975 per immigrant over 19 years of age, the 
permanent residence application costs $500 per immigrant over 19 
years of age and $100 for anyone younger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone agrees that this tax is clearly unfair and prohibitive. 
While the government is raking in surplus after surplus by 
diverting the surplus of the employment insurance fund, it is 
still collecting a landing fee from immigrants. Two thousand 
immigrants at $975 each make for a lot of money. It comes to 
about $200 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions by the government show once again its 
insensitivity toward the poor in our society. Indeed, many 
people want to immigrate here but do not necessarily have much 
money. This tax does not at all take into account the economic 
resources of individuals or the economic conditions in their 
country of origin. In the end, the door is wide open but only 
for those who have the means to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal Liberal government is accumulating surplus 
upon surplus, Quebec is welcoming some 12,000 refugees annually. 
The slowness in the processing of claims by the federal 
government results in staggering costs for Quebec. It is 
estimated that it costs about $100 million annually to take 
charge of people waiting for a ruling by the Immigration and 
Refugee Board and the federal government will not consider 
reimbursing Quebec for these costs. It is too poor. 
Clearly, the only reason for this landing fee is to put money in 
the federal treasury.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another worrisome thing about this tax is that it is an 
impediment to what the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
considers one of her priorities: the reunification of families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that many immigrants are not necessarily rolling in 
money.  For those who apply to sponsor a member of their family, 
this tax is a major obstacle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Bill C-11, which is now before the committee, 
would allow us to examine this tax and the government's real 
objectives.  It is essential that the federal government 
significantly lower this tax or, better yet, abolish it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Motion No. 231, which suggests 
that the government should remove the right of landing fee for 
all classes of immigrants.  I am more than happy to support the 
motion brought forward by the member for Winnipeg Centre and to 
speak on behalf of our member for Fundy—Royal, our immigration 
critic, who also supports the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of issues have been discussed today, but a couple of 
more statements need to be made.  It would behoove us all to 
realize that we are all immigrants to this land.  Some of us have 
been here for a few hundred years and some of us have been here 
for a few days, but all of us came from another place at one time 
or another to make our home and to try to raise our families in 
Canada.  Whether one is first generation, fifteenth generation or 
one thousandth generation, it really does not make any 
difference.  We are all equal before the law.  We all stand to 
benefit from good government and to continue to live here and 
enjoy the freedoms Canada offers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bit of background to the head tax that should be 
mentioned.  The previous speaker started to go into that 
background, but she did not get into the details.  The head tax 
and the Chinese Exclusion Act remain two of the worst examples of 
legalized racism in Canadian history.  I do not think we can move 
forward unless we are willing to look at our history, understand 
the mistakes that were made in the past, and hopefully try not to 
make the same mistakes again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original head tax was introduced in 1885 and finally 
repealed in 1923.  It was only levied on Chinese immigrants. 
When it was repealed in 1923 it was replaced by the Chinese 
Exclusion Act which remained in place until 1947.  That act 
prohibited Chinese from immigrating to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine today picking one race or one group of people and 
saying they cannot immigrate to this country?  It is quite 
unheard of.  The original head tax was also an entrance fee.  It 
was set at $50 per person in 1885.  It rose to $100 in 1900 and 
was raised to $500 in 1905.  The Chinese community continues 
today to seek redress for these acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While not to be confused with the original head tax of 1885, 
many immigrant communities refer to Canada's $975 entrance fee as 
a head tax, and rightfully so.  It was introduced in the 1995 
budget of the Minister of Finance and remains in place today. 
Additional to this fee, which was mentioned by the Canadian 
Alliance member who spoke previously, is a $500 per person 
processing fee.  The $975 is not for processing the paperwork or 
looking after the fees associated with immigration. 
The $500 supposedly looks after that and the $975 is a tax on 
immigrants who quite often can least afford to pay it.  We are 
looking at $1,500. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1410"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT50"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT50"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1410
<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Alliance member mentioned earlier, it starts to add up 
for a family of four, five, or six.  It is a considerable amount 
of money that could be well spent to allow new Canadians to 
become accustomed to the country, perhaps to learn the language 
or to give them a bit of a cushion as they integrate into the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to look at some of the statements made on the 
government side of the House in the past.  The Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration made a clear commitment to a fair, 
affordable and well enforced immigration policy.  Therefore, a 
form of financial guarantee would ensure that sponsors of 
immigrants met their obligations.  In addition, a $975 fee would 
be charged all adults immigrating to Canada to offset the costs 
of immigrant services, said the Minister of Finance, as reported 
in <I>Hansard</I> of February 27, 1995.  It could not be any 
further from reality.  As reported in <I>Hansard</I> of March 13, 
1995, Mary Clancy said that the cost of programs was $271 million 
a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the statements by the immigration department would 
imply otherwise, that the $975 would offset fees, that is not the 
case.  The $975 goes directly into general revenue.  The general 
revenue is kind of nefarious: the money goes in there but we are 
not quite certain what happens to it after.  Even the auditor 
general has a very difficult job to trace the money through all 
the loops and the rabbit warren of general revenue.  It is like 
Alice in Wonderland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help handle criticism of the fee the same government provided 
for loans to be made available to help pay the costs. The fee is 
set out in typical Liberal fashion as a so-called caring and 
compassionate government to ensure that no one is turned away as 
a result.  Loan programs and other ways of assisting are also 
included in the process, according to the hon. member for 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore on March 2, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now comes the kicker.  On April 3, 1995, Anna Terrana indicated 
that the loan option was said to be based on one's ability to 
repay the loan within a certain time period.  She asked how these 
individuals could, without the necessary tools to acquire 
meaningful employment, be realistically expected to repay the 
loans within a three year period.  They contradicted one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the House is aware that the government has since 
abolished the head tax on convention refugees.  It has kind of 
come part way.  What we need is a commitment from the government 
to come the rest of the way.  It needs to take a look at what it 
has done in the past and say that it does not work, that it 
interferes with immigration, and that it is really a penalty 
against future Canadians and immigrants to the country.   The 
government should say that enough is enough and simply get rid of 
it.  What a novel idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the day has come when as parliamentarians we should look 
at the things that work and applaud them.  We should look at the 
things that do not work and ask how they could be changed.  Let 
us get rid of them and put them on the chopping block. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  I agree with the member who just said 
“It is common sense”.  A little common sense goes a long way. 
I would like to do an overview of the PC stance on immigration. 
We recognize that immigration in Canada will continue.  We 
certainly support it.  We also recognize further that it is an 
economic necessity.  We need to have more confidence in and 
respect for human diversity so that we do not get sucked into the 
debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the words of our immigration critic, the member for 
Fundy Royal, “so that we do not get sucked into the debate of 
always having to add the word criminal in a statement related to 
immigration.  That is a very slippery slope”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the PC Party supports the bill.  We support the 
abolition of the $975 head tax and the $500 tax that is added on 
top of that.  In other words, we support the abolition of the 
$1,475 tax that immigrants are forced to pay when they come into 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the bill made votable.  Perhaps in the 
future it will become votable.  In the meantime, it is through 
the continuation of efforts like this that hopefully some day we 
will see the abolition of the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House 
to make the motion votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak in support of 
Motion No. 231, that the government should eliminate the right of 
landing fee on all classes of immigrants to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre for moving 
the motion.  I would point out that in 1998 I moved a similar 
motion in the immigration committee, which would have eliminated 
the head tax, but the Liberal members on the committee 
unanimously opposed it.  Today, when the hon. member from the PC 
Party asked for unanimous consent, it was again the Liberal 
members, not opposition party members, including the Canadian 
Alliance, who were opposed to making the motion votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the right of landing fee is a cash cow for 
the Liberal government.  The government is hungry to increase 
taxes whenever it gets the opportunity to balance its budget on 
the backs of taxpayers.  In this case, it is raising taxes on the 
backs of refugees and prospective new immigrants. The tax has 
been in place for six years. The government has raked in about 
$1.2 billion from new immigrants.  That is about $1,000 per 
immigrant per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does all the money go?  It does not go for resettlement 
purposes or into the departmental budget.  It goes to the general 
revenues of the government, this big, bulky government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head tax is not based on need.  It is not based on the 
income of the people or the educational level.  For example, 
people teaching English or French in another country may still 
have to pay for English as a second language when they come to 
Canada.  The tax does not take into consideration the ability to 
settle in Canada.  It is a very unfair head tax on prospective 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak about the historical perspective, the head tax has 
connotations of the discriminatory past of our country.  The 
government imposed a head tax on Chinese immigrants to Canada 
from 1885 to 1923 to discourage them from coming here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1420"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It started at $50 per head and then rose to $500 per head.  This 
head tax, which continues into the 21st century, reminds us of the 
Chinese exclusion act.  It also reminds us of the discriminatory 
practices with respect to the <I>Komagata Maru</I> ship which 
came to Canada.  Based on race and country of origin, the 
passengers of that ship, most of whom were refugees, were not 
allowed to land on this great land.  After many days, the ship 
was forced out of Canadian waters.  When it arrived back in 
India, many of the passengers were gunned down by the government 
at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also reminds us of the discriminatory practices followed in 
the old age security benefits, commonly called a pension for 
seniors.  It is discriminatory because it is not needs based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This head tax discriminates against the poor and people of 
colour from Third World countries.  Those prospective immigrants 
who come from developed countries have to pay that fee which is 
equivalent to about 15 days of wages in developed countries. 
Fifteen hundred dollars is about 15 days wages.  For many of the 
developing countries, it takes about 15 months to save that 
$1,500.  Then we translate or convert that currency into the 
local currency of that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the underdeveloped countries, or the backward countries I 
should say, like Zaire, it takes 15 years for people to save 
$1,500 Canadian per person.  When a family of four or more people 
plan to come to Canada, this head tax acts as a deterrent for 
those individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many other countries, the immigration visa fee is adjusted 
according to the cost of living in those countries.  For example, 
if one applies for a British visa, the fee depends on from which 
country one is applying.  In certain countries, the fees are 
lowered because the cost of living is lower and the cost of 
processing that application is lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make it very clear that I talked to many 
immigrants in my constituency and all over the country. 
Immigrants want to pay a fee, but a reasonable fee, whether it is 
a processing fee or whatever name we give it.  However this fee 
becomes unreasonable and acts as a deterrent, particularly so 
when the minister wants to open the front door, as I have been 
saying for a long time, and close the back door.  When the fees 
are discriminatory, it does not encourage the immigrants to come 
through the front door but probably through the revolving door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many individuals and groups who oppose this head tax. 
Among them are the Canadian Human Rights Commission and the 
Canadian Council for Refugees.  They came up with a document 
called “Impact of the Right of Landing Fee” in 1997.  The 
National Action Committee on the Status of Women noted that it 
has a disproportionate impact on women.  The Caledon Institute of 
Social Policy, the Canadian Ethnocultural Council and the 
Canadian Labour Congress and many more oppose this head tax. They 
oppose it because it is too much.  It is double the fee in the 
U.S.A., for instance, for a family of four entering that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally in 1995 when the right of landing fee was imposed, 
the finance minister proposed a fee of $1,700 to $1,800.  Due to 
some good negotiations probably, it came down to $975, even 
though the former immigration minister wanted it less than $300. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention that the Liberal Party at its 1996 
convention passed a resolution for the government to review the 
head tax.  I believe the government has come up with all kinds of 
lame excuses.  If it was a grassroots party, it would have 
listened to its members.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, even though the government eliminated the head 
tax for refugees in the year 2000, for five years it had been 
milking those people who were forced to leave their homes.  With 
the deficit having turned into a surplus, the government should 
lower taxes in general and eliminate the head tax.  The minister 
has the authority to eliminate the service charge because it is 
not a designated tax.  The right of landing fee should be based 
on equity so that we give new immigrants a chance to settle into 
their new lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I support this motion and I would ask the other 
members of the House to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, let 
the record show, and I hope all the people who are watching this 
back home are fully aware of this, that there is only one party 
in the House of Commons that refuses to allow this motion to go 
to a vote and that is the Liberal Party.  The Liberal MPs are the 
only ones who are afraid to put this issue to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House why they are afraid.  They would lose that 
vote.  There are members of the Liberal backbench to whom I have 
spoken who feel very passionately about this issue as well, 
because they represent ridings where there is a strong population 
of new Canadians who feel abandoned and cheated by their own 
government by the imposition of this unfair tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of one Liberal cabinet minister who has spoken very 
plainly and openly about it and who strongly believes this should 
be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party knows it would lose the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals had a window of opportunity.  I used my very rare 
opportunity of getting one of my bills or motions put forward. Of 
all the pieces of private member's business I have, I chose this 
one in order to give them a graceful exit so that they could get 
out of a bad situation.  They chose not to take advantage or 
avail themselves of that.  I hope they wear that right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the member for South Shore say that this is not just a 
head tax but a penalty on new Canadians.  They are being 
penalized for choosing to make Canada their home.  What kind of 
welcoming message does that send around the world as we try to 
attract the best and the brightest to our country?  I should add 
that we are in competition with other countries.  There are a lot 
of countries people can choose to go to.  We want them to come to 
Canada, yet we throw barriers and roadblocks like this racist 
head tax in their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This head tax is an insult to new Canadians.  I have spoken 
confidentially with people in my riding and they are offended. 
Their feelings are hurt by the imposition of this tax.  The 
Filipino Association of Manitoba, as my hon. colleague across the 
way knows very well because he is a former president of that 
association, has made very public demands.  Its members have let 
their feelings be known very publicly about how offended they are 
that the government chose to look to them as some kind of a cash 
cow or revenue generator when all they are trying to do is 
reunite their families in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most damaging thing about this head tax is not even 
the financial burden that it puts on families trying to bring 
family members here.  It is the moral indignation they feel.  It 
is in the assault on the morale of new Canadians that this head 
tax does really almost permanent damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party had an opportunity to live up to the 
resolution it passed at its own convention and to do the 
honourable thing.  The Liberals do not need a legislative 
directive to change this head tax.  They can do it unilaterally 
by order in council.  The minister has the right to impose, 
raise, lower or eliminate a fee of this nature and it could 
happen tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have sent a welcoming message to new Canadians.  It 
would have satisfied the many social justice groups and advocates 
for immigration who have been saying loud and clear how unfair 
the imposition of this tax is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals missed the opportunity.  They did it voluntarily. I 
see them all looking down at their books.  They are hanging their 
heads in shame, as well they should, because the country is 
watching, and even for those people who may have missed this 
little fiasco we are going to remind them.   We are going to 
publish it far and wide that the Liberals willingly and knowingly 
missed this opportunity.  Not only did they miss the opportunity 
to oppose the head tax, they decided to keep it and keep milking 
new Canadians like they are some revenue generating cash cow. 
Even though the government has a $100 billion surplus that it is 
always crowing about, it decided not to change the practice of 
picking the pockets of new Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus believes that immigration is an engine for 
economic growth.  The NDP caucus believes that new Canadians 
begin contributing to the economy the very day they set foot on 
our shores and buy their first meals or first articles of 
clothing or rent their first home and, I might add, start paying 
taxes for the rest of their lives.  They pay ad nauseam. 
That is how new Canadians make a contribution.  We do not have to 
pick their pockets as soon as they express an interest in coming 
to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have missed a window of opportunity to send a valuable 
message to the rest of the world today.  I am sorry in my own
