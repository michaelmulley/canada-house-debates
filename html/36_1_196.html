<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK6">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-260, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to 
initiate debate on my private member's legislation, Bill C-260. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a simple bill in that it consists of one minor amendment 
to the Young Offenders Act.  I have used the words simple and 
minor to describe the content and the construction of the actual 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ramifications of the legislation are I believe a little 
different and quite important.  They address an issue which 
Canadians have demanded be addressed for years, that the parents 
or guardians of young offenders be called to account when they 
fail to discharge their responsibility to supervise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment changes section 7.2 of the Young Offenders Act 
from a simple summary conviction offence to a dual procedure or 
hybrid offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should this bill be accepted and passed, offenders of section 
7.1 would become subject to either imprisonment of up to two 
years or the normal summary conviction penalties.  As I am sure 
members are aware, the Minister of Justice introduced long 
awaited new youth justice legislation last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, members may be aware that the legislative change 
proposed in Bill C-260 has been incorporated into the new youth 
criminal justice act.  One must assume the Minister of Justice 
and her government see merit in the changes proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may therefore be wondering why I have chosen to proceed 
with this amendment now.  Quite simply, I do not anticipate that 
the new youth justice legislation will be implemented for some 
time yet.  I have heard possibly by year's end at the earliest, 
but even that may be wishful thinking. I believe this amendment 
is important enough to be incorporated within the current youth 
justice legislation, the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now take a moment to outline the reasons for this 
proposal.  Section 7.1 of the Young Offenders Act permits a youth 
court judge or justice to allow an accused person who would 
otherwise be detained in custody to be placed into the care of a 
responsible person who undertakes in writing to be responsible 
for the attendance of the young person in court when required, 
and to ensure compliance with such other conditions as a youth 
court judge or justice may specify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young person also undertakes in writing to comply with the 
arrangements and to comply with any other conditions that the 
judge or justice may specify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In simple terms, instead of keeping a young accused in custody, 
the law permits an individual, usually a parent or guardian, to 
undertake to properly supervise the young person until the 
charges are decided.  This is essentially just another form of 
custody.  It is bail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court wishes to ensure that both the young person and the 
parent or other responsible person agree to abide by the 
conditions of release.  A signed undertaking, a contract, is 
agreed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are of course other provisions that permit changes to the 
terms of the undertaking or even cancellation of the release. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parent need only apply to the court to be relieved of their 
responsibility should they find that they were unable to fulfill 
their obligation.  If that were to occur, the young person would 
be returned to custody unless another person were to come forward 
to sign a new undertaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem that occurs and the reason for introducing this 
legislation is that some parents or guardians enter into these 
undertakings and then wilfully fail to provide proper and 
sufficient supervision.  This failure can then result in 
additional repercussions to the young person and may even result 
in additional criminal charges should the young person proceed on 
to other criminal offences.  It is this type of situation where 
parents or guardians shirk their legal responsibility that the 
bill seeks to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide an example.  Suppose a young person gets involved 
with the wrong crowd and ends up with others causing some form of 
physical assault late one night on an innocent citizen on the 
streets of a community.  The police are called.  An arrest is 
made and a charge is laid.  We can all probably understand why a 
youth court judge might be hesitant to detain this young person 
for this type of offence, especially if it is a first offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we can also understand that the same judge would wish 
to ensure the young person does not get into further difficulty 
prior to the resolution of the charges. The judge may want to 
order the young person to stay away from the influence of other 
accused.  The judge may want to order that the young person 
refrain from being out on the streets late at night.  In other 
words, the judge may impose a curfew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose the young person's parent then agrees to provide a 
written undertaking to supervise this young person to ensure 
conditions are fulfilled such as staying away from a listed 
number of individuals and being at home during a set period of 
night hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if the parent has been part of the problem all along? What 
if the parent has never properly performed parental 
responsibility toward their young person? What if the parent 
signs the undertaking or so-called contract with the court and 
then deliberately neglects to control or supervise the young 
person?  Is this type of situation not a serious problem within 
our justice system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians far and wide have long called for more responsibility 
and accountability on the part of parents or guardians of young 
offenders.  In instances such as I have just described, we have 
cases where parents or other adults sign an undertaking with the 
court to be responsible and accountable.  Should they not at 
least be held accountable to the level of a dual procedure 
offence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the young person merely breaches a condition of release then 
the parent may face a summary conviction procedure for their 
failure to comply with the undertaking to supervise.  If the 
breach of the release condition leads to the commission of a 
serious offence by the young person, that same parent might be 
subject to an indictable proceeding. Like all hybrid offences, 
the crown has the option.  Of course the judge, as always, has 
the final decision on the appropriate punishment should the 
charge be proven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some individuals opposed to these proposed changes to the 
legislation might argue that we may not want to exacerbate the 
situation between a young offender and their parent.  If the 
young offender breaks the conditions of release and the parent is 
found to have wilfully failed to uphold the promise to properly 
supervise, that parent may end up facing more severe 
repercussions through this change to a dual procedure offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may worry that relations between the youth and the parent 
may become further strained.  To this I say that if the parent 
wilfully participates in ignoring a court imposed condition, then 
the parent should be held accountable as it is obvious that the 
parent is a major part of the problem in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parent, by definition, should be setting a proper example for 
the child.  An improper example is certainly being set when an 
adult signs a court order, ignores the consequences and wilfully 
supports the young offender with inappropriate and illegal 
activity.  Of course the parent should be made to account for 
this failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment to the law is merely one step to broaden this 
accountability. It may be a large step toward protecting citizens 
and communities once we impress on delinquent parents how serious 
we consider their failures to control their children placed in 
their custody at their own request until the original criminal 
charges are heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not inform my colleagues that this 
relatively unknown section of the Young Offenders Act is of 
particular relevance to my family and me.

was 16 years old at the time.  He and two friends were heading 
home after getting off a bus near home.  They were attacked at 
random by six strangers, without provocation.  A young offender, 
who was free in the community on a section 7.1 undertaking, 
knifed him in the back.  One of the conditions of release into 
his father's custody was a dusk to dawn curfew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the young offender was not complying with that 
condition on that night.  He had also failed to appear in court 
some three weeks earlier, another failure to comply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the parent who signed that undertaking to 
supervise wilfully failed in his responsibility before the court 
and my son paid the price.  That young offender was convicted of 
the crime and is serving a life sentence in a penitentiary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will note that I stated that it was in my opinion that 
the adult offended section 7.2, as it has never been determined 
in court.  That is the injustice of this case.  I do not know if 
the situation would have ended up any differently, but the 
failure of the adult to properly supervise and control that young 
offender certainly did not help Jesse.  It may well have failed 
to help that particular young offender as well.  Who knows, 
perhaps compliance with the undertaking to supervise might have 
been enough to keep that young person at home that night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I know is that particular adult promised the court he would 
properly supervise the youth.  He promised that the youth would 
attend court.  He promised that the youth would abide by a curfew 
condition.  He failed to fulfil those promises and a young life 
was snuffed out at 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said that this amendment seeks to blame parents for 
the crimes committed by their children.  That is utterly 
ridiculous.  The young person is solely accountable for their own 
criminal activity.  For the purpose of this legislation the 
parent is guilty of the offence of failing to comply with an 
undertaking.  Even if the young person does not go on to commit 
another offence beyond a breach, the parent is still accountable 
for the failure to comply with their own promise to supervise. 
They have broken a contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others suggest that some parents are unable to control their 
children.  If that is the case, then they simply have no business 
entering into such an undertaking.  I do not suggest for one 
minute that a parent or guardian should be expected to chase 
their son or daughter down the street or physically drag them 
into the house at two o'clock in the morning should they decide 
to breach their curfew.  What I do expect, however, is for that 
parent to pick up the phone and notify the police of the breach. 
By doing that the parent has acted in a responsible manner.  The 
parent who merely shuts the door and goes to bed is clearly 
demonstrating a wilful failure to comply with their undertaking 
to supervise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that members of the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs understood the significance of this bill, so 
they made it votable.  As I said at the outset, although the 
content of Bill C-260 is contained in the new youth criminal 
justice act, I seek to amend the current Young Offenders Act, as 
the new legislation is still a long way off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fervently request and seek the support of my colleagues in 
this place for this initiative.  I do so for all concerned.  It 
is in the interest of the safety of our citizens and our 
communities.  It is in the interest of our youth who are most 
often the victim of young offender crimes.  It is in the interest 
of young offenders who are afforded the opportunity to return to 
our communities while they await resolution of their initial 
charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment is simple.  It is solely to make adults more 
accountable and responsible to properly supervise when they 
promise to do so before the courts.  Is that really too much to 
ask? 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to commend the hon. member 
for Surrey North who has introduced Bill C-260 to amend the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House will know, the Minister of Justice introduced youth 
criminal justice legislation last week.  The new legislation will 
replace the Young Offenders Act.  It represents one element in 
the strategy for the renewal of youth justice which was launched 
last May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate my colleague's valuable contribution to the justice 
committee.  Indeed, he asked a number of very thoughtful 
questions.  He was a major contributor to our victims report and 
largely generated many of the very good recommendations that are 
in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a rare day when the government recognizes a private 
member's initiative and adopts it as its own. 
In some respects it is the ultimate compliment of the government 
to a private member to accept their initiative and to incorporate 
it into legislation.  I would point out that in large measure 
this has been incorporated into the new bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer members to Bill C-68, in particular clause 31(1), which 
states that a person who has been arrested may be placed in the 
care of a responsible person. Subclause (b) states that the 
responsible person has to be willing and able to take care of the 
person and has to, in turn, undertake that they will take 
responsibility for the young person.  The young person, in turn, 
has to undertake in writing to comply with the terms of the 
order.  That in itself is quite a scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the bill addresses the concern of the hon. member opposite 
is in clause 138(1).  Herein lies the change.  Every person who 
wilfully fails to comply with clause 30 or with an undertaking 
entered into under clause 31(3) is guilty of an indictable 
offence.   Subclause (b) refers to a summary offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of the bill is to give the crown an election as to 
whether to proceed against the responsible person as an 
indictable offence or as a summary offence.  It is called a 
hybrid offence.  It is a worthwhile and laudable initiative on 
the part of the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore my intention to discuss the objectives of Bill 
C-260 in the context of the youth criminal justice bill.  The 
legislative response announced last week represents an important 
element in the government's overall strategy to address the issue 
of Canadians concerned about youth crime.  There is no single 
solution, no magic bullet which will solve the problem of youth 
crime.  Last year the crime prevention strategy was announced. 
Obviously the most effective answer to crime, and to youth crime 
in particular, is prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to address some of the nonsense 
that is in the news media about the responsibility of parents. 
My hon. friend has addressed a couple of the issues, such as 
parents who are accountable for recidivist youth.  There is no 
way that is incorporated in either his bill or in the new 
legislation.  That notion is nonsense and it needs to be said in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see anything with respect to vicarious liability for 
parental responsibility in the bill.  I stand to be corrected, 
but I cannot quite imagine how parents are going to be held 
responsible for the crime of their children, vicariously or 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses crime with respect to children and parental 
responsibility in clause 11 of the new bill.  The bill deals with 
extra judicial sanctions, namely the giving of a notice to a 
young person that they are having some serious difficulties with 
the law.  That does not initiate a judicial process.  However, 
there is an obligation on the part of the police officer to, in 
turn, give the notice to the parent so the parent or the 
responsible person is aware of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that does not work, then the next stage falls under clause 26 
of the bill where the youth is arrested.   When that youth is 
arrested there is an obligation under clause 26 to give a notice 
to the parents.  The notice contains the name of the young 
person, the charge against the young person and a statement that 
the young person is entitled to be represented by counsel.  That 
is the second level of parental responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third level of responsibility with respect to parental 
attendance is found under clause 27.  If a parent does not attend 
proceedings held before a youth justice court in respect to a 
young person they may be, by order, required to attend.  In 
certain circumstances they may be found in contempt of court if 
they fail to attend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that these are reasoned and balanced responses to 
parental responsibility.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation reflects this commitment to safer streets.  As 
stated in the preamble of the bill, the protection of society 
from youth crime is the most important objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, the legislation sets out its clear goal to 
establish a youth criminal justice system that commands respect, 
fosters responsibility and ensures accountability through 
meaningful consequences and effective rehabilitation and 
reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to state, but much more difficult to put into 
legislation.  However, I would respectfully submit that with the 
nudging of Bill C-260 and the response of Bill C-68 that in fact 
some areas of accountability and responsibility have been 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of addressing problems with the current youth 
justice system through the new youth justice legislation, Bill 
C-260 was taken into account.  The objective of the hon. member's 
bill corresponds to the one objective of the new legislation; 
that is, to foster greater accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals, including persons and their parents, must be held 
accountable for their actions.  Consequences must flow from the 
wrongdoing.  The modifications suggested in Bill C-260 were 
therefore included in the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-260 would apply after the bail criteria has been applied 
and the young person has been found to be ineligible for judicial 
interim release.  In other words, the choice is whether the 
person wants to go to jail or whether someone is going to take 
responsibility for the youth.  In such cases the proposed 
provisions of the youth criminal justice bill permit youth to be 
placed in the care of a responsible adult instead of being 
detained in custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsible adult must undertake, in writing, to take care 
of the young person and ensure that he or she complies with the 
conditions of the court.  As it now stands, if the responsible 
adult wilfully fails to comply with the undertaking, the 
responsible adult could be found guilty of only a summary 
conviction offence.  That, in certain circumstances, as the hon. 
member has pointed out, is woefully inadequate for this kind of 
criminal liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-260 proposes to make the offence a hybrid offence so that 
prosecutors have the choice to proceed summarily or by way of 
indictment.  An undertaking given to the court to act as a 
responsible adult is an extremely serious responsibility.  As an 
aside, if I were a drafter I would insist on independent legal 
advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to impress upon young people that the justice system 
must be respected and should foster values such as accountability 
and responsibility and that criminal behaviour will lead to 
meaningful consequences, then we must also apply those values to 
responsible adults who play a role in the judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the proposed legislation there are measures such as 
the one suggested in Bill C-260 which underscore the importance 
of accountability and meaningful consequences.  The seriousness 
of the crime will be reflected in the seriousness of the 
consequences rendered by the proposed youth criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parents, police, schools and others in the community will 
have a significant role to play in ensuring that the young person 
in question understands and appreciates the gravity of his or her 
actions.  It may be more appropriate for the young person to be 
accountable through retribution, community service or, in certain 
circumstances, confronting his or her victim.  The full weight of 
the criminal law will be brought to bear when a crime committed 
warrants such consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the hon. member can at this point bring a 
small measure of closure to the tragedy of his family.  He has 
acted honourably and in the finest traditions of a 
parliamentarian.  He brings honour to his son, to his family and 
to all members of this House.  I congratulate him personally on 
behalf of the House for his initiative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would also like to add my personal feelings as I open my remarks 
on Bill C-260.  It is certainly the feeling of our caucus that we 
have great admiration and personal respect for the member for 
Surrey North for the work that he has done to champion this 
cause. 
There are not many issues that our caucuses will find any 
community of interest on, more than likely, but this is certainly 
one where I have the greatest admiration not only for the issue 
but for the way the issue has been put forward and handled over 
many months. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy to champion any cause, much less a cause of such 
great personal interest.  It must have been that much more 
difficult for the member to deal with the issue.  Our caucus 
feels strongly that he has handled it very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-260, as we have heard from previous speakers, will be 
covered under the new Bill C-68 so many of the merits of Bill 
C-260 will be incorporated into the new act.  It is for that 
reason that our caucus will not be voting for Bill C-260.  It has 
nothing to do with the content or the merits or the arguments 
that we are hearing today, and certainly nothing to do with the 
issue.  It is simply the fact that we believe it is redundant at 
this point and is not necessary.  Still, it gives us a valuable 
opportunity to speak to the issue and to raise the many merits 
Bill C-260 certainly brings forward for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that under the current Young Offenders Act 
there is a maximum penalty of six months in jail and/or a $2,000 
fine for parents or guardians who fail to meet the requirements 
of the custody and supervision orders.  Certainly it is not as 
though this issue has been left unaccounted for at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have obviously contemplated the problems that come with 
releasing somebody into the custody of another person and holding 
that person accountable for doing what they promised to do or 
undertook to do, which is to keep the person in some form of 
custody until such time as a trial can relieve the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from Winnipeg and with the street gang problem it has, 
this issue comes up all the time.  It is a very frequent 
occurrence.  It certainly needed to be addressed so we are very 
pleased that Bill C-68 will put stiffer measures in place to try 
to give some satisfaction in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus has tried to wrestle with the issue and in doing so 
has tried to be tough on crime but also tough on the causes of 
crime.  That is the best way I can put it briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the issue in Winnipeg Centre, the riding I come from, 
the whole idea of releasing children to the custody of their 
parents and having parents act in a responsible manner is 
actually compounded by the aboriginal population there and the 
parenting skills of the middle aged group of aboriginal people 
who live in the inner city of Winnipeg due to the fact that they 
were lifted out of their homes as children and put into 
residential schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we have finally come to grips with.  We learn 
our parenting skills from our parents.  When we remove a whole 
generation of people from their family homes where they would 
pick up those skills, they do not have the opportunity to learn 
how to be parents.  I am not saying this in a critical way or a 
generalizing way, but that has come to be recognized as one of 
the issues we are facing with a generation of youth in various 
kinds of trouble with street gangs or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parenting that normally goes on in any family home has not 
been going on properly because of the unnatural intervention in 
in the lives of that middle aged population when they were ripped 
from their family homes, dumped in a residential school and just 
did not have the opportunity to learn many of those skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scratching deeper under the surface of the whole issue of youth 
crime and street crime, we have to look at how these youth gangs 
and street gangs are actually structured.  A lot of the kids who 
are involved, the 10, 11 and 12 year old kids, did not actually 
seek out to be members of these gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As more and more of them are finding refuge in safe houses and 
being interviewed by people, it turns out that they are getting 
muscled into taking part in these gangs.  Quite often it is an 18 
or 19 year old who comes to a 10 or 11 year old and says “If you 
do not do this B and E for us we will beat up your sister or 
bring harm to the rest of your family”.  The kids literally have 
no choice.  That is often how they get sucked into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that should change the way we view crimes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take a dispassionate view of the impact on victims of 
crimes.  We also have to take into consideration the fact that a 
lot of these youth involved in this stuff did not do it by 
choice, that they were often pulled or drawn into it from 
unnatural circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an issue in my own personal family that happened to us 
and made me wrestle with the issue to try to get a grip on how we 
feel about youth crime and the treatment of youth.  In my own 
family we were broken into by two youths who were 15 and 16 years 
old.  I actually caught them in the act of breaking into our 
house, which is a very nerve wracking thing.  When I drove home 
one night there they were in the process of breaking into our 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I managed to hold one of them down while my wife phoned the 
police, but my four year old boy was obviously curious about why 
I was fighting in the snowbank with these kids.  He came outside. 
The other youth grabbed my four year old son by the hair and 
pulled him down the street and said “I'll trade with you.  You 
let my friend go and you can have your kid back”.  It was sort 
of a kidnapping incident in the middle of a dark, cold winter 
night in Winnipeg.  It was very terrifying for my whole family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally I dropped the one kid and went after the one that had 
my son and gave him a bit of a licking.  The end of the story is 
that I wound in court for six months fighting charges that I had 
assaulted this kid who had broken into my house.  It is 
fundamentally wrong.  It made me a very angry guy for a long 
time.  As I said, it made me wrestle with the issue of whether we 
get into a hang them high kind of punishment for 15 and 16 year 
old kids who break into our houses and threaten our families or 
we work harder to try to understand the root causes and try to 
deal with it in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was eight or nine years ago.  I have had the fullness of 
time to try to wrestle with the issue.  I believe that some of 
the measures undertaken in Bill C-68 address the right direction 
in which we should be going.  I compliment the member for Surrey 
North that some of the issues dealt with in Bill C-68 had their 
origins in the issue the member brought to the House as the issue 
he wanted to promote.  There should be some satisfaction there, I 
would hope, for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of inner city youth gangs and street gangs—and 
I do not want to harp on it—is an overwhelming problem in the 
inner city of Winnipeg.  There are 1,500 kids actively involved 
in street gang activity.  They actually have break and enter 
rings where they divide up neighbourhoods.  One person will be in 
charge of a little crew of break and enter artists.  They will 
have maybe a six block area that is their turf until they wear it 
out.  Then they sell the rights to the area to another sub-gang 
leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is actually structured to the point where it is beyond kids 
just doing random acts of violence.  It is almost getting to be 
an organized crime ring of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I call them street gangs and not youth gangs is that 
they are not driven by young people.  There is always an older 
ring of people managing the young people who are undertaking the 
actual crimes.  It is incorrect and it is actually maligning 
young people to call them youth gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously as parents we know that most kids are not engaged in 
any illegal activity.  It is only a very few when we look at the 
larger picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families that can least afford decent affordable housing, 
education, sports and recreation for their youths, are the ones 
most likely to be affected by the tragedies of crime, violence, 
street activity and all the predictable consequences of those 
things.  Not to draw too tenuous a connection, we can bring the 
issue down to one of socioeconomics.  It is a natural fact that 
the have nots are more likely to have some kind of violent crime 
as a part of their daily life and more likely to experience some 
sort of violence or crime because the incidents are that much 
higher.  Desperate people take desperate measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I spoke about the issue of arson in my area of 
Winnipeg where the housing stock is so beat up, atrocious, and 
dominated by slum landlords that arson is getting to be almost 
epidemic.  These properties are not worth rehabilitating or 
renovating in any way. 
We have had 85 arsons in a three month period in a 12 square 
block area.  Sometimes two or three places a night are going up 
in smoke.  It is like the big American inner cities during the 
race riots of the 1960s.  These people are torching the whole 
community.  It is burn baby, burn again.  That is an indicator of 
the type of social unrest we are prompting through many of our 
social and economic policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
first comment on the speech of my colleague from the NDP who has 
brought another issue to the House of great concern to all of us. 
It is beyond belief to accept for a moment that he, in an attempt 
to save his son from what could have been serious injury, would 
end up being subject to legal proceedings.  It is beyond belief 
we have come to a state where we no longer have the right to 
protect our property or even our children from what seems to have 
amounted to a kidnapping and a threat against the well-being of a 
four year old child.  It is abhorrent that we as parents or as 
citizens do not have the right in law to use reasonable force to 
protect our children and our property and are subjected to 
criminal proceedings.  We as a parliament ought to take a look at 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to rise today to speak in support of my 
colleague's private member's bill.  The hon. member has dedicated 
the last seven years of his life to changing the Young Offenders 
Act to rightfully hold youth more accountable for their criminal 
actions.  Unfortunately the member for Surrey North had suffered 
an inconceivable tragedy, the loss of a child, which brought him 
to this point in his life.  I empathize with him and his family 
for their terrible loss to the extent my understanding allows me. 
I commend his fortitude to redress the inadequacy of the Young 
Offenders Act in the face of such an event.  I am confident my 
colleague's efforts, particularly in Bill C-260, will help 
prevent other Canadian parents from enduring a similar horrifying 
loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As pointed out by my colleague, section 7.1 of the YOA permits a 
youth court judge to allow an accused to be placed in the custody 
of a parent, guardian or responsible person.  The designated 
person must sign an undertaking to take care and be responsible 
for the attendance of the youth in court and to abide by the 
conditions imposed by the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the law currently stands under section 7.2 of the YOA, if the 
person who signs the undertaking fails to provide proper and 
sufficient supervision he is possibly guilty of an offence 
punishable on summary conviction but summary conviction only. 
Bill C-260 would change this to a dual procedure offence. 
Therefore a parent or guardian may be subject to imprisonment of 
up to two years or the normal summary conviction penalty for a 
violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As already pointed out today, the Minister of Justice has 
incorporated Bill C-260 within the new youth criminal justice 
act.  This provision of the new act has received considerable 
attention and criticism since the minister's announcement last 
week.  In my opinion this criticism is the result of a confusion 
and misunderstanding that must be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Surrey North and others who have spoken in the 
House have addressed the issue, but all members speaking on the 
issue ought to clarify this misunderstanding and confusion for 
the benefit of the Canadian people and particularly for the news 
media upon which we depend to communicate in a clear, 
unmistakable and unconfused manner the laws that are being 
recommended and put forward by the Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents will not be jailed for their children's criminal 
behaviour.  They may however, if Bill C-260 is passed, be subject 
to imprisonment if they fail to comply with a duly and willfully 
signed undertaking.  That is in my opinion reasonable and 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago this April, the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs tabled a comprehensive report containing 14 
recommendations for amending the Young Offenders Act.  This 
report was the result of six months of extensive consultations 
and travel throughout the country at an expense of almost half a 
million dollars.  Over 300 people representing various sectors of 
the youth justice system and society in general testified before 
the committee.  That testimony was incorporated into the 
committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 22, 1997 on behalf of the Reform Party I published a 
minority report containing 17 recommendations.  It proposed a 
comprehensive three pronged approach to deal with the 
complexities of youth crime and the contributing factors 
including:  one, early detection and intervention as an effective 
means of crime prevention; two, community based resolutions and 
sentences in cases of minor offences; and three, strengthening 
the Young Offenders Act through significant amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years after the Reform Party proposed this plan the 
government has introduced its youth criminal justice act.  I want 
to point out at this time that neither the committee's report nor 
my report caught the issue that is the centre of Bill C-260.  It 
is all the more reason I am grateful to the member for Surrey 
North that we heard 300 or more witnesses testify. This 
deficiency within the Young Offenders Act was not pointed out by 
any of the witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that the member, who was a private citizen at the 
time that our committee was in Vancouver, British Columbia, was 
to attend before the committee but for some reason or other he 
was not allowed to appear and testify before the committee.  Had 
he done so, his testimony together with his recommendation that 
now forms the brunt of Bill C-260 I am sure would have been 
placed before the committee. Nevertheless, it was not placed 
before the committee.  Again, I thank the member for his tenacity 
in coming to this place and going through what he had to go 
through to be here so that he could speak not only on the floor 
of the House of Commons but also to bring this bill forward by 
embracing and encompassing the legal process to do so within this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we will go into extended debate once the government's new 
bill to amend the YOA has been brought forward.  However, I would 
like to point out that I have concerns that the government's own 
committee recommendations have been set aside with regard to 
lowering the age, including recommendations from many of the 
attorneys general and from experts in the business, such as 
Professor Nicholas Bala who was commissioned by the justice 
department to look at lowering the age from 12 to 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the government has abandoned these young people 
who by their criminal acts signal to society that they are in 
need of help and assistance.  To leave it to the provinces is 
wrong.  It is going to create a checkerboard approach to dealing 
with these young people. There is no standardization in the 
criminal law governing the administration of the law in the 
provinces by the attorneys general. I have some concerns in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have some concerns about the restrictions placed on what 
otherwise seems to be a fairly progressive move to allow for the 
publicizing of names of young offenders, particularly violent and 
repeat violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns in those two areas. We will be addressing them 
as the bill goes further through the process and certainly before 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing,  in view of the comments made by my colleague who 
sponsored this bill and the fact that it may be a long time 
before the amendment to the Young Offenders Act produced by the 
government comes into effect, I would like to move a motion.  I 
ask for unanimous consent to proceed with all stages of Bill 
C-260 now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent of the House for the member to propose the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, there are a couple of rather interesting points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I find myself rising today to speak in support of a bill, 
principles and comments put forward by a member of the Reform 
Party.  For me, that is quite an unusual experience to have and I 
admit that openly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I see what just happened.  I see the politics of the Young 
Offenders Act which, until this previous attempt to involve 
politics, was going in the right direction. The member asked for 
unanimous consent when we have not even finished the first hour 
of the three hours of debate which have been allocated to this 
worthwhile bill.  I am sure the member who did that will be 
sending out a press release saying is it not awful the government 
will not allow this bill to go through. I thought for a moment we 
actually had a chance to get along, yet I see the opportunism 
taking place.  I just had to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back and try to get along on this bill for a couple 
of reasons; I think it is important and the government has 
recognized in the new legislation that the issue is very 
significant.  Also, the bill comes clearly from the heart of a 
member of this place and his family who have had to suffer the 
worst possible experience that any parent could ever imagine.  He 
has come before this place and has put a bill forward that might 
prevent other families from having the same experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose it could be seen as being condescending for members on 
this side of the House to congratulate the member, but I believe 
that in this case, and hopefully in many more cases, there are 
reasons we should understand the passion someone brings to this 
place.  We should understand that someone has had to go through a 
terrible experience and is now trying to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from the letter sent to all of us by the hon. 
member for Surrey North asking us to support his bill.  He 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impetus for this bill comes from personal experience.  Some 
of you may be aware that my son, Jesse, was murdered by a young 
offender in 1992. What you may not know is that his killer was 
free in the community on a section 7.1 undertaking, one condition 
of which was a dusk to dawn curfew. The murder occurred at 
midnight. 
</UL>
<—obviously in violation of that curfew. The member goes on to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the person who signed that undertaking willfully 
failed in his responsibility to supervise. My son, my family, 
paid the price. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, the point the member has made is one of the more 
thoughtful positions I have heard in this place. The supervising 
parent of the now convicted murderer who is doing I believe 25 
years at the present time—I can be corrected, but he is in 
jail—made an undertaking to supervise the individual. The member 
clearly said that knowing that the young offender was violating 
the terms of that undertaking and the terms of the parole, had 
the parent made a phone call to the police, there is a 
possibility, one never knows but there is a possibility, that the 
authorities could have taken some action.  That is so critical in 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has recognized the significance of this 
kind of an amendment.  I say to the member that if for some 
reason he has heard some members say that they are not going to 
vote in favour of his bill, one member earlier said because it 
was redundant and would be in the new legislation, I too would 
share his concern that we do not delay things too long to make 
this new amendment reality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By introducing Bill C-68 dealing with young offenders, the 
government is saying that it wants to see this implemented. 
Hopefully the opposition, for a miraculous moment or a slight 
change, will co-operate with the government so that we can fast 
track the new bill dealing with young offenders. Why am I 
skeptical that that will not happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The politics of the Young Offenders Act that are played out by 
the extreme right wing make it very difficult to put in place 
thoughtful amendments such as the one the member is putting forth 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about boot camps being the solution.  I remember 
pre-1995 and knocking on doors during the provincial election 
campaign.  As I campaigned, a lot of people said that they really 
liked the idea of boot camps and getting these guys into some 
kind of a disciplinary situation where they would have to wear 
uniforms and perform military service.  People thought that was 
the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not say this with reference to the case that impacted on 
the family of the member for Surrey North, but the real tragedy 
in many cases with young offenders is that there are parenting 
problems.  There is a lack of direction.  There is a lack of a 
role model.  There is a lack of discipline.  There is a lack of 
love. Often that is the case.  Young offenders too often come 
from broken families, from poverty, from the bad part of town if 
you will.  Sometimes they get in with the wrong group. Drugs may 
be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us to adopt the rhetoric we hear so often from the Reform 
Party, that we are not hard enough on 10 year olds is the latest 
one with regard to the new bill, would be unfortunate.  I wish 
more members opposite would learn from the experience of the 
member for Surrey North.  None of us can really understand the 
pain of that, but let us learn from it. The member has put 
forward a very thoughtful solution to a very serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that we get the message through to the 
media that this does not mean a parent is suddenly going to pay 
the price for a young person's crime.  Although there are members 
opposite who I am quite sure would agree with that sentiment.   I 
know.  I have heard speeches by members in this place and in the 
Ontario legislature where the sole solution to reducing youth 
crime was to simply find a way to make the parent pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a call very recently from a constituent who suggested we 
should go further, that we should make school teachers pay the 
price if the student in their classroom committed a crime.  Where 
do these kinds of half-baked ideas come from?  They are 
destructive. The real long term solution to dealing with youth 
crime is to reintegrate and help these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of a time I spent on the licence appeal board when 
I was a municipal councillor.  It pales in comparison to the 
kinds of issues we are talking about.  We have to realize that 
87% of the crimes committed by young people are not violent 
crimes.  Thirteen percent is an enormously high figure in my view 
and something we cannot ignore, but the vast majority of crimes 
do not fall into that category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to my example because it very much 
shaped my thinking on justice issues. We were a three person body 
that had to sit in a judicial format. It was not like a council 
meeting where we could leave the room.  We heard about a very 
high profile case in the community that generated a petition for 
the return of capital punishment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we had to get into the details, we were able to 
understand that without a doubt there was a tragedy but there was 
also tremendous remorse.  A serious problem had occurred to 
another family and it totally changed the position of the members 
on that committee.  Justice issues and violence issues are not 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me once again commend the member for Surrey North for his 
doggedness and dedication in memory of his son.  He does his 
son's memory proud.  I congratulate him for bringing this 
forward.  He and his family can take credit for this being part 
of the new legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am also very pleased to take part in this 
important debate which, as has been mentioned several times 
already, is a real tribute that the hon. member for Surrey North 
has paid to the memory of his son. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from some of the rhetoric that tends to emerge in debates 
such as this, I will not say there is no merit in some of the 
changes that have been brought about through this legislation. 
However, I do believe there is also a great deal of missed 
opportunity when I read through some of these sections, in 
particular the subject of this debate under Bill C-260, parental 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section, proposed in its current form, is very commendable. 
It will have an effect, one hopes, in terms of sending the 
proper message to parents and guardians who are predisposed to 
ignore the conditions put in place by a court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a misconception about the actual effect this 
will have on the ability of the courts to hold a parent or 
guardian responsible for the actions of a young person.  This is 
after the fact treatment.  This is not the ability of the courts 
to have any true sanctions against a parent ignoring or 
abdicating their responsibilities for their young person, whether 
their child or a person for whom they are acting as a parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wrong impression that many have is that somehow through some 
sanctions a person will be brought into court if their child has 
been accused or is being charged with an offence before the 
courts and that somehow the courts will actually be able to hold 
the parent or guardian accountable.  That is not the case at all. 
It is important for that to be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment through the new young offenders legislation will 
allow the courts to hold criminally responsible a parent in 
certain cases. For example, a young person enters the process and 
is released on a form of recognizance, which is merely a contract 
to the court to comply with certain conditions such as a curfew, 
non-association, an abstention from contacting a person or place 
or staying away from drugs and alcohol if they were involved in 
the commission of an offence.  If that young person does not 
comply with those court ordered conditions and the parent or 
guardian who signs that contract similarly with the court is not 
holding up that standard, which would be expected, if they 
abdicate that responsibility and willfully do not ensure that 
every effort is made to ensure that the young person complies, 
then they can be charged criminally and brought into court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section will accomplish that.  It also raises the level of 
accountability because it brings it from a six month maximum to a 
two year maximum, making it instead of just a summary offence a 
hybrid offence.  It does accomplish that and does so with the 
best of intentions.  The member for Surrey North should receive 
great accolades and great congratulations for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the broader scheme we need to take a more holistic approach 
when it comes to youth justice.  We need to ensure there is an 
entry level emphasis and a proactive approach taken. In order for 
that to happen the existing social services, child welfare and 
the social welfare net, need to be enhanced and up to par. 
Currently that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about an integrated approach and this new 
legislation working cheek and jowl, hand in glove with existing 
legislation that unfortunately will not happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a Special Committee of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I merely wish to indicate 
that the Bloc Quebecois members will be dividing their time for 
the remainder of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, the matter we are debating 
today is a very important one.  I believe we are, moreover, the 
first parliament in any of the three Americas to hold such a 
debate on the creation of a pan-American currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point today is not to decide on the need for such a currency 
or to agree or disagree with this measure, but rather to agree 
to debate it.  I would remind my colleagues that, where the free 
trade agreement and the signing of NAFTA were involved, the 
opposition was very vocal in its criticism of the government for 
making decisions without sufficient consultation.  The Liberals 
were in opposition at the time, and demanded that a debate be 
held prior to signing any such actions and agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a mistake must not be made a third time.  I believe that 
this question of the existence of a common currency must be 
examined thoroughly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first threw out this idea last December, and there have been a 
number of reactions since then.  The Canadian ambassador to 
Washington, Mr. Chrétien, wondered the same thing, and Quebec 
Finance Minister Landry supported the undertaking.  My colleague 
from Charlesbourg, who will be speaking a little later on, has 
studied the matter.  Thomas Courchesne and other economists have 
spoken and written about it.  The Minister of Finance, the Prime 
Minister and the Director of the Bank of Canada have spoken out 
against such a notion.  I should clarify that this was for all 
of North America, and that they have not ventured any opinion 
about a common currency for all of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that so many are reacting to this issue, asking 
questions and giving opinions indicates that we are all aware 
that our world is moving toward the formation of three major 
economic and political blocks, not just economic but political 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Economic Community is, naturally, the most 
developed.  Its beginnings date back to the Monnet-Shuman 
Agreement on carbon and steel.  The treaty of Rome followed, 
with all its developments, and then the Maastricht agreement and 
the creation of the euro barely a few weeks ago, the first 
block, with highly developed expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second block is was formed by NAFTA, which brings together 
all the countries in North America—Canada, the United States 
and Mexico, with Quebec joining soon, I am sure. 
With last year's financial crisis behind it, Asia will also move 
toward this model with a political giant, China, and the 
economic giant, Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems of some concern in Africa remain for the world as a 
whole.  It is not the focus of today's debate, but we should—ant 
this is my suggestion—hold a debate on the economic aid that 
should be given Africa, which is really outside the movement 
taking place on the other continents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA, I repeat, brings together the countries in North America. 
At the Miami summit a few years ago, a proposal was put forward 
to create a free trade market within the three Americas, from 
Tierra del Fuego to Baffin Island.  As I speak, negotiations and 
discussions are underway with Chile and Venezuela.  The 
Caribbean countries have also established a form of economic 
co-operation. 
In South America, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay have 
the MERCOSUR.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be realized that, 20 years from now, the countries of 
the three Americas will be part of NAFTA. Canada signed a free 
trade agreement with Israel and, very recently, one with the 
Palestinian Authority. It is also conducting important 
negotiations with the European free trade association, which 
includes Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of an economic bloc also implies, within a 
rather short term, the creation of a common currency and of 
common political institutions, as in the case of Europe. We do 
not need to reinvent the wheel. We can learn from the European 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that should really concern Quebeckers and 
Canadians regardless—and I want to be clear on this today—of the 
outcome of the constitutional debate between Quebec and Canada. 
It is all the more important to hold this debate now with the 
emergence of the Eurodollar, because 11 national currencies, and 
major ones at that, are about to disappear. The German mark, the 
French franc and the Italian lira were created a long time ago. 
These countries have a much longer political history than ours. 
These countries will lose their currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years from now, there will only be three major 
currencies: the American dollar, the Japanese yen and the 
Eurodollar. A large number of less important currencies are 
surviving alongside these three major ones. There is an 
intermediate category, which includes currencies such as the 
pound sterling. Negotiations are well underway in Great Britain 
to start using the Eurodollar. 
We have the pound sterling, the Australian dollar, the Swedish 
krona and the Canadian dollar, which means that the Canadian 
dollar will be of much greater interest to speculators in the 
years ahead. We saw what happened in Asia last year and in 
Brazil just recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if we know what things are like now, and if we 
anticipate the highly predictable situation of a large economic 
block consisting of the three Americas in 20 years' time, the 
issue is much more one of how to effect the transition between 
the present and the future, with the advantages and 
disadvantages that will come up along the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must realized that, as the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said in a recently published book, no government can 
claim to control its monetary policy, to have an independent 
monetary policy.  I rarely agree with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, but this is one area where we are on the 
same wavelength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the main problem for Quebec and for 
Canada during this transition period is exports.  Right now, our 
exports are primarily affected by the weakness of the Canadian 
dollar.  I wonder whether it is not worse in the medium term to 
base the strength and success of our exports on the weakness of 
the Canadian dollar rather than on the productivity of Quebec 
and Canadian enterprises.  To ask the question is to answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot allow a situation to develop where the Canadian dollar 
would increase in value because of the devaluation of the 
American dollar, probably in competition with the euro, while 
our  productivity remained unequal to that of the Americans. 
There would be repercussions to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not our duty as parliamentarians, as elected 
representatives, to carry out a careful examination of this 
situation in order to be prepared for it, instead of just 
letting it happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was raised about what would happen to our social 
policies during such a transitional period, if there were a 
common currency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ought we to abandon them, or ought we instead to do as Europe 
did, and adopt mechanisms to ensure that the deficit cannot 
exceed 3% of the gross domestic product, thus leaving leeway for 
policies leaning more to the left, or more to the right?  Free 
trade, or a common monetary policy, are not policies of the 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the situation in Europe at the present time, Germany 
has Schröder, a social democrat; France has the socialist 
Jospin; Great Britain has Blair of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, this is an important debate, of equal importance to 
the sovereignists and to the federalists. 
The economic developments that will occur in the world will take 
place regardless of the constitutional choices we will make as 
Quebeckers, and you will make as Canadians.  I believe we 
Quebeckers will have an even greater role to play, but that is 
another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that by agreeing to hold such a debate today we are 
affirming our role as elected representatives, one which must 
rise beyond petty politics and affirm the importance of having 
Quebeckers and Canadians debate such issues in preparation for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just for clarification, the motion reads a 
single pan-American currency.  Is the member suggesting a north 
American currency or a western hemisphere currency? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is neither.  When I say 
pan-American, I mean the three Americas, which represents less 
than the western hemisphere, and more than North America alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about a common currency for North America, Central 
America and South America, since I think that, in twenty years, 
all of the countries in the three Americas will be signatories 
to NAFTA and, according to the Miami resolution of a few years 
ago, which was adopted at the summit of the countries of the 
three Americas, we will have a vast economic market stretching 
from Tierra del Fuego to Baffin Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am using the term pan-American.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  Has he 
considered that the European Union, which took 40 years to reach 
a point where it even considered a common currency with the 
Maastricht treaty in Holland, first had a political union with 
the European parliament and was very much focused on defence 
issues and other issues that superseded economic issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems from my perspective that the Bloc is potentially 
cherry-picking one element of the European Union policy when in 
fact holistically the European Union has dealt more predominantly 
with defence and political issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A floating exchange rate provides an ability through that 
mechanism for the exchange rate to reflect relative levels of 
productivity.  Without that unemployment would emerge as 
potentially the main floating mechanism to reflect those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he be satisfied with an unemployment rate in Canada higher 
than it is now?  Considering the fact that Quebec has a 
relatively high provincial debt, would he be satisfied with 
higher unemployment rates for Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two questions there. 
I am told I am taking only one of the elements of the European 
construction.  If we were offered the Maastricht option today, 
the Quebec sovereignists would be happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debating one element does not mean rejecting the whole.  I am 
aware, though, that it has taken 40 years to build this 
political and monetary agreement in Europe.  I say that it would 
be in 20 years, half the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my colleague that we do not know who invented the 
wheel.  However, the next individual, the one who put it to use, 
did not take as long to do so as the one who invented it.  We 
can draw on the experience of the Europeans in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the issue of unemployment, I am concerned about the 
unemployment rate and this is why I am talking about a 
transition period. The situation is all the more worrisome if, 
in the middle term, our economic success is primarily based on 
our exports and on the weakness of the Canadian dollar.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone will tell us that if we are doing our utmost to 
strengthen our economy, this should be reflected by a stronger 
Canadian currency, which means that the gap between the American 
and Canadian dollars should be lesser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, instead of working to improve our businesses' productivity, 
we had merely and blissfully watched the success of a temporary 
policy, we would then have had to deal with an extremely high 
unemployment rate and, more importantly, with one that might 
have been permanent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, in order to deal with the dangers of an unemployment rate 
that would increase because of the low productivity of Canadian 
businesses, we must increase that productivity and make sure, 
among other things, that machinery costs us less. The weakness 
of the Canadian dollar works against us when we have to buy 
machinery from abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just the opposite of what the hon. member said, although 
we are aware of the issues that he raised. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the Prime Minister not taking the same 
attitude now that he did with respect to free trade and the GST? 
Today, the answer is no, but is this not another case where he 
will have to change his position before very long in order to 
ensure the economic future of Quebec and of Canada in the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, very likely, one more flip flop 
would not bother him, but as parliamentarians we must decide if 
we want to leave something this important to the C.D. Howe 
Institute, the Fraser Institute, the whole Canadian business 
community, and government mandarins, or whether we should not, 
as parliamentarians, play our role and examine all aspects of 
the issue.  That is what we were elected to do, and we should 
assume 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to rise today to take part in this important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before the House today is rapidly moving to the 
forefront, particularly since the introduction of the Eurocoin 
on January 1 of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to say that the Bloc Quebecois is the first 
political party to raise this issue, not only in Canada but, to 
my knowledge, in all of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody knows I have been interested in this issue for  some 
time. I circulated a study paper on this at the beginning of the 
year, which sparked a debate in Quebec, in Canada and even among 
our neighbours to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be sad, inappropriate and most of all unfortunate for 
the Parliament of Canada not to consider this issue, 
particularly since even the Canadian ambassador to the United 
States himself, Raymond Chrétien, the Prime Minister's nephew, 
raised this possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to talk about the wording of the motion, which 
does not imply the adoption of a common currency, but rather the 
striking of a committee to consider the issue. The Bloc is not 
asking that a common currency be adopted tomorrow, but that we, 
as parliamentarians, elected by the people, study the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the globalization of the economy, which 
brings as a consequence the regionalization and 
continentalization of markets. The European Union, NAFTA and 
MERCOSUR are examples of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to take into account the fact that there are only 
three major currencies left in the world, the U.S. dollar, the 
euro, and the Japanese yen, the other world currencies being 
tied to these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the Canadian dollar fit into all this?  I believe 
that the Canadian dollar, being only an intermediary currency, 
will become the object of increasing speculation, since the 
birth of the euro last January 1 deprived speculators of 11 
currencies.    This makes it all the more important to think 
things through carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been said, monetary and trade issues cannot be 
separated one from the other.  Perhaps, then, the Canadian trade 
situation ought to be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Free Trade Agreement, Canadian trade, which had been 
primarily east-west, has rapidly become north-south and 
south-north. 
In 1984, Canadian exports to the rest of the world were 113% of 
interprovincial trade.  In 1996, this figure was up to 183%, and 
Canada-U.S. trade is now greater than interprovincial trade.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of comparison, on average 62% of exports of countries in 
the European Union are with each other, whereas 82% of Canada's 
exports go to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of GNP, exports among EU countries represent only 16% 
of their GNP, whereas Canada's to the U.S., represent 30% of 
Canada's GNP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is therefore more economically integrated with the United 
States than the countries of the EU are with each other.  Also 
the fact that 11 EU countries have decided to adopt a common 
currency argues strongly in favour of establishing a formal link 
between Canadian and American dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it is logical for monetary integration to follow 
economic integration.  Thus a pan-American currency would 
probably apply to Canada and the United States first, before 
possibly extending fully to the three Americas in the wake of 
the liberalization of trade that is on the agenda for all 
countries in the western hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1998 Canada's money supply represented $364.5 billion 
U.S. 
By comparison, at the same time, the American money supply 
totalled $5,841 billion U.S., an increase of 10,7% from October 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian money supply amounts to 6.2% of the American money 
supply. This means that, for the United States, the adoption by 
Canada of a dollar tied to their currency represents barely a 
few months of the normal growth of their money supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also talk about the main advantages and drawbacks of a 
single currency. The main argument against a single currency was 
mentioned by the Conservative member and has to do with the 
principle of monetary independence. 
What about the independence of Canada's monetary policy? There 
is no such independence, it is a myth. There is no Canadian 
monetary independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not my opinion but that of several, including Sherry 
Cooper, chief economist and senior vice-president at Nesbitt 
Burns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a closer look at the figures. For example, between 
1950 and 1986, in order to get the Bank of Canada rate, we 
simply had to add 1.1% to the rate of the U.S. federal reserve 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97, for the first time in 50 years, with the exception of 
1973, the Bank of Canada rate was lower than the American rate. 
As we all know, this resulted in the Canadian dollar taking a 
nose dive and falling to 63 cents U.S. It is to correct this 
situation that the Bank of Canada increased its rate to 1% above 
the U.S. rate. 
This is a return to the old econometric model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be the main advantages of a common currency?  First, 
it would eliminate the risks of devaluation and the losses that 
result from converting national currencies.  Second, it would 
lead to greater transparency of costs and prices within a 
monetary zone, thus facilitating comparison. Finally, it would 
allow optimal allocation of capital, largely because certain 
regions have a savings surplus while others have trouble coming 
up with the capital needed to develop their projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, as parliamentarians, we should be debating all of the 
above.  The train is already leaving the station.  Before it 
goes too far, we should get on.  Not only can we be on board, 
but we can even be in the locomotive pulling the whole train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to move an amendment to the motion moved by the member 
for Laurier—Sainte-Marie.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK22">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the word «struck» the 
following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>«immediately». 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would argue that, if 11 European countries 
decide, for their own interests, to create a monetary union, why 
could Canada and the other countries of the Americas not do the 
same?  The elected representatives of the House must ask 
themselves the following question:  how can Quebec and Canada 
now make the most of the new economic context of globalization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to take the time to examine this 
important issue.  I put it to the House that we must not let 
this opportunity slip through our fingers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys,

I find it a fascinating discussion so far.  I cannot help but 
think about what this place would look like if we were filled 
with political eunuchs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen many times in the past legislation passed that 
makes this place irrelevant.  To call us a palace of eunuchs 
makes me nervous.  I cannot help but think about this when I 
listen to my friends in the Bloc.  In my judgment they seem to be 
advocating some sort of Quebec as a banana republic, with no 
control over its monetary policy, no control over the value of 
its currency and abandoning decisions on these crucial matters to 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are members of the Bloc Quebecois prepared to give up any sense 
of sovereignty over currency? Is this an extension of their 
zealous approach to NAFTA and all of the other implications of a 
free trade agreement? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am a little bit 
disappointed by the question asked by my colleague from the NDP 
for two reasons. First of all, as I mentioned in my speech, 
right now Canada does not have an independent monetary policy. 
We could study the issue in committee and I think we would come 
to the conclusion that our monetary policy is not independent 
and we would have to take it from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I do not see why such proud countries as France, Germany 
with its Deutschmark, Belgium, Italy and Spain, old countries 
that were built on a very strong brand of nationalism, would be 
willing not to give up their monetary sovereignty, but rather to 
pool it. Maybe the notion of sovereignty in the 21st century is 
more like a pooling of individual sovereignties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example. 
The Eurocoin, the new European currency, is France's idea. The 
franc was very closely linked to the Deutschmark, Germany's 
currency. France saw it had no influence on German monetary 
policy. It had no representative in the Bundesbank. What did it 
do? It proposed the adoption of a common currency. As a matter 
of fact, France was behind the adoption of the Maastricht 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened? France now has a representative in the European 
Central Bank, whereas previously it did not have any control 
over European monetary policy, which, for all intents and 
purposes, was Germany's monetary policy. France did not lose any 
sovereignty; it gained some.

listened with great interest to what my colleague from the Bloc 
said.  He has been quoting these examples from Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that on this side of the Atlantic the better 
example at the moment for the extension of the U.S. currency is 
the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  For 107 years Puerto Rico has 
had the U.S. dollar but nothing else.  It is simply a source of 
cheap labour and occasionally a source of ball players for the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the western hemisphere, has my colleague studied the case of 
Puerto Rico in the last 100 years?

pleased to note the tone the Liberals will be adopting in this 
debate. It is rather distressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are comparing apples and oranges.  This is the first time I 
have heard the Liberals comparing Canada to Puerto Rico.  This 
gives us some idea of how low they can stoop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is G7 country.  Its economy ranks 7th in the world.  They 
are trying to compare Puerto Rico, which is a political 
dependency of the United States, with Canada, which is not, and 
where we could have a say on the North American and pan-American 
monetary policy.  This is an opportunity we must not let slip 
through our fingers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lead off the 
government's response to the Bloc's motion on the pan-American 
monetary union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the blatant irony of this motion is clear to most 
hon. members.  We have a party that is dedicated to breaking up 
one of the world's truly blessed unions, Canada, and at the same 
time asks us to jump into bed with American monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the real question and issues at stake here it 
quickly becomes clear why this motion deserves to be rejected. 
Would a monetary union with the United States or the rest of the 
hemisphere give us a better monetary policy?  Would it be good 
for Canadian firms?  Would it lead to higher living standards for 
Canadians?  The answer to these questions is absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember when in the 1960s Canada had a system of fixed exchange 
rates.  However, this did not eliminate speculation against the 
value of the Canadian dollar.  In fact, it in some cases led to 
currency misalignment.  Eventually the fixed exchange rate regime 
was abandoned in the 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other countries adopted a system of fixed exchange rates 
after World War II.  Like Canada, some of them chose to move to 
flexible exchange rates while others moved to make adjustments to 
their currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there is the Euro.  That is the basis of this whole 
motion.  The move of 11 European countries toward monetary union 
might seem applicable to this hemisphere but this is the sort of 
false apples and oranges comparison, or maybe I should say 
tourtiere and strudel, that falls apart the minute we look at it 
intelligently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the facts.  The European project involves several 
countries with key members of a similar economic size and at a 
similar level of development.  These countries have adopted a 
common currency administered by a common central bank with a 
board of 11 national directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, a pan-American monetary union would be dominated by 
one mega country, the United States.  There would be the 
influence from another group of countries with records of 
sometime high cosmic inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is clear.  In such a union, even if it were put 
into practice, it is doubtful that Canada would have a 
significant role to play in the formulation of North American or 
pan-American monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes me to the underlying point.  No matter how members 
try to phrase or disguise it, a monetary union actually amounts 
to fixed exchange rates which eliminate forever Canada's ability 
to conduct a flexible and independent monetary policy.  This is 
no small or abstract sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A flexible exchange rate regime has served Canada very well over 
the years, helping our economy adjust to important economic 
shocks and allowing our country to conduct an independent 
monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might ask about the recent movements in the Canadian 
dollar.  Do these movements not show that we would have been 
better off with a fixed exchange rate and a monetary policy under 
the control of others?  Absolutely, definitely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These movements represent the natural response to international 
shocks.  In fact, it is the currency fluctuation that has 
actually helped us to adjust to these shocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen has explained on a 
number of occasions, the dollar weakened last year because Canada 
was being sideswiped by events beyond our borders. 
Foremost among these have been the Asian financial crises and 
more recently the development in Russia and Latin America. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this into context.  Canada was certainly not the only 
country to be affected by these recent developments.  Since the 
Asian crises began the currencies of other major commodity 
exporters such as Australia and New Zealand were affected even 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada's dependence on commodity based exports has 
steadily declined, Canada remains a net exporter of primary 
commodities.  Accordingly, the movements in commodity prices have 
had a significant impact on the Canadian economy.  The U.S. on 
the other hand is a net importer of primary commodities. As a 
result Canada suffers income losses when commodity prices fall 
while the U.S. economy benefits.  This is an important difference 
between Canada and the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world prices of primary commodities have a major influence 
on the value of the Canadian dollar because the exchange rate 
adjusts to balance trade and capital flows in a flexible exchange 
rate system.  When world commodity prices fall the Canadian 
dollar tends to depreciate against the U.S. dollar.  This is 
truer of our relationship with the U.S. than other G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two years the ratio of export to import prices in 
Canada and the United States has moved in opposite directions. 
Our terms of trade declined by 6% while the U.S. terms of trade 
rose by 5%.  In other words, we are receiving less attractive 
prices for the goods we sell abroad compared with the prices we 
pay for products we import while the U.S. enjoys the opposite 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important corollary that we must remember. Canada's 
exchange rate flexibility has helped buffer the Canadian resource 
centre by limiting the damage from plunging global commodity 
prices.  It has helped up to continue to sell goods around the 
world, especially in the U.S. market.  The flexibility has helped 
more than hurt the aluminium industry in Quebec, Ontario metal 
mines, Alberta oil and B.C. forest companies.  These industries 
would have suffered severely and more so if we had a fixed 
exchange rate, virtually pricing us out of any global sales at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic fact is flexible exchange rate arrangements are more 
suitable when countries tend to have different monetary policy 
objectives, different industrial structures and face different 
economic shocks.  It is not the situation Canada faces as anyone 
who can look beyond their narrow provincial borders can say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again emphasize that a flexible exchange rate allows 
Canada to conduct independent monetary policy that puts Canada 
and Canadians first.  The benefits of the greater monetary policy 
autonomy and macroeconomic stabilization made possible by 
flexible exchange rates are large. On the other hand, a fixed 
exchange rate would significantly curtail the autonomy of 
Canadian monetary authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objective of monetary police with respect to the 
domestic economy is to preserve the value of money, to achieve 
and preserve a low and stable inflation rate.  Anyone who 
remembers Canada of the mid-1970s and beyond understands that a 
high and variable inflation rate can be very costly for the 
economy and that aiming at low and stable inflation is the best 
contribution that monetary policy can make for the achievement of 
economic well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A flexible exchange rate plays a crucial role in the operation 
of monetary policy in an open economy like Canada.  We know that 
capital is highly mobile between Canada and the U.S. and it would 
be impossible for Canada to set an independent and effective 
monetary policy under a fixed exchange rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Independent monetary policy also allows us to better absorb what 
are called macroeconomic shocks.  We are seeing right now that we 
have been able to escape the worst of last year's Asian crises. 
Although both the Canadian and the U.S. monetary authorities are 
currently dedicated to maintaining low inflation in their 
respective countries, it is a recognized fact that Canada has 
recently made more progress in this regard and we have been able 
to do so more explicitly about our longer term objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record of many other countries in the hemisphere is by no 
means as good as Canada's.  Would we want our monetary policy to 
be dictated by a board of governors that would include 
representatives who had run hyper inflations in the past? 
Fixing the exchange rate also sacrifices our ability to use 
monetary policy for short term economic stabilization.  For 
Canada and the United States to be an optimum currency area they 
would have to face very similar economic shocks and be very

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is something for the hon. member of the Bloc to think 
about.  Although Canada and the United States are bound together 
in many ways, we actually face very different economic shocks. 
Some would argue that a fixed exchange rate would reduce 
transaction costs in international trade and capital flows. We 
have evidence that shows the opposite, that in fact the costs are 
very small compared to the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the costs of currency volatility were so high, why has there 
been such a drastic jump in two way trade and direct investment 
between our two countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any of these attributes can be found in today's 
motion or in the political game playing that is going on here. If 
we pursued the suggestion of the Bloc, we would end up trying to 
tread water in tough seas, having thrown away the life preserver 
of our sovereign, independent, made in Canada monetary policy. 
It is not an option the government will ever accept on behalf of 
a vast majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to vote against the 
opposition motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> In light of the interest 
being shown in this matter, I am going to ask hon. members to 
kindly limit their questions to one minute. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
interested to hear what my colleague from the Liberal Party had 
to say.  Some of his points merit more thorough study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what the purpose of the Bloc Quebecois motion 
of today is: to look at both sides of the issue.  There are 
arguments both for and against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has decided to vote against the motion presented by 
the Bloc Quebecois.  Is this not missing an opportunity to look 
at such an important issue in greater depth, instead of being 
restricted to a single day as is the case today? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thought I indicated 
quite clearly that I would be voting against the motion by the 
Bloc.  In the remarks I made I thought it was very clear the 
government has as its objective to ensure that we put Canada and 
Canadians first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is essentially saying to the House and to Canadians 
that they would like to go back to a fixed exchange rate system. 
When they draw comparison between the North American hemisphere 
and the European Union, members of the Bloc fail to recognize 
that within the European Union are countries of similar size and 
economic power.  There are countries that want to integrate their 
economies.  There is a free flow of labour mobility in the 
European Union which forms part of its agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member who asked the question think that it would 
not be in the best interest of Canada and Canadians to ensure 
that we direct our own monetary policy?  We have seen the impact 
of that.  As we experience what goes on around the world, we must 
have as a country the flexibility to ensure that we can respond 
and continue to grow our domestic economy in spite of what goes 
on globally. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the remarks of my colleague.  I 
understand his points about the differences between the European 
Union and the scale of our economies and the differences in the 
western hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned before the case of Puerto Rico.  It seems to me the 
debate is about extending the U.S. dollar.  It was extended to 
Puerto Rico well over 100 years ago, which has simply resulted in 
the slowing of the economy of Puerto Rico.  By the way, there are 
no increased ties between Puerto Rico and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were speaking about the western hemisphere and I would like 
to ask my colleague about the U.S. dollar being extended to 
Liberia. 
I am not sure if it is still true, but it may well be that for 
many years Liberia has used the U.S. dollar at par.  The country 
of Liberia is in the eastern hemisphere and its economy is very 
weak.  Would my colleague care to comment on these two examples? 
Has Puerto Rico been a success?  Has Liberia been a success by 
extending the U.S. dollar?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, one just has look at what 
most economists are saying.  It is very clear that the argument 
against any sort of monetary union with the United States far 
outweighs any of the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two examples brought to my attention by the hon. member for 
Peterborough have to be looked at, but when we look at what 
Canada has done in the past and what Canada intends to do in the 
future, our economy is not completely and directly synchronized 
with the economy of the United States.  Canada needs to have the 
flexibility to respond to what goes on around the world.  Just 
extending the U.S. dollar does not in any way solve the 
challenges that any country faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two examples the hon. member has drawn upon speak for 
themselves.  The arguments are there.  The support of Canadians 
is in tact.  We will continue with our own monetary policy to 
ensure the domestic economy continues to prosper. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, this is 
one of those motions where one cannot help but think that those 
people to our left, the members of the Bloc who put forward a 
motion like this one, are playing a game of chess.  They are not 
thinking about the current move but about the next move or maybe 
the one after.  We ought to give them a reluctant commendation 
for at least thinking ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of our currency is a measure of our economic health. 
When we look at Canada's present economic health we get a 6.5 on 
a scale from 1 to 10.  Compared with the American dollar we have 
a 65-cent dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking us to strike a committee to debate the issue.  I 
am certainly in favour of debate.  I might even be persuaded to 
vote in favour of a motion to strike a committee because perhaps 
this ought to be dealt with in considerably greater depth than we 
can do here.  Perhaps we ought to listen to expert witnesses 
which a committee could do and which unfortunately we do not 
often get to do here because not many members are economic 
experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My initial reaction is that perhaps we ought to enter into the 
debate in such as way as to say yes, let us enlarge the debate. 
However, the underlying reason for this committee and for this 
study is intriguing.  It has to do with the use of currency and 
the proposal behind the one we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating a proposal to strike a parliamentary committee, 
but the idea behind it is to have a common pan-American currency 
so we will not have to do all the conversions and somehow, I 
suppose, hide the red faces of the Liberals for its economic 
policies which have brought us into such dire straits in this 
country.  Our dollar's value on the world scene and particularly 
as it is pegged against the American dollar is at an abysmal low 
rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An analogy might be appropriate.  I do not know if members have 
ever seen a house going down the road.  I have seen this in 
Saskatchewan and Alberta.  Quite frequently they move buildings 
down the road on many wheels.  It could be 20 wheels or 24 wheels 
set underneath the building.  It is intriguing.  For a number of 
years a friend of mine was in the business of doing this and 
among other things used to haul huge grain elevators that go 100 
feet into the sky. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The analogy I want to draw is how those wheels were constructed. 
If a large building is being moved along the road and goes into a 
hole, if there is not some sort of equalization between all the 
axles one axle stops carrying its load.  Two things can happen. 
Additional weight transferred to adjacent wheels can blow the 
tires on that wheel, causing instability and if an elevator is 
being hauled it could tip.  As a matter of fact my friend tipped 
one of his elevators because the technicians were not paying 
particular attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was intrigued when I looked at the mechanism.  Every one of 
the axles is tied together with hydraulic hoses and hydraulic 
rams so that when one wheel goes into a hole the pressure is 
immediately reduced, but as the other wheels pick up the load the 
pressure is transferred back to the wheel during the time it is 
in the hole.  It is never relieved of carrying its share of the 
load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, if one of the wheels were to go over a rock or a 
high spot on the road, again it could cause the structure to tip. 
It could result in the tires on that one axle exploding 
immediately because of the additional pressure from all the 
weight of the building being on one set of wheels when it is 
meant to be distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the pressure increased, the pressure on the rams was 
transmitted via the hoses to the other wheels supporting the 
structure.  Two things happened.  It prevented any one of the 
wheels from exploding because of increased pressure on it and it 
kept stability to the whole structure so it could go straight 
along.  There was an additional mechanism available to raise one 
side to keep it straight if the road was uneven, but that has 
nothing to do with what we are talking about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if we have a larger currency?  It has been 
suggested that we should protect the Canadian currency by tying 
it to the American currency.  A constituent in my riding, if he 
happens to be watching CPAC this morning, which I know he does 
from time to time because he is a retired person and has time for 
it, will be pleased to know I am now presenting his case.  He 
strongly said we should tie the Canadian currency to the American 
currency, just do it arbitrarily and say this is what it is.  My 
constituent suggested a time line.  Perhaps it could be one cent 
per month over 30 months which would bring our currency back up 
to par with that of the Americans so there would not be a sudden 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is merit in that suggestion.  When our economy has a 
fluctuation, when it goes down the tube, because we are in the 
larger package they pick up the slack for us and we do not feel 
an immediate hit in that situation.  Eventually we would anyway, 
I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general principle of broadening the currency is to give 
strength to all countries that participate based on the overall 
average instead of on the vagaries of an individual partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One needs to be very practical when one thinks about and does 
any reading at all on the European Union, the new Euro coin and 
the Euro currency that is under way.  As an aside, Westaim in my 
riding is a coin plating plant which, among other things, is 
providing blanks for the new Euro coin.  I thought I would throw 
in that free commercial.  That is proceeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not want to do this?  I think there are a couple of 
reasons.  I seriously question it. There are some countries in 
our hemisphere that are not carrying their load.  They are 
inefficient, perhaps worse than Canada.  They are very highly 
taxed as is every Canadian citizen. 
As a result, our overall economic efficiency is too low.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One really wants to ask the question:  Why does the separatist 
party from Quebec put forward this motion today?  I think 
perhaps, as I said in my introduction, it is thinking a move or 
two ahead in what it expects will happen, that Quebec will 
eventually separate.  I suppose what we are hearing today is a 
tacit admission that when that happens the currency and the 
economic well-being of that province will be seriously 
threatened.  I think that is a political reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Bloc are hedging against the future and hoping 
they can tie themselves to a larger currency so that the weight 
of that very uneconomic decision would be distributed over and 
carried by Canada, the United States and the other countries in 
the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in the move to do this the separatists better 
have a good share of realism.  There are a number of countries 
which are being denied entry to the European Union because their 
economy is not strong.  The European Union is working to make 
sure that its currency is strong, viable and very stable. The 
European Union literally is not permitting some countries to join 
because of their economic stability.  Economic stability 
correlates very closely to political stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would give advice to my separatist partners, whom I wish would 
simply stay in Canada.  Let us work together and let us motor on. 
If they are going to go down this route, they should recognize 
realistically that there is a possibility that they would not 
even be permitted in because they would not be meeting the 
criteria for membership.

explanation as physics professor of the mechanics of moving 
buildings and grain elevators across the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party boasts of being a party that encourages debate, 
is opposed to secretive meetings behind closed doors and is 
desirous of bringing all Canadians from across the country into 
the debate. 
In this vein, will it support the motion by the Bloc Quebecois, 
that is, open doors and windows and ask everyone to express 
their opinion—experts, lobby groups, unions, management and so 
on.  Let us have a debate in society rather than a closed debate 
as some, unfortunately, would like.

he claims to support? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, the answer is maybe, and that 
is final. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the hon. member a reason for this.  Over and over we 
see the Liberals on the other side not having debates.  In fact 
on Friday they used a short day to engage in a so-called debate 
on a bill on which they had imposed closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right.  I like debate.  We need to 
debate, not only in this place, but with Canadians across the 
country on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, I would support a wider debate and I would 
support this motion.  However, in the interest of that I intend 
to sit here all day today to listen to this debate.  I have to 
tell the member that at this stage I literally have not made up 
my mind whether I am going to support this motion or not.  I am 
going to decide that after listening to more debate and more 
thinking.  At the end of the day I am going to decide whether or 
not to support this motion.  My present inclination is about 52 
to 48 to vote for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about the economic health of the country 
of Canada.  I believe he ranked it at about 6.5 out of 10 in his 
opening remarks.  He made reference only to the exchange rate. 
What about inflation rates in Canada, the growth of the GDP and 
the unemployment rate declining? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about fixing the currency to the U.S. dollar.  He has a 
constituent who has put forward that proposal.  I ask the hon. 
member whether he thinks that the B.C. forest industry could 
survive a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar.  Does he have 
constituents in business who would feel when they are exporting 
that in fact taking away Canada's ability to buffer what goes on 
around the world with flexible exchange rates would not help 
companies to export?  By fixing it what we have is just one 
unitary exchange rate and our cycles are different than those of 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, the parliamentary secretary 
has gone on to stage two.  If we have this committee these are 
the things we are going to have to talk about.  I agree, there 
are many, many measures of economic health.  The value of one 
currency against the American currency is only one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the truth of the matter is that we export a great deal 
to the United States.  That means that every prairie farmer, 
every British Columbia lumberman, everybody who produces 
something and exports it to the United States now gets paid 65 
cents on the dollar because those things are measured in American 
dollars.  Whether we do that conversion using a calculator to 
multiply by .65 or whether we have a common currency, it means 
that every worker now, instead of getting $10 an hour, would get 
$6.50 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to be competitive at our present rate of inefficiency 
and with our high level of taxation, especially employer 
taxation, if we take all of those things into account, I think 
the bottom line is yes, the currency can act as a little bit of a 
buffer locally.  However, it in no way solves the final problem 
and that is that we have policies in this country that just do 
not permit us to be as efficient as we ought to be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I say first of all that I love debate 
and I like to talk about any topic, and will debate and discuss 
almost any topic at any time.  However, we only have a certain 
amount of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean brought forward the 
suggestion today that we strike a committee to look into the 
widening gap between haves and have nots and the growing gap 
between the rich and the poor in the country, in the world and in 
our communities.  That is a laudable suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the Bloc today has me puzzled.  I 
wonder why the Bloc Quebecois would put forward a motion to at 
least consider seriously a Pan-American currency.  Then I thought 
of one idea.  If I was a separatist in Quebec and I was 
successful in separating, and then I had to have the Canadian 
dollar as my currency and the Bank of Canada setting monetary 
policy for an independent Quebec, this would be somewhat 
embarrassing.  What else could be done?  If we had a North 
American currency we could avoid this little dilemma and we could 
avoid this discussion in the whole debate around separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now understand at least why we are having this discussion 
today.  It is part of getting the fundamentals in place for a 
move toward another vote on separation.  I will set that aside. 
That is the motivation.  I think it is a useful discussion for us 
to have in the House today because I hope we can set this thing 
aside once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that from time to time I feel a bit like a political 
eunuch.  We pass legislation in the House and then the United 
States says it does not like the legislation and we yank it off 
the table.  We saw that with the MMT legislation.  The House of 
Commons passed legislation to protect the health of Canadians and 
then an American company said “Hold it.  That is not right.  We 
do not like that legislation”, and the government bent over, 
said it was sorry and backed off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have Bill C-55, the split-run magazine legislation.  The 
Americans say they do not like it, so the government is saying it 
will see if it can come up with another deal.  It goes on and on. 
We are losing our sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen imposed on us a form of economic feudalism.  Our 
country was founded by people who fled feudalism.  They fled 
those regimes around the world where they had no say, their voice 
was unheard.  They had no power.  They were unable to have 
elected representation.  If we agree with the thrust of this 
motion, that is were we will move on monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, our economy with the United States is very much 
integrated.  Eighty per cent of our trade is with one trading 
partner.  There is not a single country in the world, other than 
a banana republic, that would even come close to that.  To 
suggest that we now use the Yankee dollar as our currency, so 
that when we go to buy CDs or to the movies we reach into our 
pocket and bring out Uncle Sam's currency, that is not the Canada 
that Canadians want for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members went out on the streets and asked Canadians “Do you 
really want to have American dollars as your currency?”, they 
would think we were nuts.  They would say “Of course not.  We 
are proud to be Canadians.  We are proud of our currency.  We are 
proud to have a separate currency from that of the United 
States”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am having trouble with this debate.  I am a bit critical about 
monetary policy.  I think we are too integrated with our monetary 
policy as it is.  It should be much more independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that our monetary policy and our central bank do 
a great job.  They do a good job, but they could be doing a much 
better job in terms of fighting issues like high levels of 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us acknowledge those who argue “Look what Europe has 
done”.  I listened to my friend and I respect him.  He said that 
we are seeing the French franc go out the door.  We are seeing 
the German mark go out the door.  It is quite a different 
situation in Europe where they have 11 economies which are 
relatively the same size.  There are certainly four economies 
that are almost identical in size, influence and power.  Here it 
is us against the U.S.A.  I never slept with a mad grizzly bear 
or an elephant, but I can imagine what it must be like.  I would 
not want to move.  I would sit there paralyzed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that for us to be up against the U.S.A. on an equal 
basis is, first, laughable.  I do not have to go any further than 
to look at today's <I>La Presse</I>.  In <I>La Presse</I> the 
American government is pointing out that in the discussion of a 
North American currency it should not be suggested for a moment 
that it is interested in modifying any of its policies to 
correspond with problems in Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Chile or 
wherever.  It is an independent country.  It has an independent 
monetary policy.  It is basically saying to hell with anybody 
else.  That is the American way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American government has made its views very clear about any 
form of Pan-America currency.  We are not talking about the North 
American loonie or the North American dollar; we are talking 
about the American dollar, the American currency.  In other 
words, everybody else in the Americas would join in on some 
aspect of the American currency.  That is not on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at an example of what is happening in Europe.  After 
the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 and the Treaty of Amsterdam in 
1997, the European Council of Prime Ministers was set up.  It has 
an incredible amount of power.  I know there is a European 
parliament and other assemblies, but the real thrust comes from 
the European commission.  It has the power.  It is fair to say 
that when it decides on a particular course of action other 
governments have to abide by that decision.  It can overrule 
legislation in other countries to fit in with the monetary union 
in Europe and so on.  What Europeans have done is to say that 
they are going to give up some of their sovereignty to be part of 
that great economic union.  That is what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends previously talked about the mobility of workers 
between countries and so on.  My friend in the Conservative Party 
reminded us that it took 40 years to develop a very integrated 
approach in Europe, and not simply on monetary policy.  Here we 
are talking about monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, in Europe when it comes to economic issues and 
currency issues, the decisions are not made by those who are 
elected and representing the people, they are made by 20,000 
faceless bureaucrats in secret.  That is the way that system is 
operated.  We have too much of that now.  We have decisions about 
the trade between our countries being made in secret.  We almost 
had the MAI imposed on us.  We found out about it at the last 
minute.  Again, negotiations were basically held in secret,

being heard.  They have a sinking feeling that they are alienated 
from the political process.  There is a good reason for that 
feeling, because they are. The voices of Canadians are not being 
listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that we will now integrate our currency with the 
United States is absolute folly.  I feel a little reluctant to 
say that we will vote against this motion because debate is often 
helpful and useful, but if we totally disagree with the premise 
of the reason for having the debate and completely disagree with 
the reason to proceed with even considering a North American 
currency, why would we? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my friends in the Bloc Quebecois are successful in proceeding 
with this, they are articulating a call to be a banana republic. 
They want Quebec to be a banana republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a banana republic?  A banana republic is a country that 
has no voice over its monetary policy, no voice over fiscal 
policy.  It just goes along with the dictating country, in this 
case the United States.  Some of the representatives from Quebec 
may want this as an option.  I do not think Canadians do 
generally and quite frankly I do not think Quebeckers do. The 
idea of turning Canada even more so into a banana republic, 
kowtowing to the United States, to adapt this version of economic 
feudalism is absolute folly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone has probably got the impression that we in the New 
Democratic Party are not that keen on the suggestion of currency 
integration. We have all kinds of other reasons to set out why 
this is not a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, who 
now is sort of king of the European Euro said the other day that 
unions no longer have a part to play in the new Euro Europe. I 
wonder if the people of Quebec know that this is what is being 
said about the Euro, and that the Quebec unions would have no 
role to play in a future Quebec based on a single currency for 
North America.  That is what the chairman of the European Central 
Bank is saying about the new Euro. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that when we revisit this issue in a few months or 
perhaps even in a few years, the reality of the Euro dollar will 
be in disrepair.  Countries in Europe will realize the folly of 
continuing with this and those countries that have not opted into 
this situation will be doing much better.

in 1988 that I voted for the first time in my life, and the main 
election issue was free trade.

take any speech the NDP made at the time and I would find the 
same arguments, the same facts, the same fears and the same 
anxieties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, my question is very simple.  My colleague, whose 
oratory skills I highly respect, said “Voices of Canadians are 
not listened to”.  That is what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us give Canadians the opportunity to express their point of 
view.  Let us vote in favour of the motion. 
Let us give unions, management groups, student groups, all 
Canadians throughout Canada and Quebeckers the opportunity to 
say what they think on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he really wants the voices of Canadians to be heard, let him 
give them the opportunity.  A vote against this motion is not 
the way to let Canadians say what they think.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, this hon. member does not 
think much of that suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind the initiative of a North American currency is corporate 
America.  The BCNI headed up by our friend Thomas D'Aquino said 
that the best thing for Canada to make us highly productive was 
to privatize, to adopt free trade, to deregulate, to balance the 
budget, to impose the GST, to cut social programs, which would 
make us more like the United States and that would boost our 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done all those things.  We as a country followed the 
advice of the BCNI.  We followed the agenda of the corporate 
voices of Canada, which are the voices behind the Euro and the 
voices behind this call now for a North American or Pan-American 
currency.

that productive.  Having taken all of these steps, Canada has not 
increased its productivity.  What is absent from this discussion 
is the high level of unemployment and underemployment and the 
relatively low wages people are being paid and therefore the 
relative lack of purchasing power.  Those are some of the reasons 
we have to discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than discuss a North American currency, I would go along 
with my friend's partner, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, and 
talk about the growing gap between the rich and the poor in 
Canada, the growing gap between the rich nations and poor 
nations.  That kind of discussion would have much more merit than 
talking about integrating Canada's currency with that of the 
United States of America.

have a question for the NDP finance critic. He is a man of 
considerable insight in a lot of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do I put this without insulting him after what I just said? 
Does he really understand what the measure of currency is versus 
the wealth of the country?  I can buy a piece of equipment and 
pay $1 Canadian for it or I can buy the same thing for 65 cents 
American.  It is the same item and has the same value, it is just 
in a different measure. We have different ways of measuring 
things.  We used to measure things in inches and now we measure 
in centimetres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To what degree is his understanding that all we are talking 
about here is the debate on which measure of our economic health 
we are going to use? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, as usual my hon. friend 
has a thoughtful question so I will respond in kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that the value of our currency is a reflection 
of what international financiers feel is the health of the 
Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend will be well aware that in terms of our commodity 
exports, the present value of our currency is certainly helpful 
during these difficult economic times.  We would agree that major 
changes are required to the economy of the country in order to 
make us more productive in a positive sense, meaning better, more 
secure and better paid jobs for men and women and higher 
productivity meaning a more appropriate knowledge based economy 
of the 21st century. We might have different views on how to get 
to that point, I would suspect, but nevertheless we might agree 
on the end run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the one sector of the economy that is experiencing 
incredibly hard times because of international markets, the 
commodity sector, it is being assisted by our relatively low 
currency vis-à-vis the United States dollar.  I would also agree 
that it is a reflection of what others feel is the health of our 
economy. They are not always accurate.  I think some of them are 
evaluating in old fashioned ways and are not appreciating some of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the Bloc Quebecois for bringing this 
important issue to the House of Commons for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that as members of parliament we take 
time to debate not only the important issues facing us today but 
the important issues that will face Canadians in the future. We 
in this place can play a significant role in preparing Canadians 
for the risks and opportunities of the future.  That is what this 
motion is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Bloc Quebecois spoke earlier today. I guess he 
previously had some ties to the Marxist-Leninist Party.  Perhaps 
he was so disappointed that Marx was proven wrong about communism 
that he was anxious for an opportunity to prove that maybe Marx 
was right about capitalism. I can say that I am not in favour of 
a common currency for the Americas certainly at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European comparison and the Euro comparisons that have been 
made are highly specious.  The European Union was a very 
intentional political union first which evolved over a 40 year 
period.  It was focused on defence related issues and ultimately 
evolved into an economic union, particularly in the post cold war 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1992 Maastricht Treaty was reached after a considerable 
amount of debate and discussion.  Ultimately a lot of sacrifice 
and work went into ensuring the countries that eventually signed 
on to the Euro complied with the Maastricht criteria.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very complicated issue.  I would hope that the Bloc 
Quebecois is not supporting some race to a common currency in the 
short term because clearly Canada is not ready for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to look at the weakness of the Canadian dollar and 
the secular decline in the Canadian dollar over the past 30 
years, our Canadian dollar would now be at record lows. It would 
be extremely inadvisable for Canada to entertain participating in 
a common currency now when we would not be negotiating from a 
position of strength.  To permanently entrench that position of 
weakness would be inadvisable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to try to strengthen our currency in the short term 
with interest rate policies, the Canadian economy simply could 
not stand the increase in interest rates necessary to strengthen 
the Canadian dollar to be in a strong negotiating position in a 
common currency for the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting last summer to see the Prime Minister's 
approach to the Canadian dollar.  At one point he even had the 
audacity or economic naiveté to say that the lower Canadian 
dollar was actually good for tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most members in this House would agree that a nation 
cannot devalue its way to prosperity.  In fact, the logical 
corollary of the Prime Minister's arguments last summer would be 
that if we reduced our dollar to zero and gave away all our 
merchandise, we would be the greatest trading nation in the 
world. The fact is that we would not be getting any money for 
those goods.  A country cannot devalue its way to prosperity and 
it is naive to assume that a country can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A secular decline in the Canadian dollar has occurred, a 
significant amount of which has been due to the secular decline 
in Canada's productivity.  Productivity in Canada needs to be 
addressed with taxation issues, the differences in the Canadian 
tax system, our levels of taxation and the structure of our tax 
code relative to our trading partners.  Those issues need to be 
addressed. Interprovincial trade barriers, our regulatory burden, 
all these issues need to be addressed.  It is going to take a 
long time to strengthen our Canadian currency through that type 
of systemic, holistic approach to very complicated issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some proponents of a common currency say the positive of a 
common currency would be that it would take the power away from 
the government to make bad economic decisions. I have more faith 
in parliamentarians, in this House, in the ability for a 
sovereign country to make the right types of decisions for the 
future than those who would advance that type of argument. That 
is a very perverse argument to make, that to make the types of 
decisions necessary for Canadians in the future, we somehow have 
to rip more power away from this sovereign parliament and away 
from our sovereign Canadian institutions in terms of the Bank of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the exchange rate mechanism which currently compensates 
for the disparity between our productivity and that of the U.S. 
for instance, our unemployment rates would become the operative 
mechanism. The leader of the Bloc Quebecois concurred with me 
this morning that in fact in the short term this would be a major 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that Canadians want to see as part of any step 
toward a common currency an increase in unemployment rates. I do 
not believe Canadians can afford an increase in our unemployment 
rates, particularly in the riding I represent in Atlantic Canada 
which has seen insufferably high unemployment rates. In the 
process of embracing this common currency or further 
globalization and emasculation of our national institutions, a 
higher unemployment rate as a cost or a casualty of that is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term, many of us will recognize trends toward global 
integration, in some cases political and in some cases economic. 
As the party that introduced and supported free trade, we 
recognize and continue to believe that free trade and the free 
trade agreements have led to increased opportunities for 
Canadians. We believe there are opportunities in globalization. 
We also believe that Canadians have to be prepared to embark on 
that journey. That takes certain types of economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the replacement of the manufacturers sales tax 
with the GST was one of the domestic changes necessary to embrace 
freer trade.  It ensured Canadians had an opportunity to 
participate in freer trade and had an opportunity to prosper as a 
result of freer trade and Canadians have. 
We believe all Canadians need to be positioned to prosper in a 
more global environment.

North American currency, without dealing head on with the issues 
that have consistently hurt our Canadian dollar, productivity 
issues such as taxation, interprovincial trade barriers and the 
regulatory burden in Canada, would be naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois.  I am sure they would understand my position as a 
Canadian and my value of Canadian sovereignty.  They would 
understand the importance of our defending the sovereignty of our 
nation and preparing Canadians to participate in any global 
opportunity and challenge in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope this is not an issue being advanced by the Bloc 
Quebecois in some way to further reduce Canadian sovereignty with 
the hope somehow that it would increase Quebec's sovereignty.  As 
a Canadian I believe that the recognition of Quebec as an 
inextricable part of Canada is fundamental.  I believe very 
strongly that the distinctiveness of Quebec is extremely 
important and I defend that, as does my party as a national party 
in the House of Commons.  I would certainly hope that 
reciprocally members of the Bloc Quebecois would not be advancing 
this argument to somehow reduce the sovereignty of our country. I 
would not be so cynical as to assume they would be advancing this 
as a uni-dimensional attack on Canadian sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sovereignty is a very important issue.  While the U.K. has for a 
significant time, since Mrs. Thatcher, implemented types of 
changes necessary in the U.K. to prepare the British for the 
opportunities of the future and to undo a lot of the damages the 
Labour Party had inflicted on the English prior to her election, 
U.K. arguments against the common currency in Europe have not 
been economic arguments solely. They have been arguments on the 
sovereign right of a nation to determine its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe parliament and Canadian institutions have the 
authority and can make the right decisions. I do not believe we 
need to remove power from Canadian institutions to somehow ensure 
Canadians become competitive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I find 
it rather intimidating to rise after such an eloquent speech by 
my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first comment will deal with the notion of loss of 
sovereignty which underlies the whole of his argument. There is 
no perfect example, but a moment ago I gave the example of 
France which, before the Euro was introduced, had no say over 
its monetary policy because the French central bank was linked 
to or influenced by the Deutschmark. The bank had no say over 
the European monetary policy, which was, for all intent and 
purposes, the German monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the introduction of the Euro, France now has its say. For 
countries like France and other European nations it does not 
mean a loss of sovereignty, but an increase in sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple. I heard all the arguments, and some 
deserve more in depth consideration. Will the Progressive 
Conservative Party support this motion which is aimed at 
exploring further all the issues raised by my colleague? These 
important issues transcend party lines.

discuss and explore these types of alternatives with debate that 
is respectful of the issues and respectful of other members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I continue to have significant concerns about a common 
currency. 
It will be up to those proponents to debate their side of the 
argument and up to people like me to offer our views on the 
common currency. Where there is significant common ground on this 
issue is the recognition of some of the structural issues that 
need to be addressed in the Canadian economy either way.

should be letting the Liberals off to basically provide them such 
a cushion to defend their totally inadequate policies which have 
brought us the 65 cent dollar.  It is simply true that if there 
is a unified currency all the countries act as a shock absorber 
for the other mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I do not see supporting this motion and 
supporting the notion of further debate on a very important issue 
as in any way letting the Liberals off the hook.  I have heard 
arguments that common currencies take away the sovereign ability 
for governments to implement bad economic policy.  I would argue 
that if the Liberals listened to and perhaps took more 
Progressive Conservative policies, even they would have the 
capacity to implement some good economic policies.  I commend the 
Liberals for having kept free trade and the GST and for 
maintaining the deregulated transportation, energy and financial 
services.  Those were the policies of the Conservatives.

pleased to take part in this opposition day debate on the motion 
introduced by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and by the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg. I thank them for their initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a Special Committee of the 
House of Commons should be struck in order to consider the 
possibility of Canada's participation in the creation of a 
pan-American monetary union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 1, a new currency came to existence: the Eurodollar. 
Over the next three years, national currencies, some of which 
have been in existence for several centuries, will be relegated 
to museums and private collections. The decision to have a new 
reserve currency, in addition to the U.S. dollar and the 
Japanese yen, is an important event in the economic history of 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signing of the Maastricht treaty allowed European Union 
members to enjoy the free movement of people, goods, services 
and money on their whole territory. A monetary component has now 
been added to that economic alliance, with the result that, in 
the future, there will be only one currency and one key interest 
rate in effect in 11 countries of Europe. One cannot witness 
these changes without wondering what is going on in America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lesson to be learned from the adoption of the Eurodollar is 
that, sooner of later, economic integration raises the issue of 
monetary integration. Within about 50 years, Europe has gone 
from experiencing one of history's most bloody wars to creating 
a common market, which was restricted at first but later 
expanded through the Treaty of Rome, and finally establishing a 
true monetary union.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because there are many benefits associated with using a 
common currency when there is a high volume of trade between 
countries:  it reduces uncertainty and the costs of currency 
transactions, there is increased pricing transparency, resources 
are better allocated, and there are many other pluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, there is a downside to abandoning national 
currencies.  A currency is first and foremost a trade tool and a 
store of value, but it can serve as a buffer when our economy is 
undergoing stresses different from those of neighbouring 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new currency must also be given time to settle in. 
Some people are still worried about the initial performance of 
the Euro in the markets and will wait until it is well 
established before they are prepared to trust it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the decision to convert to the Euro means that the 11 
nations that did so felt that these disadvantages were offset by 
the benefits associated with the new currency.  Otherwise, the 
Euro would never have seen the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immediate result of the arrival of the Euro on money markets 
is the drop in the number of so-called intermediate currencies. 
The Euro replaces the French, Belgian and Luxembourg franc, the 
German mark, the Finnish markka, the Italian lira, the Austrian 
schilling, the Irish pound, the Dutch florin, the Spanish peseta 
and the Portuguese escudo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the medium term, the Euro will very likely also replace 
the English pound, the Greek drachma, the Swedish krona and the 
Danish krone. 
This is of direct concern to us; with so many currencies 
disappearing, what currency will international speculators 
settle on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have only to remember the ravages of the Asian financial 
crisis, when everyone rushed to the safety of the American 
dollar, to understand the concrete impact of the Euro.  If the 
Canadian loonie had a rough ride in 1998, so did most European 
currencies to some degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it seems clear that, with the Euro on the scene, a new 
international financial crisis would not have the same 
repercussions in Europe.  Unfortunately, such a crisis would 
still hit Canada just as hard, perhaps even worse, because those 
speculating on the rise and fall of currencies during a 
financial storm have now lost 11 of the horses they can bet on, 
thus increasing our chances of attracting their interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 15 or 20 years from now, what major currencies will there be 
left, apart from the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Japanese yen and 
maybe the Chinese yuan? In that context, in order to protect 
ourselves from the harmful effects of the growing speculation on 
currencies, some have proposed a tax on financial transactions, 
like the so-called Tobin tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we cannot avoid analysing seriously the alternatives offered 
to us if we do not want to become one of the main targets of 
international speculators. For example, we could abandon our 
marginalized national currency and replace it by a strong 
currency. But still, which one should we choose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Americas may be destined to have a common currency, from 
the north pole to the south pole, under an extended free trade 
agreement. But before we consider creating an all new currency, 
we should remember that there already exists a very strong 
currency very close to us, a currency which is used as a refuge 
when the global economy crumbles, that is the American dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian money supply totals approximately $600 billion 
Canadian, or almost $400 billion U.S. In comparison, the 
American money supply is close to $6,000 billion U.S. and 
increased by approximately 10% in 1998 over 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that the Canadian money supply in American dollars 
represents only 6 or 7% to the American money supply, the 
“dollarization” of Canada, that is the conversion of our economy 
to the U.S. dollar represents, from the American point of view, 
barely several months of growth for the American money supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note that in some regards, the new 
European central bank operates like the U.S. federal reserve. In 
both cases, the central bank establishes the common monetary 
policy in consultation with a number of regional bank 
representatives. Therefore, a system where the Bank of Canada 
would be the thirteenth regional bank of an American network is 
quite conceivable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is hypothetical, at least for now. But this issue is 
already raising hackles, particularly in Canada. The main 
argument is that by giving up its currency, either through 
freezing the exchange rate relative to another currency or 
adopting the U.S. dollar, Canada will lose all flexibility with 
regard to its economic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, looking at the evolution of the Canadian and American 
bank rates over the last 50 years, one is forced to recognize 
that the independence of Canada's monetary policy exists only in 
some people's mind. In fact, the best way to determine the bank 
rate in Canada from 1950 to 1986 is to take the bank rate they 
had in the United States at a particular point during that 
period and increase it by 1.1 percentage point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, some may point out that in 1996 and 1997, the 
Canadian bank rate was lower than the American bank rate for the 
first time in 50 years. However, we became very aware of the 
limits of this so-called monetary autonomy on August 27 of last 
year, when the loonie plunged to record lows and the Bank of 
Canada had to intervene by raising the bank rate to support the 
Canadian dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By rejecting this motion as if they were holders of the absolute 
truth, the Liberals are burying their heads in the sand, as if 
what goes on elsewhere will never affect us. This refusal to 
accept change reminds us of their historical position against 
the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent developments in Europe, including the introduction of the 
Eurocoin, raise new issues. From whichever point of view, 
Quebec's or Canada's, federalist or sovereignist, one cannot 
escape the issues related to economic globalization. 
These issues are being raised today, and by addressing them in a 
timely fashion, we increase our chances of taking in stride this 
inevitable and already noticeable turn towards a new economy. 
This requires a great deal of thought. That is why the Bloc 
Quebecois is inviting all members of this House to think about 
this issue, to take part in this debate and to vote in favour of 
this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would have thought, with a debate as important as this one on 
the future of the Canadian currency and the use of a 
North-American currency, or perhaps a pan-American one, there 
would have been more interest forthcoming from the government 
side.  They have had virtually nothing to say right from the 
start, with the exception of using their speaking time for a 
ten-minute speech of highly dubious nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague from 
Charlesbourg, the man behind this most important debate.  The 
question, as set out in the motion, is not whether we must 
change to some other currency starting tomorrow morning. 
The question is this: are we going to put on blinkers in the 
next few weeks, months or years, when debates arise concerning 
economic interdependence and the future of macroeconomic tools 
such as monetary policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is this: are we going to isolate ourselves from 
major world trends, or are we going to start right now looking 
at the pros and cons of changing the way we do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have heard so far has been pretty esoteric.  I did not 
believe we had reached the stage here in parliament of being so 
blinded by narrow Canadian nationalism as to declare ourselves 
“staunch defenders of our independence”. 
Prepared to fight to the death to maintain the Canadian dollar. 
Ready to fight to the death to prevent Canada from becoming a 
banana republic”.  I will come back to the remarks by the member 
for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, which were totally 
out of the current debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider some of the arguments we heard from the other 
side of the House.  We heard the Secretary of State for 
Financial Institutions, not just anyone, but someone who is 
supposed to be somewhat more open to changes in economic 
development and in international world trade.  He said “Canadian 
sovereignty is vital.  We will not hand Canadian sovereignty 
over to the Americans”.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize the fact that the economic interdependence 
that was built over the past 50 years, in fact since the start 
of the first GATT agreement in 1947, is practically complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 134 countries who are signatories to the WTO 
agreements.  Almost all trade is governed at the moment by rules 
that are liberalizing it, rules that became rules of law with 
the creation of the WTO and the establishment of the Marrakesh 
agreement of 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is so far behind that it is now avoiding any 
debate on the use of a North American currency or one for the 
three Americas. However, the World Trade Organization, in which 
Canada is represented, is entertaining the idea that, some day, 
we might have a world currency. Members can imagine how far 
behind we are right now. And the one who brought up the ides of 
a world currency is not just anybody, but the WTO's current 
director general, Mr. Ruggiero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are so far behind here that we forget that, while goods and 
services have been moving freely under the GATT, and now the WTO 
rules, capital is not subject to such strict rules that would 
provide similar protection. As we saw with the Asian crisis, the 
financial sector is not subject to strict enough rules. The 
result is that secondary currencies such as the Canadian dollar 
are subjected to devastating speculation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be pointed out that daily capital movement is currently 
30 to 40 times greater than the movement of goods and services 
throughout the world. If we want some form of protection, we 
should wonder about the recent Asian crisis, which may not be 
the last financial crisis to occur in the world. We must ask 
ourselves questions about the forms of protection that we can 
create. And one of them is to consistently reduce the number of 
secondary currencies in the world. Eleven of them have already 
been merged into a single currency, thus eliminating 11 
possibilities for unscrupulous speculators, who destroy national 
currencies, thus threatening the countries' economic future and 
job creation efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are not interested in talking about this. They 
would rather talk about Canada's independence. I have never 
heard so much talk about economic sovereignty in parliament as I 
have this morning. 
Independence, as they are using the term however, misses the 
whole point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions and the Minister of Finance think it is more 
important to have symbolic, artificial independence, or real 
powers within a North American organization of the three 
Americas or an international organization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Charlesbourg, earlier told us how 
European monetary policy worked, explaining that France had only 
just recently acquired a say in the future of the French franc, 
because the future of currencies in Europe was determined by the 
Bundesbank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the creation of the Euro, France will have a say in German 
policy.  That is real power, real sovereignty. 
France has exchanged an ultimately artificial—because it no 
longer had any power at all—independence with respect to monetary 
policy for real power. It did so by banding together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true for international economic integration, 
economic interdependence.  All members of the House should know 
this, but they are obtuse.  There was the case in 1997 of Costa 
Rica, a small country of 2.5 million inhabitants, winning an 
international case against the claims of the American 
government.  Imagine that. Costa Rica never would have thought 
itself capable of swaying decisions of the United States, the 
strongest power in the world. Because of economic 
interdependence and common rules, these small countries have 
gained extraordinary powers.  That is real independence, true 
national sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the speech of the member for Kamloops, Thompson 
and Highland Valleys. It was a despicable speech. We are 
fortunate that the NDP will never have a chance to be the 
government because if there is a party that would establish a 
banana republic, it is that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was so preposterous of the member for Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys to ask “Do we want to avoid, after 
the separation of Quebec, a debate on the use of the currency 
and a situation where a sovereign Quebec would have no right to 
use the Canadian dollar?” I am sorry, but the member is really 
out of touch with reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We hold 25 per cent of the money supply. Twenty-five per cent of 
the money circulating in Canada belongs to Quebec. Whether there 
is sovereignty or not, this money will always belong to 
Quebeckers. That is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we have a North American currency or not, they will have 
one heck of problem when this happens and it is decided that we 
will be using the Canadian dollar whether they like it or not. 
They do not want to hear about it. I can understand that. It 
would bother me too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys quoted 
the governor of the new European Central Bank, who said 
something along these lines “Countries of the European Union 
will not have any say in the monetary policy of the new bank”. 
This goes without saying, since in every industrialized country 
the monetary policy is essentially independent from political 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even under the Bank of Canada Act, the powerful Bank of Canada, 
which he reveres and which does not have any power left 
according to us, is said to be independent from the political 
powers in Ottawa. The member told us, quoting the governor of 
the new European bank, that the use of a common currency 
generates a loss of sovereignty. Obviously, the hon. member does 
not know how monetary policies work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance said “We 
cannot have a monetary integration of the three Americas. 
We have different economic realities, different inflation rates, 
different unemployment rates”. So what? Do the 11 European 
countries that adopted the Eurocoin as their common currency 
have similar inflation rates? Do they have similar unemployment 
rates? Do they have similar domestic policies? Come on. What we 
heard here makes no sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to have a real debate on this issue, the kind 
of debate this motion brought forward by my leader and by the 
member for Charlesbourg deserves. Instead of that, what we have 
heard so far today is just political bragging about Canada's 
sovereignty, about the need to defend that sovereignty at all 
costs. But Canada is losing this debate and it will cost us 
dearly in terms of our sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may have an identity problem, but Quebeckers do not. 
We are able to have a debate on economic, monetary and global 
integration without fear of losing our identity. Quebeckers are 
sure about their identity. Canadians are not.

choice is the way you manage it down to 78 cents.  Michael 
Wilson's way, it drops down to 70, it collapses. The Canadian 
dollar should be 78 cents”.

Edmonton was a good city for doing business.  The Lethbridge

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
reason it is so good to do business in Alberta is that we have 
very low taxes.  Unfortunately the minister did not borrow a page 
from Stockwell Day's book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the minister's record, the weakest currency in Canadian 
history despite what he said when he was running a few years ago, 
falling wages, falling productivity and falling personnel 
savings.  He does not have Mike Wilson to blame anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the minister not admit that the reason our productivity

policy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for

not agree with the premise of the hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is communities across this country are supporting 
studies like this to show how well Canada is doing around the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that we are more productive because it 
has slashed the value of the Canadian dollar and because it is 
now cheaper to buy goods from our overregulated, overtaxed 
economy.  Devaluing our currency means foreign countries will 
take more goods off our hands. I am sure if the dollar were 50 
cents or 10 cents we would do even better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the finance minister not realize that selling our products

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

that says Canadian productivity has been falling.  He will not be 
able to find one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in the KPMG study released a few days ago we see a 
series of criteria, including all kinds of costs, construction 
costs, municipal tax costs, income tax costs at the corporate 
level and on it goes, that shows Canada as the low cost provider 
of services.  Instead of helping us to sell Canada as an 
investment destination, why does the Reform Party prefer to stand 
up and put its own country down? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what we are putting down is a government that has given us a 65 
cent dollar and the highest income tax burden in the OECD, a 
country whose per capita GDP is falling through the floor in the 
OECD and among other industrialized countries.  Does the finance 
minister not understand that just as with a company, foreign 
investors look at the state of a country's debt and the value of 
its currency?  They see a country with a 65 cent dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the finance minister not recognize the 65 cent dollar he 
has given Canada is a sign that we are less competitive and have 
a diminishing standard of living in the world? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party seems to have some difficulty finding 
good things to say about its country.  We have the third lowest 
corporate income tax rate for manufacturing in the G-7.  It is 
lower than in the United States.  We have the lowest cost for 
transportation and electricity in the G-7.  We have the lowest 
initial investment cost for setting up a new facility. If the 
Reform Party were not so bound and determined to knock its 
country, it would start looking at the real facts of the matter.

65 cents or 66 cents.  In other words, sell Canada at bargain 
basement prices.

did his leader—not in the House, not anywhere in Canada, but

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley,

their products and services are not worth 100 cents on the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our high taxes and costly overregulation are keeping us

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question concerns the publication of names within the proposed

</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed act provides judges with the discretion to issue a 
ban on publication for even those who commit murder and sexual 
assault.  We are not talking about protecting the identities of

keeping the name of a sex offender from the community? 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

aware, when one deals with the publication of names and young 
offenders one is dealing with two important and competing values 
in society.  One is obviously the public's right to know and the 
value that we place on open courts in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the other value, and I know the hon. member is well 
aware of this, is the fact that we believe young people are 
capable of rehabilitation and that young people are different and 
at a different stage of maturity and development than adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is for us a case of balancing those competing 
values.  We believe that in our new youth criminal justice 
legislation we have balanced effectively those competing values.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member is probably aware, in relation to some of the

of legislation.  I will say that in the course of the discussions 
around other possibilities, we have made it very clear to the 
Americans that Bill C-55 will proceed.  We have no intention of 
abolishing Bill C-55.  We have made it very clear also that any 
future discussions must hinge on the concept of majority Canadian 
content.  We believe that reflects not only the letter but also 
the spirit of the legislation.

smacks of double talk.

the way the health protection branch does its job, reaching out

Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 20, 1994 and on November 7, 1996 the Speaker made the 
following ruling: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—while it is a tradition of this House that committees are 
masters of their own proceedings, they cannot establish 
procedures which go beyond the powers conferred upon them by the 
House. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both these cases the committees in question were in breach of 
the provisions of Standing Order 114. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the chairman of the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage is in breach of Standing Order 106(3) which directs the 
committee as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within ten sitting days of the receipt, by the clerk of a

the said committee, the Chairman of the said committee shall 
convene such a meeting provided that forty-eight hours notice is

reasons for convening such a meeting shall be stated in the 
request. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submitted a letter pursuant to Standing Order 106(3) to the 
clerk of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage on February 
18, 1999.  The contents of the letter are as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are writing pursuant to Standing Order 106(3) to convene a 
meeting of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage for the 
purpose of hearing testimony from former National Arts Centre

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is the 12th sitting day and the standing committee has yet 
to convene such a meeting.  What the committee did was deal with 
the issue in a routine steering committee meeting instead of 
convening a specific meeting to consider the request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you check, Mr. Speaker, every request under Standing Order 
106(3), you will note that in every case the chairman convened a 
specific meeting to deal with the request.  It is no coincidence 
that every committee does this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we allow committees to deal with requests under Standing 
Order 106(3) at a routine steering committee then Standing Order 
106(3) becomes redundant.  We do not need Standing Order 106(3) 
to propose a motion at a routine steering committee.  The 
intention of Standing Order 106(3) is to allow the minority on a 
committee to have a specific meeting convened to consider its 
request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A routine steering committee is often in camera and crowded with 
other items.  The actions of the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage rendered Standing Order 106(3) redundant.  We cannot 
allow a committee to enjoy that kind of independence from the 
House.  Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 760(2), states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees receive their authority from the House itself and the 
authority of the House overrides that of any committee. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you rule on this matter.  I would 
ask that you consider if the chairman of the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage is in breach of an order of the House and 
guilty of a grave contempt. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest 
to the request of the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the beginning I think most of us felt that no meeting had 
been held.  Initially I would have been prepared to say that it 
would have been inappropriate if no meeting at all been held. 
What the hon. member is telling us is not that.  It is that a 
meeting was held but because other items were on the agenda he 
does not consider that a separate meeting was held for the 
purpose of Standing Order 106(3). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair might, I submit, have to rule as to whether or not a 
meeting for the purpose of Standing Order 106(3) has to be a 
separate meeting where no other items are dealt with, or whether 
it is appropriate to deal with items under Standing Order 106(3) 
while other items are on the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite also said that if the interpretation 
was that other items could be discussed at the same time as an 
item under Standing Order 106(3), it would render Standing Order 
106(3) redundant.  Those were his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would challenge that and say I do not believe that such is the 
case.  This offers a protection for members in the event that a 
committee is not scheduled to sit for a long period of time. This 
would actually cause a meeting within 48 hours.  I would suggest 
that this is not meant to replace the regular rule that exists 
whereby an item can be discussed if the committee is meeting 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not make the rule redundant.  Standing Order 106(3) 
offers a measure for the protection of members in the event that 
a committee is not scheduled to sit.  It offers them a quick step 
on having the committee meet to discuss the item in question. 
That is the appropriate interpretation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for listening to this point of order which I think is a 
serious one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, Mr. Speaker, as you consider the problem which has 
been raised by the member from Dauphin, that you also consider 
the other thing happening with Standing Order 106(3).  Routinely 
the chair of the committee or the committee itself moves in 
camera upon receipt of one of these letters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This format allows not just one party but at least two of the 
opposition parties to find an issue or agree to an issue that 
should go to a committee and should have a meeting to deal with 
the specific subject matter. 
As the standing order states, it has to describe in detail what 
the matter is and how it should be dealt with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of giving the opposition parties a chance to publicize 
what they might consider a very serious issue, the committees 
move in camera and then dispose of the matter by saying that they 
will not deal with it further.  In other words, the intent of 
Standing Order 106(3), which is to allow opposition parties on 
occasion to raise the profile of an issue, is being thwarted by a 
routine in camera meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is describing a kind of two pronged problem for an 
opposition party.  Standing Order 106(3), which is one of the few 
tools left to us in committee, is being thwarted on two counts. 
Not only is it wrapped up in other business but it also routinely 
goes in camera, is disposed of, and no one sees it.  That means 
this standing order is of little use to members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The points that are being raised cause a bit 
of concern to the Chair.  I would address myself to the member 
for Dauphin—Swan River.  I think he mentioned that this matter 
was discussed in a steering committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it a steering committee or was it the standing committee 
which met in camera?  Could he please clarify his statement for 
me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the item was discussed in a 
business agenda meeting, just a general meeting which, as my 
colleague indicated, was held in camera.  The order was very 
specific in terms of what the request was to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Was it a steering committee or was it the 
standing committee which met in camera?  Could he please clarify 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was the standing committee 
meeting in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Therefore the question that I have to decide 
is whether the mandate given to the committee was carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were four members, as I understand it, who signed a 
request that a meeting be held in a certain period of time. I 
believe you said 10 sitting days.  Was the meeting held? 
According to the hon. member the meeting was held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it held in public or was it held in camera?  I do not know 
if there is a difference.  I would say there is not, providing it 
was the standing committee which was sitting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of any other information and judging from what 
the hon. member said, this was not a steering committee.  This 
was the standing committee and it met in camera, which is its 
right.  Is what I am saying so far correct?  I just need a yes or 
a no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, it did, but the problem 
was the standing committee did not deal with the directive under 
Standing Order 106(3) which was to have a meeting with Mr. 
Cripton. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will deal with that now.  The 
committee met—this is my word—legitimately as it was supposed 
to meet.  The hon. member is saying that because other issues 
were dealt with at that time it was not only for that specific 
case.

<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on two points of order.  The first point is that 
on November 23, 1998, I placed Question No. 169 on the order 
paper asking how many gun smugglers and illegal gun traffickers 
have been identified, prosecuted and convicted in Canada using 
the gun registration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In accordance with Standing Order 39, I asked for a written 
answer within 45 days.  My constituents have been waiting 112 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disconcerting fact here is that this happens every time I 
ask a question. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I put a question on the order paper I have to wait 
beyond the 45 days.  Why can the government not answer our 
questions in 45 days as promised?  When can my constituents 
expect an answer to Question No. 169? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member is 
concerned about this question.  As members are aware, sometimes 
when these questions are submitted they go to one department and 
we get a response.  In other cases they may be required to go to 
every department and in some cases they will go to one 
department, get part of an answer and then go to another. Then 
and only then can they go back to the first department to get the 
rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member that I will look very seriously at the 
whereabouts of the response to Question No. 169. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my second point is 
that on December 9, 1998, I placed Question No. 185 on the order 
paper asking for a list of contracts between the government and 
the consulting firm KPMG Peat Marwick Thorne.  In accordance with 
Standing Order 39, I asked for a written answer within 45 days 
and my constituents have now been waiting 99 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been waiting twice as long as the standing orders 
require. Why do I have to raise multiple points of order to get 
answers to my questions?  The government is interfering with my 
ability to do my job.  If the government answered one question 
every 45 days, I would get eight answers in a year.  If I used 
all four of the order paper questions to full advantage, I would 
get 32 questions answered a year.  As it is, I am getting fewer 
than two answers per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At what point does this become a question of privilege?  When 
can my constituents expect an answer to Question No. 185? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I explained to the 
previous question, sometimes the responses are more complicated 
than in other cases.  For example, in tabling responses to 
petitions, we have well over 2,000 petitions and we are running 
at well over a 90% response rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member that in this case I will look into the 
whereabouts of Question No. 185. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am reluctant to get into any 
discussions with the hon. member about when his privileges have 
been interfered with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary is aware that at one time I 
was chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.  That committee deals with, among other things, changes 
to the rules of the House.  If the hon. member feels he has a 
grievance in respect of the answers he is not getting to his 
questions, I suggest he raise the matter with that committee 
which has the power to change the rules and allow him to put more 
questions on the order paper.  At least he could get his 
questions asked even if he did not get answers.  He would not 
have his four places tied up in the way he is complaining about 
today.  That is something the committee could consider and report 
to the House on.  I know the hon. member might want to be 
vigorous in his pursuit of such an aim with the committee. I know 
he would find a very receptive ear in that of the parliamentary 
secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest we leave the matter there.  The parliamentary 
secretary is the chair of the committee and so in appealing to 
him, the member would be appealing to two people at once. That is 
always a helpful thing and will save time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shall the remaining questions stand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before Oral 
Question Period, I carefully listened to the debate on our 
motion and the speech by the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. He 
carefully explained why a special committee should be struck to 
consider the creation of a pan-American monetary union. 
There is a possibility we might participate in the creation of a 
pan-American monetary union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, my colleague argued the response of members on 
the government side was quite weak. Their arguments are half 
baked. They are putting them forward saying “No, we do not want 
such a committee, we do not want to debate the possible creation 
of a pan-American monetary union”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover my colleague for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot reported the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions had 
argued that Canada's monetary policy was very important for 
Canada's sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this: could my colleague tell me how independent 
Canada's monetary policy is from the United States? Is this not 
merely an illusion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Drummond 
for her excellent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when we look at the evolution of monetary policy since 
1950, the independence of the Bank of Canada's policy is highly 
suspect.  Since 1950, almost 100 basis points, or 1% in terms of 
Canadian interest rates, have been added to American interest 
rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, each time the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank makes 
interest rate decisions, the Bank of Canada follows suit. That 
is entirely natural because we are in lockstep with the American 
economy.  There is capital circulating at the speed of 
lightning, and increasingly freely.  Given Canada's weaker 
performance compared to the United States, more money may leave 
the country if there is a difference between Canadian and 
American interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was 1996-97, when the Bank of Canada boasted that it 
operated independently from American monetary policy, when 
Canadian interest rates were over 1% lower than American rates. 
What was the result?  The Canadian dollar took a nosedive, made 
even worse by the Asian crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from 1973, when the Bank of Canada made a decision 
completely unconnected with the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, this 
was the only such occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the circumstances, therefore, any talk about the independence 
of the Bank of Canada is complete nonsense.  The Bank of Canada 
is not independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had another example of this as recently as August and 
September.  The president of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank 
lowered American interest rates by 100 basis points. 
Fifteen minutes later—not one or two days, not one week, but 15 
minutes later—Mr. Thiessen, the governor of the Bank of Canada, 
lowered Canadian rates by exactly the same amount.  We are 
continually following the evolution of American monetary policy. 
A common currency for the three Americas, or even an 
international currency, would not be such a great loss of 
autonomy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member across the way knows that the United States is one of the 
most powerful countries in the world. Is it true that the only 
currency the Americans would accept would be their own currency, 
the American dollar? Is that true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is not the point. The members 
opposite should try to show a glimmer of intelligence for once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is whether we are going to take a back seat to global 
progress.  Will Liberals refuse to have a real debate, as they 
are asked, and in particular to hold a forum at the finance 
committee?  I have asked for a two to three-day forum bringing 
together experts from Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could examine the pros and cons of a monetary union, see what 
the conclusions could be drawn and prepare members of parliament 
to hold debates which would be more enlightened than those we 
have heard today from the Liberals and the New Democrats in 
particular. That is what we are asking for.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion introduced by the Bloc Quebecois proposes a monetary 
union between Canada and United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That is not it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B> Excuse me. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example which members give us is that of the European Union. 
The European Union is very different from the United States and 
Canada.  There were 11 countries all trading with one another in 
11 different currencies.  Together they are roughly the same size 
economically as Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine the complexity of doing business in a market 
where there are 11 currencies and 11 different borders to cross 
in order to have the same economies of scale?  A monetary union 
had transactional cost savings inherent in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another advantage, and we have to look at it, is that with a 
single currency there is no possibility of the currency either 
going up or down against a foreign currency.  Perhaps this causes 
difficulties when doing business over a long period of time.  The 
costs from a supplier cannot be guaranteed for six months because 
the exchange rate may differ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could find ourselves producing goods or services in Canada 
which are not competitive.  However there is a way around that. 
All businesses involved in international trade which need to deal 
with international currencies do what they call hedging.  They 
buy a currency six months ahead if that is when they will need 
it.  Or, they sell a currency six months or a year ahead, if that 
is when they will be selling their products, in order to ensure 
that their costs are ascertainable and fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we in Canada do with the United States.  We do not 
have the huge problem of 11 different currencies; we have just 
two.  If we were to go into a monetary union it would be very 
unlike the European Union which involves many countries.  However 
there is a certain homogeny, a certain sameness about the 
countries.  The United States vis-à-vis Canada is about 11 times 
as big economically.  The inevitable result would be that we 
would lose our monetary policy independence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of the Bloc Quebecois who just spoke said that Canada 
never had an independent monetary policy. This is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Since 1950. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B> When our government took office in 1993, 
Canadian interest rates were 2.5 points higher than in the 
United States. Today, our short and long-term interest rates are 
almost the same as in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we followed an independent monetary policy that 
everyone benefited from, because the huge decrease in our 
interest rates led to many more benefits, including a drop in 
the unemployment rate that now stands at 7.8%, down from 11.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also saved a lot on debt service charges. Our independent 
monetary policy greatly benefited to all Canadians and each and 
every region of the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason it is very important for us not to 
follow the course of the Bloc.  When we have our own currency we 
have a buffer against changes in economic circumstances, against 
economic shocks.  Canada, side-swiped by the Asian crisis, has 
seen commodity prices around the globe fall approximately 25%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a net exporter of commodities while the United States 
is a net importer.  Just because of global commodity prices the 
terms of trade with the United States have gone against Canada by 
about 6% and in favour of the United States by about 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had the same currency, what would have been the result? It 
is very simple.  We would have seen a cut-down in Canadian 
production.  We could have seen workers leaving Canada and being 
able to move to the United States which is experiencing the 
upturn, but we know that is not feasible.  We would have seen 
price declines, wage declines where there were no fixed wage 
contracts, and job losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of commodity prices falling, the Asian crisis followed 
by Russia on August 17, and the flight to security of currencies 
everywhere, in spite of being hit by those crises our 
unemployment has continued to fall.  Our currency, the Canadian 
dollar, has gone down a bit.  It has gone down 7% vis-à-vis the 
American dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at other countries in the world that have 
suffered.  South Africa's is down 34%; it has been sideswiped 
completely.  Australia's is down about 15% and New Zealand's is 
down about 19%.  Norway's is down a tremendous amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the fact that Canada had put its economy in good order 
we were able to get through it.  Thanks to the fact that we had a 
flexible independent monetary policy, jobs continued to increase 
in Canada and workers did not suffer.  That was the great benefit 
we enjoyed as evidenced through the last nine or twelve month 
period. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but asked myself if the Bloc is not being a little 
bit naughty in putting this motion before the House? Could it be 
their way of trying to create some kind of link with the United 
States? If another referendum were to be held, would that not 
make them somewhat closer to the United States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never before has such an idea been put forward in the House, and 
it is being put forward by the Bloc for the whole of Canada. 
Most of the time, their ideas only affect Quebec, not the whole 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that the Bloc believes this motion 
will promote separatism in Quebec, because the people will feel 
that there is some kind of pre-agreement with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never will we support such an assumption or such ideas. We will 
protect our economic independence and our independent monetary 
policy, while recognizing what is going on in the rest of the 
world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
somewhat surprised when I heard the member across the way say 
that our monetary policy has had a positive influence on the 
unemployment rate. I would ask him to compare it with what it is 
in the United States. It might wake him up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we go again with this notion of Canada's monetary 
independence vis-à-vis the United States. I would like to know how 
independent Canada's monetary policy has been, since we know 
that from 1950 to 1986 all one had to do, to determine the Bank 
of Canada rate, was to add about 1% to the U.S. federal reserve 
rate for the same period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He was right when he said the gap in the bank rates was even 
wider between 1986 and about 1993, this is when the recession 
was worse in Canada than in the United States. John Crow, the 
Governor, who was responsible for raising the interest rates to 
such high levels, is now defending an independent monetary 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of having an independent monetary policy if it 
jeopardizes jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the independent monetary policy of the Canadian 
government when the Canadian dollar collapsed in 1997-1998, the 
Bank of Canada had to raise its interest rate 1% above the 
Americans', returning to the same econometric model we had 
between 1950 and 1986? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the monetary political independence when both curves 
are parallel? I wish I could show them to the House. They are 
exactly the same. Where is the independent monetary policy in 
all this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, in a globalized world, we must 
look at what other countries do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention the six points our finance minister 
presented to the IMF. Among these was the suggestion that all 
western countries, countries with a strong economy, should 
recognize that the world economy is at risk and should lower 
their interest rates to stimulate growth within their economies 
and to encourage imports from Asian countries or from other 
countries that had problems because of the Asian crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We worked together with other countries that have a strong 
economy. That is not a lack of independence. On the contrary, 
working in co-operation with our allies is a sign of 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must repeat. 
When we took office in 1993, our interest rates were a lot 
higher than those in the United States. Thanks to our low 
inflation policy and our tax programs, we have managed to 
eliminate the deficit. Our interest rates have gone down and 
were really lower than American interest rates six months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the changes occurring worldwide, we have had to 
adjust our interest rates little by little, sometimes by 
increasing them and sometimes by lowering them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we can see the results of our independent monetary policy 
in terms of economic growth and jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I sometimes 
wonder when I see our Liberal colleagues worry about the 
intentions of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the facts. When the issue of free trade came up, 
whether it was about the original agreement or the one we have 
now, Quebec was at the forefront of these changes. Quebec was 
the one with a vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation here is exactly the same. Trade between Canada and 
the United States totals $1 billion a day, maybe more. As for 
trade between Quebec and the United States, 55% of our exports 
go to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now imagine the problems related to the exchange rate, to a 
dollar that goes up, that goes down, that is unpredictable. 
Sooner or later, we will have to go the way of a common 
currency, and I would rather we thought about it now and not 
when it is too late. That is what the Bloc Quebecois is 
proposing with this motion, the creation of a committee. What 
does my hon. colleague has to say about that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I must admit 
that when this resolution came across my desk this morning at 
about 10 o'clock, I scratched my head and could not quite fathom 
why a sovereignist party, a party dedicated to sovereignty should 
propose a motion which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a Special Committee of the 
House of Commons should be struck in order to consider the 
possibility of Canada's participation in the creation of a 
pan-American monetary union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first of all became a little suspicious and thought there was 
some mischief here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminded me somewhat of the free trade agreement where our 
first struggle in the free trade agreement was to try to get the 
Americans' attention. Frankly, as far as the Americans were 
concerned, we were a small economy, somewhere close to the size 
of California, nothing more, nothing less, approximately the same 
number of people.  The Americans were not overly concerned about 
entering into any kind of agreement with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was somewhat difficult to get them to take us seriously to 
the point where we actually ended up for the first part of the 
negotiations negotiating both sides of the agreement so that we 
could have some framework with which to move forward. We finally 
cut a deal with the Americans and entered into what was the free 
trade agreement and then became the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.  As they say, the rest is history.  I will leave it to 
others to debate the merits of that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem as I see it is that Canada is perceived to be a 
bit player in the entire exercise, particularly in world economic 
terms and indeed in North American terms. We take some pride I 
suppose in being the largest trading partner in the world with 
the Americans.  As others have pointed out, basically $1 billion 
a day goes back and forth across our borders.  Might I suggest 
that the Americans perceive it, particularly through the lens of 
Washington, as nothing more than a state border, a bit of a 
strange state border but a state border nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were persuaded to proceed with this resolution 
as is urged by the hon. members, I would argue that in fact that 
issue is even more exaggerated.  If Canada has a problem being 
perceived by Washington as a bit player, imagine how Quebec would 
be perceived by Washington or New York. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that people in the offices that control the American 
monetary policy, particularly Mr. Greenspan, would be in a bit of 
a scramble to find out where Quebec City was. Then they would 
probably be told that they speak French up there. That is kind of 
nice, sort of like Louisiana.  And that Quebec has civil law. 
That is kind of quaint, a novel idea.  And really it is a 
distinct society.  That is different altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Greenspan and others who determine that kind of policy would 
not be interested only in issues of culture and language, because 
frankly for them, what counts is the bottom line, who has the 
most dollars.  The issues that are of the greatest concern to 
Quebec and also of concern to the rest of Canada are very minor 
issues as far as Mr. Greenspan and his people might be concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The monetary policy for a North American currency will be set in 
Washington.  Let us make no bones about that.  That is a reality. 
What Ottawa thinks or what Mexico City thinks or what Quebec 
City thinks will be utterly irrelevant if this resolution goes 
forward and if we have a unified currency. To think otherwise 
would be completely naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a perfect case of taxation without representation.  In 
particular, this is the creation of monetary policy without 
representation. It will be the ultimate in alienation.  It will 
be the ultimate in frustration and it will be a colossal error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this resolution goes forward and if the contemplated result 
occurs, we might as well say goodbye to sovereignty for all of 
us. 
If sovereignty is an issue now, and it has been for 150 years, it 
will be an even more exaggerated issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis, he who has the most toys wins in an issue 
of this kind, and he who has the most bucks wins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the speakers from the opposite side used the analogy of 
the European Union.  The argument was that it went relatively 
smoothly.  There were 11 countries, 11 currencies, 11 different 
sovereign jurisdictions, et cetera, et cetera.  What the speaker 
failed to mention was that one of the countries did not have 
about 80% of the economy.  This would be a strange analogy.  If 
for example Germany had 80% of the economy in the European Union, 
do hon. members think that Berlin would really care what Madrid 
thought about fiscal or monetary policy? I would argue that all 
it does is encourages assimilation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves at some point what is the game, what is 
the real resolution behind the resolution?  There is a certain 
cleverness to the resolution.  I have to admire the other side in 
that respect.  I suppose that instead of going through a painful 
four step process we might as well just eat the pain and go for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand the resolution and the desire on the part of the 
members opposite, I would first of all understand that they would 
want separation.  That is clearly the reason they are here in 
Ottawa.  That will cause a certain amount of pain for Canada and 
a certain amount of pain for Quebec.  There is just no getting 
around that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we would have this strange understanding of a joint use of 
the currency.  That is probably more pain for Quebec and a little 
less pain for Canada, because frankly Ottawa will not give a hoot 
what Quebec City thinks about monetary policy and the joint use 
of the Canadian dollar. We will do what we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I would assume a certain element of frustration will set in 
on the part of a sovereign Quebec and there will be a desire by 
Quebec to go to a separate currency.  We can skip that stage and 
go directly to an American currency, but I think that would be 
the logical outcome of the inevitable frustrations between Ottawa 
and Quebec City over the management and joint use of the Canadian 
dollar, which I would argue is basically pain for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final stage would be stage four, which is to go to the U.S. 
dollar.  Inevitably I think that is where we would all end up, 
which would be pain for everyone.  I would say pain for everyone 
in Canada, but not for the Americans who will not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for the cleverness in his resolution. 
He is basically skipping all the stages and going directly to the 
American dollar and who cares about what the rest of Canada might 
think about the issue.  If we need high interest rates to provide 
a stimulus, forget that.  We are not going to get that.  If we 
need low interest rates to reduce inflation, there is no point in 
having that.  We will not be able to achieve it in any event.  We 
will have absolutely no control over fiscal or monetary policy in 
this country. We have to then ask whether we would have any 
control over any other policy in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already gone through the pain of the federal government 
trying to get control over its fiscal situation.  If it had not 
gotten control over its fiscal situation, we would not have been 
able to talk about the health budget.  There would not be 
anything to talk about because we would still be in deficit. If 
we have no control over our fiscal and monetary policies, we will 
have no control over any other policies in this country and we 
might as well kiss sovereignty for all of us goodbye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the analogy of the European Union which I would 
argue is a false analogy.  It is an analogy which simply does not 
make sense.  It is as if Germany had 80% of the economy and let 
all of the other bit players join in the European Union. That 
makes no sense.  It is a false analogy and needs to be denounced 
as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a stalking horse motion.  It is there to promote Quebec 
sovereignty.  This is part of trying to develop winning 
conditions and trying to convince the rest of Canada that we will 
agree to what will, by any other name, be the U.S. dollar. 
That will in one respect create winning conditions.  We will just 
go from stage one to four like that.  There will be pain all the 
way around and I do not know that any of us will be a great deal 
better off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the poor 
content of the member's speech is not surprising. The member 
himself explained why it is so: he began thinking about this 
issue at 10 o'clock this morning. One can understand why his 
arguments are so weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said the Americans give no thought to this debate. He should 
read this morning's <I>Miami Herald</I>. The columnist Andres 
Oppenheimer, whose by-line is also carried in 40 other newspapers 
across the U.S., mentions today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member should also know that the Florida trade 
secretary spoke about this subject and thought about it; the 
president of Argentina, Carlos Menem, gave some thought to this 
issue too, as well as the Inter-American Development Bank and the 
Mexico Business Council. Finally, the Canadian ambassador in 
Washington, the Prime Minister's nephew, also said we should 
discuss this issue. That all brings us to the original motion 
proposing such a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question: how is it that the Liberal members who were 
so in favour of holding a debate on the free trade agreement 
with the Americans in 1988, who wanted to extend it, are now 
doing their best to avoid this debate? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would correct the hon. 
member in one respect, namely that I started thinking about his 
motion at 10 o'clock this morning.  I have thought about the 
issues it raises on many occasions.  In my view, as it is 
phrased, the motion is a nonsense motion and not one that yields 
a serious conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to whether people in Florida are discussing this issue, I am 
not privy to that information.  It may be that Quebec is going to 
annex Florida or Florida is going to annex Quebec.  I am not 
sure. However, I understand that there are a number of people 
down there who would like to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would address my hon. colleague's attention to an article in 
this morning's <I>National Post</I> entitled “The Case for a 
World Dollar”.  I read that article initially not even knowing 
the debate would occur here today.  I put the article down and 
thought it incoherent.  It made no case for a world dollar, let 
alone a North American currency.  With the greatest of respect to 
my hon. colleague, I would suggest that his case has not been 
made and that in fact he has created for himself difficulties 
that he has yet to anticipate.

protection of the U.S. dollar these many years.  Has the Liberian 
economy become better or worse in his view? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes this is a motion about 
going under the mother hen of the U.S. dollar.  I would 
respectively suggest that this motion lays an egg.  The only 
question is how to poach it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is that no country has fared better under the 
U.S. dollar.  Puerto Rico, in particular, is an excellent example 
of a country that is without sovereignty, without direction and a 
country that cannot make an impact because it has no control over 
its finances or its fiscal or monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to have Canada or, more particularly, 
Quebec become another Puerto Rico in this hemisphere, then he is 
welcome to it.  We on this side of the House will resist very 
strongly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will split 
my time with one of my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to participate in this debate on the motion which I 
will read for the benefit of those who have just tuned in: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a Special Committee of the 
House of Commons should be struck in order to consider the 
possibility of Canada's participation in the creation of a 
pan-American monetary union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are members of the Bloc Quebecois calling for the creation 
of such a committee and why are we holding this debate today? 
Because in this rapidly changing world, because of 
globalization—as members opposite keep telling us—members of 
Parliament must be able to see further down the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the attitude of the members opposite concerns me; it 
reminds me of the attitude that prevailed during the debate on 
free trade. The Liberals started by shouting their indignation. 
We all remember what they said, that free trade would be the 
mother of all evils and that if they were elected, they would 
never sign the agreement. Once elected, the new Prime Minister, 
Mr. Jean Chrétien, finally signed the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say finally with pleasure— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I remind the hon. member that we must not 
refer to an hon. member by name, but by his or her constituency 
or title, as the hon. member knows well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was talking about the hon. 
Prime Minister. I hope you will forgive the history teacher when 
she gets the upper hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just after his election, the hon. Prime Minister finally signed 
the free trade agreement. But more importantly, he became the 
defender, the grand champion of free trade areas all over the 
world because Canada is ready to establish free trade areas with 
APEC countries, the Americas, as well as EFTA—Canada has 
ambitious plans but it also has more modest ones—whose members 
are Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that, after a positive vote on sovereignty, we 
will be able, if that is deemed desirable, to create a free 
trade zone that will include Quebec. But if the future is 
influenced by what is happening in Europe—and chances are that it 
will be—should we not examine the impact this will have and 
prepare for that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we prepare? I am my party's critic for industry, and 
I know how serious the productivity problem is in Canada, and 
the Canadian monetary policy did not help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state has suggested that the depreciation of 
the Canadian dollar preserved jobs, but the low value of our 
dollar has also made Canadians considerably poorer compared to 
the Americans. This low value of the dollar, based on a lack of 
productivity and low salaries, does not only make us poorer, but 
also makes improving our productivity more difficult, since that 
involves buying new equipment. 
But two thirds of equipment purchases in Canada come from 
abroad, and 90 % of this is from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lower the value of our dollar, the more difficult innovation 
is for Canadian businesses. While we hear flattering 
pronouncements on that extraordinary Canadian economy, we find a 
more sobering description of our reality in reports from the 
industry department. The truth is that if our productivity had 
improved at the same pace as in the United States, for example, 
each Canadian would be richer by $7,000. That is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just more separatist trickery, but a real issue that 
more and more people want us to grapple with, because there are 
good reasons why we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not suggest this should be done tomorrow. 
We say this matter ought to be examined by parliament, because 
it poses a number of problems, including Canada's increasingly 
lag behind the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very fine to go on about an independent monetary 
policy, but I would point out to my hon. colleagues from Ontario 
that they have not experienced the chill the eastern provinces 
have as a result of the Canadian monetary policy.  The east has 
always had the opposite reaction to the rest of Canada.  When 
Ontario was overheating, the rest was just beginning to warm up 
a little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am most anxious to see a committee struck to continue this 
debate.  The debate is under way, however, and it is going to 
continue, because we are lagging further and further behind the 
United States, and the rest of the world as well, moreover. 
In the past 25 years, Canada has recorded the least growth in 
productivity of all G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance of Manufacturers of Canada has developed a 
competitiveness index.  For each factor, the country's 
performance is compared with the top performer in the OECD, and 
the rating is expressed as a percentage.  In 1997, Canada—proud 
of its performance that year, moreover—was rated at 76%, compared 
to the Americans' 89% and the OECD countries' 82%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Porter, the universally respected guru when it comes to 
competitiveness, judges Canada harshly in a study he has carried 
out on us. 
Among Canada's five greatest weaknesses he lists the poor growth 
in productivity, and the little invested in science and 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This prompts me to say that, under those circumstances, one 
would expect the Canadian government to take a lead role in 
improving Canadian productivity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there were a number of initiatives promoting the 
knowledge economy, but the truth of the matter is that the 
budget this year provides $80 million less for science and 
technology than it did last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From an economic point of view, from now on, will our hon. 
colleagues opposite want to bury their heads in the sand or look 
at the development tools we will be needing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can no longer base its sovereignty on an economic policy 
that has its citizens getting poorer all the time and its 
exports, which we are so proud of, rely on costs whose main 
features are our low wages.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have two questions for the member.  I listened very carefully to 
what she had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is one which I posed previously.  I would be 
grateful if the hon member would comment on the success of the 
country of Liberia taking the U.S. dollar as its own currency and 
giving up power over its economy and financial affairs.  Does she 
consider that the economy of Liberia and the people of Liberia 
benefited from that experience? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I wonder if the hon. member would comment on this.  This 
is from today's issue of <I>l'Actualité</I>.  It is an article by 
Professor Pierre Fortin, who is an economics professor at the 
Université du Québec à Montréal.  I will read the last paragraph 
of the article: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Times have changed. To let the smallest change in world prices 
for our raw materials disrupt our currency is a notion that 
dates back to the 1970s and that we need to drop. Texas does not 
have a monetary policy distinct from that of Washington and that 
has not stopped it from prospering. Even Honduras does not let 
its currency vary according to the world price for bananas. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member care to comment on Professor Fortin's article? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, two fine questions from my 
colleague.  However, the first one concerns me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being proposed is a committee for Canada.  He is 
prepared to compare Canada's weight with that of the United 
States and that of Liberia.  As we try look at a future with a 
pan-American or North American currency, he agrees to consider 
the question.  He is assuming that the model will be that of 
Liberia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us all use our brain a little.  Should discussions occur, 
can we not ask our colleague whether the Americans might not 
wonder what would be in it for them?  Naturally, the United 
States is elephantine, but living next door to it can be costly 
too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to his question on Pierre Fortin, I do not understand it at 
all.  He is talking about Canadian policy, which the secretary 
of state said had fluctuated with the price of natural 
resources, permitting jobs to be saved.  What Pierre Fortin said 
is that for a self-respecting country, it made no sense, and 
doubtless he would agree with me, the effects on productivity 
are terrible in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that in the short term this should not be done, 
but the situation must be seen for what it is.  Everyone is 
becoming poorer.  That is what it means. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will vote in 
favour of the Bloc Quebecois motion, because no one can oppose 
studies.  Everyone here is on continuous training these days. 
So we agree to go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortin said that a common currency was absolutely 
unacceptable and that the furthest one could go would be 
monetary association. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any thought of a common currency involves the assumption that 
the Americans would forgo their national currency, the strongest 
in the world, even stronger than the Euro.  In this vein, I 
would ask my colleague what she thinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event it would be possible to negotiate a date for the 
establishment of a common currency, I would ask her what fiscal 
measures should be passed to strengthen Canada's monetary and 
economic position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I am pleased by the 
announcement made by the whip of the Progressive Conservative 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for his question on Pierre Fortin and <I>L'Actualité</I>, as I said 
earlier regarding the notion of fluctuation—the secretary of 
state boasted about this—there is no doubt that issues such as 
the distinction between a union and an association must be 
discussed. The idea is to look beyond the Canadian dollar and 
the monetary policy, and to try to anticipate what the North 
American and tricontinental economy will be in the years to 
come. This is what we must look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good sign if members opposite agreed to discuss 
this issue, because the situation is changing and will continue 
to change whether we want it to or not. This is true for the 
economy, but also for other areas. 
The government would be well-advised to create a serene 
atmosphere to discuss this whole issue, because the future of 
our fellow citizens and of our children is at stake. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for Mercier for sharing her time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the deputy government whip that if he wants to quote 
<I>L'Actualité</I>, he does not have to go that far. On page 10 of the 
magazine, we find the following: “I anticipate a North American 
currency within five years. It is unavoidable”. That comment is 
from Sherry Cooper, the chief economist and vice-president of 
Nesbitt Burns. Incidentally, Ms. Cooper is not a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions 
said he was opposed to the motion of the Bloc Quebecois on a 
monetary union with the United States. Up to that point, I 
understand him, because he is not referring to today's motion. 
He is opposed to something we are not discussing. The Liberals 
are off the track, but we are used to that. It is par for the 
course with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, today's motion calls for a committee to consider a 
pan-American currency.  We cannot presume to know at this time 
what conclusions such a committee would reach, as the Liberal 
members are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also puzzling why there is such vehement opposition to a 
committee to consider the possibility of a form of monetary 
union in North America and in the Americas at the very time when 
members of this House are giving thought to a free trade zone 
for the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Liberal members be so removed from a topic such as a 
common currency at the very time when we are debating 
international and intercontinental trade?  These same 
individuals who, as my colleague, the member for Mercier, 
pointed out, are now supporting the elimination of barriers 
between all countries in the Americas, are the same folks who 
said in the red book, and I quote from page 24, for my 
colleague, the member for Outremont: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will renegotiate both the FTA and NAFTA to 
obtain a subsidies code, an anti-dumping code, a more effective 
dispute resolution mechanism, and the same energy protection as 
Mexico.  Abrogating trade agreements should be only a last 
resort if satisfactory changes cannot be negotiated. 
</UL>
<Thought was even given to abrogating this agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members remember that, in 1993, the Liberals campaigned 
against NAFTA, against the lack of consultation and information 
with respect to these agreements, and that they said on page 24 
of their red book that they were prepared to abrogate the FTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have they done since?  They have signed it without a word, 
they have let in Chile, and they recently signed with Israel and 
Palestine.  This was another promise they broke, along with the 
GST and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might wonder why our Liberal colleagues want to drag the 
debate down to partisan levels. 
What we are suggesting today to our colleagues is to act as 
responsible parliamentarians. What they are telling us is that 
it is bad thinking and plainly bad to suggest to this House that 
we act as responsible parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a review committee concluded that under no circumstances 
should we adopt a common currency with the Americas, we would 
certainly abide by and support its decision. It might decide, 
surprise, surprise, that we should have a fixed exchange rate 
with the U.S. dollar, set at 80 cents, for example, after 
negotiations, to avoid the uncertainties—a word we hear often 
from our Liberal colleagues—regarding exports, which account for 
one job out of three in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might decide we should adopt the American dollar or a 
pan-American dollar. 
We are not experts, so today we are suggesting that a review 
committee be struck to hear what experts, economists, exporters, 
the Canadian Manufacturers Association, the Canadian Exporters' 
Association might have to say on the matter. If they tell us 
“Yes, we should go ahead with this”, why should we as 
parliamentarians stubbornly refuse to have a quality debate and 
not do our job? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask this to my colleagues, because soon we will have a 
question and answer period. I would like them to respond to my 
arguments. Why do they not want to do their job as 
parliamentarians? They opposed free trade, what is their opinion 
of a free trade zone? Do they oppose it too? I have news for 
them. 
Their government and their party are in favour of this American 
free trade zone and even presided over the first 18 months of 
negotiations. Why not then take advantage of this forum to 
expand the debate to the possibility of a unique currency for 
all those partners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is legitimate. Why do they not want to talk about 
this, and why do they always come back with the same message 
“the bad separatists are only introducing this debate to be able 
to separate more easily”. This has absolutely nothing to do with 
today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also raise the objection that, as far as exports are 
concerned, we have an advantage now. The Quebec minister of 
finance was saying that it was because our weak dollar. 
He was saying “Yes, but all this has a pernicious effect, a 
little bit like drugs. At the outset, it is pleasant, but in the 
long run, it can be very detrimental to our health”. It is the 
same thing for the economic well-being and the low Canadian 
dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be that today it is easier to export our goods on 
certain markets because our dollar is weaker than the U.S. 
dollar. Who knows. Those who have travelled to the United States 
lately have certainly noticed that the Canadian dollar is worth 
very little compared to the U.S. dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> You know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Yes, I know. 
But if the value of the Canadian dollar increased, would this 
automatically means that our exports might be penalized? Should 
we therefore set up a monetary policy to keep our dollar at 63, 
65 or 70 cents? Is that the federal government's monetary 
policy? Perhaps it should tell us that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the independence of our monetary policy, my colleague for 
Charlesbourg, my colleague for Mercier and my other colleagues 
who took part in the debate have shown it very well. 
Since 1950, if we look at the line of the U.S. dollar value in 
relation to the value of the Canadian dollar as well as the 
interest rates, we can see that the lines are following the same 
curve, they look like exact copies of each other, with one 
exception, in 1993, if I am not mistaken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are doing 80% of our trade with the United States, 
where our exports are going; we are more closely linked with the 
United States than the European markets are among themselves, 
yet the European countries, after ten years of discussion, opted 
for a single currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they closing their minds to any potential discussion and 
study of such a possibility? Why do they absolutely want to rule 
out a debate on that subject, in spite of the fact that the 
Canadian ambassador to the United States, Mr. Chrétien, said 
that it was something to consider, in spite of the fact that the 
chief economist and vice-president of Nesbitt Burns said that 
this was inevitable within five years, and in spite of the fact 
that several economists and experts said that we should look at 
this issue today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we Parliamentarians want it all done for us?  Why 
should we want the people at Finance to discuss this matter, and 
then we will just vote on the bill to implement it, as was done 
with the free trade agreement with Chile? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we want to do as we did with the free trade agreement 
with Israel, and just vote on the bill to implement it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what MPs should be, mere rubber stamps? Should we adopt 
implementation legislation and say yes, this is fine, the public 
servants did a good job?  No.  Like the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg, I too believe our job is to study it, to examine 
all the possibilities, and then to be in a position to make 
enlightened decisions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my 
opinion there is already a pan-American currency, one that is 
used throughout the world, and that is the U.S. dollar.  Many 
countries do not like this situation, among them France, England 
and the other European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member across the way.  Is it true 
that the real reason the Europeans created the euro was to 
protect European sovereignty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that, indeed, the 
euro was created, among other reasons, to strengthen the 
monetary policy and the world situation vis-à-vis the United 
States, the U.S. dollar and the possible fluctuations of the 
exchange rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for example, what George Sauras did to the pound sterling. 
Over a period of just a few days, he was able to get the value 
of the pound sterling to go down by gambling on that value. 
Today replacing these 11 European currencies by the euro 
provides increased protection against this type of speculation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not here to examine this issue, but to ask that a 
committee be set up to undertake that task. 
As we demonstrated today, in the past, speculators could gamble 
on 11 different currencies that have now been strengthened by 
creating a single new currency, the euro. These speculators will 
have to look around to find a currency that is not as strong and 
as economically important. They will be able to gamble on that 
currency and, perhaps, create more problems for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that all these other currencies have now been grouped 
together and are better able to protect themselves against such 
speculation, it is likely that these speculators will turn their 
attention to the Canadian currency and will target our dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue which the committee could examine. I suggest to 
the hon. member that he should submit this issue to the 
committee. Said committee will determine if the Canadian dollar 
is indeed strong enough to withstand international speculation. 
If it is unnecessary, as in the case of trade rules, why is 
Canada such a fervent supporter of the WTO?  We might put this 
question to my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, the various countries in the world can stand up to the 
United States in the case of a trade dispute.  Could Canada 
withstand speculation over its dollar, given that the Europeans 
will perhaps consider going elsewhere?  That question could be 
raised in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, how financially and fiscally independent is Canada from the 
United States?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the extent of this independence when we look at the 
curve since 1950?  When 80% of our trade is with the United 
States, how independent are we in trade terms from them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, and during the last election campaign, in 1997, the 
Canadian government said “In terms of foreign trade, we will 
open our market to other sectors of activity, toward Asia, 
Europe and Africa”.  In the meantime the curve of trade with the 
U.S. continues to climb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are economically dependent on the U.S as well as commercially 
dependent on them. We must make sure that we are prepared for 
potential speculation and for a potential change in direction in 
relation to them.  Perhaps a study on the subject could help us 
prepare for an increase in the value of the Canadian dollar, for 
potential speculation on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the question my colleague from Charlesbourg is trying to 
answer by asking parliamentarians to assume their 
responsibilities. However if Liberal members wish to disregard 
their responsibilities when they vote, the people of Canada will 
know about it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think 
one of the biggest features of our currency and its value today 
has to do with uncertainty.  A lot of the uncertainty has been 
created by people across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc motion alludes to the desire of the separatist movement 
to copy the European Union.  As we know, European countries have 
come together to create a common currency.  I think it is 
appropriate that we ask ourselves why they did that.  Basically 
the reason is that they wanted to lessen their sovereignty 
because their history has not been a happy one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think of the two world wars and how nationalism 
devastated some of those economies.  People who have travelled to 
Berlin or Warsaw have seen that most of the buildings date from 
the 1950s.  It does not take a lot of thought to realize what the 
sovereignist movement in Europe has done.  The people have said 
they are trading sovereignty for economic growth and stability. 
They want to come together to have a common currency.  As other 
speakers have mentioned, there are 11 independent countries.  The 
thought process is quite different in Europe than it is in North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about currency as if it is unique.  People have traded 
in coins.  Indeed in this country we have used beaver pelts. 
Seashells have been used in other places.  These things only 
represent a modicum of the exchange between people.  The 
important thing is the value of the trading relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Bloc seem to think this is entirely in reverse, 
that somehow exchange rates influence productivity.  In fact 
productivity and the underlying economics that exist in the 
country reflect the exchange rates, not the other way around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the issue of a Pan-American monetary union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members have alluded to the reality that within the North 
American structure economic forces are divergent.  We know that 
our neighbour to the south dominates the economy of North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the Canadian <I>Almanac</I> today because I was 
interested in what the comparative economic relationships would 
be in North America.  The GDP of the province of Quebec is about 
$185 billion.  That represents approximately 20% of Canada's GDP. 
The U.S. GDP, on the other hand, is something like $6.740 
trillion.  These figures do not include Mexico.  Quebec's 
economic strength just within the United States and Canada would 
be less than 2%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Do these people really think they are going to have some say 
about currency evaluations when they would only have 2% of the 
economy in the Pan-American relationship?  I doubt that.  I think 
we all know fundamentally that if we entered into an agreement 
like that we would not be controlling the foreign exchange of 
currency calculations, it would be someone in Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems odd to me that separatists would actually bend 
themselves out of shape.  Now they want to give up their 
sovereignty movement and make themselves simply a fiefdom of the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have our own independent foreign exchange rate and 
currency?  It allows us to manage the economy.  The exchange rate 
actually represents the underlying economic forces.  It allows us 
to adjust foreign exchange rates to deal with certain shocks that 
occur in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are living through a period in which commodity 
prices are depressed in world markets.  Unfortunately Canada is 
very susceptible to that because a significant portion of our 
economy is related to commodity pricing.  Commodity pricing has 
changed through global forces which are quite often beyond our 
control.  Russia has been dumping commodity prices and the demand 
in southeast Asia has also declined.  These have all had an 
impact on commodities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have choices.  Do we change our foreign exchange 
rate, our internal currency, or do we try to maintain an 
artificially high exchange rate?  I would suggest, in the 
wonderful fairyland of the Bloc, that if it had an American 
currency, suddenly that economic tool would no longer exist.  The 
only ways one could adjust for economic forces would be through 
unemployment and high interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a commodity based economy to some extent, but in the 
same almanac it was interesting to see the breakdown of the 
province of Quebec and how the GDP figure is arrived at.  It 
basically stated:  primary manufacturing, electric power, mining 
and pulp and paper.  Quite frankly, those are all commodity based 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What members opposite are proposing is to adopt a Pan-American 
currency, the result of which, under our current economic 
conditions, would be increased unemployment in the province of 
Quebec and increased local interest rates.  On top of that, it 
would also reduce their sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it quite incredible that this is the debate that the Bloc 
has brought forward to us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange to have this kind of misguided approach to foreign 
exchange.  I was also surprised to find that the Conservative 
Party supports this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the history of this country, of John A. 
Macdonald, the building of the great railway and the national 
dreams.  What has happened to them?  They have become so demented 
along the way that we are now accepting a separatist agenda to 
reduce Canadian sovereignty at the behest of our big brothers to 
the south?  It is a sad day indeed for the House of Commons when 
we have to go that full circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker after speaker from the Bloc has given us an economics 
101 lesson.  I find it quite incredible that somehow we are in 
bad shape in this country because of our foreign exchange rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was greatly pleased to go to the unveiling of the KPMG book 
that everybody has been talking about recently.  It states that 
Canada is number one in the world with respect to its competitive 
position. 
Yes, foreign exchange is part of that.  They say that at a 79 
cent dollar Canada will start to lose that competitive position.

lose our competitive position that we now have, and at the demise 
of the province of Quebec I might add. From sector to sector, 
from the software sector to the high tech sector, Canada has been 
rated as the number one place in the world to do business.  I do 
not think we want to give up that competitive position just at 
some whim of the Bloc which is totally misguided.  It does not 
even seem to suit the Bloc's own agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be celebrating the fact that the Canadian economy is 
robust.  It has the opportunity to be competitive in world 
markets.  I would encourage all members of the House, including 
those in the Conservative Party, to stand up four square and 
object to losing our sovereignty and losing our ability to make 
our own economic decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this does not 
make sense. First of all, the member says that, if we had the 
same currency as the United States, Quebec would have no input 
into monetary policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec forms 25% of Canada, and we already have no input into 
Canada's monetary policy. Is the member making fun of us? We had 
no input into the Constitution or the social union agreement. We 
never have any input. This will not change in an American 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now let us look at the facts. 
Canadian businesses already have bank accounts in U.S. dollars. 
Why? Because there is a tremendous amount of trade between 
Canada and the United States, to the tune of $1 billion a day. 
What country is the United States' largest trading partner? Is 
it Japan? Not at all. Is it Great Britain? Absolutely not. It is 
Canada, and 55% of Quebec's exports go to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our businesses here in Canada already work in U.S. dollars. They 
try to stabilize uncertainties due to fluctuations by buying 
what is called future contracts on the value of the U.S. 
currency. We already have a highly integrated economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Mr. Know-it-all over there, holder of the absolute truth, who 
refuses that a committee of the House of Commons be struck to 
consider these issues, really does not know anything at all and 
above all does not want to know anything. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think it would 
take a lot of intelligence to realize we do not start studying 
something which means the demise of our own economy and of our 
own constituents.  The member talked about what he believes to be 
the fact that somehow the Quebec people have no say in monetary 
policy.  I would like to point out the obvious. Some of the 
directors of the Bank of Canada come from the province of Quebec 
and Quebec does have a say in how we arrive at monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deal in foreign exchange relationships all the time.  As a 
matter of fact I was surprised to learn the other day that the 
largest flow of American dollars outside of the United States is 
not in Canada but in the Soviet Union.  People are using the 
American dollar as a source of foreign exchange in world 
denominated currency.  That does not mean we have to be part of 
that hegemony of the American system. In fact foreign exchange 
conversion is quite healthy and quite easily done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of countries thought the American dollar was so wonderful 
that they were going to peg themselves to the American dollar and 
this would create stability within their own economies.  We do 
not have to think back further than Southeast Asia and the 
Indonesian crisis and so forth and of countries which were unable 
to make it.  Brazil just devalued its currency.  Countries could 
not maintain that support level because it was artificial.

loss of jobs, by high interest rates.  It would be a brutal and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
listening to the hon. member's comments, I wish to clarify our 
party's position on this motion.  We are supporting this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe this is an important issue that deserves discussion 
by members of parliament. Economists are discussing this issue as 
we are here today.  They have been discussing this issue for 
months.  I suggest that there are probably bureaucrats in the 
Department of Finance who are discussing this issue.  As their 
elected officials, we owe Canadians at least that amount of 
respect to discuss the issue in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to the reasons I am personally opposed to a common 
currency at this time.  They are many of the same reasons the 
hon. member articulated.  His party was the same party that 
opposed free trade in 1988.  His party in the 1993 election in 
which he was elected opposed the GST.  We cannot take the 
Liberals seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is odd that the 
opposition from time to time comes out and says “Is it not a 
terrible thing that you whip your caucus?”  This man just said 
he disagrees with his own party's support of this motion yet he 
is going to stand up tonight and support it. Where does that put 
him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon. 
member for Yukon, Aboriginal affairs; the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre, The budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is not really a debate about monetary policy.  My 
colleague from Durham came closer to the truth when he mentioned 
words like sovereignty in this debate.  This is really a debate 
about national identity and the preservation of national 
identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back in time as money began, in the ancient city states 
of Greece, money represented and contained on it the images of 
the state.  Usually on one side was a god or goddess and on the 
other side, some symbol of the state. In Roman times, the Romans 
put the effigy of Caesar on their coinage.  They used that effigy 
to establish their identity throughout the civilized world at the 
time, all of the Mediterranean. In about 100 AD a coin with 
Caesar's head on it could be found anywhere, even in Britain. 
That coin said Rome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money still conveys that image.  It still has that purpose.  No 
country knows that better than the United States of America.  The 
Americans know full well that when their dollar is circulated 
around the world, it says to the world “We are the most powerful 
country in the world”.  It also says “We are successful.  These 
are our values”.  As the member for Durham mentioned, in the 
Soviet Union the real money of commerce is the American dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year I was on holiday in Belize.  Belize is a 
small English speaking country on the shoulder of the Yucatan 
Peninsula 
in Central America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Belize uses the Belizean dollar.  It looks identical to the 
Canadian dollar, complete with the Queen. On the reverse of the 
Belizean dollar, the paper currency, there is a scene of Belize. 
Nevertheless, when it is flipped over, the Queen can be seen.  It 
is similar to a Canadian bank note.  I suspect that the Belizean 
dollar is actually manufactured in this city.  Of course, the 
Canadian authorities print money for many countries around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Belize things can equally be bought with the Belizean dollar 
or the American dollar.  I suggest there already is a 
pan-American currency in use everywhere in the western hemisphere 
and that is the American dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any store on Sparks Street paying in Canadian currency is 
fine, but paying in American currency is fine as well. 
We already have precisely the kind of pan-American currency that 
is proposed by the Bloc motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Europe there is a long tradition of national independence, 
especially in France and England.  The arrival and the power of 
the American currency in Europe has caused great concern and 
distress.  Particularly France is concerned about losing its 
national culture, symbols and sense of identity to a kind of 
American hegemony worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sentiment is echoed worldwide, the fear that the United 
States will establish its values everywhere.  We have reason to 
fear that because global television now penetrates every corner 
of the world. English and American values are dominating the 
cultural message that is going out across the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the few things we as national identities have left to 
preserve our sense of self is our money.  I was absolutely 
mortified and distressed in the 1980s before I ever became an MP 
when the previous government, the government of Brian Mulroney, 
came along and changed the Canadian currency, changed it to make 
it more neutral, less patriotic, less Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was young, as a paper boy I can remember the first time I 
obtained my own earned money.  Collecting door to door I would be 
given a one dollar bill or a five dollar bill.  Money in those 
days had scenes of Canada.  I remember as a child looking at 
those bills and thinking that is my country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mulroney came along and as part of this whole pandering to the 
Quebec nationalists, the Quebec sovereignists, Mulroney tried to 
take away many symbols that represented Canada from things like 
our postage stamps and our money. I suggest that if we, and when 
I say we I mean all of us, French-speaking Canadians and 
English-speaking Canadians, want to preserve a sense of who we 
are, whether we think of ourselves in one region or another 
region, then we have to preserve those few symbols that are left 
to us as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that in no independent country of Quebec is there ever 
going to be a currency that could survive for more than two 
weeks.  Even in the proposition of independence was the 
suggestion that a separate Quebec would adopt a Canadian 
currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the rule, that Quebec separate, alone or together, 
cannot have anything better than the American dollar bill to 
represent the French-speaking fact of this country, then how long 
would that French-speaking fact survive?  It would not survive 
because the Americans are not tolerant of the nature of this 
land.  The nature of this land is this beautiful country that 
includes two very strong linguistic cultures.  That has no part 
in the American plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see members of the Bloc Quebecois smiling.  If they were to go 
to France they would hear the French talk about the Americans and 
the dominance of the English language in France, of Disney World 
and all the symbols of the United States that are invading 
France.  The French understand how necessary it is to protect 
their country with its own symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there is a reason for the Euro.  It was recognized in 
Europe among those 11 countries that if they were going to 
survive not just as an economic entity but as a sovereign entity 
against the American cultural power, they had to have their own 
currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is behind all of this is not monetary policy because it 
really has nothing to do with that.  We are in a global economy. 
This really has to do with images, symbols and a sense of 
ourselves, be we Canadians or Albertans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I agree with what the hon. member said in his 
speech today.  I just want assurance that the Liberal Party will 
not change its position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember back in 1974 when Liberal leader Pierre Trudeau 
campaigned against price and wage controls against Bob Stanfield 
from Nova Scotia and the famous line “zap, you are frozen”. He 
won a majority government and all of a sudden in came wage and 
price controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the famous GST debate when the predecessor of the 
Reform Party, its hero Brian Mulroney brought, in the GST.  Who 
campaigned against the GST?  The Liberal Party.  It is in power. 
I just checked today and the GST is still there.  The Liberals 
changed their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember a famous free trade debate once again brought in 
by the Conservative Party.  I see free trade is still there.  The 
Liberals changed their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Liberal Party to be a chameleon from here to eternity 
or can we trust that what the member is now saying will remain as 
Liberal policy for at least the next four or five years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to inform 
the member that since 1993 with this Liberal government, 
backbench Liberal MPs have been fully engaged in helping to 
create policy.  I can assure him that through committee, through 
caucus, we will set the government on the right course, 
protecting our national sovereignty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the chronicle by the previous speaker is so 
accurate.  All this was of course set out in the red book, which 
is almost as red as some of the government members' faces 
whenever these inconsistencies are brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member does raise a very good point when he 
talks about the actual issue here being sovereignty.  It is not 
so much sovereignty.  The Bloc, in fairness, has brought this 
motion forward to examine the issue, an issue that is taking 
place everywhere else in the world and, as previous speakers have 
indicated, something that is very likely going on right now in 
the Department of National Revenue.  The issue is not necessarily 
about sovereignty today.  It is about examining something that 
needs to be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make it very clear.  I do not know if there is some 
hidden agenda here that was alluded to by the hon. member. 
Perhaps we should beware the ides of March.  The Conservative 
Party is not supportive in any way, shape or form of having a 
dollar tied to the Americans or having a common currency. We are 
supporting, however, looking at this issue further in a 
committee. That is the position we are putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I submit that when a party 
supports a motion like this, it has to take whatever is behind 
the motion as well as the motion at face value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very obvious in my mind that the question of money and the 
symbolic importance of money is very central to how we identify 
ourselves as countrymen.  I caution the member that perhaps he 
has not thought of this aspect.  I have raised this aspect and I 
had hoped in view of that he might consider how his party will 
vote on this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to the debate from the very beginning, and I think the 
last Liberal speaker gave us a very good illustration of the 
Liberal position. Liberals are stuck with symbols of the past, 
they are looking to the past, and they have a hard time getting 
involved in modern debates that are forward looking, because 
they feel threatened and they are afraid of coming to grips with 
their own identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks, the hon. member has never mentioned economic 
arguments or the impact on exports, which would make an 
interesting debate, or the transition to be made if we are to 
have a new currency. There is not a single economic argument in 
his remarks. His favorite words were pride, symbols, and value. 
That reminds me a lot of the debate on free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question to the hon. member. Since he said that our 
currency represents his pride of being Canadian, his identity, 
the sense of belonging he feels when he looks at the Canadian 
dollar, could he explain why this proud symbol represents the 
Queen of England? Is that symbol of the past what makes him so 
proud of being Canadian? He is not even able to have on his own 
currency more proper symbols of Canadian culture. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot thank the member 
more for his observation because I believe absolutely that it is 
high time we changed those symbols. I would like on all Canadian 
dollars and all Canadian currency the symbol of the Canadian 
flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is absolutely right.  It is high time this 
country cut those symbolic ties to Britain and stood up for 
itself, Canada united, all of us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to address the Bloc motion today which I shall read 
into the record so members and people watching this on television 
will understand what we are doing: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a special parliamentary 
committee of the House of Commons should be struck in order to 
consider the possibility of Canada's participation in the 
creation of pan-American monetary union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Reform Party, I think my colleagues do not have 
anything against the motion or do not have great concerns about 
this motion.  It is well and fine to discuss this and send it to 
some kind of committee.  That is not a problem at all.  What I am 
concerned about is that in doing this we will start to take some 
of the attention away from the dreadful record of this government 
when it comes to the Canadian dollar.  I will address that in a 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me address some of the pros and cons of having a 
pan-American currency.  Many people have discussed this lately 
with the advent of the Euro.  There are some good aspects and 
some bad aspects. The sovereignty issue is one of the biggest 
issues people are concerned about.  Their concerns are very 
valid.  The Canadian currency is a repository for many of our 
symbols.  My colleagues in the Liberal Party have made some good 
arguments about that.  That is fine.  We acknowledge that that is 
a big issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the pros of doing this, of having a pan-American 
currency, would be things like business issues. Some businesses 
have for a very long time been sheltered from competitive 
pressures because the dollar has been used as a buffer to protect 
them.  All of a sudden that would be gone.  They would then be 
forced to compete and improve their products and services.  In 
doing that they would raise the standard of living of Canadians. 
That is one of the great advantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are disadvantages too.  We are in a country where so much 
of our GDP is dependent on commodity prices.  We have seen this 
recently.  If all of a sudden commodity prices go in the tank and 
the dollar cannot adjust for it, we run into a situation where we 
may have some dislocation, some unemployment and those sorts of 
things.   We should have that discussion but it is not timely to 
have that discussion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue today and the things we have discussed in the 
House of Commons in the last couple of days are the ones we 
should keep discussing.  I am talking about this government's 
dreadful record in protecting the Canadian dollar under the 
system we currently have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue not because it is important that our 
dollar be at some particular number or figure but because where 
the dollar is tells us something about the state of the Canadian 
economy.  Many people regard the dollar and the level it is at as 
a barometer of the health of the Canadian economy. We should 
become concerned when we see it fall to record lows. We saw that 
happen this summer.  Frankly, it has barely budged from that 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not long ago, in fact just a few years ago, when we had 
the current finance minister, at the time running for the 
leadership of the Liberal Party, rip the Conservative finance 
minister at that time, Michael Wilson, because the dollar had 
fallen below 80 cents.  He said it would be a free fall.  It 
would collapse if it went below 70 cents.  Under this government 
it is at 65 cents.  It is bad enough that the dollar has fallen. 
When our dollar is that weak it effectively means that Canadian 
families have to face a pay cut because they are now buying 
imports with those cheaper dollars.  That in and of itself is a 
bad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond that.  As I said, the state of the dollar is also 
a barometer of the health of the economy.  When the dollar falls 
that dramatically and is so listless as it is today that tells us 
a lot about the policies of the government.  It tells us a lot 
about the fiscal policies of this government.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us discuss some of those.  We know Canadian productivity is 
absolutely in the tank.  We have report after report drawing 
attention to this.  We see the OECD issue a report that talks 
about Canadian productivity falling dramatically although at one 
point we were one of the leaders in the world.  We know from 
companies like Nesbitt Burns that our productivity is in the 
tank.  The industry department of the Government of Canada has 
pointed out that Canadian productivity is lagging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know from economics 101, if we are producing less, not as 
much as other countries, if our productivity is not staying up 
there, we are not producing as much wealth and our standard of 
living is falling.  That is one of the primary reasons why 
Canadians today feel hard done by.  They do not necessarily 
understand all the arguments being made in this place today but 
they know they just do not have as much money as they used to 
have at the end of the month to pay the bills.  That is a 
tragedy.  This is not just an economic debate.  It is a debate 
about the situation many Canadian families are in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before Christmas the industry minister revealed, perhaps 
unwittingly, the policy of this government when he said that high 
taxes aid productivity in Canada.  That is what the industry 
minister, the would-be finance minister, said.  The Reform Party, 
the official opposition, thinks the industry minister is off his 
rocker.  We say that high taxes are one of the things that kill 
productivity in the country.  We say that high taxes make us less 
competitive.  We say that when you have high taxes you have a 
weak currency.  That is exactly what we told the government again 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's defence is to drag out a report done by KPMG 
consulting that states that the two biggest selling advantages of 
Canada when we try to promote it around the world to attract 
investment are low wages and a weak currency.  Talk about trying 
to put the best face on a bad situation.  It does not talk about 
how our taxes are so competitive and how we are attracting 
business that way, in the manner Ireland has done it over the 
past several years, or the United States, the U.K. or other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government trots out these arguments which at best would 
seem to be acts of desperation when it starts boasting that we 
have low wages.  The fact that we have low wages may attract some 
business but my friends across the way would have to admit it is 
a third world argument.  The people who are being paid those low 
wages are not very thrilled about it.  They want to see wages 
going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this pattern over and over again where the government is 
faced with all this bad news and tries desperately to put some 
good face on it.  It would take 100 Mary Kay beauty consultants 
to dress that argument up and make it look good.  Canadians do 
not buy it for a second.  They are tired of seeing their standard 
of living eroded, and they see it over and over again under this 
government.  They see taxes going through the roof, they see a 
$580 billion debt and they intuitively understand that is 
connected to the state of the Canadian dollar and their eroding 
standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the government to set aside the feeble arguments it has 
been making about Canada being attractive because we do not pay 
our people very well and Canadians are willing to work for 
peanuts.  Set those arguments aside and address the issue head on 
and say we have a tax problem. Our taxes are 30% to 40% higher 
than in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Say don't come to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  I am being dressed down by the junior 
minister of finance, the selfsame member who dressed down 
homemakers the other day.  Do not get me started on that.  I do 
not think the minister wants to hear about that again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage the government to face this issue head on.  Instead 
of getting engulfed in a debate about a pan-American currency, 
which is a fine debate to have at some point, let us address the 
things we can do something about to not only improve the 
productivity of the Canadian workforce and make our businesses 
more productive but to put more money into people's pockets, to 
reward them for the job they have done in balancing Canada's 
budget, to reward them for creating the wealth that makes Canada 
one of the greatest countries in the world to live in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people should be rewarded.  In so doing we will find that 
our dollar will start to strengthen.  My friends in the Bloc, in 
the Liberal Party, in the Conservative Party and in the NDP would 
agree that if we ever had a debate on a pan-American currency and 
decided for some reason to actually proceed with a pan-American 
currency, it would be an awful leap to go from 65 cents Canadian 
to a full $1 and not have all kinds of dislocation as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, why do we not take some steps with the tools we 
already have to improve the strength of the Canadian economy and 
thereby the Canadian dollar?  Why do we not start to cut taxes? 
Why do we not pay down the debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a golden opportunity with the last budget. 
What did it do?  It blew it.  Instead of taking what would have 
been a very large surplus and using it to start to cut taxes in a 
meaningful way, it dramatically increased spending.  Its spending 
budget was $104.5 billion.  Instead of sticking to that budget it 
decided to go over budget by almost $8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were in the private sector and did something like that, I 
would be kicking stones down the road and without a job. However, 
each and every year the government goes over budget.  It raised 
next year's spending projections by $4 billion.  It goes on and 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the tools to begin to address the problem of 
a weak Canadian currency.  It simply refuses to act.  Despite all 
the rhetoric we heard from the finance minister when he was on 
this side of the House and pursuing the Liberal leadership, the 
government has the tools and it refuses to use them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now all of a sudden the spectre of a pan-American currency is 
raised as some way to get us out of this mess.  We say that 
debate is much too premature.  We do not need to have that 
discussion today.  In fact, we think it takes the heat off 
government which for too long has delayed dealing with the issue 
of productivity and strengthening the dollar.  We would much 
rather see it address this issue head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked a lot about the failure of the government's 
record.  It is a record it should be embarrassed about.  I simply 
ask my friends across the way to not take my word for it. Let me 
quote from people who watch the performance of the government. 
Here is a March 5 press release from Nesbitt Burns: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's poor productivity performance is the result of 
confiscatory and uncompetitive tax rates—and dramatic tax cuts 
are urgently needed in order to boast economic activity, job 
creation and income growth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all kinds of quotes from the Conference Board of Canada, 
CIBC, Wood Gundy, and on and on they go, about the horrible 
performance of the government when it comes to productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not only criticize.  I will offer some concrete solutions 
on what to do about this problem.  The first thing we should do 
is not get sidetracked on this debate about a pan-American 
currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing we should do is take the surpluses we have and 
instead of spending them on all kinds of ridiculous programs, as 
the government does each and every year— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Like on health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  My friend across the way says “health 
care”.  No, I am not talking about health care.  I am talking 
about regional development grants which the government uses year 
after year despite the fact that the auditor general and many of 
the pro-business groups in the country find them completely 
distortionary and completely wasteful.  They actually do much 
more harm than they do good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we freeze the level of spending at $104.5 billion and 
reallocate money within that envelope toward higher priority 
programs like health care, we argue the government would be able 
to run up some large surpluses and use those to start the process 
of giving Canadians tax relief.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will argue it gave tax relief.  If we look at the 
numbers and calculate the tax relief the government gave against 
the tax increases it brought in, we find that over the next three 
years Canadians will be $2.2 billion worse off.  That is no 
solution.  We need to have dramatic net tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are advocating $26 billion in tax relief, which 
would amount to $4,600 for the average single income earner with 
a family of four.  This would be a tremendous amount of money 
left in the pockets of Canadian taxpayers.  That money could be 
used to spend on things they want to spend it on.  That would 
help our productivity.  We need $17 billion to pay down the 
record high levels of debt in Canada today of $580 billion.  We 
need to start paying that down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of getting into the argument about a pan-American 
currency, instead of trying to hide behind the very feeble 
arguments that we found in the KPMG report which came out the 
other day, we urge the government to face the issue head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to give Canadians a break.  They are the ones who 
balance the budget.  They are the ones who produce the wealth in 
the country.  Let us give them a break.  Let us not continue to 
find ways to waste this money like the government always does, 
without fail.  No matter what government it is, Liberal or Tory, 
it seems to find a way to waste it.  Let us give that money back 
to taxpayers.  They are the ones who balance the budget.  They 
are the ones that deserve to benefit from the money going to the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
to the arguments of our Reform Party colleague and I was under 
the impression he agreed we should study the issue but then it 
became clear that he wished there were other priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to answer my questions. Recently, our 
dollar has been falling and this helped Canadian companies in 
the natural resources area to maintain their export levels. 
However, as the dollar falls, other businesses in Quebec and 
Canada see the cost of importing raw materials and finished 
products rise. Our economy is not just based on primary 
products.  Our economy is more diversified. 
We have problems with the rate of exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider hockey players, for instance. Earlier, another 
member talked about the symbolic importance of a currency for 
national pride. Now in our national sport, hockey, players want 
to be paid in U.S. dollars. I think something is wrong and we 
should ask ourselves questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Executives of large businesses also often ask to be paid in U.S. 
dollars. Why? Because our dollar can be worth 66 cents today and 
only 64 cents a year later. This represents a loss of salary of 
almost 3 to 4% for someone who is paid in Canadian dollars 
compared to U.S. dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the long term development plans of a business 
wishing to export to the American market in five years. 
How much will the Canadian dollar be worth then? Let us go back 
five years. Our dollar was worth 70 cents. It lost about 12%, 
but regained some of its value. How can we have long term export 
plans to the American market in those circumstances? We have 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues we should address and I will conclude on 
that. Should we have a common North American or pan-American 
currency? Should we have a floating dollar or a dollar on a par? 
Should we have new monetary instruments? The bottom line is there 
are solutions but we will find them only if we raise issues. This 
is why the Bloc Quebecois is suggesting that a committee be 
struck. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I recognize and agree 
with many of the points my colleague from the Bloc has made.  I 
think we need to have this discussion somewhere down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that in getting involved in this discussion the 
heat will come off the government for its disastrous track record 
when it comes to the Canadian dollar.  The government has allowed 
the productivity of the country to fall because of its high tax, 
high debt policies.  As a result we see the ability of many 
Canadian companies being in peril when it comes to competing 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to fix this is not to let the government off the hook by 
becoming involved in some wide ranging debate about monetary 
union and that sort of thing. 
The way to deal with it is to go back and undo the disastrous 
policies of the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need any more high tax policies.  We have to reverse 
the trend to regulate the Canadian economy to the point where 
business almost chokes on the amount of paperwork it has to go 
through in the course of a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying the emphasis is the bone of contention of the 
Reform Party.  We need to put emphasis on fixing the fiscal 
policies of the country.  Then we will see a stronger dollar and 
at that point have this debate in full. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member for Medicine Hat connected the standard of 
living with the low dollar on several occasions in his speech. 
Would he not agree that the standard of living is actually tied 
to purchasing power as well as to the level of the dollar? As a 
matter of fact it is more tied to purchasing power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the member has to do is travel to Italy, England, any 
European country or Japan, for that matter, to find that the real 
cost of consumer goods, particularly essential goods, is far 
higher in comparison to Canada.  I am talking about rent, 
foodstuffs and whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is probably the reason we are still considered by the 
United Nations as one of the richest countries in the world.  Our 
standard of living is very high. Even though our dollar is low 
relative to other countries, its purchasing power in Canada is 
still very high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument he presented, in particular with respect to the low 
dollar, does not hang together very well.  What we are talking 
about is that when we have a low dollar relative to other nations 
it attracts investment in the country and encourages the buying 
of exports.  It is a net positive thing rather than a negative 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pose a direct question to the hon. member on the 
suggestion that somehow the Americans would agree to set their 
dollar aside for some kind of pan-American special currency. Does 
he not agree that is pie in the sky, a total dream?  The 
Americans are tough guys in the world when it comes to monetary 
policy, fiscal policy and economics, and there is no way they 
would ever give any time to such an idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, as the member knows, 
never is a long time.  In a sense I think the debate is 
irrelevant.  At this point we are far from being in a position 
where the Canadian public would even consider having a debate 
about it.  I do not see the point of going down this road at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The far more important issue, and the issue that is important to 
the pocketbooks of Canadians today, is the fact that our low 
productivity means we have a lower standard of living and that is 
reflected in a low dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend has said that a low dollar is a positive thing.  I say 
to him that if a low dollar is a positive thing we should hope 
for a 40 cent dollar, a 20 cent dollar, a 10 cent dollar.  Then 
we could imagine how prosperous we would really be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard about the KPMG study where the government is saying low 
wages are a great reason to come to Canada.  The government 
should be bloody well ashamed of that argument.  It is 
embarrassing to the government and to members across the way that 
they would trot that out as a reason for people to come to 
Canada.  I hope they apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.   As far as I am concerned bloody well is not appropriate 
language for the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think you should rule, Madam Speaker, that the member is out 
of order and should ask him to apologize.  We are on television. 
School is out completely in Ontario and in many other parts of 
the country.  Children are watching this broadcast and I do not 
think bloody well is appropriate.

there are always two ways of attaining one's goals in life: get 
there directly through tax reform, and he knows very well that 
the present government does not seem to want to move quickly in 
that direction; or get there indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one wants to establish a balance of power during 
negotiations, this debate about striking a committee to consider 
the matter will certainly put us in the position of having to 
carry out a tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the debate is badly aligned.  If the motion is well 
drafted, and I believe that it is, it contains no mention of a 
common currency. 
It talks about a pan-American monetary union.  This in no way 
excludes national currencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member if he in fact makes a distinction 
between a common currency and a pan-American monetary union that 
retains national currencies as is, with a strict variation in 
the rate of exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the motion has been well drafted but very badly 
understood by all members of the House, and I would ask him to 
provide some clarification. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I guess I see the 
actual motion as a bit of a distraction from the important issue 
of the day which is that Canadians are seeing their standard of 
living eroded.  We see the government coming up with trumped up, 
very feeble arguments as to why that is somehow a good thing and 
the way to attract business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hate to see the debate get off track and get away from 
that when the government has something to account for.  That is 
why I am not really opposed to having the discussion but opposed 
to having any amount of emphasis put on it at this time.  It may 
be a discussion for somewhere down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no magic bullet to fixing this problem.  There is no 
single solution that will fix it.  The best way to address the 
issue of a weak currency is to ensure that Canadian business and 
investment is competitive.  The way to do that is to start to cut 
taxes and pay down debt.  That is the way to address this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I feel like I have been watching a ping-pong match and 
wondering who the players are because we have a member of the 
Conservative Party saying this is not about common currency.  We 
have a member of the Reform Party saying the Canadian public does 
not want to have this debate but he thinks it should go to a 
committee anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really quite bizarre but it has helped me today in one 
way. I finally discovered what the united alternative is.  I see 
the member for York South—Weston who would be their leader. Let 
me tell the member what he will be leading.  He will be the 
Conservatives and the Reformers, and the bed will be awfully 
crowded because it will be full of separatists.  It is truly mind 
boggling.  That is what we are hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take this debate today and play it back for the 
members opposite just to see how much they have gone from here to 
there during today's debate.  It is quite remarkable. The member 
for Saint John must be shaking her head.  She is coming out to 
give some leadership to her caucus colleague, to say “you didn't 
really say we were going to support this”.  She is probably 
having apoplectic attacks over the fact that someone in her 
caucus has committed her caucus to vote in favour of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would that bother a true Canadian?  My colleague from 
Wentworth—Burlington hit the nail on the head.  For someone else 
to suggest there may be a hidden agenda is bizarre.  What is the 
driving force behind the Bloc every day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It's the Bloc.

paycheques to people who want to destroy the country.  It is 
absolutely amazing.

cheque.  I am a duly elected member just as he is.  I do my job 
and I ask him to withdraw his words. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Once again I advise 
members to please use their words very judiciously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thought I did.  I 
made the point and I will make it again.  Only in a country like 
Canada, where our dedication to democratic principles is clearly 
the highest in the world, would this institution allow for 
paycheques to be handed out to individuals who are dedicated to 
the destruction of this place and this country.  If they want to 
take offence that is their problem.  It is really quite amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is this crowded bed.  It is clear to me that the 
so-called hidden agenda is not really so hidden.  Their 
counterpart, the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Bouchard, a former 
cabinet minister in a Conservative government, has said that he 
is dedicated to creating winning conditions.  Those would be 
winning conditions so that he could win a referendum, so that he 
could lead the province of Quebec out of the federation of 
Canada. That is their goal.  No one can deny that.  They can rise 
all day long if they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Bloc members have been elected by certain people in the 
province of Quebec I presume that they support Mr. Bouchard's 
position.  If not they should rise on a point of order and tell 
us they do not agree with their premier.  Clearly they are 
attempting to create winning conditions so they can take their 
province out of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is supposedly not about common currency.  It is 
about a united pan-American monetary policy without currency. We 
will have funny money, Canadian Tire money.  Maybe they will 
accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What is wrong with Canadian Tire? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Nothing is wrong with Canadian Tire. 
It is great.  This member would obviously try to build an economy 
on a foundation of coupons.  We have a policy on the books being 
debated that we should convert to a system of coupons.  It would 
not surprise me if that is where the supposed would-be leader of 
the united alternative tried to lead this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that the Bloc is interested only in 
undermining anything Canadian.  It would undermine anything that 
stands for principles of democracy in this country.  That is its 
goal.  It wants to destroy the country.  It is in its interests 
for it to pass a motion if it believes or subscribes to that 
particular policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be soft and gentle.  Let us send it to committee.  It 
really will not hurt anybody. It is interesting.  This is an 
opposition day.  This is the opposition's opportunity to put on 
the floor of the House of Commons issues of concern to its 
constituencies, to its party, to the people of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would it not talk about some of the things that concern all 
parliamentarians if it is doing its job on an equal footing?  Why 
would it not talk about poverty? It is a problem.  We in the 
government have to acknowledge that. It is a problem that we 
intend to do something about.  We will work with the Canadian 
people toward ending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would it not talk about housing programs?  We know what the 
provinces have done across this land.  I know what happened the 
minute Mike Harris took office in Ontario.  He cancelled all 
social housing in the entire province.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not have a debate about that?  Maybe it is time the 
federal government got back involved along with the provinces, 
along with the area municipalities, along with the regions, along 
with the non-profit housing corporations, along with the 
charitable sector and along with the private sector.  It is time 
we got involved in housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not have a substantive debate over something like 
that?  Opposition members want to put forward nonsensical motions 
the Canadian public could care less about.  It is concerned about 
those issues that hit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the Reform for a minute.  I do not often do 
that.  I will take a minute because I was very interested to hear 
the member for Medicine Hat say Canadians are not producing. It 
is fair game for these members opposite to stand up in this place 
and take their best shot at the government.  Go ahead, we are big 
boys and big girls.  We can handle it.  They have trouble taking 
it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would that respected member, the finance critic for his 
party, criticize Canadians and say that they are not producing? 
Why would he lead an attack on the Canadian people?  The truth is 
the Canadian people are hardworking, honest, dedicated and 
community oriented.  We have a wonderful country with wonderful 
people in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to be in the interests of members of the opposition to 
stand up and denigrate Canadians right across this land. I fail 
to understand it.  He then said Canadians do not understand what 
we are debating here today.  I wrote it down the minute he said 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the member what they do understand.  They understand 
they are not Americans.  They understand they are not 
separatists.  They understand they are not extremists.  They are 
Canadians.  They understand and they do not want to be any of 
those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Conservative member made reference to the ides of March.  It 
reminded me that we are only two days away from St. Patrick's 
Day, which then reminded me of that wonderful photo op that 
occurred when Ronald Reagan and then Prime Minister Mulroney sang 
“When Irish Eyes are Smiling”. There was a wonderful sense of 
warmth and feeling in this country as Mulroney climbed into bed 
with the elephant on one side and the separatist on the other 
side.  This is clearly déjà vu all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories will support this motion.  That is remarkable.  The 
Tories are actually agreeing that we should go to committee and 
discuss what amounts to the break-up of this nation.  I find it 
astounding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Every sparrow that falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I am not sure what the member means by 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is uniting to support a motion because its 
members see an opportunity to derail and to set the agenda.  The 
NDP has not said it will support this, so there is a tad of 
common sense on the left extreme in this place.  I am pleased to 
say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this section why are those members doing this? They want to 
drive the agenda.  They want to throw a cog into the wheel of 
government any way they can.  It does not matter.  They have 
principles and if we do not like them, they have others.  It is 
not a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have to mess things up in this place by supporting a Bloc 
motion, one of the most nonsensical ideas I have ever 
heard of, they are not beyond doing that. They will lower 
themselves to whatever level of expectation or non-expectation, 
and the Tories agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they not?  If they were prepared to go dancing with 
Mr. Bouchard, why would they not climb into the sack with these 
guys here?  It does not surprise me at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a regionalization of the political spectrum 
across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who did that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B> Brian Mulroney did that.  I thank the 
member for asking the question.  Keep throwing me more little 
tidbits.  It helps.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have regionalization.  We have a western based party that is 
so confused it has actually gone to the rank and file in the 
Reform Party and said it wants to close shop.  It does not think 
it can go any further than it has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an interesting opportunity when I was an observer delegate 
on behalf of the federal Liberal Party at the united alternative 
conference.  It was like sticking a thousand pins in my eyes for 
the entire weekend, but I did it and saw the most incredible 
thing I could not believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Jean Allaire, a committed separatist, stood to speak to the 
gathered throng of some 1,500 mostly Reformers, there was a 
standing ovation.  Can anyone imagine a standing ovation?  Then 
Rodrigue Biron, a noted economist from the province of Quebec who 
is also a committed separatist, addressed this august or not so 
august body, and once again a standing ovation occurred.  I could 
not understand how this could happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last couple of weeks I travelled throughout the west on 
a task force meeting with folks from Richmond, Vancouver, Calgary 
and Winnipeg.  There are no separatists out there.  They are all 
true, red blooded Canadians.  They believe in this land and the 
sea to sea to sea motto in spite of the fact that the political 
poobahs of the Reform Party ran those disgusting adds during the 
last election campaign.  People in western Canada want Quebec to 
stay in Canada.  Of course there are some who do not but the vast 
majority in their hearts want to keep this land strong and 
united. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite remarkable to sit at this united alternative 
conference, which I must admit was only attended by two members 
of the Conservative caucus who were there more as spies than as 
any kind of supporter.  They were not very happy and a little 
confused.  I am sure they have been whipped into shape now and 
are back in line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of the Conservative riding associations fired any of 
the delegates who attended.  They kicked them right out of the 
party.  That is called inclusiveness.  It was quite interesting. 
In a certain way I do not blame the Conservatives.  Why would 
they want to do that?   They just went through a process where 
they elected an old leader to come back and help lead them to the 
promised land.  Even though the leader of the Reform Party is 
throwing his entire party into the waste bin, at least the 
Conservative Party had the common sense not to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree in this place, even the Bloc members, their main 
goal or reason for being here is to lead their province out of 
Confederation.  They want to enter into negotiations to have a 
pan-American monetary policy.  The question has been put as to 
whether it would be the American dollar.  Would the Americans 
just sit down and say that it does not matter, that they will 
cash in their chips and start a new dollar of some kind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that happened, would that be the thin edge of the wedge that 
would eventually lead Canada to no longer having a currency, an 
identity or a position on the international monetary scene?  We 
would be seen as just sort of a hick-up on the side of some new 
pan-American dollar.  That might lead to the break-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have a Canada divided along monetary lines.  Its 
characteristics and its strengths would be totally destroyed and 
Quebec would see itself as being on its own.  Who would Quebec 
have to deal with in that event?  It would have to deal with the 
Yankees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know how many here think the Americans would tolerate 
separatism for more than a hick-up.  Not a chance.  In no 
circumstances would separatists be able to go into the hallowed 
halls of congress and debate that they should be allowed to 
separate from that body.  It just would not be accepted or 
tolerated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One Bloc member made the comment that living beside an elephant 
can be quite expensive.  It is a heck of a lot better than 
sleeping with one in case it rolls over.  That could be a little 
more than expensive.  In essence that is where this would lead us 
if we were to follow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a terrible waste of time, effort and money in this place 
and in our committee system when we should be talking to 
Canadians about what we will do for our youth, how we will help 
our young people.  I am chairing a task force on youth 
entrepreneurship.  I am honoured to do so, to be able to travel 
the country to meet with young people, to listen to their hopes 
and their dreams, to listen to what government should be doing to 
assist them in creating a future for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that young people realize economic times have 
changed.  They may not simply be able to rely on a job from a 
large company any more.  They might have to be more creative.  It 
is amazing how creative our young people are.  I met with eight 
young entrepreneurs in Regina at a round table. They told me 
their stories of how they had opened their businesses, how they 
were proud to be Canadians, and how they were proud to be young, 
working and succeeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is such a positive story to tell but all we hear is the 
doomsayers, the negatives, the Reformers, the sky is falling.  I 
have news for them.  The sky is not falling; the sky is the limit 
in this great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, should we 
laugh or cry? It would appear some people are suffering from 
microcephaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, my colleague across the way suggested sovereignist 
members from the Bloc were lucky to receive a salary. Quebec 
contributes 24% of the funds in the federal coffers. Year after 
year my riding alone sends around $400 million to Ottawa, and my 
paycheck is paid by my constituents, like every member of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is insidious on the part of my colleague opposite to suggest 
that because we are sovereignists we are lesser democrats, we do 
not do our job as well as others and we are less deserving of 
our salary. This is unacceptable, and I hope my colleague 
opposite will withdraw what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the motion introduced in this House by the Bloc is aimed 
at striking a committee to review extremely important matters 
regarding trade within the Americas. This issue deserves to be 
reviewed. It is extremely timely, which is being raised not only 
here, but also in Argentina and in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that for years Panama's currency has been at par 
with the US dollar. Of course, its trade situation is very 
special because of the Panama Canal. 
In my previous life as a computer consultant, I visited Panama 
and realized that using the American dollar made trade a lot 
simpler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be the same here if we had the tools to prevent 
exchange rates from fluctuating? These are questions we have. 
They are important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Liberal member, and all his Liberal 
colleagues who took part in the debate today, would be well 
advised, instead of showing their ignorance of facts, to let 
such a committee do what it takes to inform us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B> Mr. Speaker, with a pan-American<B> </B>monetary 
agreement, Canada would no doubt have to adopt the American 
currency or a new currency, a new, completely new dollar system, 
which would be dominated by the American political interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that new system, Canada would give up its national 
monetary policy, which is an integral part of its sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about giving up sovereignty.  This is about destroying 
the country.  I do not care if the member is happy with his

and destroy Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a 
very solemn moment for me.  I have been sitting here in silence 
for some 20 minutes while the member illustrated to me, to the 
House of Commons and to the people of Canada why there is a 
separatist party and why there is a Reform Party.  I did not 
create it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the west, the people of Quebec and the people of Atlantic 
Canada have tolerated for too many years being denigrated, being 
minimized and being insulted.  It went all the way from Trudeau 
and his famous one finger salute to his denigrating statements 
against farmers.  It continued with Mulroney and his arrogance 
and his father knows best attitude over the whole country, and it 
continues.  I humbly want to say that illustrates why the Reform 
is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be good advice for Liberal members to watch the speech 
on television again, to review it and ask themselves the heart 
rending question: “Do you win friends by ripping into them the 
way the member did?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a speaker at the united alternative who told us about the 
concerns of Quebec.  He saw in our group some hope for solving 
the problem and staying in the country.  We gave him a proud 
standing ovation and I would do it again.  This member who was 
present has it all wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was fumbling around 
looking for some Kleenex and I am sorry I could not find any. Are 
members aware of what the separatist said at the united 
alternative conference?  He closed his remarks with these words: 
“My language, my country”, and the member across gave him a 
standing ovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Canadian it is my view that no one who believes in the 
country should give a standing ovation to an avowed separatist 
who came before a group legitimately trying to start a new party 
because the old one is dead.  I understand that.  Obviously they 
have to do something.  For them to give a standing ovation is 
nothing more than an embarrassment to the people they represent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too have a question for the quiet, shy, unassuming, 
modest, very low key, low profile member from Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mississauga.  I want to know whether 
the member will maintain his position of being against the common 
currency for the next few weeks or months because Liberals tend 
to speak one way and then suddenly change their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the promise against wage and price controls in 1974 
when Trudeau said “Zap, you are frozen”.  What did he do?  He 
brought them in.  I think of the GST.  The member for York 
South—Weston is here.  He campaigned against the GST.  The GST 
is still here.  I think of the free trade debate and all of the 
sanctimonious speeches made on this side of the House when they 
were here, and the free trade accord is still with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long will it be before the member changes his mind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Scarborough—for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what is the problem? 
Scarborough. Toronto.  It is Mississauga.  It is a beautiful 
city.  It is the fifth largest city in the country.  It has a 
wonderful mayor and a wonderful council.  It is a great place. It 
never rains or snows in Mississauga.  What else can I say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to the hon. member that I do not have the longevity 
in this place that he does and I cannot answer for what happened 
in the era of Mr. Trudeau, but I can tell him that when I was 
elected in the last election I did not run on cancelling the GST. 
Not this member.  This member will not run on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe most Canadian subscribe to what this party stands for. 
It was obvious in the election results. 
We have eliminated the deficit, no thanks to the Tory party.  We 
have the country working again.  We have created 1.6 million new 
jobs since we took office.

it is helpful to the efforts of Canadians right across the 
country, who are trying to unify this country, for him to be so 
partisan and so disrespectful of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well over one and a half million Canadians in the province of 
Quebec voted for the Bloc Quebecois.  As distasteful as he may 
find it that there are members of the House who believe in a 
separate Quebec, they were given a mandate by about one and a 
half million Canadians in that province.  Surely he should 
respect the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I read between the lines, between the rhetoric, is an 
anti-French attitude that is simply not helpful.  Surely the 
member from Mississauga owes the people of Quebec an apology for 
some of the disrespectful comments he made a few moments ago.  I 
am wondering whether the hon. member is speaking with the 
authority of the Government of Canada.  I noticed that the House 
leader was here.  The least he could do is—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite amazing to 
hear this member make remarks like that.  If we want to research 
<I>Hansard</I> we will find three words uttered by that very 
member.  These are not my words; they were his words.  He said 
“Separatists are traitors”.  Is he telling me that he would 
make a remark like that and somehow be denigrating the people of 
Quebec?  That is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time have I spoken against the people of Quebec.  I speak 
against the Bloc.  I will always speak against the Bloc because 
they are trying to destroy my country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future leader of the united alternative had better watch 
out.  As I have pointed out before, if he is on their hockey

to be struck in order to consider the possibility of the 
creation on a pan-American monetary union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious issue and I am very proud to speak to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on a common currency for the three Americas should 
start right now. While the Prime Minister of Canada and the 
governor of the Bank of Canada oppose this concept, the deputy 
premier of Quebec, Mr. Bernard Landry, who was an adamant 
proponent of the free trade agreement in 1988, is supporting the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois and its leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FTA, followed by NAFTA have given Canada and Quebec a better 
access to the American market, and exports from Quebec have 
risen annually by 7% or 8%. Mr. Bernard Landry was right, and 
this trade agreement was fitting nicely in our agenda for Quebec 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a common currency is another political and 
economic issue that should be dealt with seriously, in the 
context of discussions and negotiations over international trade 
agreements and more particularly in the context of a sovereign 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois is requesting that a committee be 
set up to study this important issue. Even if the Prime Minister 
of Canada and his finance minister are completely opposed to 
this, all members in this House should do something concrete and 
demonstrate that a common pan-American currency is a most 
realistic project that should be examined right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Bloc Quebecois is that a sovereign Quebec 
should keep the Quebec-Canada monetary union, but we should go 
further than that in our thinking. We know that sovereignists 
are for change. 
They are open to this worldwide debate, contrary to the federal 
Liberals who do not want to move away from the status quo and 
who refuse any kind of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the position taken by the Liberals in the 
1988 debate on free trade. They were against the idea, including 
the then premier of Ontario, David Peterson. In 1999, it is the 
same scenario. Ontario Liberals are opposed to change and show 
no openness to prepare for the next 10, 15 or 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago, the Bloc Quebecois, a democratic party that 
listens to its grassroots members, formed a task force to 
examine the place of a sovereign Quebec in the world. The issue 
of a common currency will also be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I support the creation of a common currency, as do 
my colleague from Charlesbourg and our leader. 
I am still convinced that, by the year 2020, three currencies 
will dominate the world market, namely the U.S. dollar, the 
Eurocoin and the Japanese yen. Twenty years is not a long time. 
Therefore, we must prepare ourselves for that economic 
possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House of Commons must follow our lead immediately 
and consider the possible creation of a common currency. The 
federal Liberals still have closed minds and are incapable of 
dealing with such an important issue. They just refuse to get 
away from their old conservative way of thinking, from their 
unhealthy obsession with the status quo and from their narrow 
vision of Canadian nationalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand them. 
How can we expect them to be proactive and to renew their 
rhetoric when they are led by a man who is mostly inspired by 
the Trudeau philosophy of the 1970s? And what about the position 
of the New Democrats, who are also stuck on their old 
centralizing paradigms that are very close to those of the 
federal Liberals who are unable to have a world vision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has taken the lead. Our members want to talk 
about this issue right now. We are a sovereignist party that 
anticipates the exceptional interdependent relationship of a 
sovereign Quebec with its other economic partners throughout the 
world. We are a party that looks forward to the future, not an 
old fashioned party like the Liberal Party opposite.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question of the 
last member who spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a very important motion and certainly one which 
is worthy of debate.  I am not one of those who believes we 
should not be discussing this issue.  This is probably an issue 
which will be the subject of discussion in the House and in the 
country for the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the last member who spoke said, it is very clear that we are 
moving into a new community in the world where there will be 
three major currencies.  The establishment of the Eurodollar has 
established conditions where in fact it will be very difficult 
for other currencies, smaller currencies, those that are not part 
of a block, to survive, whether it is the United States currency 
or the European currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are interested are very concerned about this. 
However, I think that the problems Bloc members have in terms of 
bringing up this issue are several. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the paradox of wanting to jump immediately into a 
Pan-American currency over which they will have no control, when 
they would be leaving a currency which they presently, through 
the Minister of Finance who comes from Quebec and through their 
members of parliament from Quebec, have a direct interest in 
preserving. 
I do not understand that paradox from their perspective.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member another question.  For those of us who are 
looking seriously at this issue, and who recognize that it is an 
issue, we realize that we are going to have to deal with the 
Americans.  We are going to have to deal with the American 
Congress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite and every member of the House knows that 
the American Congress today acts in a very unilateral way.  Does 
the member seriously think that it is in the interests of 
Quebecers to abandon a system in which they have a direct role in 
participating in the decision making process to go to a system 
where the Americans will not allow us to have any input?  Or does 
the member actually believe that we will get a seat on the 
federal reserve board of this new currency? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to see that 
there is at least one hon. member who is open to the possibility 
of a committee being struck. The pan-American currency is a 
project for the future. We have to talk about it. This is our 
position and we want to set up a committee. Is there anything 
more democratic that a committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have chosen to address today the issue of 
Quebec's sovereignty. Let us be serious here. What we are 
proposing today is becoming a more and more distinct possibility 
in a global environment. The hon. member opposite, who is the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, should know this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Mississauga West early on in his speech 
today severely insulted me along with many western Canadians.  He 
also gravely inflicted damage on the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is my understanding that we are in questions and comments 
following the speech of a member of the Bloc.  Is this relevant 
to that speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The parliamentary secretary is 
correct. The hon. member making his comments is supposed to make 
the comments and questions on the speech just heard.  I am sure 
he was getting to that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was coming to that 
point, precisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The records of this House are meant to reflect what went on in 
the House and to reflect what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand once again to ask the member from the Bloc if the debate 
today from the Liberal side does not make him want to cry out, as 
I do, for an apology from the Liberal government for what it has 
said and done to the people of Quebec and to the people of 
western Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure 
that I rise to demand one too. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just 
learned a few moments ago that, according to a poll the FM 93 
radio station in Quebec City held during one of its shows, 91% 
of its listeners are in favour of a pan-American monetary union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, my question to my hon. colleague from Lotbinière is the 
following: Is he surprised at the results compiled by the FM 93 
radio station? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, radio listeners in Quebec 
City are open people who believe in the future, so I am not a 
bit surprised by these results, and I am sure that if such a 
poll had been held throughout Quebec, its results would have 
been positive. It just goes to prove that Quebeckers are all for 
change and not for the status quo, unlike the federal Liberals 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 6.15 p.m. it is my duty to 
interrupt proceedings and put forthwith any question necessary 
to dispose of the business of supply.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am going to 
carry on with my question to the interlocutor for the Metis about 
first nations housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more first nations are forced to live off reserve for 
social and economic reasons, but it does not matter where they 
live.  Either on reserve or off reserve, conditions are 
appalling, they are disgraceful, they are dangerous, they are 
cold, they are unheated.  They are third world conditions as 
confirmed by the United Nations.  These are Canadian conditions 
if one is a native person in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a responsibility for accessible 
social housing, but in particular is responsible for first 
nations people in this country.  Our first nations people should 
not be dying in garbage dumps in Ontario or freezing to death on 
city streets.  There is enough wealth in this country for 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a letter today from the Lubicon which states that in 
the richest province in one of the richest countries the Lubicon 
live without even the necessities of life, such as running water 
and sewage disposal.  Families of 10 to 15 people are crowded 
into a single, uninsulated house with no money to repair even a 
broken window.  Tuberculosis, diabetes and cancer rates have 
soared.  With 95% of the adults unemployed, social ills have 
taken an enormous toll.  All the while, over $9 billion worth of 
resources have been extracted from Lubicon lands.  This is a 
similar situation faced by first nations people all over the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could be avoided by making the “Gathering Strength” 
document actually work to treat the first nations as if they are 
partners, not as if it is a master-servant relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The booklet of the National Aboriginal Housing Association of 
May 1998 asks for the transfer of housing to be halted.  The need 
for housing can be justified either as a fundamental human right 
recognized by international law or as an aboriginal right 
specific to the aboriginal peoples in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is signatory to many international covenants and 
conventions, including the United Nations charter.  It is 
involved in the working group which is drafting the universal 
declaration on indigenous rights.  These covenants and 
conventions were fully discussed in a paper entitled “First Our 
Lands, Now Our Homes” in response to the urban and rural native 
housing cutbacks in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no reason that we cannot properly house the 
first nations people of this land.  They are not in an equal 
situation and they need housing as a basic human right so they 
can attain equality in other areas.

basic premise of the question some time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately far too many aboriginal people across Canada live 
in very poor conditions.  We recognize that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is worth noting that our government has put in place 
a government-wide action plan that addresses the key challenges 
facing all aboriginal people whether they live on or off reserve. 
This action plan, known as Gathering Strength, was announced more 
than a year ago and includes partnerships as one of its key 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recognizes that a new partnership with aboriginal people is a 
prerequisite if we are going to effect real change. It also 
recognizes the importance of involving other partners such as the 
provincial governments.  In fact it is the provinces that are 
particularly important players when it comes to issues facing 
aboriginal people living off reserve since they have the primary 
responsibility here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is important to stress that Gathering 
Strength was developed in the spirit of working together to find 
practical solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing on the theme of partnership, the federal interlocutor 
has actively engaged the aboriginal groups to listen to their 
ideas and concerns.  More than ever, the interlocutor has been an 
effective advocate within this government for Metis and off 
reserve aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year he has met a number of times with the 
aboriginal organizations representing all aboriginal peoples. The 
interlocutor has personally met with over 20 organizations on a 
bilateral basis and a great number more through multilateral 
fora.  His door has always been open to aboriginal people and it 
remains so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These meetings have resulted in several key accomplishments, for 
example, a number of signed agreements, an aboriginal trade 
mission to Latin America, and the hosting of a round table 
discussion on urban aboriginal issues in Regina, which is a 
first.  All participants have found these meetings to be 
incredibly useful and necessary if we are going to make a 
difference.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE BUDGET 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am trying to get to the bottom of why this government 
decided to spend $3.6 million advertising its federal budget. I 
raised this question after we received this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were shocked and appalled as were many Canadians across this 
country, especially Canadians who are facing enormous 
difficulties gaining access to quality health care services. 
These are people who are in line for hip surgery, who are waiting 
for MRIs and for personal care homes, who are struggling to make 
ends meet in order to care for elderly family members and for 
needy children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I hope Canadians will get some clarification on this very 
important question.  I hope the parliamentary secretary is not 
going to simply say that this is what governments always do and 
it is doing a great service for Canadians.  These $3.6 million 
ads that were taken out do not offer one iota of public service. 
They are sheer propaganda and speak only to the fact that this 
must be about political crisis management and not about 
worthwhile and meaningful remedies for our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the budget was tabled in the House there has been 
incredible coverage.  There have been over 750 references to this 
budget in the major media outlets.  This does not even include 
many of the weeklies.  I am sure the tally comes up to well over 
1,000 hits in the media just in terms of the health care budget 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that 10 days leading up to the budget the 
government decided to leak out bits and pieces of the budget so 
that people were inundated with news about what was in store for 
Canadians.  We heard that there was $2.5 billion for health. Then 
came the big leak to Canadians about $11.5 billion. Canadians had 
it up to here about what was going to be in the budget and what 
was in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want to see $3.6 million spent on advertising 
this government's political agenda.  They want to see every penny 
go into health care where it is absolutely needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would that $3.6 million have bought?  By our calculations 
it would have bought 150 personal home care beds.  It would have 
paid many times over for training of emergency nurses.  It would 
have paid for an MRI and then some.  All these things are 
absolutely needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the minister, the parliamentary secretary and 
the government that they listen to the voices of Canadians on 
this critical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly want to reflect on what has happened in the 
province of Manitoba where the Conservative government decided to 
spend $500,000 advertising its so-called health care agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me paraphrase the words of the Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> and 
apply them to this government. 
The Minister of Health here in Ottawa should scrap the 
government's $3.6 million campaign for health care reforms.  The 
move would show that a new firm hand is now steering health care 
in this country.  It would show that the ruling Liberals can get 
their priorities straight.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the message Canadians send to the government.  That is 
the message the Liberals ought to hear. It is far more important 
to deal with the health care needs of Canadians than to try to 
manage the political difficulties of this present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One really has to ask the last question of all which is if this 
budget was more about substance and less about smoke and mirrors, 
would this money actually have been necessary?  Would we have to 
spend taxpayers' money to sell the news to Canadians that this 
government is finally moving on health care?  In fact the 
government is merely trying to recover lost ground and put back 
some of the money it has taken out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to an answer from the government on this critical 
issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK297"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat 
Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for pointing out that indeed this budget has received a 
significant amount of media attention.  In fact there have been 
thousands of hits as the hon. member described, thousands of 
placements in the media.  This budget has been a very, very 
powerful good news message. The media has been anxious to analyse 
its content exactly for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member quite rightly stood up to say that we are always 
interested in making sure that the money is spent wisely, that it 
goes to the purpose for which it was intended. I do not have any 
reservations in saying that $3.6 million spent on a budget of 
approximately $150 billion as a percentage of the actual budget 
is not a huge amount of money.  It is very important however that 
it be spent wisely to make sure that all Canadians understand the 
details of exactly what is in the budget.  This is what affects 
them most deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member pointed out that in her opinion $3.6 million 
would provide approximately 150 chronic care beds.  I would 
simply ask the member to do the calculation as to what $11.5 
billion will do to the health care system in terms of providing 
chronic care beds, MRI and other equipment, additional nursing 
staff in hospitals, and additional recruitment opportunities for 
doctors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what this budget does. It provides $11.5 billion 
in additional health care funds to the provinces over the next 
five year period.  That is quite a substantial amount of money. 
In comparison to $3.6 million, quite frankly it is a very 
powerful addition to the health care system.  That does not 
include the additional funds that have been put in place for 
existing federal government programs.
