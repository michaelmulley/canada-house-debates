</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
were all shocked and saddened to hear about the senseless tragedy 
that occurred yesterday afternoon in Taber, Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our condolences go out to the family and friends of Jason Lang 
who was killed yesterday during the shootings. Our prayers are 
with the family and friends of Shane Christmas who remains in 
serious condition in hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parent I can only imagine the terror that is felt at 
hearing there has been a shooting at your child's school. I can 
understand the pain the people of Taber are feeling today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parent I insist that our schools be what we intend them to 
be:  places of learning, places where we can send our children 
knowing they will be safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of this House I am reminded that we must all work 
together to ensure conditions that produce such horrific violence 
are eliminated from our communities. As Jason Lang's father said 
today, “Lots of things need to be changed and lots of things 
need to be healed”.  Over the coming days and months I know that 
all members will work to ensure that what can be done will be 
done.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>GASOLINE PRICES 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, gas 
prices are getting a lot of attention these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is Canadians enjoy some of the lowest gas prices in 
the world. Without government taxes, gas is as cheap as it was 20 
years ago. The only thing that has changed dramatically is the 
amount Canadians are being taxed at the pumps.  The government is 
the real villain in gas pricing with over 50% of the price of a 
litre of gasoline going to government taxes, yet virtually none 
of that money is returned to my province for road infrastructure 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go into a grocery store or a restaurant I see the before 
tax price of the product.  Why can gas retailers not do the same 
for their customers?  Why do retailers not advertise their 
gasoline prices on a before tax basis so Canadians can plainly 
see how much of their gas dollar is going into the government's 
tax tank? Why are gas retailers willing to take the heat for 
government taxation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need tax cuts now so they can get more distance for 
their dollar.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I recently hosted the Prime Minister's caucus task force on youth 
entrepreneurship along with my colleagues from the 
Kitchener-Waterloo region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force spent its time in Kitchener speaking with young 
entrepreneurs, their mentors, service providers and members of 
the private sector.  Topics such as education, finances, 
resources and government support were all discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Task force members visited a number of companies run by young 
entrepreneurs from the Kitchener-Waterloo area.  We visited Joe 
Merlihan of the Woolwich <I>Observer</I>, Jen Herzog of 
Distinctive Stamp Design and John Rochetta of The Beat Goes On. 
In addition, some members dropped by the Business Enterprise 
Centre and Kor Gallery and Studios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young entrepreneurs we met were dynamic, intelligent 
individuals who have used their talents in creative and unique 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the many young entrepreneurs from across the country 
who are working hard to make their dreams come true.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to inform the House that the residents of 
the township of Brock located within my riding of 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock received a big boost with a $168,000 
federal grant from the Department of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This grant created the funding to establish the new community 
employment resource centre located in the Beaverton town hall. 
The centre officially opens its doors to the public tomorrow, 
Friday, April 30, 1999.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task of locating a job can be very difficult.  This centre 
will assist residents looking for employment through a number of 
services.  These services include employment counselling, job 
listings, free photocopying, faxing, computer use and the listing 
of college and university courses offered to upgrade their 
skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre was created through a partnership involving the 
federal government, the township of Brock, Durham College and 
other agencies.  I would like to congratulate the individuals who 
made this project work.  This centre will be a benefit not only 
to the residents but also to the whole community of Brock 
township.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week we 
celebrated the  National Volunteer Week, to recognize the 
efforts of the 7.5 million Canadians who give generously of 
their time all through the year in order to help the less 
advantaged members of our community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to highlight an individual, a Canadian 
of Hellenic origin, who was honoured by the Quebec National 
Assembly with a volunteer award for her efforts and contribution 
over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This person is Ms. Vicky Nicolakakos, a friend whom I consider 
to be a most deserving individual.  All those who know Vicky know 
her commitment and her tireless efforts in responding to the 
needs of the underprivileged, the ailing, and the troubled of our 
society.  She is an outstanding Canadian and a great role model 
for us all.

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the House 
has heard many great and eloquent speeches in its time.  Few have 
been delivered with the moral authority we heard this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Václav Havel is a very special individual.  His conscience 
called on him to suffer the trials of being a dissident.  A sense 
of duty demanded that he assume the highest political office in 
his country.  However, the greatest contribution he has made is 
to warn us that evil can only triumph when good people look away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Winston Churchill once said that the greatest virtue was 
courage.  The life of the man who spoke to us today is a model of 
courage and is a great legacy to his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, I was also pleased to hear an echo of 
many values that the Reform Party stands for and why I am here. I 
was especially moved by his demands that we recognize that the 
individual, regardless of status or wealth, is more important 
than the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the House will join me in expressing our profound 
admiration to Havel the man, and our respect to the President of 
the Czech Republic.

clean and safe drinking water is a precious resource which many 
of us take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Nunavut, students at Netsilik school in 
Taloyoak, Qiqirtaq Ilihavik in Gjoa Haven and both Takijulauk and 
Ulaajuk schools in Pond Inlet are participating in the Aquatox 
2000 program launched by Canada's International Development 
Research Centre.  Students in a worldwide network of over 100 
schools test the quality of water using very simple yet effective 
methods and post the results on an interactive web site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The participants gain valuable scientific knowledge and an 
appreciation of the importance of water while engaging in a 
positive dialogue with youth from other nations committed to a 
sustainable future.  Keep up the good work.

their backs on the thousands of people infected with hepatitis C.

year to the day after the Liberals' rejection of a motion, which 
had the support of all the opposition parties, calling for 
compensation of all hepatitis C victims.  They reminded us that 
nothing has changed in the past year, except that several 
hundred victims have died, without receiving any support from 
this government, which continues to wash its hands of them.

against these kinds of grievous acts, we would all do so 
tomorrow.  But laws will not prevent random violence.  We must 
look at the root problem.  If we strengthen families, improve the 
support provided by social services and make it easier for police 
to do their job, perhaps troubled youth will feel that they have 
a place to turn before they turn to violence.

yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage stated that everyone supported the decision to 
let go women's hockey coach Danièle Sauvageau, which is patently 
false.  Once again, the Liberal member's response was a 
shameless denial of the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the hon. member for Bourassa, that staunch defender of 
professional sport, and feigned defender of amateur sport, his 
problems are far from over. 
While the Minister of Canadian Heritage is confirming that the 
recommendations in the report on the funding of amateur sport 
have been pigeonholed, how can he expect Hockey Canada to act on 
his suggestion that Danièle Sauvageau be appointed immediately 
as the coach for the 2002 Olympics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the hon. member for Bourassa, Danièle Sauvageau was 
apparently let go because she was too pushy.  In fact, all she 
was doing was claiming what was rightfully hers, and the 
Quebeckers in the Liberal caucus would do well to follow suit. 
At present they are not asserting themselves enough and not 
assuming their responsibilities when the time comes to defend 
Quebeckers.

the phrase reduce, reuse and recycle should not apply to Canada's

of neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are so bad that even the defence minister is admitting

<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

defence budget.  This is the first time in over a dozen years 
that budget has been increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have increased it because we want to make sure that we look 
after the fine dedicated men and women who serve in our Canadian 
forces.  We have given them pay raises.  We are improving their 
housing conditions.  We are doing a number of things that improve 
their quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the government has been purchasing the equipment and the 
tools they need to do the job.  The people who will now be 
deployed to Macedonia will be taking some of our latest and best 
equipment, all new and all fully compatible with our allies. That 
will help them to do the job of peacekeeping. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
our fine dedicated men and women in the military have had $7.8 
billion cut out of the defence department since the government 
took power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that a war is on the defence minister is surprised.  He 
tosses back a few dollars, but he is surprised to find out we are 
extremely limited in the support we could give to our allies. Our 
troops need money and more equipment and they need it now. We 
have invested $1 billion in this budget.

budget?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

contribution to this allied effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talked with General Short, head of the NATO air 
operation, he said our pilots were first teamers.  He said they 
were among the best who serve there.  They have CF-18s that are 
well equipped to do the job.  The equipment we are giving to our 
people who are going to Macedonia will be state of the art 
equipment.

the money and equipment they need to do the job over there.

additional money to go into the budget.  I read three of their 
documents and I do not know what part of the word reduce they do 
not understand.  That is certainly in fact what they were 
advocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We value what our troops are doing over there.  Canadians value

the minister is wrong.  Our troops are the best in the world, but 
there is just not enough of them.  The minister knows full well 
that there is not enough of them because the government has cut 
$500 million a year since it took office in 1993.  Our Canadian 
armed forces are underfunded, underresourced and undermanned, and 
the minister knows it full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of National Defence stand in the House today

while the Minister of Finance was bringing the fiscal House in 
order and we were getting the deficit under control, hearing from 
them constantly.  They said “You can't go fast enough. Take it 
out of defence.  Take it out of social services.  Take it out of 
the pensioners”.  That is what they were saying over there.

and will do a good job for Canada.

the minister is wrong again.  He knows that he cut defence 
spending and other programs.  At the same time they have 
increased spending and added $12.5 billion to program spending 
that is questionable in the first place in the latest budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence minister, the foreign affairs minister and the Prime

passed on to the Milosevic regime.

for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister tell us if it is possible for the governments 
of Quebec and Canada to systematically gouge their own taxpayers 
with sneaky and incomprehensible tax measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a single parent family with two children and a total 
income of about $31,000 for example.  If the parent earns $1,000

have we reduced taxes, but in the example the hon. member has 
given, as a result of the last budget, a young family with two

pay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Finance is aware that at present the Quebec and federal tax 
systems are demotivating; they encourage people to work under 
the table and, more importantly, encourage the brain drain. 
Statistics prove this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister guarantee us a partial tax reform before the 
next budget, and will he also encourage the Quebec Minister of 
Finance to undertake a similar process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not lose sight of the fact that, in the last provincial

that is incorrect.  I would suggest that the member is wrong in 
that interpretation of the agreement.  I have a copy of the 
agreement here.  Chapter 2, on the conflict between federal and 
provincial laws, it is expressly clear.  I believe if the member 
reads it he will clearly see that the laws of general application 
apply, and those include the rights of women and matrimonial 
property.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
suggest that the hon. member read the entire treaty because he is 
not correct.  The minister of British Columbia who was 
responsible for putting this agreement together, Dale Lovick, has 
said that this treaty is effectively silent when it comes to 
women's rights and women's issues.  Why is this government 
effectively silent?  Why has it not stood to defend the rights of 
Nisga'a women when it comes to matrimonial property?

protect the rights of women.  They are protected in this treaty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Transport Canada sold the control tower in Kelowna to Nav 
Canada in 1996, Transport Canada revealed that it had effectively 
condemned the structure in a September 1989 report that said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediate action will be taken to produce...an appropriate tower 
replacement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did Nav Canada know that it had to replace the tower when it 
bought it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Nav Canada is aware of the 
potential for sightline obstructions at the Kelowna airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parking of large aircraft at the Kelowna aircraft apron 
occasionally obscures the tower's visibility of aircraft 
movements in the holding area for runway 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nav Canada has successful implemented sight specific procedures 
at the airport.  For instance, an expansion of the apron area is 
to be completed later this year.  The expansion will help 
alleviate the problem.  Furthermore, Nav Canada is currently 
examining a proposal to use a series of video camera systems to 
ensure visibility of all manoeuvring aircraft. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that does not address the problem that Transport Canada 
itself found, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the location and the height of the control tower, portions 
of the runway and taxiways are not visible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The control tower is actually 22 feet lower than the end of the 
runway.  Nothing is going to fix this except a new tower and not 
band-aid solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister now make safety priority number one in 
Kelowna, like he does everywhere else, and instruct that a new 
tower be built in Kelowna? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester is quite aware of the fact that we have 
been very sensitive and have been monitoring the situation very 
closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Nav Canada, which is responsible for the implementation of 
these regulations at that airport, deems it necessary after the 
interim measures I have already mentioned are implemented, and if 
they are not successful and Transport Canada monitors the 
situation, then I am sure further action will take place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we spend the entire $30 billion pension surplus today, who

doing with the $30 billion is giving it back to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat this because it seems hard for the other side to 
understand.  It is really reducing the debt by giving the money 
back to taxpayers.  That is what it is doing.  We are giving it

at noon today, unions harshly criticized the dictatorial

to empty out its employees' pension fund.  Yet Treasury Board 
figures show that employees have contributed more than 52% of 
premiums since 1924. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government refusing to sit down with its employees 
and pensioners and negotiate how the surplus, which belongs to

recently done in Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

the government has pension plans that provide benefits to 
employees. These benefits are set out in law.  The government is 
giving employees their benefits under the law.  Employees have 
never absorbed any deficits, and therefore the surpluses do not 
belong to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary indications of the supreme court's thinking 
is a case involving the Province of Quebec, which availed itself 
of the surpluses in an insurance fund. The supreme court

targeting young people, trying to addict them to cigarettes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to its order of reference dated April 20, 1999, the

provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 16, 
1999, and has agreed to report it with amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-504, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(prohibited sexual acts). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce this 
private member's bill which proposes to amend the section of the 
Criminal Code dealing with prohibited sexual acts committed with 
children or in the presence of children, and would prohibit such 
acts where they are committed with children under the age of 16. 
It would essentially raise the age of consent for sexual activity 
from 14 to 16 years.  It would also provide for a minimum 
sentence of five years imprisonment for anyone convicted of an 
offence under sections 151 and 152 of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the recent ruling about child pornography in B.C. and the 
presentation of a petition of over 100,000 signatures calling for 
the protection of the most vulnerable members of our society from 
sexual abuse, I think this House will find this bill very timely. 
I look forward to receiving the full support of all parties. I 
thank the member for Kelowna for seconding this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very please to present this bill to 
the House.  It proposes to allow a taxpayer a deduction for 
expenses related to the adoption of a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adoption is a gentle option to ensure that a child can be placed 
with loving parents.  Adoptive parents often face significant 
costs when they embark on adoption, but out of pocket adoption 
expenses are not tax deductible even though adoption is a 
significant social contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An environment where there is a mom and a dad is an environment 
where children thrive.  Adoption is also very cost effective at a

adoptive parents make and recognizes the inequities that adoptive 
parents face.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.)</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
move that the 70th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs presented on Tuesday, April 20, 1999, be 
concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise and debate the 70th report of the 
procedure and House affairs committee.  Those who have been 
watching regularly on television and our regular attenders in the 
House realize what is happening.  They realize we are debating a 
report from committee for quite a few reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go through some of the reasons committee work, 
the important work of committees, needs to be highlighted during 
motions under Routine Proceedings.  The Reform Party has been 
highlighting the issue for several days to point out to the 
government some of the failings in the democratic system and in 
the parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need to debate this committee report?  I would argue 
that committees demand a great deal of time, money and energy 
from both members of parliament and from parliament itself.  Yet 
the reports are largely ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we just take its number, it is the 70th report of the 
procedure and House affairs committee.  It has been tabled in the 
House, expecting a response from the government.  As is often the 
case, it will be ignored.  There will be no earth shattering 
changes made to the system.  There will not be a response from 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large, especially on reports from committees, the 
government seems to take them as something tabled at the clerk's 
table which goes into never-never land, never to be seen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of examples come to mind right off the bat.  I remember 
a unanimous report that was brought forward by the natural 
resources committee back in the days when I was on that 
committee.  It was called <I>Keep Mining Off the Rocks</I>.  All 
parties agreed to it.  They came forward and made about a dozen 
recommendations to the government.  We brought it forward to the 
House and tabled it.  Guess what?  Not one of those 
recommendations was followed up on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of all parties on that committee did all that work. They 
heard all the witnesses.  There were all the expenses and all the 
time spent, the give and take.  It was the best of democracy, we 
would think.  The voice of Canadians was represented in the 
committee.  They did detailed work and brought forward a report. 
It was given to the government with a plea from all parties, 
Liberal, Bloc, NDP, Reform and so on.  It was laid before the 
House and not one of the recommendations made it into government 
policy or even, it seems, got a response from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the recent 48th report— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I am reluctant to 
interrupt the hon. member for Fraser Valley, but I am sure he 
recognizes the report he has moved concurrence in has to do with 
the selection of votable items in Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to admit that in all the time of his speech so far I have 
not heard Private Members' Business mentioned once or votable 
items or any criteria.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he wants to address the report he has moved concurrence 
in.  I would invite him perhaps to direct his attention to the 
words of the report and tell us a little about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I started by mentioning 
that the 70th report deals with Private Members' Business.  I am 
building the foundation of why this report is an important one. I 
am talking about the importance of the work of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee's 70th report is no less important than any other 
committee's work.  A subcommittee of the procedure and House 
affairs committee diligently goes about its work.  It sacrifices 
its time and energy.  It calls witnesses.  There is give and take 
in committee and again it is brought forward.  I am just building 
the argument.  The trouble is that all that work is for naught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of that committee on the 70th report talks about 
criteria for Private Members' Business.  It talks about bills 
being drafted in clear, complete and effective terms.  They must 
be constitutional.  They must concern matters of significant 
public interest and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have any quibble with that report.  The report is fine. 
The problem we are talking about is that in general reports come 
into the House and go into a dark hole, never to be seen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to build the case, the background, the 
underpinnings of this argument.  Another report dealt with was 
the televising of committee work.  It was the 48th report of the 
same committee.  It was a unanimous report brought forward to the 
House of Commons.  It talked about how we got together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on that committee and spent more than a month there.  We 
listened to procedural experts.  We listened to constitutional 
experts.  The press gallery made presentations.  We listened to 
people from the print media.  We talked on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusions we came to were unanimous.  The government whip 
was on that committee.  The chief opposition whip was on that 
committee.  There were 15 or 17 members from all parties of the 
House on the committee which brought forward this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the unanimous report, the 48th report, 
talked about televised committees.  What has happened to it? What 
has happened to the televised committee report?  Absolutely 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendations were brought forward that all of us had agreed 
to.  They talked about the need to show democracy at work.  MPs 
spent all this time in committee.  There are committees, right 
now as we speak, that are diligently doing their work, the give 
and take in committee.  Who knows about it?  We cannot even get a 
<I>Hansard</I> from committees any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The televised committee alternative that all parties agreed to 
has gone nowhere.  It has been ignored by the government.  It has 
been sitting in its hands for weeks.  There has been no response. 
The silence is deafening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the 70th report on Private Members' 
Business today.  These types of reports are abused by the 
government.  Often they involve busy work, work given by the 
government to members of parliament to keep them occupied while 
the government does what it darn well pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing comes of a committee report on a good subject matter.  A 
good mandate has been given by the House or by the committee.  A 
study sometimes involves hundreds of thousands of dollars and 
hundreds of hours.  It involves the testimony of witnesses, 
written reports, give and take, and all that I mentioned earlier. 
What comes of it?  Nothing.  It is something that keeps people 
busy, but it does not have an impact on this place because it is 
ignored by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When decisions are made in committee no one even knows what 
happens to the recommendations.  I was in a committee the other 
day and a parliamentary secretary, who should know better, stood 
and asked how we could make sure something happened to the 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to break the news to the poor fellow.  I told him it would 
be tabled in the House and that nothing would happen to it.  It 
would be tabled in the House with our unanimous support.  The 
government would take a look at it and probably one person in one 
office would say  “I do not like it”.   Then it would go into 
that big round filing cabinet, never to be seen again.  That is 
what would happen to it.  That is the sadness of the committee 
report system. 
That is why the 70th report, another piece of good work, is 
largely ignored.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You educated the parliamentary secretary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  I do not know if we can educate the 
parliamentary secretary, although he was shocked to hear the news 
that his report would never be seen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report deals specifically with Private Members' Business. 
Even Private Members' Business is no longer dealt with fairly in 
committees.  This particular committee, the subcommittee, is not 
the problem.  The problem is what happens to the Private Members' 
Business that is generated by this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 70th report talks about the guidelines and the types of 
bills it will consider.  It chooses which ones are votable.  They 
come into the House.  We often pass that same bill.  We send it 
off to committee, and then what happens to that bill in 
committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen it happen before.  People bring in a bill.  It 
passes at second reading.  All of us give a standing ovation.  We 
do not even care what it is about, hardly, because we are so 
thrilled that one actually got passed in this place and that the 
government whip did not hammer to stop it.  We finally send it 
off to committee, thrilled that the subject matter will actually 
be discussed and a private member will actually see some fruition 
to all labour he or she put into an idea and into a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens to it?  Let me give the House a couple of examples. 
The hon. member for Mississauga East had exactly that success 
with Bill C-251, a justice bill concerning consecutive 
sentencing.  I was here when the bill was passed.  I saw the 
standing ovation for the hon. member for Mississauga East.  I was 
one of those standing.  I was thrilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a great bill.  I supported the bill.  I thought the 
essence of it captured the Canadian desire to have the justice 
system reflect more accurately our desire that people who commit 
consecutive serious crimes again and again should be given 
consecutive sentences.  I thought it was a good bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was sent off to the justice committee and what happened?  The 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs met on March 24, 
one month ago, and in three minutes eliminated every clause of 
her bill and voted to report it back to the House as a blank 
piece of paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine that.  Three years of work by the hon. member for 
Mississauga East and it was all for naught.  Private Members' 
Business is the root of how business came to the original mother 
of parliaments.  The hon. member brought it into the House and 
got a glowing standing ovation.  It was sent off to committee and 
the committee destroyed it in three minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons they got away with that is that the 
proceedings of committees are not televised.  Let us imagine the 
change in attitude, the smirks on the faces of those who 
eliminated the clauses of her bill, if they had to smirk in front 
of the television cameras for all Canadians to see.  Let us 
imagine their attitude when someone stood and asked if they 
realized that three years of work by this member of parliament is 
being destroyed in three minutes.  They should smirk then on CTV 
news.  They should smirk then while <I>The National</I> on CBC has 
them covered.  They should go ahead and gloat over their ability 
to destroy this person's bill when the television cameras are 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have not adopted the 48th report about televising 
committees.  They know they can act almost with impunity because 
no one is there to report on them.  We cannot see all this 
happening.  Members of the public and members of parliament read 
about it in a paper a few days later, saddened by what went on, 
but no one is there under the watchful eye of the television 
camera to make sure they are acting democratically and properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is that the hon. member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge brought forth Bill C-235.  This was a 
little different.  I was as thrilled as all members and gave him 
a standing ovation when it passed and was sent off to committee. 
I did not happen to support the bill but that was not the issue. 
The issue was that the House should have to deal with that bill. 
That was the point.  I do not agree with every bill in this place 
but the House should have to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the bill got sent to committee.  On April 15, about two 
weeks ago, that hon. member was subjected to the humiliation of 
answering the question of how many years had he worked on the 
bill.  In five minutes committee members made a blank page out of 
the whole thing and destroyed the bill.  They nuked every clause 
out of that bill and will report it back to the House as a blank 
piece of paper and let the House deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, when it comes back here, there is nothing to deal 
with. 
It has all been eliminated in committee.  There is nothing we can 
do.  It is a complete waste of Private Members' Business time. 
It is a complete waste of the committee's time.  It is a complete 
waste of the democratic process when a mockery is made of it by 
handling important Private Members' Business in this manner.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again refer to the 70th report, which is what we are debating 
at this moment.  The 70th report lays out the criteria for 
important Private Members' Business.  It tells members how to get 
a bill approved, how to move it through the system and what kind 
of bill will be approved.  When the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge brought that forward, jumped through 
all the hoops, made the case, got the approval of the House and 
did everything that the report demanded, what happened?  It was 
sent off to committee, only to be seen again as a blank piece of 
paper.  That is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 70th report, as good as it might be, is no good to anyone 
because that is what happens to Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth point I would like to make as to why we need to 
debate this report from the committee is that we need to report 
this in the House at this time because no one else will ever see 
what the report is about.  Reports are tabled routinely during 
Routine Proceedings day after day:  the 50th report, the 60th 
report, the 70th report.  I do not know what number we are up to 
today.  The report is simply tabled, and that is the end of it. 
It is gone.  It is worse than cyberspace.  We cannot even press 
the undo button.  It is gone, never to be seen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians have no idea of the important work of committees. 
They are not televised.  For some reason the Liberals will not 
allow them to be televised.  They are not reported.  We have to 
choose this type of venue to debate it because there is no other 
way of bringing this important committee work to the attention of 
the Canadian people.  The House is televised and that is why we 
have to do it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be better to televise the committee hearings and 
let Canadians make their own judgment about what goes on in 
committees?  They can watch their MPs at work.  I am not simply 
talking about a big committee like finance, which will spend 
$600,000 or $700,000 touring the country on a prebudget 
propaganda tour.  What about the other committees, the good 
committees which deal with agriculture, transport, public works, 
scrutiny of regulations and all of the things that go on behind 
the scenes?  All of that is ignored because there is not a 
television camera allowed.  That is bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we had the privilege of listening to Mr. Václav 
Havel address parliament.  He talked quite a bit about democracy. 
I sat in my seat to listen to his speech.  One of the senators 
who was sitting in the middle aisle came over to the Reform House 
leader and I and said “Over in the Senate, over in the other 
place, we televise all of our committee hearings.  You are the 
great bastion of democracy here, so why do you not televise your 
own committees?”  He laughed and said “You guys give us the 
gears about the Senate, but we are more open and more public with 
our committee hearings than in the Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hung my head low and I thought to myself “What do I say to an 
unelected senator, who is not accountable to anyone, who is there 
by the grace of the Prime Minister's blessing, who tells me about 
televised and democratic committee hearings that the public can 
catch any time they like?”  They can turn on the television set 
and it is right there.  Here we are, hanging our heads, saying 
“Unless it is in one particular room it will not be televised. 
I guess the Senate does it better than we do”.  What a shameful 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I slunk back to my seat and listened to a pillar of democracy 
talk about openness, transparency and all of the things that we 
should have in our committee system, which we do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fifth point is that at times when democracy reigns, when 
television cameras come into committee, it is a nice, refreshing 
breath of fresh air.  Yesterday the major networks in the country 
fought for most of the day to have the defence hearing televised 
so they could attend, bring in their cameras and so on. 
They spent the day struggling with government authorities, asking 
why they could not televise the defence hearing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the middle of a war in Kosovo.  Does the government 
not think the defence committee hearings might be of interest, 
not only to the media, but probably to several million Canadians 
who are worried about the future of our defence corps, our 
Canadian forces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They fought for a day until they finally got in.  What happened? 
Both the government and the opposition got a clip on the news.  I 
thought it made the whole thing.  It did not paint anybody in a 
bad light.  It brought some light to the situation.  It was a 
fine example of how it could be in years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by quoting Robert Hutchins, a former president of 
the University of Chicago, who edited the great books of western 
civilization.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death of democracy is not likely to be as assassination from 
ambush.  It will be a slow extinction from apathy, indifference, 
and undernourishment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our attempts to make our committee work more democratic and 
more open, I urge the House to adopt both the 70th and 48th 
reports which deal with the televising of committees so that we 
can nourish those committees, make them more democratic, more 
open, more available to the Canadian people, and I ask that we do 
that without any delay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was very pleased to listen to my colleague who spoke 
about the issues surrounding what happens in committees.  Having 
been one of three people from the Reform Party who sat on the 
procedure and House affairs committee which dealt with televised 
committees, I can only say that the frustration is growing more 
and more every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is, when members from all parties in a committee 
agree on a concept, it comes into the House and it dies.  I note 
that the government whip was there and he agreed to it.  I 
presume that these folks are just as knowledgeable as we are as 
far as what has to take place.  Now the question in the House and 
in committees as well is:  Should we even be here?  If we 
develop a report, put all of our ideas together and come to a 
unanimous consensus, only to have it die because someone in 
cabinet kills it, should we even bother? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the recommendations coming from the report on 
televised committees were very good.  This was to be a pilot 
project for the coverage of committees, with 24 hours' notice. 
There was a sunset clause that it would end this June.  There 
were constraint criteria, such as those televising the committees 
would obey the rules.  It would be gavel to gavel coverage of the 
whole committee meeting.  It would be objective coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only recommendation which was made that put some negative 
light on it was that the committee did not want to renovate one 
particular room because of the cost and the fact that the House 
of Commons will soon be under renovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens?  The government House leader says “I do not like 
this report.  What we will do is renovate a room”.  That was the 
very recommendation to which the committee said no.  Not having 
been at any of the meetings, I suppose he could have read the 
report, but I doubt that he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this just an issue of televised committees, or is there 
something bigger at stake?  I will leave it at that because that 
is the important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform House leader 
has cut right to the nub of the question, which is:  What is the 
big issue about committees?  Is it just that we need more 
television cameras?  Is it an ego thing for parliamentarians? 
What is the issue?

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not about televising committees, although that is 
critically important.  It is very important that we at least keep 
up with the Senate in our ability to communicate with Canadians 
about the work of this place.  That is important, but it is not 
just about televising committees, it is about the work of all 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps 10% of members of parliament are present now in the 
House.  Why is that?  Are they off having tea and crumpets at the 
Empress Hotel?   No, they are off at committee, doing important 
work.  They are having clause by clause discussions on bills. 
They are proposing amendments to legislation.  Members are 
bringing forward proposals on policy initiatives.  They are 
investigating the role of Canada in Kosovo.  They are asking the 
defence minister to explain where the money is being spent and 
how we are protecting our soldiers.  Members are doing all of 
this important work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not know about most of it.  Even if we had a television 
camera in front of us we could not watch the hearings.  We cannot 
see the work, the hours, the money, the expertise and the 
witnesses that we fly here at great public expense, and the 
devotion to the subject matter which is shown by members from all 
parties in the House.  Members bring different perspectives and 
often come to a unanimous conclusion after hearing witnesses and 
having a clause by clause debate.  A lot of work is involved in 
coming to a unanimous conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then what happens?  The report is tabled in the House with much 
fanfare.  Maybe there is a press conference downstairs.  We all 
say that it was a satisfying bit of work.  We came to parliament 
to help change the system and propose things to make Canada 
better.  What happens?  Nothing.  The fact that nothing happens 
is the big issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports are prepared, work is done, effort is expended, dollars 
are expended and hours are wasted because the reports gather 
dust.  That is a shame.  What we should have is a vibrant 
discussion, under the full light of television cameras, so that 
members of parliament can be seen by their constituents back 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constituents could see us deliberating, for example, an 
important agricultural issue.  The member for Portage—Lisgar 
might be debating the future of the wheat board, the future of a 
farm subsidy program, the railway and so on.  The member could 
say to his constituents “Watch tomorrow morning at noon because 
I will be going to work for you.  You will be seeing me in 
action.  Tomorrow I will represent our constituency on that 
important issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big issue is that no one knows about it.  No one can see it. 
When a report is finally drafted, nothing happens.  That is the 
big issue.  That is why reports should be dealt with.  They 
should at least merit a response from the government in a timely 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a list, which is too long to go into, of dozens of 
reports that have been tabled in this place.  The response from 
the government, at best, was:  “We had a look at it and we are 
not going to do it”.  That brings the work of parliamentarians 
into question.  That is unfortunate.  As I mentioned earlier, 
democracy does not die usually a violent death; it dies by 
apathy, neglect and undernourishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that the light of television cameras would do something to 
reverse that.  It would nourish democracy.  It would give 
strength and importance to the work of all members of parliament, 
so that it would not appear that we simply gather here for 
question period.  The work we do would be noticed and would make 
a difference in the Government of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
I go to schools and talk to children about the workings of 
parliament I tell them that very important work takes place in 
committees.  I would like to be able to continue to tell them 
that.  However, from what I have been hearing from my colleagues, 
committees are not always relevant.  I believe the discussion 
today is about relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 109 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within 150 days of the presentation of a report from a standing 
or special committee, the government shall, upon the request of 
the committee, table a comprehensive response thereto. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often what is deemed to be a comprehensive report turns 
out to be totally ignored or, as has been so eloquently expressed 
here, it is tossed in the dustbin. It speaks volumes to the 
relevance or irrelevance of the work of committees.  I would like 
my colleague's comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that standing order, one 
of the rules we work under here in the House, is exactly as the 
member described.  There is a requirement for the government to 
respond but often that response is “We are going to take a 
little more time to look at it” or “We appreciate the work you 
have done thank you very much, we are sure looking this over”. I 
would bet they are just sweating late at night over there in the 
Langevin building going over it clause by clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of Standing Order 108, another rule that committee 
members can use to bring subject matters to the committee.  We 
gather signatures from the opposition parties.  We get a subject 
matter or a witness to come before the committee. That is 
supposed to give us some influence on this side but often what 
happens is the government will say “Thank you for that request. 
We know you have the right to do it”, but guess what?  The 
committee goes in camera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a committee goes in camera that means not only are there no 
television cameras, there are no witnesses, there is no 
<I>Hansard</I>, there is nothing.  At that time the committee 
makes a decision on whether we get to hear our witness or not, 
and guess what?  There is always a majority of government members 
on a committee and guess what?  They always turn it down.  I 
should not say always, but 90% of the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Orders 108 and 109 are examples of a government that 
says it wants to keep us busy, but when it comes to the nub of 
the issue or if we get too close to home and it looks like we are 
about to strike a political point, there is a dust gathering area 
that is sifting down as we speak on a layer of books as high as 
an elephant's eye. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for recognizing me.  I know my hon. 
colleague is most anxious to take part in the debate once more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of the debate on the 70th report raised by my 
colleague the hon. whip of the official opposition, the 70th 
report of the procedure and House affairs committee is an 
excellent report, one that we collectively worked on very 
closely.  There was some give and some take but ultimately I 
believe we have contributed to a report that enhances private 
members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of that subcommittee, the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington who is with us today, and other colleagues 
from all parties who work on that committee I think will find 
this contributes to the process in a very positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I wholeheartedly support the strong and sincere view of 
the member who spoke previously about the worthiness and 
importance of committee work— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about report 48? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  I am being asked to comment on another 
report.  I know the Chair wants me to remain relevant to the 
report at hand, but I know he will allow me some flexibility in 
presenting my case and also to expand it to some other reports 
that in the end will ultimately contribute to this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 70th report is an excellent report. I remain optimistic that 
this report will meet everyone's expectations and in fact will be 
concurred in.  I have no doubt.  I am quite optimistic. Having 
said that, I do not want to take up any more House time without 
diminishing the significance and importance of the 70th report. 
I do believe the government will respond within the 150 days in a 
favourable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly on the 48th report, I am a member of that committee. I 
concurred and was part of that unanimous report.  I can share 
some of the frustrations that my colleagues opposite have about 
that.  We did not quite make it all the way that day.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding that we did not quite get it all done through 
that report, I think we have made a substantive contribution to 
ultimately in the end arrive at the objective.  The ultimate 
objective is to have more televising of committees.  We will get 
there.  The fact that we did not get there right now does not 
discourage me one iota.  Does it frustrate me a little bit?  Oh 
yes, I wish we had it done, wrapped up and delivered, but we are 
not quite there.  There is a little adversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The chief government whip is getting 
carried away with his rhetoric, but I remind him that the report 
we are debating is not on televising of committees, it is on 
private members' business and I know he will want to return to 
that.  Perhaps he is building a foundation, but we are all 
looking forward to the superstructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I said everything that I 
could about the importance and the quality of the 70th report.  I 
know that the House also anxiously wants to get back to the 
business of the House, Bill C-66, the very important National 
Housing Act.  Therefore, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK165">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had discussions with the government House leader who 
indicated that he is now prepared to negotiate even further and 
help this along on Monday.  In view of that, we will not be 
standing for a vote this time, but we do expect some action on 
Monday.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL HOUSING ACT

<A NAME="LINK168">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 28, 1999 consideration of Bill 
C-66, an act to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act and to make a consequential 
amendment to another act, as reported (without amendment) from 
the committee; and of the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in 
the debate on Bill C-66 and specifically the proposed amendments 
to the bill as outlined in Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by raising the broad issue of housing in 
this country today.  I do not think there is anyone in this House 
who will deny that there is a housing crisis in Canada.  In fact, 
many would go beyond simply calling it a crisis.  The mayors of 
capital cities right across the country have called it a national 
disaster and the facts bear that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 100,000 Canadians are homeless.  We know the situation 
facing our aboriginal community both off reserve and on reserve. 
The backlog of houses in first nations communities in the north 
exceeds 4,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities right across the country especially in our inner 
cities and older neighbourhoods, have a major problem in terms of 
the housing stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency of Winnipeg North Centre, we are faced with 
what can only be described as such a deplorable situation that a 
state of emergency should be declared.  This is not unique to 
Winnipeg North Centre. My community represents the same kind of 
concerns we see from one end of the country to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are vacant and boarded up houses.  Houses and buildings 
have become targets just waiting for arsonists.  I do not need to 
tell the House that there is a very high incidence of arson in my 
community and in other communities across the country with the 
deplorable situation in terms of housing stock and the many 
boarded up vacant houses.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about absentee landlords.  We are talking about 
lack of dollars being provided either by government or from an 
individual's own disposable income for renovations and upkeep. 
We are talking about drastically dropping market values for 
housing in some of our inner cities and older neighbourhoods.  We 
are talking about red circling by insurance companies which makes 
it very difficult to purchase the necessary protection for one's 
house.  We are talking about insurmountable barriers to home 
ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those factors have to be noted in this debate because 
they are taking a devastating toll.  It is so apparent through 
the bill before us today that this government pays no heed.  At 
the precise moment when the need is the greatest our federal 
government is pursuing a policy of abandonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget it is federal withdrawal from the areas of 
public housing, social housing, co-operative housing and 
non-profit housing that in very large measure has caused this 
crisis in the first place.  Why then would the government do more 
of the same? Why at a time of crisis would the government do the 
opposite of what is required? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would this government retreat even further from its 
responsibilities as it is doing in Bill C-66?  Why at precisely 
the moment when this country needs a national housing strategy 
and national housing standards would this government introduce 
measures to complete its policy of abandonment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community, as I am sure is the case in other centres 
across the country, citizens and community organizations are 
trying to fight back.  In the true spirit of Winnipeg's north 
end, citizens are banding together to find co-operative, 
collective, community based solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neighbourhood patrols are springing up.  There are economic 
development initiatives.  Housing renewal projects are developing 
in response to this critical situation.  But the federal 
government is not participating, supporting, encouraging and 
ensuring that we can come up with realistic solutions to this 
very grave problem.  Why will this government not support this 
spirit of community and pride of neighbourhood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are focusing in this debate on a government that refuses to 
see what is happening around it and refuses to recognize that it 
must be part of the solution.  Bill C-66 is going in the wrong 
direction.  It is absolutely the wrong remedy for the critical 
situation we are facing.  The amendments being proposed by the 
Reform Party in this grouping do not make the situation any 
better.  They will undoubtedly make the situation worse and will 
contribute even more to a government policy that is bound and 
determined to put everything in the context of the marketplace in 
terms of efficiency and competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a moral obligation, a political 
responsibility and a constitutional obligation to ensure that 
Canadians everywhere in the country have the right to adequate 
shelter.  This bill and these amendments do not satisfy those 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to try to convince the government, although I know 
it seems far-fetched, to withdraw Bill C-66.  The measure of good 
government and great leadership is in the government's ability to 
respond to needs.  It is in the ability of a government to 
reverse its policies when it can see that the needs are growing, 
spreading and becoming critical right across the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not too much to ask the minister to reverse his policies, 
put this bill on ice and go back to the drawing board and start 
to look at some of the promises that were actually made to the 
people back in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is useful to remind the Liberals about their policies in 1993 
when they were still in opposition.  I want to specifically 
mention a letter dated September 22, 1993 signed by the present 
Minister of Finance in which he said “Our platform document 
provides a framework for government in the 1990s.  We believe the 
federal government has a positive, proactive role in national 
housing policy and the responsibility of accessibility and 
affordability to over one million Canadian households living in 
need of adequate shelter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to that promise?  What happened to that election 
platform?  Why do we have Bill C-66 before us today?  Instead of 
the amendments that we have before us today, which make the CMHC 
more of a competitive force in the marketplace, we should be 
seeing amendments to a bill today that reflect the needs in our 
communities and make mortgages more accessible to those who are 
having a hard time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically want to implore the government to look at the 
whole question of changing the rules and regulations to make it 
possible for people on low incomes or on social assistance to be 
eligible for home ownership and to be able to benefit from public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the government that it had promised earlier to consider 
changing the arrangements under the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation to address concerns about eligibility of social 
assistance recipients for CMHC underwriting.  It had promised to 
look at the question of sweat equity as a means of satisfying 
down payment requirements.  We have heard nothing on that front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we hear is CMHC becoming more competitive and putting 
housing out for export.  While the government talks about 
exporting housing, people in this country are living in squalid 
and deplorable housing conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to tell the government to stop and look at its 
priorities, look at the needs in the country and recognize that 
we absolutely must have leadership from our national government. 
We have to have a national housing policy.  We are the only OECD 
country that does not have a national housing policy.  It is 
deplorable, it is negligent and it must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge the government to reconsider this bill and come back 
with a progressive, innovative policy to deal with the serious 
crisis in our country today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to various motions presented by my hon. 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have before us are three visions of the relationship 
between the Government of Canada and the CMHC.  At one extreme, we 
have the amendments being proposed by my colleague from Kelowna 
which in my view would seriously undermine the government's 
ability to carry out its public policy role in housing which it 
fulfils through the renewed mandate of Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to explain.  The Government of Canada is committed to 
playing a leadership role in housing.  That is why the government 
renewed the mandate of its housing agency CMHC and has strengthened 
CMHC's ability to fulfill its mandate through amendments to Bill 
C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government understands the importance of helping Canadians 
meet their housing needs.  We understand the importance of 
building a strong, competitive housing industry.  We know that 
good housing creates sound communities and a strong country.  We 
know that housing has a major impact on the economy of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 clearly sets out the public policy objectives of the 
CMHC.  Permit me to read this extract from the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Act, in relation to financing for housing, 
is to promote housing affordability and choice, to facilitate 
access to, and competition and efficiency in the provision of, 
housing finance, to protect the availability of adequate funding 
for housing at low cost, and generally to contribute to the 
well-being of the housing sector in the national economy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we have already talked about this, but it is important to 
repeat it.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely nobody would dispute the importance of these objectives. 
Yet the hon. member proposes changes that would eliminate the 
government's ability to regulate CMHC should it be necessary to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to remove this section of the National Housing Act, 
as proposed, we would effectively be reducing the government's 
control, in other words the public's control, of CMHC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that if my hon. friend thought for a minute about 
what he was proposing, he would realize how ridiculous it is to 
imply that the public should not have the right to ensure that 
CMHC is accountable to them.  CMHC is a public institution with a 
public policy role, a role that has served Canadians so very well 
for over 50 years.  To suggest that government control of a 
public institution should be reduced is somewhat bewildering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 will give CMHC the means to carry out its public 
policy role more effectively and in a financially prudent manner. 
This is what the Government of Canada expects.  This is what the 
people of Canada deserve.  This is what Bill C-66 is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the other extreme, we have the member from Cape Breton who 
would have every decision made by CMHC approved by the governor 
in council.  Perhaps the hon. member does not realize that to do 
so would involve great expense, both in terms of administrative 
costs and in the quality of services that the Government of 
Canada can offer to Canadians.  Indeed, the hon. member would 
have the government return to the old days of red tape and heavy 
bureaucratic processes at the expense of efficient delivery of 
important government services for needy Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have another member of the opposition presenting a 
scenario where every service provided by CMHC to individuals and 
communities would first have to be approved by the province 
concerned.  This would limit the Government of Canada to such an 
extent that it could not provide Indian reserves with the 
services they require without provincial approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could also prevent other Canadians from having access to 
federal government measures in areas that were not of interest 
to a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear about it.  The benefits arising out of programs 
administered by CMHC are, and will remain, subject to the 
decisions of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 will modernize the relationship between CMHC and the 
Government of Canada.  In fact, Bill C-66 requires yearly 
approval of the CMHC business plan. This will ensure that CMHC's 
actions are in keeping with the wishes and priorities of the 
government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, every year the House is involved in approving the 
resources given to CMHC to reach out to needy Canadians to 
implement those programs that one member would rather see not 
regulated at all and that another member would regulate to the 
point of administrative paralysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act and 
the Financial Administration Act clearly confer to the government 
oversight in all aspects of the corporation's activities.  What 
more could the hon. member want?  Why, for instance, would we go 
so far as to endorse a proposal from the member from Cape Breton 
to have potentially every project approved by the governor in 
council? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision that we are proposing in Bill C-66 is a modern 
vision, a vision which will result in government services that 
are more responsive to the needs of Canadians and the needs of 
their regions, a vision which will better equip CMHC to work 
co-operatively with provinces, a vision that at the end of the 
day will lead to a more efficient and effective government.  That 
is a vision that I think every Canadian would support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again we rise up in the House to 
debate another bill that came from the Liberal government.  This 
is a piece of legislation that came from the south end of a 
north-bound cow.  That is exactly where it came from.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous member spoke about the hon. member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton.  The hon. member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton 
sees through the government's plans and that is why it is so 
upset and is trying to discredit her in any way it can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is again trying to download federal 
responsibility for the citizens of this country and load it onto 
the provinces.  That is absolutely unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia, for example, the government downloaded the 
responsibility for social housing onto the backs of the provinces 
by saying, “No problem.  We are done.  We have done a good 
deed”. That is exactly what it is trying to do now, only in this 
particular case it is making it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to merge with a company called General 
Electric Capital Corporation, a large, foreign-owned 
multinational company, so it can do the mortgage insurance part 
of it.  Not only is the government downloading its responsibility 
to the provinces, it is also giving the financial responsibility 
away to a foreign multinational corporation. Where is the heart 
in the government?  It is absolutely unbelievable that it can 
continue to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The destruction of the federal role in housing began in the 1991 
budget when the then federal Conservatives announced the end of 
federal funding for new social housing.  As usual, the Liberals 
have reformed the Tory policies and have made them even worse. 
The Liberal government continued the abandonment of social 
housing in 1996 when it began to download social housing back to 
the provinces.  It concluded downloading agreements with seven 
out of the ten provinces.  B.C., Alberta and Ontario are 
currently the holdouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just another disguise, another masquerade by the 
government to download its responsibility for housing onto the 
backs of the provinces and tell the citizens of the country 
“Don't worry about it.  The provinces will look after you”. 
That is absolutely unacceptable and shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put some personal perspectives on this.  I come from the 
beautiful riding of Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore 
in beautiful Nova Scotia.  Many people in my riding, as well as 
in all of Atlantic Canada, have been hurt by the downturn of the 
fishery.  These people have lost their homes. There is probably 
nothing worse to a family than losing their home, the shelter, 
the peace, the security and the ability to bring up their 
children in their own home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when they look for assistance and help from the 
government?  They go to the federal government and get slapped in 
the face one more time.  The federal government, with its 
Ottawa-central attitude, is saying “Too bad, so sad, make it out 
on your own”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder where the heart is in the government.  Whatever 
happened to the Pearson days?  Whatever happened to those caring 
Liberals who cared about Canadian citizens, not just about the 
bottom line of foreign national corporations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear the rhetoric from the government time and time again 
that it is on the right track; it knows what it is doing.  It 
tells us not to worry, it can be trusted.  It is absolutely 
despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to reread what the current finance minister said while 
in opposition;  “Dear friends”—I love that term—“Our 
platform documents provide a framework for government in the 
1990s”.  Let me make it abundantly clear that a Liberal 
government should be absolutely committed to stable and secure 
funding for the non-profit and co-operative housing sector, but 
it is not.  It has completely abandoned its responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets to the point where we wonder why we even bother coming 
here.  Are we relevant any more to the Canadian people, except 
the government's friends and the party?  It goes on and on and 
on.  Even the UN has discredited our policies when it came to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many reports we could speak about, but the abandonment 
of housing by the federal government comes at a time when the 
need for federal support is even greater.  We need support from 
the federal government in resources and manpower more than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Golden report on homelessness stresses that all levels of 
government, federal, provincial and municipal, have to co-operate 
to put an end to homelessness.  What the federal government wants 
to do is just abandon its responsibility and say to the provinces 
and municipalities “It is your problem, you look after it.  We 
are just the federal government.  We absolutely have no heart. We 
do not really care about you anymore”.

proven that in our defence capabilities, in the fishing industry, 
in agriculture with the farmers across the country, and small 
business.  And when it comes to the most basic need of Canadian 
citizens from coast to coast to coast, affordable social housing, 
the government is abandoning that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about CMHC, that great corporation, and what 
they are going to do.  In actuality the government is going to 
eliminate any power or control that we as members of parliament 
may have.  The government is going to stack the CMHC board of 
directors full of its Liberal friends.  Patronage.  The pigs are 
at the trough again.  They are going to feed at taxpayers' 
expense with absolutely no concern for Canadian citizens, 
especially those who are most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came to Ottawa, and I assume I speak for all 301 of us, 
in both official languages I might add, our goal and role in life 
was to help those who cannot help themselves.  We certainly did 
not come here to abuse labour rights.  We did not come here to 
abuse the environment. We certainly did not come here to neglect 
those who cannot help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal social housing is a policy that should be upgraded and 
maintained.  There should be resources and manpower available in 
order to maintain that.

What in God's name are we doing here if we cannot help those who 
cannot help themselves?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL HOUSING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK176">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-66, an act to amend 
the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to another 
act, as reported (without amendment) from the committee; and of 
the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the Group No. 1 
motions concerning Bill C-66. I should say right from the start 
that we are opposed to these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments attempt to deal with limiting the powers of 
CMHC in the commercial insurance market. It is interesting to 
note that of these six amendments, several were suggested by GE 
Capital in material that was sent out to MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about the effect of multinational companies 
taking over and influencing the direction in which housing should 
go.  We notice that the federal government has already stepped 
back from the area of social housing.  That has certainly given 
rise to the problem we see in our society today with respect to 
so many homeless people and the conditions that exist in so many 
of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of communities throughout Canada where people do 
not have adequate shelter over their heads.  We know how very 
important housing is to every aspect of a child's life. 
Children growing up without proper shelter, squeezed into 
bedrooms that house more than they should, or perhaps children 
not even having an adequate bedroom, all of these things impact 
upon the child's ability to pursue their education at school and 
to interact socially with others. These things come together to 
create some of the social conditions we see today, the many 
tragic incidents that are taking place across our country.  We 
wonder how these things can take place and many times it comes 
right back to the root cause that those very basic necessities of 
life are not being provided.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very much opposed to things which would limit the 
potential for social housing and for the government to play a 
role.  The question here is whose side are we on?  Are we on the 
side of the large foreign owned multinational companies, or are 
we on the side of Canadian families who are looking for 
affordable decent housing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If some of these amendments were to go through, it would 
certainly create a climate that would push CMHC to move away from 
that kind of risk market and into areas where it felt more 
secure.  It would back even further away from helping with social 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot say enough about how important it is that the federal 
government get back into the area of social housing to provide 
much needed accommodation right across our country.  Lots of 
times when backing away from something people look at the 
budgetary reasons and say, “We have to get this deficit down. 
We have to cut back so we can bring the finances in line”.  They 
forget that by cutting so deep, quite often they make the 
situation worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is similar to a doctor who performs an operation and in 
cutting away a cancer cuts too deep into the bone and creates 
another problem. We know if we cut back on the programs to such 
an extent that we do not have adequate housing, then those other 
problems I mentioned earlier follow, people not being able to 
pursue their education, people becoming discouraged about looking 
for work.  The social problems of people living on the streets, 
problems of drugs, needles and getting diseases because of 
unsanitary conditions, all of these things will develop. It 
escalates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that the government assume its 
responsibility and role and makes sure there is adequate housing 
for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All through this bill there are provisions which would remove 
any direct government involvement in providing housing for those 
in need.  Instead of parliament or even the cabinet making 
decisions about how best to provide affordable housing, that 
authority has been delegated to an appointed board of directors 
at the CMHC.  Again we are into this whole area of privatizing 
everything which is something that disturbs me quite a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In too many areas of public or social responsibility the 
government is cutting back and privatizing, putting it out into 
the private sector.  Consequently government is losing control of 
the things that are really within its responsibility to make sure 
they are preserved in the best interests of society at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look very closely at this whole process where 
everything is put out into the private sector as if it could be 
done better there than being maintained in the public sector. 
When that is done, we are actually putting a vote of 
non-confidence in our public service and in the people who work 
within that service.  We are saying they cannot do things as well 
as private business or private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group of amendments that we are looking at and the kind of 
changes in this legislation are all geared in the direction of 
giving favour to the private industry as opposed to building up 
and enhancing our public service and getting the programs that 
are required so that all people can have adequate and affordable 
housing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words in this debate on the housing 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask publicly of the senior minister in the House today, the 
Minister of National Revenue, why has the Liberal Party strayed 
so far from its progressive roots of Lester Pearson and Paul 
Martin, Sr. when it comes to social policy and social housing? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember years ago when the ministry of urban affairs was 
created.  I was a member of the House when the first policy steps 
were taken in the Trudeau years toward more social housing in 
Canada.  In the last few years it seems to me that the Liberals 
have forgotten where they stood in those days when they were more 
progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the Reform Party has had a tremendous impact 
in setting the agenda, in being the rudder in terms of the new 
Liberal policies. The Minister of National Revenue is shaking his 
head, I can hear it from here.  I think he would probably agree 
with what I am saying if we had the kind of parliamentary system 
that would allow a bit more freedom and independence for 
expressing ourselves in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party at one time was socially progressive, starting 
with the great thinkers conference in Kingston many years ago 
with Tom Kent.  Lester Pearson was leader of the opposition.  I 
remember people like Eric Kierans in the party and the three 
wise men coming out of Quebec, Trudeau, Pelletier and Jean 
Marchand.  They talked about a new and just society, about 
participatory democracy.  They swept a young man, the member for 
Vancouver South—Burnaby, the Minister of National Revenue, off 
his feet and into what he found was a great social democratic 
revolution. All of a sudden it went poof and the whole thing 
disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an open debate. We have 10 minutes on each of these 
amendments.  I would like the Minister of National Revenue to 
explain why the party has lost its way.  This minister is very 
ambitious.  He wants to take on the Minister of Finance as a 
leadership candidate.  He wants to challenge Brian Tobin and the 
Minister of Health as the left-wing progressive Liberal in terms 
of challenging the Minister of Finance for the leadership of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we ought to hear from the Minister of National Revenue 
and have him explain what his vision is for social housing and 
what his vision is on what we do about homeless Canadians. I am 
sure the Reform Party is sitting here with great anticipation to 
hear where this Liberal stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last night I was coming back from a function at the Cuban 
Embassy, and I did not see the minister there by the way. I saw 
homeless people sleeping under a bridge not too far from 
Parliament Hill. They were not Cubans, they were Canadians. These 
were homeless people. A number of years ago there were not many 
homeless people around the streets of Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, 
Regina or Vancouver. Now there is homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has established a ministry responsible for 
homelessness and the minister is from New Brunswick.  I want to 
know what the vision of that ministry would be.  Will there be 
funding for that ministry?  A New Brunswick member is here in the 
House.  Perhaps he knows whether or not there will be funding for 
that ministry of homelessness.  What is the vision?  How do we 
find homes for people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government bill before the House today that is going 
to be regressive in terms of the amendments. It seems to be 
tilted toward the marketplace and commercialization of CMHC in 
terms of its lending policies, and the influence of the Minister 
of Finance and his conservative bent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Minister of National Revenue to tell us what 
the vision should be in terms of social housing, homelessness and 
what we should do about the number of Canadians who are suffering 
from falling incomes.  The gap between the rich and the poor has 
widened radically in the last five to ten or twelve years. Yet 
the government across the way is the government that has made the 
most drastic cutbacks in the history of our country in terms of 
social programs, particularly health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the taxes go up.  They go up very unfairly and 
indiscriminately.  It is an unfair tax system in Canada. Most 
taxes are placed on the backs of the people who are least able to 
pay them, low income and middle income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, we have a lot of time this afternoon.  I would 
like to sit down now and give the Minister of National Revenue an 
opportunity to tell us what his vision is of social housing, what 
his vision is in terms of homelessness, what his vision is in 
terms of where we should go to narrow the gap between the rich 
and the poor.  After all, as we all know, he wants to be a 
leadership candidate on the left of the Liberal Party.  He wants 
to challenge the Minister of Finance to the mantle of the 
leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. I want to know where 
he stands.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paradoxical, to say the least, that we are having to deal 
with a bill such as this.  I think everyone understands that the 
federal government has absolutely no interest in housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before introducing our amendments, I want to remind the House 
that the government made a commitment in the 1996 speech from 
the throne to withdraw completely from the housing sector. 
Government members with us today will remember that, at least I 
hope they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we find a paradox on reading the bill.  We discover the 
government wants more space and more powers in the housing 
sector.  It is totally incomprehensible. 
It is contradictory to say the least, and completely 
inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill were passed—and I certainly hope not, but we are 
sometimes at the mercy of majorities—it has all the potential to 
allow the federal government to establish a national housing 
allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Minister of Public Works, who is responsible for the 
CMHC, whether it was not somewhat inconsistent that, in the 
throne speech, which is a commitment after all, the government 
said it wanted to withdraw from this sector, and that 
negotiations were even under way to transfer $1.9 billion to the 
provinces.  The minister replied that, while that was so, there 
were some provinces where logic did not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attitude is a bit hard to understand. 
Our amendments, which I hope will be favourably received by the 
government, provide that, if the federal government takes action 
in the low cost, co-operative or non-profit housing sector in 
municipalities in Quebec, we hope that permission will first be 
required from the Government of Quebec and the National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains certain provisions flowing from a clause such 
as this, particularly where aboriginals and student loans are 
concerned.  We hope, through our amendments, to broaden the 
scope of what exists already on a smaller scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to take this opportunity to ask the federal government, 
particular the government members here today—I am thinking of the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration—to bring pressure to bear 
so that the negotiations that have been going on with the 
Government of Quebec for over two years reach a successful 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something positively indecent about the federal 
government's proposal, and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, the federal government is spending $362 million 
annually in the housing sector, through various CMHC programs. 
But this is to completely ignore Quebec's demographic weight. 
If the federal government had to adjust its spending to reflect 
Quebec's demographic weight, it would be just over 24%, as 
everyone knows.  It would then have to spend $480 million.  The 
difference is $117 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor is it respectful of what used to be termed households with 
core housing needs.  I would remind members that all the 
governments in Quebec, the one the Minister of Immigration 
belonged to, as did her friend Mr. Johnson, the government of 
Mr. Parizeau and the government of Mr. Bouchard, all these have 
made the same demands on the federal government as far as 
housing is concerned, namely that they receive a fair share, 
taking core housing needs into consideration.  Although Quebec 
accounts for 24.60% of the population of Canada, it contains 29% 
of households in need of core housing.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been acknowledged by Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trudel, and all the 
housing ministers, one after another, in the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebec had its fair share, taking into account the households 
in need of core housing, that would mean it would receive $567 
million.  I repeat, however, that as we speak what is being 
spent is $362 million.  This makes no sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More ridiculous still, the Minister responsible for CMHC and 
member for Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, makes an offer to Quebec, 
offering it less than the CMHC spends annually. 
This makes little sense.  He offers Quebec $289 million, while 
at this very moment $362 million is what is being spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the voice of Quebec will be able to make itself heard in 
this cabinet, that the ministers will get some hold on 
themselves and loosen the purse strings a little.  Housing is an 
important issue.  The main cause of poverty is certainly the 
amount that our most disadvantaged fellow citizens have to pay 
in rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if there is no official indicator of poverty in Canada, the 
National Council of Welfare, along with Statistics Canada, 
considers a person poor, and below the poverty line if he or she 
is devoting 55% of income to basic necessities, i.e. 
accommodation and food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a society where there have never been so many poor, 
and in many cases, of such poverty.  We should recall the slogan 
of the Liberal government in 1968, which called for a just 
society.  This is how Pierre Elliott Trudeau's Liberals made 
their entry into government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people, who claimed to have a sense of fairness and to 
want to live in a fairer society, are becoming dramatically 
accustomed to living with a level of poverty that has never been 
so high.  It is important the federal government give the 
provincial governments the money it will transfer so they have 
additional resources in the housing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress enough with the Liberal ministers that the voice 
of Quebec must be heard and negotiations must continue.  There 
is no need for a bill like this. 
If the federal government wants to talk of housing, it will have 
the support of the opposition parties.  I am sure it will have 
the support of the Progressive Conservative Party, the Reform 
Party and the New Democratic Party if it wants to make more 
money available to the provinces, which should be the real 
agents in the area of housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a major shortage of resources.  However the federal 
government has a lot of money.  After dumping responsibilities, 
it has a huge amount of money.  In the fight against poverty, 
the least it could do is let the provincial governments, with 
Quebec in the lead, have some of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all of Canada, as we speak, two provinces are working on 
housing development, that is, permitting public housing to be 
built. 
There is Quebec, with one of the best governments ever assembled 
in the National Assembly.  Quebec has set aside $42 million for 
housing development.  Another province has also done so: British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Liberal members to vote in support of our 
amendments, because it is in the interest of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to enter the debate on Group No. 2.  These amendments 
from various members of the opposition parties all essentially 
deal with one subject: the governance, the administration and the 
devolution of powers with regard to the housing situation in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address my remarks primarily to the efficiency, the 
accountability and the effectiveness of the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation and the operation of the Government of Canada 
with regard to housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice a number of members of the Liberal Party are here.  It 
is to their advantage to listen carefully.  It would be very good 
if all of them were here to listen to some of the comments that 
are about to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  I must have hit some kind of chord. 
They all agree that they should be here listening to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not have a national housing policy.  There 
is a little bit here and a little bit there.  There is a little 
bit in CMHC and a little bit in some other kind of program. There 
is no consistent national housing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has been set up 
under the National Housing Act to implement the government's 
housing policy when in fact there is not one.  There is a whole 
bunch of hodgepodge itsy-bitsy pieces coming together.  Sometimes 
they work and sometimes they do not.  It is essential that we 
have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask whether the government believes that a 
hodgepodge is the best way to meet the housing problem in Canada 
today.  I submit that it is not.  The way to look after housing 
and to develop a solution to the housing problem in Canada would 
be to give the jurisdiction of this matter to those people who 
are closest to the situation and to the problem.  That would be 
the provinces and the municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that is precisely what was addressed by my 
hon. colleague who just spoke.  It is also a question that has 
been raised by the other opposition parties.  Huge sums of money 
are involved in the business of providing housing.  There is also 
a huge social problem which needs to be addressed.  We need to 
ask ourselves what is the best way to resolve this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the city of Toronto that commissioned a major study, 
the Golden report which was published in January of this year. It 
comes to grips with many of the issues we are dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the city of Toronto that has done good work. The 
magazine put out by the Canadian Housing Corporation made some 
very interesting points.  It indicated that the municipal 
governments throughout Canada that are closest to this problem 
have probably done a better job of coming to grips with it than 
any other level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprise, surprise.  Of course they have because the problem is 
before them virtually every day.  It deals with Vancouver and Van 
City Place, a 50 unit development for street involved youth. 
There is a new development of 40 singles in Toronto in addition 
to the Golden report.  The city of Montreal is an equal partner 
with the province of Quebec on a 50% cost sharing program 
designed to improve the quality of housing in central areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a small scale, the city of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, was a 
key player in establishing a new affordable home ownership 
initiative.  The city of Kamloops provides another example. 
Working in partnership with the Canadian Legion and a local 
developer, the city has provided land on a lease basis for a 
seniors condominium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Edmonton is an active partner in the Edmonton 
coalition of the homeless initiative to establish a housing trust 
fund.  The city of Saskatoon is similarly assisting the 
development of a trust fund.  The city of Toronto just 
established an $11 million capital revolving fund, using money 
collected from private developers in return for density bonuses 
over the past dozen years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A variety of cities large and small have shown not only that 
they can deal with the issue but that they actually are dealing 
with the issue.  It is significant that we can demonstrate the 
housing issue can be dealt with at the local level and that these 
governments are competent, able and willing to deal with the 
issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government through Canada Mortgage and Housing has vacated a 
large number of these areas.  It is confusing.  On the one hand 
it devolved the problems to the provinces but not with all 
provinces.  There is another confusion and that is the federal 
co-op development that has been happening in Canada.  In Ontario 
there is a real division.  Roughly 50% of the housing 
co-operatives are owned by the provincial government, or under 
the jurisdiction of the provincial government, and about 50% are 
under the jurisdiction of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand the government says it wants to divest itself 
and give it all to the provinces.  Lo and behold a lobby group is 
formed and is successful in saying that the federal co-ops should 
stay with the federal government.  That is exactly what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of housing co-operatives is a good one.  I like it a 
lot because it comes to grips with one of the fundamental 
principles of housing, the pride of ownership that goes along 
with owning a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Housing Act has given many people the right, 
privilege and opportunity to own their own homes.  It has been a 
benefit to all of them.  They have expressed their own 
individualism through housing.  People who are not as capable or 
not as able financially to do that have joined together with 
others and have formed a co-operative venture so that they can 
own their domicile co-operatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are different kinds of co-operatives.  We have mentioned 
federal and provincial co-operatives, but there is also those 
that are equity co-operatives and those that are non-equity 
sharing.  People who do not have the resources can get into a 
co-op, develop their equity and actually feel they are part of a 
co-operative, have an ownership and a direct interest, an equity 
interest in the particular place where they live.  It makes them 
accountable.  It makes them responsible.  It gives them a sense 
of pride as individuals to be able to express themselves in this 
way, which is highly desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A better solution to the whole business of social housing might 
be to allow these people to own some of it themselves and be able 
to share in the management and operation of a particular unit on 
a co-operative basis, rather than on a handout basis where it is 
given to them virtually without any strings attached and without 
any responsibility connected to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague was commenting on my speech.  I am so happy that he 
was impressed with it.  I just wish hon. members opposite would 
be as impressed as he was.  It is good to hear that common sense 
is recognized by both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation.  We need to have accountability.  We need to 
recognize that accountability is best found if the decisions are 
transparent and if the powers of the corporation are somewhat 
restricted.  The provisions of the bill give almost carte blanche 
to the management of Canada Mortgage and Housing to do whatever 
it wishes to do, whether it is to get involved as a intermediary 
in the financial marketplace or whether it is to have agents and 
branches in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments concerns the ability of Canada Mortgage 
and Housing to establish branches and agents.  It is not 
restricted to Canada.  They could be established anywhere in the 
world.  That is not what Canada Mortgage and Housing should be 
doing.  If the purpose is to establish Canada's national housing 
policy, it should not be allowed to establish agents and branches 
in a foreign nation somewhere. 
The loophole is not closed in this legislation.  It is important 
for the members opposite to recognize that this is Canada's 
mortgage and housing corporation, to implement Canada's national 
housing policy, and not some other national policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will make some brief comments on the amendments in the second 
group.  I will deal first with the amendments submitted by the 
member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, Motions Nos. 8, 10 and 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my understanding of the amendments is correct, the intention 
is to restrict financial assistance to non-profit and co-op 
associations when it comes to encouraging the building of rental 
housing projects on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly support and encourage the involvement of housing co-ops 
and other not for profit associations in the provision of rental 
housing, such as the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada. 
It has been helping to supply Canadians of mixed income with 
affordable housing for over 30 years.  The government should 
continue its commitment to co-op housing as a social policy 
instrument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention that non-profit and co-ops are not the 
only forms of social housing.  There are many innovative and 
successful private sector solutions for the provision of 
affordable housing; everything from large apartment buildings all 
the way down to single duplexes owned by small builders.  These 
small business people should not be excluded from the bill. They 
are also important in supplying affordable housing to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to Motions Nos. 7, 9, 13, 15, 18, 19, 21 and 
23.  My comments are relatively straightforward on these items. 
These motions would create a legislative requirement that cabinet 
advise Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation on how to 
implement certain aspects of its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two thoughts on this.  First, I am concerned that these 
amendments would place unnecessary restrictions on the CMHC that 
would require it to seek cabinet approval every single time the 
corporation wanted to assist an individual, group or company in 
setting up affordable housing projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, cabinet already provides policy direction to the CMHC on 
many issues.  In some cases, cabinet will want to direct the 
corporation on how to proceed in certain instances.  However, 
when and how cabinet should intervene should be at the discretion 
of cabinet and not be written inflexibly into the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 17, the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton has 
suggested that we specify the type of housing projects in section 
78 to be low rental housing projects.  I have no trouble with 
this amendment as it spells out in clearer language the intent of 
the act with respect to the development and financing of public 
housing.  I certainly see no great demand among Canadians that 
the government should be involved in financing upscale housing, 
so I would be pleased to support this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next two motions I would like to speak to are Motions Nos. 
17 and 35 put forward by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.  I understand the intention of the member 
with respect to the intrusion of the federal government into 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was just last year that we had to deal with a senseless and 
unprecedented program called the millennium scholarship fund. 
This was a unilateral and unwarranted invasion of Canada's 
provincially-run education system.  First, the government slashed 
educational transfers to the provinces by 40%, and then, to add 
insult to injury, it kept most of the money for itself and 
started a new program to solve the lack of money in education, a 
problem it created in the first place.  However, the program was 
not universal for all students as were the educational transfers 
it replaced. 
Much of the budget for the program will be eaten up in new 
administrative costs.  This program has set federal-provincial 
relations back several years.  This is certainly not a nightmare 
that my party and I would like to see repeated.  I think my hon. 
friend and I are in agreement on this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I differ from him is whether or not a real threat exists 
in this bill that would allow the government to create another 
millennium scholarship fund but this time in housing, an area of 
provincial jurisdiction.  I think the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is trying to kill a mosquito with a 
nuclear bomb when only a fly swatter is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my reading of the bill, in both sections that the member 
would like to amend, there is a requirement that CMHC create a 
program working jointly with the provincial governments.  That 
means that CMHC cannot proceed alone but must have the approval 
of the provincial government concerned and must work bilaterally 
with that province to produce a joint result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes beyond consultation, beyond co-operation or 
collaboration.  It requires CMHC to create a program that is the 
child of both the federal and the provincial governments.  Just 
as it takes two hands to make a handshake, there is no way the 
federal government can create a new program on its own according 
to the bill.  I am satisfied that the provisions in this bill 
provide sufficient protection against that happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lack of decent affordable housing and the proliferation of 
homelessness in the country is reaching dramatic proportions. 
Just last month, the Prime Minister appointed the new Minister of 
Labour from Moncton, New Brunswick as the new minister for 
homelessness.  Last Friday, during question period, a member of 
the Reform Party asked the new minister for homelessness a 
question and she denied being the new minister for homelessness. 
It is a shame that she has had the title for over a month now and 
does not even know what her job is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am saying that CMHC must have the flexibility to 
act jointly with provinces to solve these problems in different 
areas and under different circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two amendments, if passed, would prevent the provinces and 
CMHC from being able to implement solutions to housing problems, 
even if there is agreement between the provinces and CMHC, until 
a universal agreement on housing is signed covering all aspects 
of housing policy between the provinces and CMHC.  In other 
words, the provinces and CMHC could not solve any problem until 
they solved all of their problems.  This is too restrictive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66, as it stands now, will allow the provinces and CMHC 
to take action incrementally in areas where there is joint 
agreement without the requirement that they must agree on 
everything before moving forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise to speak to various motions presented by my 
hon. colleague.  The government does not support these motions 
and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot repeat it often enough.  What we have before us today 
are three visions of the relationship between the Government of 
Canada and CMHC.  The amendments being proposed by my colleague 
from Kelowna would, in my view, seriously undermine the 
government's ability to carry out its public policy role in 
housing which it fulfils through the renewed mandate of Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  Allow me to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to playing a leadership 
role in housing.  That is why the government renewed the mandate 
of its housing agency, CMHC, and has strengthened CMHC's ability 
to fulfil its mandate through amendments to Bill C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government understands the importance of helping Canadians 
meet their housing needs.  We understand the importance of 
building a strong competitive housing industry.  We know that 
good housing creates sound communities and a strong country.  We 
know that housing has a major impact on the economy of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 clearly states the public policy role of CMHC. I will 
quote from the bill itself.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Act, in relation to financing for housing, is 
to promote housing affordability and choice, to facilitate access 
to, and competition and efficiency in the provision of, housing 
finance, to protect the availability of adequate funding for 
housing at low cost, and generally to contribute to the 
well-being of the housing sector in the national economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely nobody could dispute the importance of these objectives. 
Yet the member proposes changes that would eliminate the 
government's ability to regulate CMHC should it be necessary to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to remove this section of the NHA as proposed. We 
would effectively be reducing the government's control, in other 
words, the public's control of CMHC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that if my hon. friend thought for a minute about 
what he was proposing, he would realize how ridiculous it is to 
imply that the public should not have the right to ensure that 
CMHC is accountable to them.  CMHC is a public institution with a 
public policy role, a role that has served Canadians so well for 
over 50 years.  To suggest that government control of a public 
institution should be reduced is somewhat bewildering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 will give CMHC the means to carry out its public 
policy role more effectively and in a financially prudent manner. 
That is what the Government of Canada expects.  That is what the 
people of Canada deserve.  That is what Bill C-66 is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the other extreme, we have the member from Cape Breton who 
would have every decision made by CMHC approved by the governor 
in council.  Perhaps the member does not realize that to do so 
would involve great expense, both in terms of administrative 
costs and in the quality of services that the Government of 
Canada can offer Canadians.  Indeed, the member would have the 
government return to the old days of red tape and heavy 
bureaucratic processes at the expense of the efficient delivery 
of important government services for needy Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member has presented a vision which would require that 
every service CMHC offers to individuals and communities be 
approved by the government of the particular province.  We know 
this vision would have the Government of Canada so hamstrung that 
we would not be able to serve the housing needs on reserves 
without provincial approvals.  This vision would also deny other 
needy Canadians access to important federal assistance should any 
of the provinces not consider the particular measure important or 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear:  The benefits conferred by the programs 
administered by CMHC are and will remain governed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 introduces a modern relationship between the 
Government of Canada and CMHC.   Bill C-66 calls for the approval 
of CMHC's corporate plan every year to ensure that the directions 
taken by CMHC meet the will and priorities of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, every year the House is involved in approving the 
resources given to CMHC to reach out to needy Canadians; to 
implement those programs that one member would rather not see 
regulated at all and that another member would regulate to the 
point of administrative paralysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the CMHC Act and the Financial Administration Act 
clearly confer to the government oversight in all aspects of the 
corporation's activities.  What more could the member want? Why, 
for instance, would we go so far as to endorse the proposal from 
the member from Cape Breton to have potentially every project 
approved by the governor in council? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision that we are proposing in Bill C-66 is a modern 
vision, a vision which will result in government services that 
are more responsive to the needs of Canadians and the needs of 
their regions, a vision which will better equip CMHC to work 
co-operatively with provinces, and a vision that at the end of 
the day will lead to a more efficient government.  That is a 
vision I think every Canadian would support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague the member for 
Compton—Stanstead for seconding my motion.  Obviously the 
Voisey's Bay nickel find in Labrador of major importance.  We 
have taken this time today to bring it to the attention of the 
House to see if we can exert some influence on the Government of 
Canada in particular and the Government of Newfoundland as well 
to expedite this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to introduce discussion today on this proposed 
development of the rich nickel deposits at Voisey's Bay in my 
home province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Members will note 
that my motion was originally filed exactly 19 months ago today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this period a series of developments have taken place 
which we hope can bring us closer to the approvals required for 
this project to proceed and for the maximum benefits to be 
realized for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and of 
course for Canada.  But it is symptomatic of our sometimes 
cumbersome system and the red tape that we create that even now 
questions remain about whether positive economic activity will be 
allowed to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that my Motion No. 194 was submitted over a 
year and a half ago, the questions it addresses remain pertinent 
and topical.  Developments on this file are ongoing and include 
the presentation of the environmental assessment panel's report 
to government on the first day of this month, the associated 
commentary from Inco representatives at the company's annual 
general meeting held yesterday, and ongoing consultations with 
aboriginal groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully understand that there are important questions which must 
be answered before a mining operation of this magnitude can be 
undertaken.  In this case the most important questions include 
the project's impact on the environment, the status of aboriginal 
land claims and the revenue sharing arrangements with the 
provincial government in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I feel it must be pointed out that those who 
propose to develop this rich natural resource, thereby creating 
employment and generating a new revenue source for our 
government, have to date lived up to their environmental 
responsibilities.  Inco has acted in good faith on the 
environmental assessment process and invested considerable time 
and resources to co-operate fully with the panel set up to review 
the various aspects of this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still some outstanding issues on the questions of 
processing and refining.  I am in full agreement with the 
province's position with regard to the requirement for a smelter 
and refinery in Argentia, Newfoundland.  Every Newfoundlander agrees 
that the export of these raw materials from our province would be 
absolutely devastating to our economy.  We are sticking to our 
guns.  We are, all of us together in Newfoundland and Labrador, 
saying to Incoand its shareholders that there must be a refinery and 
smelter in Newfoundland if there is to be a mine site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of my motion is to call on the Government of Canada 
to play a lead co-ordinating role in ensuring that while the 
important environmental and land claims issues are addressed, 
government itself does not become an impediment to progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with my colleagues the fact that new 
discoveries of nickel have been found in Australia and other 
places in the world.  Despite the fact that these deposits were 
found after the discovery in Voisey's Bay, the Australian 
projects in particular have in that time been designed, duly 
approved, developed, fully constructed and are now producing 
nickel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message is not complicated.  The message is simply let us 
not allow the machinery of government itself to constitute a 
barrier to economic activity.  Let us examine the advice 
carefully prepared through the work of the environmental 
assessment panel.  Let us consult with the aboriginal people who 
hold land claims in the area.  But let us do so in an expeditious 
manner so that when we know these valid considerations have been 
satisfied, we do not stand in the way or indeed cause even 
further delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed Voisey's Bay development has, since its inception, 
been faced with a series of obstacles to overcome.  I do not want 
to leave any member of the House with the impression that the 
concerns that lie behind some of these delays are not valid or 
important.  Nobody that I know of is suggesting that such a 
project would ever be undertaken without due regard for the 
environment and without close consultation with the aboriginal 
groups in the area.  But we must adopt a reasonable approach.  We 
must not be blind to the fact that our people suffer when the 
wheels of government turn so slowly that the viability of a 
significant development project is put in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some obvious practical matters to be taken into 
consideration with regard to the timing of the government 
decision and its impact on the Voisey's Bay development 
potential. One of these is the very short construction season 
available in Labrador. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the length and severity of the winter in the Labrador 
climate, construction can only be carried out during a relatively 
brief window of time every year.  As a consequence of this, a 
delay of, let us say, three months in the government's decision 
making does not mean a delay of only three months in the start of 
construction.  If the government were to wait until the end of 
this summer before giving its approval for the Voisey's Bay 
project to go ahead, the whole development would remain dormant, 
on ice, pardon the turn of phrase, until the weather warmed up 
some time in the year 2000 so the project could begin. 
A three month delay in decision makingmeans more than a full 
year's delay in construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that all members of the House are familiar with the 
difficulties experienced by the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador in adjusting from the collapse of the northern cod 
fishery that drove our economy for centuries. I and my colleagues 
in the Progressive Conservative caucus have identified the 
problems created by the fisheries crisis, emphasized the need for 
new avenues of economic growth and made constructive proposals to 
that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems are real and they have a human face.  I see it 
firsthand on a regular basis.  Many of the people affected are my 
constituents and still others have been forced from a lack of 
economic opportunity to leave our province. Can members present 
in the Chamber 
imagine that 30,000 Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have been forced 
to leave Newfoundland in the last three years alone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area of Placentia and Argentia for example is in my federal 
riding of St. John's West.  The closure of the former American 
military base in Argentia dealt a significant blow to the economy 
of that whole area of Placentia Bay. Since the Americans' 
departure, the Canadian government has invested in the 
neighbourhood of $100 million in environmental remediation, 
cleaning up the toxic waste and making the area suitable for new 
industrial and commercial development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those new industrial commercial developments is the 
Voisey's Bay smelter and refinery. Much of the land has been put 
on reserve for this project and indeed, we have probably lost 
some other business activity in the area because we are waiting 
for this smelter and refinery to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proponents of the Voisey's Bay project have proposed a 
smelting and refining facility for the Argentia area that will 
provide the much needed economic boost to the local economy. I 
take my responsibility to the people of this area very seriously. 
I am here as their elected representative to fight to make sure 
that the smelting and refining facility does become a reality in 
Argentia. We have a responsibility to seize every opportunity 
that will generate new activity in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with hon. members some information that 
illustrates the importance of new economic development in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the most recent labour force survey figures from 
Statistics Canada, unemployment in the province of Newfoundland 
stands at an intolerable 17.6%, more than twice the national 
average of 7.8%.  The rate is three times that of Alberta with 
5.8%, or Manitoba with 5.4% unemployed. That is good news for the 
people of those provinces and I congratulate the governments of 
Alberta, Manitoba and certainly Ontario for creating an 
environment in which economic activity is encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former U.S. President John F. Kennedy once said that a rising 
tide floats all boats.  I say to members that whatever positive 
signs may be evident in some parts of the country, Newfoundland 
and Labrador cannot afford to have a lethargic government act as 
an economic anchor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third party analysts agree that Newfoundland and Labrador will 
experience slower growth in 1999-2000 than it did last year. Even 
with developments in new industries outside the province's 
traditional economic backbone, the fishery, estimates are that 
growth in Newfoundland and Labrador next year will be only 
one-half of what it was last year. Surely it must be obvious that 
the last thing we would want to do is delay unnecessarily the 
start-up of a new development that will benefit the country, the 
province and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would like to make, lest I be accused by some of 
overstating the impact of the Voisey's Bay project, is that I 
realize this development in itself is not a panacea for all of 
our problems. We all know that the days of seeking the magic 
megaproject solution that can stand alone and satisfy all of our 
economic needs are long past.  This has much more to do with 
getting the fundamentals right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In getting the fundamentals right, Newfoundland and Labrador 
exports more raw material per capita than any other province in 
Canada.  Ontario as an example exports the least raw material per 
capita. There is an obvious correlation between the amount of 
raw materials we export and the unemployment rate. If rawmaterials 
are used wisely, we will get a much lower unemployment rate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity for an important new addition to the 
economy of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Moving forward with the 
project will be helpful.  Failure to do so, failure to take full 
advantage of our natural resources when the opportunity to 
develop them presents itself, would be a clear indication that we 
are a long way from being able to effectively build a new economy 
in the absence of a viable commercial cod fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues in this House to join with me in making a 
strong statement calling on the federal government to assume a 
leadership role not only in seeing that the necessary criteria 
are satisfied but also in co-ordinating negotiations among all 
the stakeholders.  Let us work to ensure that this project, 
including the Mill/mine in Labrador and the smelting and refining 
facilities in Argentia, can proceed without further delays for 
the benefit of all Newfoundlanders and indeed for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member for St. John's West and I can understand 
the passion with which he speaks.  One might wonder why the 
member for Etobicoke North would enter the debate on the project 
in Voisey's Bay.  I will give the House some background to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the good fortune to visit Voisey's Bay with my colleague 
from Labrador in 1996.  It was quite impressive and we could see 
the potential for this particular site for the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador and indeed the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for St. John's West said that this would be an 
important new addition to the economy of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  He asked for the federal government to assist in 
facilitating some resolution to this impasse.  I certainly would 
support that. This project is important to that region and to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem as I understand it is that the Newfoundland 
government has attached preconditions.  These preconditions are 
aligned, I suspect, with what the member opposite said, that the 
refinery would need to be located in Argentia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I think we need to ground some of the debate in 
business economics and logic. Going back to the original 
purchase, in 1994 Inco paid $4 billion for the Voisey's Bay 
discovery.  The price of nickel at that time was about $3.50 U.S. 
a pound.  It is now about half that price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have this important new addition to the economy of 
Newfoundland and Labrador given current economic conditions, 
which are really projected to last for some time regrettably, 
this project will not really be implemented. That would be a sad 
day for the people in Newfoundland and Labrador and it would be a 
sad day for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inco, as I understand it being a business, has to look at other 
options.  It is looking at a project in New Caledonia, a French 
colony near Australia.  Inco has to decide which one of these 
deposit sites is going to be developed next.  Is it going to be 
Voisey's Bay or New Caledonia?  Being a very strong Canadian 
company with a lot of roots in Canada, Inco would much prefer to 
develop the site at Voisey's Bay, but how can it when business 
economics argue totally against it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask why the member for Etobicoke North would be 
concerned.  I am concerned as a Canadian.  Having visited 
Labrador I would like to see the economy of Newfoundland benefit. 
I can understand why the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and 
their government are anxious to realize the full potential for 
their treasury and for their people, but we have to come back to 
basic business economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that if Inco decides to go to New Caledonia, 
Labrador will lose about 500 permanent direct jobs plus about 
1,200 spin-off jobs. 
It will also lose about $1.1 billion in investment for the mine, 
the mill and the concentrator facilities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member from Ontario let me say that Ontario is affected as 
well.  The way that Inco has proposed it, the only way the 
project can proceed is if the mining, the milling and the 
concentrating are done in Labrador.  At that point the 
concentrate would have to be sent to Quebec City or Sept-Îles and 
then moved to Sudbury, Ontario, or to Thompson, Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the only way that Inco seems to feel it can proceed.  It 
has its business people who understand business economics.  They 
are accountable to their shareholders. That is the only way it 
sees the project working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the project does not go ahead, northern Ontario and northern 
Manitoba will lose smelting and refining jobs.  Most of the 
smelting and refining of the New Caledonia concentrate will be 
done, for logistical and other reasons, in Japan and not in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland insists on the smelting capacity being located in 
Argentia.  Newfoundland and Canada are at risk of losing about 
$1.7 billion in taxes and other revenues over eight years.  Now 
that the election in Newfoundland is behind us, it is time for 
the Government of Newfoundland to look seriously at some business 
economics and get on with this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add some insult, I am afraid that in November 1998 the 
Newfoundland government announced amendments to the mineral act 
which gave the provincial cabinet the power to decide what was 
economically viable.  The cabinet in Newfoundland, while we 
respect that it has good analysts and other people for advice, 
has the power to tell Inco, which is a business with 
shareholders, employees and other stakeholders groups to whom it 
is accountable and spends its whole life running businesses, that 
Newfoundland will decide what is economically feasible and what 
is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is quite tragic.  We are depriving Canada, Newfoundland, 
Labrador, Ontario and Manitoba of jobs, revenue and economic 
activity because of an understandable passion by the Newfoundland 
government not to repeat mistakes it has made in the past.  We 
can understand that sensitivity, but when the price of nickel is 
half what it was when the project was conceived, it is a matter 
of economics.  Sometimes we cannot have the full cake and have to 
accept half the cake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe strongly that Inco is quite prepared to sit down with 
the Government of Newfoundland.  Perhaps the Government of Canada 
could play a facilitative role in bringing the parties together, 
cutting through the rhetoric, getting down to the basics of 
creating jobs and economic activity in Canada.  If that could 
happen I know it would be very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project at Voisey's Bay is a staggeringly attractive 
proposition.  As I said, I had the pleasure of visiting it and 
seeing the area oozing with hope and the dreams of the people who 
will be involved.  However, they will not be involved if the 
people of Newfoundland and Inco cannot get together to make the 
project a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support what the hon. member is saying.  The Government of 
Canada should play a facilitative role, but I do not see how it 
can do that if the Government of Newfoundland is saying there are 
preconditions, that the smelting capacity must be in Argentia. 
That is a huge stumbling block. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the member opposite in the sense of moving the project 
forward.  I would argue that our government should be involved in 
helping to get the project rolling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to the motion put forward by the 
hon. member for St. John's West.   For those Canadians watching 
these proceedings on television, I would like to read the motion 
that is currently before us: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House the government should become 
actively involved in the Voisey's Bay nickel project, specifically 
to speed up the settling of native land claims and to expedite 
the completion of all environmental studies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member certainly has more faith in the federal 
government than I have.  I understand his frustration at the 
seemingly endless process of study and negotiations and more 
study and negotiations.  However, I would never have thought I 
would hear anyone on the opposition side of the House looking to 
the federal government to expedite anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims of tainted blood have been waiting for over a year 
for compensation.  We could ask them what they think of the 
government's ability to be expeditious.  Newfoundlanders in 
particular have not been served well by the Liberal government. 
The TAGS program has been a disaster for Newfoundlanders and was 
a band-aid solution in place of real reforms of the cod 
fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hibernia project has been another Liberal failure.  Not one 
oil manufacturing job will be created in Newfoundland as a result 
of the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Churchill Falls is another example.  Newfoundland lost $1 
billion a year as a result of a do-nothing Liberal government 
that refuses to give Newfoundlanders a fair deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seal hunt has also been systematically destroyed by the 
Liberal bureaucratic red tape that has prevented the export of 
seal projects around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are four good reasons why we should not invite the Liberal 
government to get involved in this project.  Newfoundlanders are 
better served by negotiating on their own terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Voisey's Bay project has been stalled and 
delayed, not because there has not been enough government 
interest in the matter but because there has been too much. This 
is no longer a business venture.  It is a three ring political 
circus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the players already involved in this project. 
Inco Limited is involved.  As it is the private sector company 
ready to take on the risk of the project it will be the one 
creating the wealth and the jobs.  It will be the one jumping 
through the political hoops trying to please the various 
stakeholders involved in the project, many of whom have very 
legitimate concerns that must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the patience of Inco's president, Scott Hand.  It 
seems that Canadian entrepreneurs have unfortunately had to 
become politicians and spin doctors.  That is the new cost of 
doing business in the Canadian economy and more federal 
intervention, as is proposed in the motion, is not the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to encourage Mr. Hand to continue to 
negotiate with the province.  The Newfoundland people want this 
project, need this project, and are ready and able to make this 
project a success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Labrador Inuit Association and Innu nation are also involved 
in the negotiations, representing the interests of the first 
nations people in the area.  They have been active participants 
in the creation of a 200 page study of the project that contained 
over 100 recommendations.  On the basis of this report, it looks 
as if the Voisey's Bay negotiations may have been given a second 
life and a second chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land claim concerns and benefit agreements brought forward 
by these groups are currently being considered by Inco.  The 
environmental study has given the company a conditional green 
light to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Newfoundland is also involved in this matter. 
While Brian Tobin is working for the people of Newfoundland, I 
believe he can learn a lesson from Alberta about creating 
economic growth.  In Alberta we are working to remove the 
barriers impeding economic progress and development.  In 
Newfoundland they are erecting new ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleague from St. John's wants to be of some 
assistance to his constituents, and I know he does, he should ask 
Mr. Tobin a simple question: Is Newfoundland open for business? 
Nobody questions where Mr. Tobin's loyalties lie.  I would 
however question his commitment to liberalizing the Newfoundland 
economy to encourage domestic and foreign investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the Voisey's Bay project and economic development 
in general is not further political meddling.  We need to see the 
development of sensible and workable environmental policies that 
allow for sustainable economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental regulations are another tax on Canadian 
businesses.  While many of them are necessary, others are not. 
There is a balance that must be struck.

according to fair and equitable guidelines, but this must be done 
on a comprehensive basis so that it does not continue to be a 
never ending barrier to economic development in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians and lawyers have hijacked land claim issues and it 
is the grassroots Inuit or other aboriginals who have suffered. I 
once again applaud the author of the motion for allowing debate 
in the House on the Voisey's Bay project.  However I do not 
believe he will find a solution through this arrogant and out of 
touch Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
encouraged to hear members say that the Voisey's Bay project 
could find minerals in my riding of Manicouagan.  I am referring 
to Sept-Îles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to this motion regarding the problems of 
the nickel project in Voisey's Bay, Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion recommends that the government become actively 
involved in this project; on the one hand, to speed up the 
settling of land claims from aboriginal communities present in 
the area and, on the other hand, to ensure that all 
environmental studies necessary for implementation of the 
project are duly completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports this motion.  In order to explain 
our position, I will give some essential background and history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inco Ltd., the main backer of the Voisey's Bay nickel project, 
has its eye on lands in the far northeast corner of Labrador. 
But the Inuit and Innu in this region have lived on these lands 
for thousands of years.  Clearly, these are their traditional 
hunting and fishing grounds. 
They also grow certain medicinal plants there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is that these northern communities have, from 
time immemorial, maintained a close relationship with the land 
and its resources.  Their traditional economy is based on the 
bounty of nature and the land, for instance boots made of skins, 
bone and ivory needles, food-gathering, trapping, and so forth. 
In addition to providing for the material needs of the Labrador 
Inuit and Innu, the land is at the heart of their relationship 
with other works of the Creator, and their spirituality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in its 1996 report, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples identified the land as one of the four fundamental 
themes of the northern first nations' culture.  In other words, 
the land is extremely important for the culture and the soul of 
a northern aboriginal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us get back to the issue before us. The Innu and the 
Inuit have important land claims in the Voisey's Bay region. These 
claims obviously concern traditional lands that are filled with 
memories and that have been used by generations of Innu and 
Inuit. These claims are still not settled and now there is this 
nickel mining project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that the federal government and the 
Newfoundland government must sit down with the Innu and Inuit 
communities to settle their claims, this before allowing Inco to 
begin mining operations in Voisey's Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, in my view, a basic issue of respect for the aboriginal 
community that lives there and for which these lands are 
literally their living environment, one that also reflects their 
cultures. In short, these lands are their universe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mining project is a good development opportunity for 
Labrador. It could even, based on my information, benefit 
communities as far as Sept-Îles. For the moment, I cannot say any 
more on the subject. However, we must not forget that it will 
also, in all likelihood, have a negative environmental impact on 
that region. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT48"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT48"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore imperative that the federal government try to 
settle the claims of the Innu and Inuit, so that Inco's arrival 
in Labrador can take place in a climate of mutual co-operation 
between those involved, and in the respect of the aboriginal 
community living on that territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Voisey's Bay mining operation must necessarily 
include guarantees and a significant compensation package for 
the first nations directly affected by this mining project. The 
motion before us generally goes in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, a few years ago, the federal government, the 
Newfoundland government and the Innu and Inuit communities in 
Labrador appointed a group to examine the impact of the Voisey's 
Bay mining project. The group tabled its report on April 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recommended, among other things, to settle the issue of land 
claims and to arrive at an agreement between the company, the 
governments and the aboriginals on the sharing of benefits—we are 
talking billions of dollars—from the mining project. Indeed, this 
is the way we will have to go, it would seem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the land claims issue is still not resolved, particularly 
in the case of the Innu, there is also another basic issue that 
remains unresolved, namely the environmental impact of the 
mining project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, at this time, the Inuit and the Innu of Labrador still 
do not know where the smelter will be located and what will 
happen to the slag it will produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of contaminants contained in this residue, 
and the wind may carry them to adjacent soil and water.  These 
vital problems are still on the back burner.  The Bloc Quebecois 
is therefore calling upon the federal government, as the motion 
proposes, to become actively involved so that all of the 
environmental studies will be completed in order for the 
aboriginal population, and all other individuals or groups 
affected, to have the proper information on environmental 
impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, if this development project, which is of 
importance for Labrador, is to be given the green light to 
proceed, first the native land claims by the inhabitants of this 
area, the Innu and the Inuit, must be settled. 
It must also be ensured that the environmental consequences of 
mining operations are analyzed in depth and that the information 
relating to this, which is of such vital importance, must be 
made publicly available.  In other words, the project is a good 
thing, but not at any price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is required first of all is to sit down, put all the pieces 
of the puzzle together, scrutinize all the implications of the 
project, while maintaining harmony, good faith and respect among 
all partners associated in the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certain, indispensable even, that the federal government 
must get actively involved in resolving the major problems I 
have raised here.  There is much still to be done, so it is very 
much in the federal government's interests to roll up its 
sleeves and get cracking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Motion M-194 is along the same lines as my own 
observations, I support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to discuss this motion, which was put

Voisey's Bay project.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is timely in that a significant step was recently 
taken with the release on April 1 of the environmental assessment 
panel's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into the issue, there are a couple of points I 
want to make with respect to the remarks made by the Reform 
member for Edmonton—Strathcona.  He spoke disparagingly about 
some of the programs which the Government of Canada has in place 
in the province of Newfoundland.  He spoke about the TAGS 
program, for instance.  The TAGS program, the Atlantic groundfish 
strategy, was put in place to help people in their time of need. 
We were there for the people of Newfoundland as a result of the 
downturn in the cod fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also spoke about the seal hunt.  I really do not know what 
his point was on that, other than he was flopping around like a 
seal on the ice and he would not know the difference between a 
codfish and a seal if he saw one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important to review the historical context of 
this project so that we can more fully appreciate the present 
situation and some of the complexities that still lie ahead. 
However, before I begin I would like to preface my remarks with a 
couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Government of Canada's position regarding the 
Voisey's Bay project is that this is a matter to be resolved 
between the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, which is the 
manager of the mineral resource, and the Voisey's Bay Nickel 
Company, which is the firm proposing to develop the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to emphasize that while it is up to the 
province and the company to negotiate a mutually beneficial 
outcome, the federal government strongly supports all positive 
endeavours to this end and looks forward to its successful 
completion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to make is that the Government of 
Canada is heavily involved in native land claim negotiations 
across the country and is doing everything in its power to 
resolve all such claims as expeditiously as possible.  The 
Government of Canada is committed to the land claims negotiations 
in Labrador and to a fair and equitable process and outcome. 
These talks have their own pace and the government does not want 
to jeopardize them by attempting to advance them beyond that 
pace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project we are addressing today concerns a mine and a mill 
near Voisey's Bay on the northern coast of Labrador.  This is a 
rugged area, with rough terrain and a sub-Arctic climate of short 
summers and long winters, which was a point made by the member 
for St. John's West earlier.  It is located between the Inuit 
community of Nain and the Innu community known as Davis Inlet. 
The area is the subject of overlapping land claims on the part of 
the Labrador Inuit Association and the Innu Nation.  The land 
holds an estimated 150 million tonnes of ore containing nickel, 
copper and cobalt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minerals were first discovered in this vicinity in 1993 by a 
company called Archean, which was under contract to Diamond 
Fields Resources Incorporated.  Two years later, in 1995 and 
1996, Inco Limited purchased the area in two stages for $4.3 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Voisey's Bay Nickel Company, an Inco subsidiary, has 
proposed to develop a nickel, copper and cobalt mine and mill in 
the area.  The nickel concentrate from the mill would be sent 
elsewhere for processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1996 the Voisey's Bay Nickel Company announced that 
it had chosen Argentia, Newfoundland as the site for a smelter 
and refinery complex.  The company estimated that the two sites 
together would create 3,500 direct and indirect jobs in the 
province, and that we all certainly would welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 31, 1997 the four principal parties involved in the 
Voisey's Bay project, that is, the Government of Canada, the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Labrador Inuit 
Association and the Innu Nation, signed a memorandum of 
understanding to establish the environmental review process. 
Under the MOU a five person environmental assessment panel was 
appointed. 
The panel held two rounds of public consultations over the next 
year and a half.  The first round began that spring.  The second 
round of consultations took place in the fall of 1998, from 
September 9 to November 6.  The company was also at those 
hearings to explain the project and to respond to any concerns 
and questions raised by participants.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the period between the two rounds of consultations 
several events took place that had a significant impact on the 
project's negotiations and progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1997 the Newfoundland court of appeal issued a 
temporary injunction blocking the company from building a 
temporary road and airstrip that would allow it to begin 
underground exploration.  The next month the company announced 
that it was delaying the Voisey's Bay start-up date, which had 
originally been scheduled for late 1999, by at least one year. 
Three days later, on September 22, the Supreme Court of 
Newfoundland stipulated that the road and airstrip were an 
integral part of the mine and that the company must refrain from 
any underground exploration until it had received environmental 
clearance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring of 1998 the Federal Court of Canada heard 
arguments put forward by the Citizens Mining Council of 
Newfoundland and Labrador that the project's environmental 
assessment should include both Voisey's Bay and Argentia sites. 
On March 8 of this year the court ruled that the law did not 
impose a duty in the circumstances of this case to include the 
two projects in one environmental assessment.  This decision 
served to remove any uncertainty over the environmental 
assessment process for the two sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Newfoundland rejected the new proposal of Inco on the 
ground that it was not of sufficient benefit to the province. 
It took the position that the project would not proceed unless 
all of the ore was processed within provincial boundaries and 
that the company's investment must include a smelter at Argentia 
in order to maximize the number of jobs for Newfoundland and 
Labrador citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 23, 1998 Newfoundland suspended negotiations.  A few 
days later the company halted its engineering and procurement 
activities relating to construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these events were going on, parallel talks were also 
taking place with the Labrador Inuit Association and the Innu 
Nation.  The negotiations were being conducted separately with 
each of the two native groups.  I would like to emphasize that 
these organizations, as well as other aboriginal groups, have 
been an integral part of the environmental assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with the two aboriginal groups are continuing.  The 
federal government is strongly committed to forging new 
partnerships with native peoples.  It is through the successful 
negotiation of major projects such as Voisey's Bay that the 
government will build and maintain such partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, therefore, that the Government of Canada is strongly 
committed to a fair and equitable process and outcome.  It is 
making every effort in its power to achieve such a result as soon 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the sometimes rocky road behind us, I am happy to report 
that events have in the past few months taken a much more 
positive turn.  On February 10, 1999 the Premier of Newfoundland 
and Labrador indicated his willingness to renew talks with 
Voisey's Bay Nickel Company after the company said that it too 
hoped to resume negotiations.  The four MOU parties have since 
held discussions and have reached a preliminary agreement on a 
broad framework for future consultations.  I understand that 
formal consultations are expected to begin on May 3, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, the 
environmental assessment panel released its report on April 1, 
1999.  This represents a significant milestone.  The Government 
of Canada and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, as 
well as native groups, are now in the process of reviewing the 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by stating the government's view that a positive 
spirit of co-operation on the part of all parties will ensure 
that everyone concerned achieves mutually beneficial results from 
this impressive project.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I should advise the House that if the 
hon. member for St. John's West speaks now he will terminate the 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. members who have spoken.  Some were in support of 
the motion and I am not so sure others were supporting it or not. 
However I thank all hon. members for their contributions to this 
important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Malpeque just outlined a decent history of what 
has happened and how government will proceed with supporting this 
major development.  In the case of the Government of Canada the 
major role it can play is in the lands claim area.  I hope the 
motion will encourage the government to speed up and to make a 
priority of land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land claims for Newfoundland and Labrador relating to Voisey's 
Bay are a little more important and urgent than they may be in 
other parts of the country because of what I said about the 
economy of Newfoundland and Labrador.  We have to have priorities 
as a House of Commons and as a Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a priority for land claims settlement in Canada, it 
should be in Labrador to make sure this development can go ahead. 
I also thank my friend from Quebec who talked about the 
settlement for aboriginal peoples which comes from the land 
claims issue and his concern for the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not in a confrontational way I want to say in particular to the 
member from Etobicoke why this project is so important to 
Newfoundland and Labrador and why it is different from the norm. 
We just celebrated 50 years of Confederation a few days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Our union with Canada has been an 
amazingly good stroke of luck for the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  It has helped us in many ways.  It has given us a 
social safety net.  It has allowed us to access the Canadian 
economy in many ways.  It has served in many ways to benefit 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it has not always worked as well as it could have or 
should have.  Certain things have happened to Newfoundland and 
Labrador because of our union with Canada that really should not 
have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have an unemployment rate that is twice the national 
average.  Why is that so?  Why does Newfoundland and Labrador 
have twice asmany people unemployed every single day of every 
single week of every single month of every single year for 50 years? 
There has to be something wrong. There has to be some way that can be 
rectified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the problems we have.  Our unemployment 
situation is obvious.  Some 30,000 people left Newfoundland in 
the last three years alone.  That would be comparable to 7,500 
people leaving Prince Edward Island.  It is unbelievable to think 
that can happen consistently and still have a viable entity as a 
province with health and education systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give the member from Etobicoke a little history of 
what happens in Newfoundland and Labrador. One thing that happened in 
Newfoundland that should never have happened was that the 
Government of Canada forced the tiny unimportant province of 
Newfoundland to sign a deal on the Upper Churchill agreement, 
which has cost Newfoundland citizens anywhere between $700 
million and $800 million every year since 1969.  We could be a 
have province.  We could contribute positively in a revenue sense 
to Canada.  That is one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we do in Newfoundland and Labrador is because of the 
nature of where we are and of industry in Canada.  Maybe we should 
send all our fish to be processed in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia 
because there is excess capacity there.  Maybe we should take all the 
nickel we have and send it to Sudbury for smelting. It would be 
logical to ask what Newfoundland and Labrador can supply to Canada. 
We can supply raw materials and labourers, I suppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the nature of Confederation as we want it to be. 
There is a difference.  There is an opportunity for the 
Government of Canada and the province.  There is a problem with 
the provinces in some of its stances in negotiating with Inco.  If 
we were to work this arrangement through it would show to all 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians and all other people of Canada 
we can be allowed in Newfoundland and Labrador to earn our own keep. 
We can be allowed to make our living, pay taxes and contribute 
revenue to the country of Canada.  We can do it just using our own 
resources.  We are not asking for a whole lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Inco deal, the Voisey's Bay deal, and 48 million 
barrels of oil off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland this year, but 
we are not allowed to refine any of it in Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  What should we do, just basically supply raw 
materials? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendous correlation between Newfoundland having 
the highest per ratio export of raw materials and the highest 
unemployment rate, and Ontario having just the opposite.  It does 
not export raw materials to the same degree per capita 
and has a high employment rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have to do in Newfoundland and Labrador and that 
is why Voisey's Bay is not just a mine.  It is an opportunity for 
Newfoundland and Labrador and Canada to put our partnership right, 
to allow those of us in Newfoundland and Labrador to contribute. 
I hope this debate highlights the issue so that some of the people 
in the House can have a full understanding of the history 
of what has happened in Newfoundland and Labrador and why Voisey's Bay 
is so important to us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Mr. Václav Havel and Mrs. Havlovà were welcomed by the Right 
Honourable Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada, by the 
Honourable Gildas L. Molgat, Speaker of the Senate and by the 
Honourable Gilbert Parent, Speaker of the House of Commons.</I> 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Parent (Speaker of the House of Commons):</B> 
Mr. President, Madam Havlovà, Senators, distinguished guests and

guests:  the Right Honourable Jean Chrétien.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B>  Speakers of 
the House of Commons and Senate, honourable members, ladies and 
gentlemen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once in a great while, members of the two Houses of the Canadian 
Parliament put aside partisan differences, silence our debates 
and come together on our very, very best behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For anyone who has ever watched our daily proceedings, such 
occasions are nothing short of a miracle.  And I must admit, they 
are right, especially today, for we have in our presence a 
leader, a truly remarkable leader, whose perseverance in the face 
of tyranny, whose dignity in the face of persecution, helped to 
make possible the democratic transformation of his people, his 
country and his continent ten years ago; a transformation which, 
by any standard, was a miracle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of course of the President of the Czech Republic, 
Václav Havel. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great Victor Hugo once wrote that not even the strongest 
army in the world can defeat an idea whose time has come.  But 
it is also true that, for any idea to triumph in its time, there 
must first be a champion, a leader, a symbol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, in your long crusade for freedom and justice, you 
led a mighty struggle against some of the strongest enemies 
known to human progress: fear and oppression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armed only with the courage of your convictions and the 
rightness of your cause, you triumphed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your childhood was spent, first, under foreign occupation, and 
then under the consolidation of a brutal totalitarian regime. A 
regime that chose to block your aspirations in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most of us, wounds like these might have created bitterness 
and a sense of personal futility.  But in you, they fuelled the 
writing and acts of conscience which captured the longing of 
your countrymen and the admiration of the entire world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You revealed the hollowness of an imposed political system, and 
your words and deeds helped secure its doom.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time came, after so many years of privation, you were 
the only real choice to lead a country that was new again, to 
define its new politics, its economic transformation and its new 
relationships within Europe and beyond. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, I would like to quote from your first New Year's 
address to your people: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may ask what kind of republic I dream of.  Let me reply: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dream of a republic independent, free and democratic; of a 
republic economically prosperous and yet socially just; in short, 
of a humane republic that serves the individual and that, 
therefore, holds the hope that the individual will serve it in 
turn. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you visited Canada for the first time in early 1990 that 
vision was still to be made real.  Today the Czech Republic is 
one of the leading democracies of central and eastern Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your economic transformation, despite certain challenges today, 
will lead toward membership in the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are a partner of Canada in NATO, the OECD, and you are 
active in the WTO.  Our soldiers are keeping the peace in Bosnia 
and we make common cause in the OSCE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have sent some of your finest sons and daughters to Canada 
over the past century, who have become some of our most 
distinguished business leaders, academics, writers and, of 
course, hockey players.  I have to tell you, Mr. President, that 
one of your fellow citizens, Dominik Hasek, is not very popular 
in Ottawa these days, but it is very nice of you to come here to 
compensate for that humiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return, over the past decade Canada has done its best to 
support your country in re-establishing democracy and recreating 
a market economy.  Together we are also seeking to build new 
trade and investment links of mutual benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. President, your personal journey and that of the Czech 
Republic speak to how far the cause of freedom and human rights 
have come in Europe, but the crisis in Kosovo is a stark reminder 
of how much further there is to go.  And if I might be so bold, 
if that journey is to have lasting meaning in the Europe of the 
new millennium, then its simple and powerful lessons must be 
applied without hesitation in that complex and troubled land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Kosovo, and everywhere in Europe, must one day 
feel the same security and attachment to their homelands that you 
described in your dream of a humane republic; ideals that you 
have done so much to make a reality in the Czech Republic of 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fortified by the knowledge that someone of your unshakeable 
faith in the forces of justice and right has taken up this cause 
without hesitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together with our NATO allies we are doing the right thing in 
Kosovo.  Together we will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an age of overstatement, Mr. President, where the 
meaning and value of words are often made cheap by excess 
rhetoric, but for you there can be no overstatement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my great pleasure and honour to introduce to this 
honourable House a beacon of freedom, a man whose achievements 
repudiate the idea that poets and dreamers have no place among 
statesmen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ladies and gentlemen, a poet, a dreamer and a great statesman, 
Václav Havel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Václav Havel (President of the Czech Republic):</B>  Prime 
Minister, Speaker of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Commons, 
members of the Senate and the House of Commons, distinguished 
guests, I certainly do not need to emphasize how honoured I am to 
address you.  With your permission, I shall use this opportunity 
for a few remarks concerning the state and its probable position 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is every indication that the glory of the nation state, as 
a climax of the history of every national community and the 
highest earthly value, in fact the only one in whose name it is 
permissible to kill or which is worth dying for, is already past 
its culminating point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the enlightened endeavours of generations of 
democrats, the horrible experience of two world wars, which 
contributed so substantially to the adoption of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the overall development 
of our civilization, are gradually bringing the human race to the 
realization that a human being is more important than a state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idol of state sovereignty must inevitably dissolve in a 
world that connects people, regardless of borders, through 
millions of links of integration ranging from trade, finance and 
property, up to information; links that impart a variety of 
universal notions and cultural patterns.  Furthermore, it is a 
world in which danger to some has an immediate bearing on all; in 
which, for many reasons, especially because of the massive 
advancement of science and technology, our fates are merged 
together into one single destiny; and in which we all, whether we 
like it or not, suffer responsibility for everything that occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that in such a world, blind love for one's own 
state, a love that does not recognize anything above itself, 
finds excuses for any action of the own state simply because it 
is one's own state, and rejects anything else simply because it 
is different, inevitably turns into a dangerous anachronism, a 
hotbed of conflicts and, eventually, a source of immeasurable 
human suffering.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in the coming century most states will begin to 
transform from cult-like objects, which are charged with 
emotional contents, into much simpler and more civil 
administrative units, which will be less powerful and, 
especially, more rational and will constitute merely one of the 
levels in a complex and stratified planetary societal 
self-organization. This change, among other things, should 
gradually antiquate the idea of non-intervention, that is, the 
concept of saying that what happens in another state, or the 
measure of respect for human rights there, is none of our 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will take over the various functions that are now performed 
by the state? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us first speak about the emotional functions. These, I 
believe, will begin to be distributed more equally amongst all 
the various spheres that make up human identity, or in which 
human beings exercise their existence.  By this I mean the 
various layers of that which we perceive as our home or our 
natural world; our family, our company, our village or town, our 
region, our profession, our church or our association, as well as 
our continent and, finally, our earth, the planet which we 
inhabit.  All this constitutes the various environments of our 
self-identification; and, if the bond to one's own state, 
hypertrophied until now, is to be weakened it must necessarily be 
to the benefit of all these other environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the practical responsibilities and the jurisdictions of 
the state, these can go in only two directions:  downward or 
upward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Downwards applies to the various organs and structures of civil 
society to which the state should gradually transfer many of the 
tasks it now performs itself.  Upwards applies to various 
regional, transnational or global communities or organizations. 
This transfer of functions has already begun.  In some areas, it 
has progressed quite far; in others, less so.  However, it is 
obvious that the trend of development must, for many different 
reasons, go along this path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If modern democratic states are usually defined by such 
characteristics as respect for human rights and liberties, 
equality of citizens, the rule of law and civil society, then the 
manner of existence toward which humankind will move from here, 
or toward which humankind should move in the interest of its own 
preservation, will probably be characterized as an existence 
founded on a universal or global respect for human rights, a 
universal equality of citizens, a universal rule of law and a 
global civil society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest problems that accompanied the formation of 
nation-states was their geographical delimitation, that is, the 
definition of their boundaries.  Innumerable factors, ethnic, 
historical and cultural considerations, geological elements, 
power interests, as well as the overall state of civilization, 
have played a role here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of larger regional or transnational communities 
will sometimes be afflicted with the same problem; to some 
extent, this burden will possibly be inherited from the very 
nation-states that enter into such entities.  We should do 
everything in our power to ensure that this self-definition 
process will not be as painful as was the case when nation-states 
were formed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to give you one example.  Canada and the Czech Republic 
are now allies as members of the same defence association, the 
North Atlantic Alliance.  This is a result of a process of 
historic importance; NATO's enlargement with states of Central 
and Eastern Europe.  The significance of this process stems from 
the fact that this is the first truly serious and historically 
irreversible step to break down the Iron Curtain and to abolish, 
in real terms and not just verbally, that which was called the 
Yalta arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enlargement, as we all know, was far from easy and has 
become a reality only ten years after the bipolar division of the 
world came to an end.  One of the reasons why progress was so 
difficult was the opposition on the part of the Russian 
Federation; they asked, uncomprehendingly and worriedly, why the 
West was enlarging and moving closer to Russia without taking 
Russia itself in its embrace. This attitude, if I disregard all 
other motives for the moment, reveals one very interesting 
element:  an uncertainty about where the beginning is, and where 
the end is, of that which might be called the world of Russia, or 
the East.  When NATO offers Russia its hand in partnership, it 
does so on the assumption that there are two large and equal 
entities:  the Euro-Atlantic world and a vast Euro-Asian power. 
These two entities can, and must, extend their hands to each 
other and co-operate; this is in the interest of the whole world. 
But they can do this only when they are conscious of their own 
identities; in other words, when they know where each of them 
begins and ends.  Russia has had some difficulty with that in its 
entire history, and it is obviously carrying this problem with it 
into the present world in which the question of delimitation is 
no longer about nation-states but about regions or spheres of 
culture and civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, Russia has a thousand things that link it with the 
Euro-Atlantic world or the so-called West; but, it also has a 
thousand things which differ from the West, just like Latin 
America, Africa, the Far East or other regions or continents of 
today's world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that these worlds, or parts of the world, differ from 
one another does not mean that some are more worthy than others. 
They are all equal.  They are only different in certain ways, but 
being different is not a disgrace.  Russia, on the one hand, 
deems it very important to be seen as an entity of moment, an 
entity which deserves special treatment, that is, as a global 
power; but at the same time it is uncomfortable with being 
perceived as an independent entity that can hardly be part of 
another entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Russia is becoming accustomed to the enlargement of the 
Alliance; one day it will become acclimated to it completely. Let 
us just hope that this will not be merely an expression of 
Engels' “recognized necessity” but an expression of a new, more 
profound self-understanding.  Just as others must learn to 
redefine themselves in the new multicultural and multipolar 
environment, Russia must learn it also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means not only that it cannot forever substitute 
megalomania or simply self-love for natural self-confidence but 
also that it must recognize where it begins and where it ends. 
For example, the huge Siberia with its vast natural resources is 
Russia but the tiny Estonia is not Russia and never will be.  If 
Estonia feels that it belongs to the world represented by the 
North Atlantic Alliance or the European Union, this must be 
understood and respected and it should not be seen as an 
expression of enmity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this example I would to illustrate the following.  The 
world of the 21st century, provided that humankind withstands all 
the dangers that it is preparing for itself, will be a world of 
an ever closer co-operation on a footing of equality among larger 
and mostly transnational bodies that will sometimes cover whole 
continents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order that the world can be like this, individual entities, 
cultures or spheres of civilization must clearly recognize their 
own identities, understand what makes them different from others 
and accept the fact that such otherness is not a handicap but a 
singular contribution to the global wealth of the human race.  Of 
course, the same must be recognized also by those who, on the 
contrary, have the inclination to regard their otherness as a 
reason for feeling superior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important organizations, in which all states as 
well as major transnational entities meet as equals for debate 
and make many important decisions which affect the whole world, 
is the United Nations.  I believe that if the United Nations is 
to successfully perform the tasks to be imposed on it by the next 
century it must undergo a substantial reform.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Security Council, the most important organ of the United 
Nations, can no longer maintain conditions from the time when the 
organization first came into being.  Instead it must equitably 
mirror the multipolar world of today.  We must reflect on whether 
it is indispensable that one state, even if only theoretically, 
could outvote the rest of the world.  We must consider the 
question of which great, strong and numerous nations do not have 
permanent representation in that body.  We must think out the 
pattern of rotation of the non-permanent members and a number of 
other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make the entire vast structure of the United Nations 
less bureaucratic and more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must deliberate on how to achieve real flexibility in the 
decision making of UN bodies, particularly of its plenary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, I believe we should ensure that all the 
inhabitants of our earth regard the United Nations as an 
organization that is truly theirs, not just as a club of 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crucial point is what the UN can accomplish for the people 
of this planet, not what it does for individual states as states. 
Therefore, changes should probably be made also in the procedures 
for the financing of the organization, for the application of its 
documents and for the scrutiny of their applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a matter of abolishing the powers of states and 
establishing some kind of a giant global state instead.  The 
matter is that everything should not always flow, forever, solely 
through the hands of states or their governments. It is in the 
interest of humanity, of human rights and liberties as well as of 
life in general, that there is more than one channel through 
which the decisions of planetary leadership flow to the citizens 
and the citizens' will reaches the planetary leaders.  More 
channels mean more balance and a wider mutual scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope it is evident that I am not fighting here against the 
institution of the state as such.  It would, for that matter, be 
rather absurd if the head of a state addressing the 
representative bodies of another state pleaded that states should 
be abolished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about something else.  I am talking about the fact 
that there is a value which ranks higher than the state.  This 
value is humanity.  The state, as is well known, is here to serve 
the people, not the other way around.  If a person serves his or 
her state, such service should go only as far as is necessary for 
the state to do a good service to all its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human rights rank above the rights of states.  Human liberties 
constitute a higher value than state sovereignty.  In terms of 
international law, the provisions that protect the unique human 
being should take precedence over the provisions that protect the 
state.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If, in the world of today, our fates are merged into one single 
destiny, and if every one of us is responsible for the future of 
all, nobody, not even the state, should be allowed to restrict 
the rights of the people to exercise this responsibility.  I 
think that the foreign policies of individual states should 
gradually sever the category that has until now most often 
constituted their axis, that is the category of “interests”, 
“our national interests” or “the foreign policy interests of 
our state”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The category of “interests” tends to divide rather than to 
bring us together.  It is true that each of us has some specific 
interests.  This is entirely natural and there is no reason why 
we should abandon our legitimate concerns; but there is something 
that ranks higher than our interests: it is the principles that 
we espouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principles unite us rather than divide us.  Moreover, they are 
the yardstick for measuring the legitimacy or illegitimacy of our 
interests.  I do not think it is valid when various state 
doctrines say that it is in the interest of the state to uphold 
such and such a principle.  Principles must be respected and 
upheld for their own sake, so to speak, as a matter of principle, 
and interests should be derived from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it would not be right if I said that it is in the 
interest of the Czech Republic that there is an equitable peace 
in the world.  I have to say something else.  There must be an 
equitable peace in the world and the interests of the Czech 
Republic must be subordinated to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance of which both Canada and the Czech Republic are now 
members is waging a struggle against the genocidal regime of 
Slobodan Milosevic.  It is neither an easy struggle nor a popular 
one, and there can be different opinions on its strategy and 
tactics; but no person of sound judgment can deny one thing: This 
is probably the first war ever fought that is not being fought in 
the name of interests but in the name of certain principles and 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is possible to say about the war that it is ethical, or 
that it is fought for ethical reasons, it is true of this war. 
Kosovo has no oil fields whose output might perhaps attract 
somebody's interest.  No member country of the Alliance has any 
territorial claims there, and Milosevic is not threatening either 
the territorial integrity or any other integrity of any NATO 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the Alliance is fighting.  It is fighting in the 
name of human interest for the fate of other human beings.  It is 
fighting because decent people cannot sit back and watch 
systematic, state directed massacres of other people.  Decent 
people simply cannot tolerate this and cannot fail to come to the 
rescue if a rescue action is within their power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This war gives human rights precedence over the rights of 
states.  The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been attacked 
without a direct UN mandate for the Alliance's action. 
But the Alliance has not acted out of licence, aggressiveness or 
disrespect for international law.  On the contrary, it has acted 
out of respect for the law, for the law that ranks higher than 
the protection of the sovereignty of states.  It has acted out of 
respect for the rights of humanity, as they are articulated by 
our conscience as well as by other instruments of international 
law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this as an important precedent for the future.  It has now 
been clearly stated that it is not permissible to slaughter 
people, to evict them from their homes, to maltreat them and to 
deprive them of their property.  It has been demonstrated that 
human rights are indivisible and that if injustice is done to 
some, it is done to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ladies and gentlemen, I am well aware that Canadian politics has 
long and systematically advanced the principle of security of the 
human being, which you deem equally important as that of security 
of the State, if not even more important.  Let me assure you that 
this Canadian ethic enjoys a profound respect in my country.  I 
would wish that we are not merely allies in a formal or 
institutional sense as members of the same defence alliance, but 
also as partners in promoting this worthy principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear friends, many times in the past I have pondered on the 
question of why humanity has the prerogative to any rights at 
all.  Inevitably, I have always come to the conclusion that human 
rights, human liberties and human dignity have their deepest 
roots outside of this earthly world.  They become what they are 
only because, under certain circumstances, they can mean to 
humanity a value that people place, without being forced to, 
higher than even their own lives.  Thus, these notions have 
meaning only against the background of the infinite and of 
eternity.  It is my profound conviction that the true worth of 
all our actions, whether or not they are in harmony with our 
conscience, the ambassador of eternity in our soul, is finally 
tested somewhere beyond our sight.  If we did not sense this, or 
subconsciously surmise it, certain things could never get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude my remarks on the State and on the role it will 
probably play in the future with the following statement:  While 
the state is a human creation, humanity is a creation of God. 
L'Etat est l'oeuvre de l'homme, et l'homme est l'oeuvre de Dieu. 
Thank you.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an historic fact that your literary works helped to 
inspire the revival of democratic and national sentiments that 
led to the Prague Spring of 1968.  And when Warsaw Pact 
intervention withered the Prague Spring, you played a leading 
role in organizing peaceful opposition to the totalitarian 
regime of the time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next decade, your continuing refusal to compromise your 
personal beliefs and political principles gave you a unique moral 
authority.  And when passive Czechoslovak resistance turned 
revolutionary in November 1989, the Prague Drama Club gave birth 
to the Civic Forum.  This organization spoke out on behalf of the 
growing number of groups and individuals demanding fundamental 
changes to the political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given your past as a playwright and dissident, it was natural 
that you should play a leading role in the Civic Forum.  Your 
strength of leadership seemed to make it inevitable that, like 
Nelson Mandela, you should be chosen President of your country

free elections in more than 40 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Your Excellency, over the past six years, as the first President 
of the Czech Republic, you have assumed the role of

you the philosophical and moral confidence to address the 
challenges facing Europe in a most profound way. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, your speeches have dwelt on the need for the 
European Union to stand for more than just a common currency and 
a common market; they have dwelt on the need for Europe to 
reinvent itself spiritually and to rediscover its basic classical 
civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a broad extension of that, you have often spoken of the 
common roots of human spirituality, as you have this morning.

imperatives that should focus on accepted rules of human 
co-existence, so badly needed right now.
