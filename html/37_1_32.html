<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MEMBER FOR EDMONTON-STRATHCONA 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been doing a lot of 
soul-searching over the past three days and would like to share 
my thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to Canada as a baby, fleeing Idi Amin's Uganda in the 
arms of my parents.  It was their dream to live in a great and 
free democracy.  Canada is their promised land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago, I became the first Muslim elected to Canada's 
parliament and one of the first refugees. I am very proud of 
this honour, not just to be chosen by the people of 
Edmonton—Strathcona and not just to serve in this great 
institution, but because I knew that my being elected as an MP 
was the last milestone in my family's road from tyranny to 
freedom, the final destination in my people's journey from being 
refugees who belong nowhere to being full citizens of Canada, the 
greatest country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the events of the last few days have been so 
hurtful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Saturday, my partner and I opened up a new business, a cafe 
that employs a dozen young people in the heart of Edmonton. 
However my assistant had booked me on a radio show at the same 
time.  He tried to call me at the cafe to let me know when I was 
to appear on the show but he could not reach me.  With only a few 
minutes left until air time, he panicked and did the radio 
interview himself pretending to be me without my knowledge or 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a bad decision, an error in judgment, made in the stress 
of the moment.  It has never happened before and it will never 
happen again.  It was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right after the show, my assistant drove to the cafe and told me 
what he had done.  Shortly after that, the radio station phoned 
me and asked me about the interview.  At first I covered for my 
assistant, a man who has competently and loyally worked for me 
and our constituency from the beginning. 
I told the producer that it was actually me on the radio.  I 
lied. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was wrong for my assistant to appear on the radio claiming to 
be me and it was wrong for me to cover that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My assistant and I have since telephoned the show to apologize 
and my assistant has resigned.  He is sorry for pretending to be 
me.  I am sorry for trying to gloss over his error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already apologized to Peter Warren, the host of the show, 
and to all of his listeners across Canada.  Today, Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to offer to you, as the Speaker of this legislature 
and my friend, my apologies for not living up to the standards of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my fellow MPs, I offer my regrets for not living up to their 
standards of integrity.  I apologize for embarrassing them.  I 
pledge my loyalty again to my leader and the whip, who have dealt 
with me firmly, yet compassionately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the people of Edmonton—Strathcona, I offer my sincere 
apologies for my momentary lapse in judgment.  It has been a 
unique honour to work for my constituents in parliament and to 
serve them in the riding.  I hope they will continue to look at 
me and judge me by the sum of my words and deeds and not by this 
one error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than anyone, I want to address my parents, Nizar and Razia 
Jaffer, who have been hurt the most by my mistake.  For 30 years 
they have put their own interests and wishes aside to give 
everything they had to my brother and me.  I would not have been 
able to get here to Canada without them.  I would not have been 
able to get to parliament without them.  All of my achievements 
have been because of their love and devotion.  I am sorry I let 
them down.  More than anything, that has hurt these last few 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to clear the air. 
Let me close by pledging to continue doing in years ahead what I 
have done for the past four years, to serve the people of 
Edmonton—Strathcona as best I can and, just as important, to 
live up to my parents' example as best I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure all hon. members appreciate the 
kind words of the hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona.  I am 
sure that his parents and his electors will be very proud of him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not want to be seen or in any way derogate from the rather 
complete and forthright way in which this matter has been dealt 
with by the hon. member, but it occurs to me that in the facts as 
I have heard them there was a decision and an act by another 
individual, the staffer of the hon. member, who made a decision 
to do something which I believe would be contrary to the rules of 
the House and could constitute and be seen as contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that although there is probably a will to put 
closure to this, it having been addressed well by the hon. 
member, it seems to me that the staffer involved should be 
providing a written apology to the House for the actions or 
decisions that he made, if I have understood the facts properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be my view that the matter should not close until that 
individual has acknowledged the error that he appears to have 
made.  I would like to suggest that an apology should come from 
that person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, I wanted that to show on the record, having heard 
all of the facts.  Again I do not want it to derogate at all from 
the rather fulsome and complete way that the hon. member has 
dealt with this today.

<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-305, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act (inventory of brownfields). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I consider it a privilege to introduce a 
bill, which is the first step of what I intend to be a three 
stage process, aimed at identifying, assessing and remediating 
what are known as brownfields.  The term brownfields refers to 
industrial properties which lie vacant or neglected due to 
concerns of environmental contamination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act to 
expand the existing registry so that any member of the public can 
report suspected contaminated sites with the express purpose of 
building an easily accessible national registry of brownfields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also allow the federal government, together with 
provincial, municipal and private partnerships, to assist with the 
often prohibitive costs of environmental assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To solve a problem one first has to identify the problem. 
Ultimately, I see this is as a three stage process: 
identification, assessment and remediation.  The bill addresses 
the first two stages directly.  First, we identify the extent of 
the brownfields nationally.  Once we know where these sites are, 
we can begin to assess the costs of the clean up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having this information open and available to all levels of 
government and private enterprise will foster co-operative and 
innovative solutions.  The advantages of the remediation of 
brownfields are obvious: job growth, revitalization of our 
downtown cores and reversal of urban sprawl, as well as the clean 
up of potentially environmental hazardous sites right in our own 
back yards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a small but crucial step toward reclaiming these 
commercially useful sites, revitalizing our city centres and 
combating urban sprawl.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>AGRICULTURE 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair has received an application for an 
emergency debate from the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I contacted your 
office this morning.  I wanted to bring this matter forward in a 
timely fashion because there is a great urgency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in Prince Edward Island are currently facing a very 
devastating decision.  They must decide within the next few weeks 
whether to plant their potato crops given the situation that 
exists in terms of the market that would be there for them in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, as you, Mr. Speaker, would be quick to agree, 
that members of parliament be given the opportunity to express 
their concern and also to urge the government to act in a 
significant way.   We know that there has been a compensation 
package offered to Prince Edward Island potato farmers in the 
range of $14.1 million.  This was less than half of the amount of 
money that the Prince Edward Island government has put into this 
issue already itself.  It was much lower than the amount that 
they were requesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put this situation into perspective as to the seriousness 
of the issue itself.  Canada and Prince Edward Island agree that 
approximately 6.3 million cwt. of potatoes in storage currently 
is surplus resulting from the closed U.S. border, restricted 
shipments to Canada and the price protection in the rest of 
Canada.  What Prince Edward Island did in absorbing this loss was 
to protect the rest of the potato market for the entire country 
at a huge expense to those individual farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, United States protectionism is devastating the 
Prince Edward Island potato industry.  The hurt that was suffered 
by the island is testament to the fact that this problem is 
Canada-wide, but it is being absorbed by a single province in 
this instance.  Both short term economic and long term financial 
market re-entry needs must be addressed in the package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the Chair to accept this application given the 
urgency, particularly the urgency pertaining to the necessity for 
farmers to decide whether to reinvest in their farms and to put 
potatoes in the ground for the coming season.  I stress again 
that the border is currently not open for farmers to assess 
whether they should make this reinvestment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair has certainly read the letter 
that was forwarded by the hon. member and has heard his remarks 
today.  I note that the subject of the debate today, an 
opposition day, is in fact agriculture as chosen by the official 
opposition.  The motion will be put to the House in a few 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the circumstances, it would be premature for the Chair to 
allow this application at this time.  We should hear how the 
debate progresses today.  The issue may be discussed during the 
debate, as I suspect it might be.  If the hon. member feels that 
perhaps the issue has not received a reasonable airing, he could 
bring the application before the House on another occasion.  At 
this time I will say no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK48">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call on the 
government to authorize an additional $400 million in 
emergency assistance for Canadian farm families (over and 
above all agriculture programs announced or in place to 
date), to be paid out in 2001, and that the confidence 
convention need not apply to this motion. 
Debate arose thereon. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
wish to raise an issue before the House on the acceptability and 
admissibility of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call on the government to authorize an additional 
$400 million in emergency assistance for Canadian farm families 
(over and above all agriculture programs announced or in place to 
date), to be paid out in 2001— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is noteworthy, from a procedural point of view, that the 
motion does not urge the government.  It directs the government 
to do the action in question.  The motion does not say that the 
House ask the government to consider the advisability of spending 
$400 million.  It calls on the government to authorize such an 
expenditure.  I will get to both of those terms in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, I will argue with the Chair that the motion 
directs the government to make such an expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 79(1) deals very clearly with this kind of 
situation.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House shall not adopt or pass any vote, resolution, address 
or bill for the appropriation of any part of the public revenue, 
or of any tax or impost, to any purpose that has not been first 
recommended to the House by a message from the Governor General 
in the session in which such vote, resolution, address or bill is 
proposed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no recommendation for the motion from the governor in 
council which purports to direct the government to make an 
expenditure.  It is, therefore, in my estimation, out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marleau and Montpetit, at page 901, indicate how such a motion 
should be worded.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an alternative to a bill which might require a royal 
recommendation obtained only by a Minister, a private Member may 
choose to move a motion proposing the expenditure of public 
funds, provided that the terms of the motion only suggest this 
course of action to the government without ordering or requiring 
it to do so. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion uses extremely definitive language.  It does not 
suggest something to the government.  When one calls upon someone 
to do something, one is not thinking about it or making a 
suggestion, one is telling or directing someone to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's 6th edition, at page 186, goes into more detail. 
Citation 616 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions purporting to give the Government a direct order to do a 
thing which requires the expenditure of money are out of order. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 617 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abstract motions should use the words, “that the Government 
consider the advisability of...” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number (2) of citation 617 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these words are used, it leaves the Government free, after 
considering the advisability of doing something, to come to the 
conclusion that it should not do so.  There would not, therefore, 
necessarily be an expenditure of public money involved. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if one is ordering the government to do 
something, it causes the expenditure, and if the government does 
not have the tools to refuse to do that thing, then it is ordered 
and therefore it requires royal recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number (3) of citation 617 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An abstract motion does not finally bind the House to make the 
grant, and it imposes upon the Government the responsibility of 
either accepting or rejecting the recommendation. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is not at all abstract.  It specifies an amount of 
money.  It specifies the recipient.  It specifies what is not to 
be included in the calculation of the amount.  It specifies a 
time limit by which the payment is to be made.  All of those 
elements, not just one or just some, are there.  It does not say 
to the government to go away and think about it or consider it, 
it says to do it.  This is a direct violation of Standing Order 
79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw a couple more things to the attention of 
the Chair.  Page 213 of the 6th edition of Beauchesne's, which 
refers to the royal recommendation, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendation precedes every grant of money, the consent may 
be given at any stage before final passage, and is always 
necessary in matters involving the rights of the Crown, its 
patronage, its property or its prerogatives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes from <I>Bourinot</I>, page 413. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will notice as well, Mr. Speaker, that the motion in 
question states “That this House call on the government”.  I 
explained extensively why I do not think call satisfies the 
criteria.  However the word authorize is in the motion.  That is 
a word utilized in the estimates, estimates that are tabled in 
the House pursuant not only to a royal recommendation but signed 
by the Governor General and we rise in the House to acknowledge 
the royal recommendation which was made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 1-2 of the main estimates, entitled “The Expenditure Plan 
Overview”, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2001-2002 Main Estimates present budgetary spending 
authorities totalling $163.4 billion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the amount in question.  In other words, that language 
is in the estimate process with which we deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Mr. Speaker might be tempted to say that it has 
happened on a couple of occasions that the words “call upon the 
government” have been inserted in a motion put before the House 
by the opposition.  Should the Speaker be tempted to say that 
that would constitute the precedent on which the Chair might want 
to rule that the motion is in order, I would suggest that it does 
no such thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there may have been two or three such motions in the 
past.  Prior to that they were never accepted.  Because no one 
has challenged him on a point of order in the past, the Chair did 
not rule on the acceptability of those motions.  Therefore, he 
was not called upon to rule them in order.  I believe that this 
is the first opportunity the Chair has been called upon to do so 
by a member of the House.   I would ask the Chair to consider 
that particular proposition as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are points that I wanted to make to the Chair this 
morning.  The motion calls upon the government to authorize an 
expenditure.  It specifies when the expenditure is to be made, 
who the recipient will be, the timeframe on which to give it and 
what is to count and not to count as part of that expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this is not in order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, to quote the hon. House leader, he knows this is 
not a point of order.  It is a nice try but it is not a point of 
order and he knows that full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also cutting into debate time.  I hope at the end of this 
discussion that this time could be added on to the allotted day 
because farmers want this issue debated, they want it debated in 
full and they want it debated today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out in Marleau and Montpetit on page 724, under the 
consideration of opposition motion, it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in opposition to the government may propose motions for 
debate on any matter falling within the jurisdiction of the 
Parliament of Canada, as well as on committee reports concerning 
Estimates. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have a debate today about the estimates and how the 
government has failed to contribute the necessary funds to deal 
with the farm crisis.  Instead we chose a motion which is 
obviously in order and has been tabled with the required notice 
ahead of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that our motion does not direct the 
government to a course of action.  It does not order the 
government to do a certain thing.  It does not compel it to a 
certain course of action.  However, it does call on the 
government, as are farmers across the country, to a course of 
action that will direct the government to help out with the farm 
crisis.  So it is a plea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It calls on the government to address that concern.  I hope 
it will enter into the debate in such a way that by the end of it 
the government will understand the severity of the crisis and 
will vote in favour of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Beauchesne's parliamentary rules, page 256, paragraph 923, 
with respect to opposition day motions, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Opposition prerogative is very broad in the use of the 
allotted day and ought not to be interfered with— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader, while he has an interesting 
discussion, should perhaps change his late night reading to 
something more entertaining than the standing orders because he 
knows full well his is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not have notice of this.  It would have been interesting 
to go back to see what the government House leader had in some of 
his opposition day motions when he sat on this side of the House. 
He called on the government of the day to spend money freely, 
widely, indiscriminately and at will, especially his.  I am just 
pointing out again that is not what this is.  It is very specific 
to a particular crisis and is calling on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For clarity, there are two parts to this motion.  The second 
part has to do with the confidence measure.  Just to be clear, 
that is what we call a free vote.  That means the government will 
not rise or fall on this debate.  It is a free vote.  We can have 
a debate on this and the House can even decide in favour of this 
motion without the government falling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is straying a little off the 
point.  I do not think the government House leader was arguing 
that the motion was out of order because of anything it said 
about the confidence convention, words which I know are in the 
motion I put to the House a minute ago.  The hon. member might 
simply be wading into a morass if he brings that subject up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Might I suggest we deal with the admissibility of the amendment 
on the grounds raised by the government House leader, rather than 
going off.  Frankly, the Chair is not concerned beyond anything 
the government House leader might have raised.  That is why I 
would like to hear on that point and nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, the 
confidence measure, not to belabour that, is in order as it says 
in Beauchesne's.  The first part is also in order because it does 
not direct the government or order the government.  It would have 
been out of order if, for example, we had just said that the 
House authorize or the House direct the government to spend 
money, or change the budget or any such thing.  It does not do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It calls on the government to address this serious crisis.  It 
calls on the government to react to this particular proposal, 
which is very precise.  It is completely in order.  We look 
forward to the debate which I suggest should be starting 
immediately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, to speak very briefly in support of the submission 
put forward by my learned friend the House leader for the 
official opposition, this matter when viewed in the whole does 
not order the government to do something.  It calls upon the 
government to exercise its discretion and increase spending with 
respect to farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has always held, as set out in both Beauchesne's and 
Marleau and Montpetit, that broad discretion should be used when 
interpreting these types of motions.  It would be unduly unfair 
for this motion to be ruled out of order.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that it is very much an attempt by the government 
House leader to eat into the debate time.  This can be 
interpreted as not only an insult to the official opposition and 
members of the opposition who support this, but also a swipe at 
farmers who are very much in need and very much interested in 
seeing their issue aired in a public way in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the submissions of the government House leader do 
not rule this motion out of order, that we should get on with the 
debate so we can talk about the real issue today, and that is how 
the government is underfunding farmers in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair thanks all hon. members who 
have made contributions to this debate, the House leader for the 
official opposition, the government House leader and the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I start by citing to hon. members page 724 of Marleau and 
Montpetit: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in opposition to the government may propose motions for 
debate on any matter falling within the jurisdiction of the 
Parliament of Canada, as well as on committee reports concerning 
Estimates.  The Standing Orders give Members a very wide scope in 
proposing opposition motions on Supply days and, unless the 
motion is clearly and undoubtedly irregular (e.g., where the 
procedural aspect is not open to reasonable argument), the Chair 
does not intervene. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the very able arguments of the government House 
leader, the Chair has reviewed this motion and I will allow 
myself to fall into the temptation that the government House 
leader warned me against by citing to the House past practice in 
respect of this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 25, 1999, the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake 
proposed a motion to the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government has failed to 
defend the interest of Canadian farmers from the unfair subsidies 
and unfair trading practices by foreign countries...accordingly, 
the government should immediately ensure that emergency 
compensation is delivered to farmers— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 2, 2000, the hon. member for Halifax moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls upon the government to stand up for the 
Canadian value of universal public health care by announcing 
within one week of the passage of this motion a substantial and 
sustained increase in cash transfers for health— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 20, 2000, the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls on the Minister of Finance to increase the 
Canada health and social transfer by $1.5 billion— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample precedent for these kinds of motions to be moved 
in the House.  The Chair, in considering these motions, 
admittedly heard no argument on the admissibility of the motions. 
However, in putting any motion to the House, the Chair reviews 
its procedural acceptability, and unless the Chair feels that the 
motion is within the rules and the precedents of the House, the 
Chair will decline to put the motion and may instruct hon. 
members that amendments are required, and that consultations are 
an ongoing feature of submissions of motions and amendments in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, if they submit an amendment that in the 
opinion of the staff of the House working under the Speaker's 
direction feel is inappropriate or out of order, suggestions are 
made to improve the wording or change the wording to bring it 
within the practices of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. government House leader feels it might be falling 
into temptation on my part to rely on these past practices, the 
fact is they have been allowed in the past because the Chair 
took the view that they were in order.  It might have been urged 
otherwise, but I suspect the ruling then would have been the same 
as it is today, and that is, that this motion is in fact in 
order.  Notwithstanding the very able arguments of the hon. 
government House leader, we will proceed with the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your prudent ruling.  I 
am sure that members of all parties who individually supported 
your ascendancy to Chair are in fact congratulating themselves 
for their good judgment and your good judgment.  We appreciate 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farming is said by some to be a way of life but it is also a 
business.  No one knows better than Canadian farm families today 
that the price of this business has often been bankruptcy.  Over 
the past year prices have plummeted.  Farmers are facing the 
prospect of not being able to put seed into the ground.  They are 
facing many challenges.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say from the outset and make it very clear that I believe 
Canadian farmers are as innovative, as hardworking and as 
entrepreneurial as any in the world.  In fact, Canadian farmers 
can take on the world and feed the world and do it on a 
competitive basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers believe this too, but the fact of the matter is 
that our farmers are competing in an artificial field, competing 
against subsidies in the United States and in Europe that are 
artificially high.  Everything is skewed against our farmers. 
They are asking for the playing field to be levelled.  In fact, 
because of the field not being level and because of the federal 
government's neglect, it is as if the federal government has tied 
the hands of our farmers and hobbled their feet.  It is as if the 
government has put a 100 pound weight on their backs, thrown them 
into the international race and is expecting them to keep up. 
That is unrealistic and it can and needs to be changed.  However, 
the federal government does not want to change the rules to give 
our Canadian farmers the level playing field they need and that 
is what this discussion is all about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Add to this weight that farmers already carry because of 
government inaction an unrealistic tax regime, not just for 
farmers but for agriculture businesses that would like to expand 
opportunities for farm products, and add to that Agriculture 
Canada user fees, and we see the weight that has been 
unrealistically placed on the backs of our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about growing grains, oilseeds, corn and 
soybeans in Ontario or about wheat in the west or any of the 
ridings producing farm products across Canada, farm incomes have 
fallen severely in the last three years.  The projection is that 
they will continue to fall.  This is a very serious message and 
it is a very serious crisis that our farmers face right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that farm income for grains and oilseed 
producers is projected to fall as much as 35% from the five year 
average in the year 2000.  That is a drastic and unbearable drop. 
It is important to note that the five year average already 
includes two years of disastrous commodity prices.  This level of 
income is not sufficient to sustain the agriculture industry in 
Canada.  Years of neglect by the federal government has resulted 
in the need for an immediate emergency compensation package.  We 
will talk about the other things that also need to be done, but 
this compensation package is the most pressing issue for 
agriculture today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the situation is so severe that we have called for an 
immediate emergency package of at least $1 billion in new federal 
spending.  It is important to point out that this must be 
additional spending from the federal government, not just a 
reallocation of spending that has been promised and in fact not 
delivered.  This dollar amount is based on clear estimates of 
what we calculate to be the hurt Canadian farmers have been 
carrying and the damage they face, mainly as a result of the 
unrealistic subsidies from the United States and the European 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our political opponents would like to say that the 
Canadian Alliance is not bringing forward a consistent policy 
because we call for free trade on the one hand yet demand an 
emergency package for farmers on the other.  However, let me be 
very clear that this is absolutely consistent with the Canadian 
Alliance position.  Our agriculture policy states that “we 
should only reduce Canadian farm support in conjunction with 
other countries”.  That is a direct quote from our policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is far different from what the Canadian government has done 
since it signed the general agreement on tariffs and trade. 
Support for European and U.S. farmers has not changed 
significantly from the time of the GATT agreements.  We saw 
support for our farmers slashed and drastically reduced.  We 
cannot expect our farmers to fight this, and not just against 
farmers from the United States and Europe because those farmers 
are backed by the might of the treasuries of Europe and the 
United States.  This is an unrealistic expectation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsidies provided by our trade competitors to increase their 
own agriculture production are the principal cause of this 
current farm income crisis in Canada.  A lot of Canadians would 
be surprised to know that in 1999 European wheat farmers received 
58% of their income from government.  In 1999, U.S. wheat farmers 
received 46% of their income from government, while Canadian 
farmers received only 11% of their income from the government in 
1999. 
This is a very dramatic change in terms of what Canadian farmers 
face.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, U.S. support for its oilseed producers amounted to only 
4% of income.  However, we must look at what happened in just two 
years.  By 1999, that support had ballooned to 25% of U.S. 
oilseed producers' income.  During the same time, support for 
Canadian oilseed producers remained essentially unchanged. These 
are drastic comparisons.  It should be no surprise that the U.S. 
is now forecasting a fifth year of record soybean production 
while the value of Canada's soybean crop continues to fall 
dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the last GATT round of trade negotiations were completed 
Canadian farmers were basically at par with U.S. subsidy levels. 
After the round was completed, the gap between Canadian and U.S. 
subsidies began to grow and that put added pressure on our 
farmers. While Canadian farm support has fallen since the accord, 
support for U.S. farmers has actually returned to pre-GATT 
levels.  Canadian farmers were actually worse off after the last 
round of trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gap between support levels for Ontario and those for U.S. 
grain and oilseed growers is actually equivalent to about $63 an 
acre for a typical farm growing a mix of corn, soybeans and 
wheat.  This means that the cost of achieving equity with U.S. 
farmers would be about $300 million per year for Ontario and 
about $1.5 billion nationwide.  These are real costs.  These are 
measurable effects.  Our farmers, as I have said, are some of the 
most efficient producers in the world, but they are competing 
against European and U.S. treasuries all on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This serious drop in revenues, which has been caused by these 
increasing foreign subsidies, has also been compounded by 
skyrocketing costs.  It is not as if farmers are just fighting 
subsidies.  Costs are rocketing through the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not many people outside the farm community who know 
the degree to which farmers are impacted by energy costs and the 
significant increases there.  The cost of getting their crops 
into the ground in the spring and of harvesting in the fall is 
highly dependent on the cost of diesel fuel, as is the cost of 
getting their product to market.  Then we have the ballooning 
cost of fertilizer which uses natural gas as a key ingredient. 
All farmers here today know what has happened to fertilizer 
costs, but I wonder if Canadians know of the increased cost 
because of soaring energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the federal government done to assist in those energy 
costs?  It has sent cheques to students and to prisoners in jail. 
I think it is time that the government looked at the energy costs 
and the increases being carried by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current programs have failed.  The 1998 agriculture income 
disaster assistance program continues to hold back a huge 
percentage of the money that was promised to farmers, with 8,700 
claims from 1999 that have not even been processed.  We say it is 
time to get that money off the cabinet table and onto the kitchen 
tables of family farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said that the $500 million the government has just 
promised is a lot of money.  We can make the analogy of putting 
500 litres of fuel into an airplane so it can cross the ocean, 
but it needs 1,000 litres to make the trip.  There is no point in 
even filling the plane if it is going to crash into the ocean. 
That is what we are talking about.  Farmers cannot even get the 
crops into the ground if they know they cannot complete the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must be done and it must be done 
immediately.  We are talking about an industry that is 8.5% of 
the Canadian gross domestic product and employs 1.9 million 
Canadians.  In Ontario, it is the number two industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add that we must not leave unattended the other things 
that must be done.  I just want to say in closing that once we 
get this emergency help we must aggressively attack foreign 
subsidies, we must remove the 4 cent per litre federal excise tax 
on farm fuel, we must encourage more value added processing with 
a realistic tax regime, we must give all grain farmers marketing 
choice, especially those in western Canada, and we must reduce 
farmers' costs by modernizing the grain handling and 
transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We demand this action.  We demand that the government move on 
this emergency request and that it do so now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the speech from the Leader of the 
Opposition.  I recall that when the member was campaigning in 
Regina during the election he said that our farmers do not need 
any more subsidies, that they are the best farmers in the world. 
I am wondering why he has changed his tune to such an extent in a 
matter of a few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is ridiculous, 
because all through the campaign, as a matter of fact, I gave a 
speech very close to this one.  I said that if the U.S. and 
Europe were not involved in this increased subsidy game, we would 
not need these subsidies.  However, because they are involved in 
that game, we need these subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also distinctly remember a speech in Saskatchewan during the 
election in which a Liberal candidate said the reason farmers 
were not getting help was that they were not voting Liberal. 
Those are the kinds of comments I remember in the campaign in 
Saskatchewan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Gordon Barnhart, a former clerk 
of the Saskatchewan legislature, recently published a book on the 
history of Saskatchewan's first premier, Walter Scott.  Throughout 
that book he made references to agriculture, one which I will 
quote:  “If agriculture prospers, so will this land”.  He was 
referring mainly to the new province of Alberta, but it is also 
true if we look at the history of Saskatchewan in particular.  If 
agriculture prospers, so does the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member alluded in his speech to the fact that 
agriculture has been going down.  All he has to do is take one 
journey through my constituency.  It is so evident what is 
happening:  agriculture and the people are in a desperate 
situation.  I have received well over 1,000 desperate calls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition could agree with 
the premise that we must prosper in agriculture if we are going 
to be a viable community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain is not only good on history but on the 
future, because he is looking ahead in a proactive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course when agriculture as an industry is 8.5% of our GDP, 
with 1.9 million Canadians directly involved in agriculture or 
agriculture industry markets, it is vitally important to the 
entire economy of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back to pre-depression years, we can see that when 
the agriculture community was affected everything got hit, 
whether it was implement dealers or producers of various seed 
products, everything we can imagine in terms of all the products 
and lines that are being affected today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree 100% and, as a matter of fact, it is not just a premise 
but a fact that our economy depends on agriculture in a very 
significant way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the front page of the <I>National Post</I> today tells us 
that junior ministers are to get limos as the Prime Minister 
reverses policy.  It will cost the Canadian taxpayer about 
$50,000 for each one of the secretaries of state who will get a 
limo courtesy of the taxpayers of Canada, yet farmers are 
left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said:  1,000 desperate phone calls and they have 
received nothing.  How many desperate phone calls did the Prime 
Minister receive from secretaries of state demanding cars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the hon. leader's comments regarding the 
disparity in the ways in which cabinet secretaries and farmers 
are treated in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  It is a penetrating question, Mr. 
Speaker.  I am tempted to move toward some partisan remarks, but 
I will try to restrain myself because this is very serious.  It 
reflects the priorities of the government, whether it is cars for 
junior ministers—and reflecting the fact that tractors cannot 
move into fields—whether it is putting hundreds of millions of 
dollars into other highly questionable activities, or whether it 
is to reflect on the comments of the auditor general who has 
asked the question in terms of the management of hundreds of 
millions of dollars by the government.  The auditor general has 
asked this question:  who is minding the store? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just on the amount of money the federal Liberal government has 
spilled and wasted, we could top up this amount and meet what is 
required for farmers facing disaster today, leaving alone the 
government's misplaced priorities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Alliance has today 
brought forward this motion suggesting very clearly and telling 
the government quite clearly that $900 million is the minimum 
amount of money required to get our grains, oilseeds, corn and 
soybean producers through this spring seeding. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only $500 million of that money was brought forward by the 
agriculture minister.  As a result, I have found it necessary to 
bring the issue of agriculture and the income situation back to 
the House and once again put it to the members.  We are moving 
past the cabinet, which produces half measures, to the House as a 
whole so that individual MPs can stand in their places and say 
through their votes whether or not they support agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a crisis.  This is not some frivolous exercise we are 
going through in the House.  This is a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, agriculture is not in total crisis.  There are many 
sectors that are doing fine.  The problem the agriculture 
minister has is that the government has not put forward any long 
term policies that would help the sectors that are affected when 
the price cycle hits bottom, which is a normal thing with 
agriculture commodities around the world and in Canada.  The 
government has no policies that come into play to give those farm 
sectors and commodity groups not a profit but the ability to 
continue to farm and to contribute to Canada's national product 
and to the food supply we all need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have been asking if this should even be done.  Our food 
supply is essential to the well-being of our country.  It 
contributes dramatically to the well-being of every Canadian. 
Having a viable agricultural sector, with the expertise required 
to be a farmer these days, is in our national interest and our 
vital interest.  We must maintain that infrastructure and ability 
in Canada so that we can continue to feed ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned the agriculture minister.  He has brought 
programs forward and he will be talking about all the money that 
has been put out to farmers.  However the last statistics I have 
on the AIDA program, for the years 1998 and 1999, show that only 
62% of that money has been given out.  That is part of the 
problem.  Not only is the money insufficient but it is not 
necessarily given out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal a little more with the politics of this and the 
responsibility of backbenchers.  Ultimately the cabinet has 
responsibility but we, as individual members of parliament, have 
one member, one vote.  My vote is every bit as good as the 
minister of agriculture's in that we each have one of 301 votes 
in the House.  If each member represents their constituents, then 
we will see the motion pass at the end of the day because many 
MPs in the House know that farming is essential to the country 
and that the $400 million is essential to farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Backbenchers on the government side, including the Ontario 
rural caucus chair, have indicated that the opposition should be 
doing more on the issue and that somehow that would translate 
into more action by the cabinet.  We have been doing quite a lot, 
right back to 1998 when I became chief agriculture critic for the 
official opposition.  We have had motion after motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture minister was giving speeches in Regina and 
suggested to the agriculture committee that we should go out west 
and hold hearings for farmers.  The chair of the day from 
Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia said that was a good idea and 
nine meetings were held.  I put a motion forward saying that not 
only should we hold hearings in western Canada to listen to 
farmers but that we should go into Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough to have fancy words and good speeches telling 
everyone how sincere we are about the issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was at the agriculture committee there were members who 
voted against my motion to hold hearings on safety net issues in 
Ontario.  Had those hearings been held I think perhaps the 
government would have understood from farmers back in 1998-99 
that the crisis was real and that it had to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members who voted against me and against holding hearings in 
Ontario were the members for Gatineau, 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, Whitby—Ajax, 
Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington, Kitchener Centre, 
Leeds—Grenville and Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Toronto—Danforth has professed quite loudly that 
he is a big supporter of farmers.  I take him at his word.  He 
held a concert in Toronto and a big dinner here in the Hall of 
Honour.  It was a big public relations exercise, for all apparent 
purposes.  Here at the Hall of Honour dinner farmers believed 
they and MPs were signing a petition that would result in action 
being taken by the House.  That was not within the rules of the 
House.  It was a deception for the farmers who thought backbench 
Liberals would do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told them constantly that the only way to get something done 
in the House was to have a vote— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I take constructively the comments from the member with 
one exception, and I would ask you to rule on it.  The member 
used the word deception and I believe that is inappropriate 
language because it would suggest that it was a deception, a lie 
or a trick.  Those words to me are very close, and I would ask 
him to withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for 
Toronto—Danforth for his intervention but, respectfully, I am 
not satisfied that I would require asking another member to 
withdraw the word deception in the context in which it was used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I take the opportunity early in the debate to ask all 
members to be generous and, to use a word from previous 
parliaments, judicious in their choice of words, and particularly 
to be respectful of one another given the importance of this 
issue to a large number of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was certainly trying 
to commend the member for what he tried to do in bringing the 
information to city people around the country, but also for 
ensuring that the right message is sent to rural dwellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the $500 million was announced, of course, the Ontario 
Federation of Agriculture, following up on what I had already 
done, sent a letter to the editor “Re: Federal government 
campaign against farmers”.  It was dated March 15, right after 
the $500 million was announced.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has fired up its formidable propaganda 
machine to counter the day of action carried out by farmers 
across Canada on March 14, 2001. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ad that ran in newspapers cost anywhere from $1,500 to 
$2,500 at the going rate.  I know the federal government gets a 
cut but it is still an awful lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will note that the newspaper ad, in big black letters, 
says “Supporting our Farmers”.  This is followed by smaller 
font, and then, again in big black letters, it says “$1.6 
billion”.  This is followed by more small font, and then the ad 
talks about the spring credit advance program.  The next big font 
reads “$700 million”.  This is misinformation to people who do 
not understand farm issues or how much money has actually gone to 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they read the ad, it says “Government of Canada”, 
“Supporting our Farmers”, “$1.6 billion”, “$700 million”. 
Those words stand out.  The ad has everyone believing that 
somehow farmers have received $2.3 billion. 
This kind of information should not happen.

Producers, farm organizations and farmers across the country. I 
do not think there is one farmer out there who will not support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking if Liberal members will support the motion, which 
gives direction to the agriculture minister and the cabinet that 
$400 million is what is required as an immediate emergency cash 
injection for the year 2001.  I think the government will support 
the motion and come through with the required funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move an amendment at this time.  I move:

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member and the Alliance Party for bringing forward this 
issue under their supply day.  I do, as members of the House 
recognize, believe very strongly in the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been somewhat confused about the Alliance policy 
on agriculture, but it seems to be a little clearer today after 
the Alliance leader and the member for Selkirk—Interlake spoke 
on it, although it is more anti-government than pro-farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Selkirk—Interlake and 
perhaps he can clear it up for me.  He spoke very eloquently on 
support for farmers right now.  However, back in October 2000 
Statistics Canada said there were 22,100 fewer farmers than 
during the previous year.  I will quote the member who indicated 
at the time: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It doesn't necessarily indicate a disaster happening.  It 
indicates to me more the rationalization and changing of the 
business side of the agriculture sector.  While the study 
indicated that there's fewer farmers on the prairies, that 
doesn't mean we're going to have less production or lower 
agriculture sector dollar earnings. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member explain how that comment fits into what he is 
now talking about with respect to the supports that are necessary 
in agriculture?  He says here that it does not necessarily mean 
less dollar earnings, but that it does not necessarily mean less 
production either.  Perhaps he could clear that up for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the member 
for Brandon—Souris continues with old style politics about how 
the agriculture sector works and his understanding of it.  The 
Progressive Conservatives had many years with massive majorities 
to set forth a long term agriculture policy.  The member for 
Brandon—Souris sits there questioning whether the Canadian 
Alliance has a strong agriculture policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a strong policy regarding grain transportation and 
organic farming.  We support supply management.  We have always 
supported safety nets for farmers.  When the Crow rate was thrown 
out we had the trade distortion adjustment program that would 
have continued supporting farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the survey the member mentioned.  The survey 
was not taken out of income tax forms.  It was not taken out 
of who was filing an income and expense statement.  It was a 
phone survey done by Statistics Canada.  The survey did not 
determine the number of farms lost.  It determined what it was 
told were the number of farm jobs lost.  Certainly there were 
fewer people in the agriculture sector than before. 
However this member continues to ignore history.  At the end of 
the second world war in Saskatchewan there were something like 
175,000 farmers.  At this point there are some 60,000 to 75,000 
farmers there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance very clearly understands that change or 
evolution in any business sector, including the agriculture 
sector, is necessary.  Those members who would sit and save the 
status quo as it was 5 or 10 years ago are doomed to failure, and 
the Canadian Alliance will not let Canadian agriculture fail. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
previous member talked about the standing committee on 
agriculture visiting the prairies in late November and December 
1999.  He read into the record the number of members of 
parliament from Ontario sitting on that committee who voted 
against similar meetings being held in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake.  Of 
the nine meetings that were held in western Canada, three in each 
of the three prairie provinces, how many meetings did the 
agriculture critic for the Canadian Alliance attend? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a very 
interesting question.  I did not attend any of those meetings 
because the Canadian Alliance has such a depth of members of 
parliament with expertise in the agriculture field that we had 
members at every one of those hearings.  While those hearings 
were ongoing and in that immediate timeframe, I was in 
southwestern Ontario representing farmers who were not being 
represented by their own MPs.  Also during that time we had the 
agriculture producers hearings on the go.  We had meetings with 
3,500 farmers in 72 different ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pointless for the NDP to say that we have not been doing 
our job.  <I>Hansard</I> will show that the Canadian Alliance has 
done more for agriculture in the House than any other party since 
1997. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this 
debate and discussion on the importance of agriculture and 
agri-food in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the government can clearly show through our actions the 
importance of the industry.  Farmers and the agri-food industry 
are the backbone of rural Canada.  A lot happens in rural Canada, 
and agriculture is a major part of it.  Certainly other sectors 
of our economy and resource sectors are involved as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all contribute to the good standard of living in Canada. 
There is no question that there is some stress out there in 
certain sectors of primary production.  The hon. member for 
Selkirk—Interlake pointed out in his comments a minute ago that 
some sectors were affected at the present time more than others. 
A couple of years ago some other sectors were affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work collectively and constructively to put together 
programs, recognizing that those programs have to be altered and 
changed as time goes on.  It is like building a new building, a 
new office or a new kitchen.  In a few years one has to recognize 
there are some realities to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the realities we had to deal with was the financial 
situation of the country when we formed the government in 1993. I 
will not go into it, because people know about that disastrous 
situation.  In 1997, when I became minister of agriculture, the 
safety net envelope of the federal government was $600 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1998 the industry was saying that it needed $450 
million in extra support above and beyond what was there for 
income support.  The government put $1.07 billion in place to 
assist over the next two years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term safety net agreement that we signed with the 
provinces last summer for the first time ever has an envelope in 
it of $435 million for income support alone.  That is above and 
beyond the support that is there for programs such as companion 
programs within the provinces, the net income stabilization 
account, crop insurance support, et cetera.  As a result of the 
document we all signed, it is $1.1 billion.  When the provinces 
put their share with ours, their 40% for our 60%, it came to $1.8 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, a couple of weeks ago the government 
announced an additional $500 million for income support to be 
allocated to the provinces based on our allocation formula of 
60%.  Agriculture is a shared jurisdiction, as we know, so when 
the provinces put their share with that it came to the $830 
million which was announced a couple of weeks ago.  The total 
available to farmers is $2.66 billion, the highest level of 
support for farmers since 1995.  Members can say what they want, 
but I assure them that money will go to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we increased two and a half times the spring 
advance program the government put in place last year.  Farmers 
can borrow up to $50,000 interest free this year to help put 
their crops in the ground.  We estimate that farmers will take 
advantage of that to the extent of at least $700 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House and people across the country where the 
provinces were.  Most of the provinces did not put any money on 
the table until the federal government forced them to come 
forward with their 40%.  Some of them are even kicking and 
screaming at that, saying that their province does not want to 
take part in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, one province in the last two years received $400 
million in support from the agriculture income disaster 
assistance program.  The announcement last week of $500 million 
will mean another $200 million to that province on top of the 
estimate of the Canadian farm income program for this year of 
$200 million.  That will be $400 million in government support to 
one province alone for the 2000 crop year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate some of the comments being made today.  I 
appreciate some of the comments out there in the public today and 
coming from farm leaders.  I neglected to say that I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Toronto—Danforth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall we need to talk about government support to farms, but 
we need to talk about farm income in general.  What can we do as 
opposition parties, as government, as industries, as provincial 
governments, to put in place a longer term plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The analogy I would like to give is that we have been trying to 
fix the roof for a number of years, with some success but 
certainly not total success for everyone.  It is time that we put 
effort into analyzing and reviewing the programs, which was 
started.  That was discussed and agreed to by my provincial 
counterparts last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 145,000 farmers enrolled in the net income stabilization 
account with $3.3 billion in their accounts.  Is that $3.3 
billion being used to the extent that it could be?  I do not 
know.  We need to look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 100,000 farmers that participate in crop insurance. They 
have $5 billion in crop insurance out there.  Are the crop 
insurance programs the best they could be?  I do not know.  My 
guess is there will be some improvements in co-operation with the 
provinces.  I could go on, but we need to talk about how we can 
assist the overall income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there are pressures and that consumers are 
concerned about how agriculture is treating the environment and 
about food safety.  We also know there are farmers out there who 
need some transition within their own farming operation, for 
example.  We know as well that there may be some lands out there 
that, given the realities of the day, economically just do not 
make sense. 
No matter what the good Lord gave them for resources and under 
the best of management, with the realities of today production 
capacity is just not there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we assist those producers to do something else or something 
different with their land?   There is no question that there are 
some producers who need skills training.   I believe there is a 
role for the federal and provincial governments and industry to 
provide that type of thing.  I look forward to hearing 
constructive criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take that approach to build a new barn.  When we 
build that new barn a few years down the road we know we will 
have to do some renovations.  I have farmed all my life and I am 
realistic.  When I built barns I thought they were the be-all and 
end-all, but I knew that down the road I would have to analyse 
and make some renovations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term approach is the one we have to take.  There is a 
short term need.  The government has sought all available 
resources for the bridging approach that will take us to the long 
term approach.  We cannot continue to manage the way we have been 
on a year to year basis.  As we said in the throne speech we have 
to do long term planning to move it beyond crisis management.  I 
am confident that will take place as we already have it started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial ministers told me at the federal-provincial meeting 
last week that they too have to take that approach.  They are 
being told by their cabinets that they have to do something in 
the long term approach about the overall income of farmers.  This 
includes government support to income, but there is more to farm 
income than government support such as research, innovation and 
resource allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the comments members will be putting forward 
today.  I am confident that as we work together we will continue 
to strengthen the industry to deal with the realities before us 
today both domestically and internationally.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the agriculture minister has 
recognized that not all commodities are in trouble.  However 
grain, oilseed, soybean and corn producers are subject to world 
market prices and in a lot of trouble.  That is where the AIDA 
program has failed to deliver to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has changed the name of the program from AIDA to 
CFIP, the Canadian farm income program.  Does the minister expect 
this program to serve farmers, those that are being hurt in 
particular, any better than what AIDA did? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no such thing 
as a program that can be designed to do exactly what every 
individual producer wants it to do for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of any program in Canada is that it is based on the 
amount of production of producers.  If, for example, the gross 
sales of a farm in Canada are $75,000 or $80,000, the program is 
based on guaranteeing 70% of the gross margin, which is a 
considerably smaller sum than the gross sales. The program brings 
the farmer back up to 70% of the gross margin referring to a 
period of reference years prior to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the member that over the two years of the AIDA 
program in the province of Saskatchewan a bit shy of $400 million 
will be put into that province.  The $500 million that we 
announced two weeks ago in Saskatchewan, along with 
Saskatchewan's 40%, and I trust that it will be there, will put 
another $200 million into that province for this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In co-operation with the Saskatchewan government and the federal 
folks the estimate is that another $200 million will go into 
Saskatchewan.  That is on top of the $200 million that was 
connected with the announcement two weeks ago.  This means that 
for this year those two programs with federal and provincial 
portions will put $400 million into the province of Saskatchewan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for being here 
during the debate.  I have a couple of comments and a question 
for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has indicated that the responsibility is a shared 
federal-provincial responsibility.  We all accept that.  The norm 
now is a 60:40 split.  Could that not be adjusted?  Is there any 
reason this could not be an 80:20 split as opposed to a 60:40 
split? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I ask that is because in the United States it is a 
federal responsibility.  The U.S., between 1998 and 2000, has put 
$48 billion of federal money into the pockets of farmers.  Our 
government seems to always say that the provinces are not coming 
to the table equally and as quickly as what the feds are.  Why 
could that split of 60:40 not be changed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said that since 1995 there has never been more 
money in agriculture.  The government took power in 1993.  Prior 
to 1993, $4.3 billion went to agriculture.  Today it is $1.6 
billion.  Forgetting about all the rationales, reasonings, budget 
deficits and the rest, the fact of the matter is that there were 
$4.3 billion and it is now down to $1.6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the amount of surpluses that are available, does the 
minister not see that more of those dollars should go back into 
agriculture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know why the 
hon. member keeps bringing this up all the time.  He only 
embarrasses himself and his party.   When we took government, the 
Government of Canada was taking in $120 billion a year.  That 
member's government spent $162 billion a year.  Someone had to 
take hold of the finances of the country because his government 
had put it into bankruptcy.  Someone had to put it back.  When we 
got it back in line, and there is no question that we did, we did 
it through the contributions of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last five years $7.1 billion has gone into support and 
safety nets for Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asks why our system is different than the United 
States.  It is because our constitution says that it is a shared 
jurisdiction.  If the hon. member wants to change the 
proportions, a shared jurisdiction would be 50:50.  If he wants 
to talk to the provinces about a 50:50 split, I am for it. We, as 
a federal government, have said that we will go to a 60:40 split. 
It is a shared jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we strengthen this industry in every way possible, the 
individual producers, the provincial governments, the consumers 
of Canada and the federal government will all benefit.  The 
biggest beneficiaries are the consumers because our industry 
provides them with the safest, highest quality food of any 
country in the world.  We need to work collectively to continue 
to provide that to our Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I was watching part of the debate from my office and 
became somewhat concerned about aspersions cast on my colleague 
from Toronto—Danforth.  More important, right after that I noted 
that the member for Selkirk—Interlake introduced an amendment to 
his party's own motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to you, Mr. Speaker, that the 
amendment effectively precludes, prevents and, in a very 
calculated way, denies any opportunity for a member of parliament 
to expand on the very important and meaningful debate. 
Specifically, I had intended to put forth a motion that would 
also consider the impact of the grocery industry concentration in 
the manufacturing industry.  It is a point— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  With the greatest of respect, I 
believe the hon. member is engaging in debate.  He will certainly 
have time for that over the rest of the day.  For the time being, 
we will resume debate on the amended motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to say at the outset that I will not be supporting the 
motion.  I feel that the debate is serious and that all parties 
must be involved, but I feel that the approach taken by the hon. 
member for Selkirk—Interlake, the agriculture critic, is 
mischievous. 
He tries to divide the House.  When he uses a word like deceive 
to describe our efforts on this side of the House, he dumbs down 
the ongoing constructive approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deal with the issue from the perspective of an urban member of 
parliament.  I do most of the shopping in my family.  I have 
tried for many years to understand the complexities surrounding 
the issue.  I will continue with all my energy and intellect to 
support family farms, but I want to do it in a reasoned and 
constructive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, all of us in the House have done a mediocre job 
educating consumers on agriculture.  Few consumers or few urban 
people realize that the average family farm income is under 
$20,000 a year.  Few consumers realize that the average age of a 
person farming today is close to 60 years old.  I am not 
surprised that more and more younger people living on farms are 
not inspired to continue in the footsteps of their mothers and 
fathers and maintain their farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To shift the emphasis we have to go back to the consumer.  Is it 
not amazing that in the city of Toronto one in six jobs depends 
on the food business?  When we in the House of Commons press the 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister for support and 
resources in the automotive, aerospace, tourism or any other 
sector, we always link it to jobs.  It seems that most of the 
debates on agriculture focus on 270,000 farmers.  We should start 
including in the debate and in the rationale the fact that one in 
six jobs in urban areas depends upon the agri-food business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we turn to the business section of any newspaper, we see the 
massive profits of food retailers and processors.  Then, when we 
come to producers, we see an incredible disparity.  I cannot 
figure out how producers, who are supplying processors and 
retailers, are getting screwed right in front of us.  How is this 
happening?  Why is it not being challenged? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers we are using are wrong.  We talk, for example, of 
the $500 million of new money going to farmers. To someone making 
$25,000, $30,000 or even $100,000 a year, it seems like a lot of 
money going to 270,000 farmers.  The reality is that consumers, 
the urbanites, are the net beneficiaries of the work of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the cheapest food policy of any country in the G-7. 
Over 90% of Canadians probably do not know this fact.  We have a 
cheap food policy in Canada.  In other words, it is not farmers 
that are getting the subsidies.  When we in urban areas go into 
Loblaws, Sobey's, Dominion, or whatever, we get access to high 
quality food at very cheap prices.  We are the ones who in the 
end are the net beneficiaries of any moneys going to farmers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is asking for another large sum of money.  By 
the way, I support the principle and the spirit of the motion, 
whatever the amount of money, whether it is $400 million or $600 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have to start educating urban people.  The issue is 
about food sovereignty.  Would an average family of four be 
willing to spend $1 per person per week, or $4 a week, for a year 
to maintain the family farm system of Canada?  Would that average 
family spend $200 a year to have a safe and secure supply of food 
and to maintain food sovereignty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should understand that this is the cost to them on an 
individual basis, approximately $50 per person per year.  They 
should link to the issue on a personal basis and understand what 
it means to them in terms of added cost. If so, the energy and 
the reason behind rebuilding the agriculture and agri-food sector 
would be greatly enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to all farmers listening that I have no doubt about 
their need for the dollars put on the table.  In fact, as a city 
MP I could never understand how this number was arrived at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 13 I received a fantastic letter from Mr. Brian Doidge 
from Ridgetown College, University of Guelph.  I would be happy 
to share it with anyone who is interested.  He did the 
calculation of gap in income support payments from government for 
grain and oilseed farms in Ontario versus those in the U.S.  He 
did a brilliant calculation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the calculation showed that if we gave Canadian 
farmers the $63 per acre over the 4.83 billion acres planted in 
grain and oilseed crops, we would arrive at the $1.5 billion and 
the 60:40 split.  However, it would only be half the subsidy 
American farmers would receive.  Even at half we are not totally 
in the game with our American friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to bring the debate to city people.  We have to ask city 
people if they want a food sovereign country.   We never seem to 
challenge the profits of retailers, restaurants, food services, 
food processors and hospitality industry.  We never challenge 
those sectors because we understand the number of jobs they 
create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say humbly that if the Minister of Finance took a look at all 
the revenue through personal income taxes which those jobs and 
those corporations created, maybe he has to take a little less 
from the food processing and food retailing sector.  He may have 
to distribute some of what he is taking from those sectors to 
farmers who make sure the quality and secure supply of food 
ultimately serves all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague on doing a 
commendable job on education, which is the term he used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provincial governments, all local governments and all 
parties in the House, I say without fear, have not done a good 
enough job educating the public on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker, the hon. minister of agriculture, used 
some figures for Saskatchewan.  I direct this question to him 
concerning the federal-provincial cost sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan, as we know, has the largest number of farmers, the 
largest number of acres under cultivation and so on.  With the 
60:40 split, it is extremely difficult for Saskatchewan to match 
that 40%, more so than for any other province in Canada.  We have 
to be careful in condemning one province for shying back a little 
because it is in the least financial position.  It has the least 
resources right now to match that 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think this all or nothing approach, which is 
meet the 40% or the province does not get the 60%, is perhaps the 
right approach? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I would say to the hon. 
member that I have always believed that the essence of being in 
the House is that the stronger regions look out for those regions 
which do not have the same financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that Saskatchewan does not have the financial 
strength that the provinces of Ontario or Alberta have, but I 
will give an even better example.  I think it is a near scandal 
that we cannot find $6 million or $7 million for the potato 
farmers in P.E.I. when we all know that we spend that amount in a 
year around here on paper clips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the question, I have always been a believer and 
have always supported the fact that the advantaged provinces have 
a duty to look out for those provinces that go through bad 
patches. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Toronto—Danforth 
is in essence up to his old game of trying to divert this debate 
away from what the real issue is.  The real issue is simply that 
this motion says that farmers require an additional $400 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to ask the hon. member not to try to blame government 
inaction on the fact that the consumers in Toronto or other 
cities do not fully understand the agriculture issue. Elected MPs 
fully understand it.  They have been lobbied by every group, such 
as the Ontario Federation of Agriculture and the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not recognize that the motion is a vote about 
$400 million and not a vote about educating the consumer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the motion belittles the 
intelligence of government members because essentially the hon. 
member for Selkirk—Interlake is trying to embarrass government 
members into a money motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody in the House realizes that a money motion is a vote of 
non-confidence.  Quite frankly, I think we can do a hell of a lot 
more to rebuild the family farm sector of this country in here 
rather than in another election. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, 
I would like to congratulate the member for Toronto—Danforth. 
Being a city folk, he has done an awful lot to try to put across 
the issues of the farm crisis and certainly the issues that 
affect farmers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that, I wish everybody in the House would stop playing 
politics and get to the issue.  The issue obviously is trying to 
find solutions to a very serious problem.  It is a non-money 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member for Toronto—Danforth. 
There was a non-money issue when the Minister of Finance decided 
to spend $1.3 billion on an energy rebate, and I am not going to 
argue that program.  Perhaps it was the best program that could 
have come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not believe that the same kind of political will 
in the government could and should come forward with $1 billion, 
or $900 million or $1.3 billion for an issue that is equally as 
important, which is agriculture in the country?

I am passionately committed to this issue, as are nearly all of 
my colleagues in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament on this side of the House were in a state 
of absolute shock when we did not get the full $900 million a few 
weeks ago.  Does that mean we are going to go back in our corner 
and hide?  We are going to continue to use our reason and use our 
arguments to press the government to come up with the amount of 
money that is required to have a proper national agricultural 
policy in the country.  We are all committed to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in today's debate and to indicate at the 
outset that the New Democratic Party will be voting in support of 
the resolution put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say we do not recognize that there is a good deal 
of double talk going on here today.  One of the earlier speakers, 
in questioning the member for Toronto—Danforth, said that we 
have not done a good enough job of explaining agriculture to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I would not disagree with that, I point out that one of 
the reasons that perhaps we have not done a good enough job is 
because some political parties in the House are 
johnny-come-latelies to the crisis.  I am speaking specifically 
about the Canadian Alliance, formerly the Reform Party, that 
introduced the motion today.  That party has come to prominence 
in the country based on a cheap food policy. There are many 
examples over past years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one and only leader of the Reform Party said in Truro, Nova 
Scotia in the early 1990s that western provinces could not afford 
all the farmers they had.  We have quotes on the record that I 
alluded to in the past, indicating that Elwin Hermanson, who was 
the agriculture critic in the House between 1993 and 1997 for the 
then Reform Party, said that he would not disagree with any of 
the cuts that were made in agriculture following the arrival of 
the Liberal Party to power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 election platform of the then Reform Party indicated 
that it would cut support to agriculture by several hundred 
million dollars.  Less than a week ago there were a number of 
rallies around the country.  The Leader of the Opposition, the 
person who introduced the motion today, spoke at the rally in 
Ottawa that a number of us attended.  Anyone would have had the 
impression, as would any one of the 5,000 in attendance, that he 
was going to rush right back to the House of Commons and demand 
additional funds for agriculture.  He rushed back to the House 
but he dealt with immigration and not the crisis on the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I share the sentiments of the member for Brandon—Souris 
that we should not play politics with this issue, at the same 
time history teaches us some lessons.  It is important to point 
those out from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the history of the problem of agriculture in Canada is 
written, people will recognize and realize that 1993 was a 
pivotal year in the process.  Not only was it the election of the 
Liberal government and its preoccupation with eliminating the 
deficit as quickly as possible, but that year coincided with the 
conclusion of the lengthy Uruguay and GATT round at which time 
agriculture and support payments for agriculture, both domestic 
and external, were dealt with for the very first time in an 
international setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government, with its preoccupation on 
eliminating the deficit, hid behind the GATT resolutions and 
recommendations that everyone should cut subsidies or support 
payments by 20% over five years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know, and it is a matter of public record, Canada went 
much further than 20%.  It eliminated it by some 60% over that 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time it is a matter of public record as well that 
following the 1993 election two parties lost their voices in the 
House.  The former Progressive Conservative government and the 
New Democratic Party did not have official representation between 
1993 and 1997.  The government opposite was listening to the fact 
that the Reform Party was not being critical at all of the cuts 
that were coming in agriculture.  It went at it in a very 
ruthless way.  That was the period of time in which the Crow 
benefit was lost in western Canada.  That was a huge amount of 
money out of farmers' pockets, more than $600 million per 
year across the three prairie provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Saskatchewan, as was pointed out by the 
member for Souris—Moose Mountain, has most of the arable land. 
It is over $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is, the minister of agriculture would 
have all of us believe that history began in 1997 when he started 
to put more money back into agriculture.  My colleague from 
Brandon—Souris was absolutely correct when he said there was far 
more money in agriculture support payments for Canadian farmers 
prior to 1993.  That first mandate of the Liberal government took 
a lot of money out of agriculture, the Crow benefit being one of 
them, and it enormously jacked up the costs to farmers.  We are 
still seeing the downside of all of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point the minister of agriculture raised, and he talked 
about it again today, was this 60:40 split.  He correctly pointed 
out that there was a joint program for agriculture between the 
provinces and the federal government.  I do not believe it was 
part of the confederation bargain that agriculture would be split 
in any kind of a 60:40 arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back about 15 years ago to 1986, I remember very well that 
the premier of Saskatchewan, Grant Devine, was demanding a 
billion dollars to help grain and oilseed farmers.  This was in 
the midst of a provincial election campaign in Saskatchewan.  I 
recall as well that the billion dollars was forthcoming from the 
then Conservative government of Brian Mulroney with absolutely no 
40% arrangement having been made by Saskatchewan to pay for that. 
This is relatively recent history which we are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that the minister of agriculture referred to was 
the AIDA program, which is now morphed into the Canadian farm 
income program.  My recollection goes back to 1998 when the 
minister of agriculture spoke at the United Grain Growers 
convention in Regina.  It was in the fall of 1998, a few weeks 
before the AIDA program was announced in December of that year. 
The minister was very clear in his comments that morning that the 
real problem in agriculture was in the provinces of Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan, and by golly he was going to do something about it. 
The something became the AIDA program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the numbers the minister has revealed here today, the 
fact of the matter is, and the statistics bear it out, that the 
agricultural income disaster assistance plan has worked less well 
in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba than in any of the 
other provinces.  This has to do with the rules and regulations 
and the fact that it looks at previous years to sort out their 
income for this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With farming, especially in the grains and oilseeds which is 
predominantly in western Canada, having been at such a flat 
plateau over the last number of years, there were no dips.  With 
few exceptions, many farmers have not qualified for the AIDA 
program, nor do I predict will they be able to qualify in those 
two provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba for the CFIP. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1200

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me to comment on the fact that now we are getting 
signals from the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food saying 
that it will not be putting money into the CFIP plan in the 
province of Saskatchewan unless that province puts up its 40% of 
the money for CFIP.  I think that is a very wrong way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government of Saskatchewan has looked at agriculture 
support plans in the country and has concluded—and I agree very 
much with the member for Souris—Moose Mountain on this 
point—that this program and its predecessor, the AIDA program, 
simply do not work for Saskatchewan farmers.  What the government 
of Saskatchewan is saying is that it will put the equivalent 
money into agriculture to help farmers in its own province, but 
it does not want to contribute specifically to this program 
because it has demonstrably failed over the last number of years. 
I do not think there should be any demur on the part of the 
Government of Canada in regard to that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the government of Saskatchewan can demonstrate 
clearly that it is putting in new and equivalent money but is not 
putting it into a flawed program that does not work for its 
farmers, surely that should not be a reason to tell Saskatchewan 
that if it is not going to comply, it will not get its share of 
this $500 million that was announced a couple of weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as an aside on the $500 million, it was very revealing to 
me to hear the member for Toronto—Danforth say essentially how 
shocked and appalled he was, although those were not his exact 
words, that it was only $500 million, not $900 million, when the 
announcement was made two or three weeks ago.  Yet I well 
remember every one of those members standing up to vigorously 
applaud the minister of agriculture when he said that he had just 
come from meeting with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture and 
that the government had put in $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note again the duplicity in all of this and the theatrics that 
go on around here, with the member for Toronto—Danforth now 
saying how disappointed he is that there was not more money, 
although doubtless he was one of the people who was up and 
applauding the $500 million.  There were certainly a number of 
others who did so at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 1997, when the New Democrats and the Progressive 
Conservatives were once again represented in the House in 
sufficient numbers, the early arguments we heard when we started 
talking about the need for federal assistance for agriculture 
were that our pockets were not as deep as those of Washington or 
Brussels.  Those were the arguments at the time and to some 
extent they were correct, because the deficit had not yet been 
eliminated but the government was bent in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that argument, I submit, no longer applies.  The budget has 
been balanced.  There is a healthy surplus of some $21 billion 
this year, I think, and for the next four years thereafter it 
rolls out to about $100 billion, so there is no argument that our 
pockets are not as deep as those of Washington and Brussels or 
that we cannot compete with them.  The fact of the matter is that 
the government can compete.  The reality is that it chooses not 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not lost on farmers when just before Christmas an 
announcement was rolled out by the government about a $1.7 
billion loan guarantee for Bombardier.  There was no hint of any 
problem whatsoever in that aerospace industry.  There is $1.7 
billion in loan guarantees for Bombardier while farmers are 
fighting for any financial scrap they can get in their area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not put money into agriculture, I do not think there is 
any question that we are going to risk losing the food security 
we all want to retain.  I think the Europeans understand that. 
They have survived two famines over the past century and that is 
why they support their farmers.  They have simply determined that 
they are not going to accept a third famine and they are prepared 
to put some money into farming to ensure that it does not happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have responded and are saying that they will not 
put their farmers at a disadvantage in regard to what is 
happening in Europe.  The numbers have been bandied about this 
morning; they have put a lot of money into supporting their 
farmers in recent years.  We in Canada have not done so and I 
think that if we do not, we risk losing our security over food 
and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, in 
answer to some questions, I think, talked about the need for 
transition and about farms perhaps continuing to get larger, like 
they have over the last many decades.  That is all well and good, 
but if we are to have some transition programs, we are talking 
about an aging farm population.  The average age of farmers in 
Saskatchewan is 58 and I suspect it does not differ very much in 
that province from many other provinces.  If the government is 
planning to do that, it will have to look at putting some 
transition programs in place to help ease the adjustment of 
farmers who will be leaving the farm and going on to other types 
of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Toronto—Danforth talked about the disparity 
between producers and the food business, the retail sector.  He 
is absolutely right.  I think the National Farmers Union has 
indicated that for the last 30 years food production across 
Canada has basically held steady at something less than $5 
billion, while the retail sector has increased sixfold to $30 
billion or $31 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is well made, but we also now have people like Larry 
Solomon, who was recently quoted in the paper as saying that we 
cannot afford to continue to subsidize farmers and that if only 
we had small farms around big cities all our problems would be 
over.  It would be interesting for Mr. Solomon to visit 
Saskatchewan and see the reality of 47% of the arable land and 
figure out how everybody would be able to cluster around some 
large cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that we really do not have an 
oversupply in the country as long as we have people around the 
world who cannot feed themselves.  What we have is a difficulty 
in getting the food to the people who need it most.  It would be 
short term pain if we were to reduce our food supply and not be 
able to get back into that business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks with that point and just emphasize 
again that with a $100 billion surplus, there is a need to put 
some of that money into farming.  I have never been persuaded 
that the $900 million was enough.  There were a lot of farmers in 
western Canada saying not to go down that road, that they needed 
more than that.  It is probably important and it is probably high 
time that provincial ministers of agriculture, farmers and, to 
pick up on the point from the member for Toronto—Danforth, 
consumers as well try to have some kind of a discussion and 
debate about the future of agriculture in the country and where 
it is that we think we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than the top down approach, where lobbies happen, a rally 
happens and the government comes out with a dollar amount, I 
think we should turn the process on its head.  Let us have some 
discussion with the farm community, consumers and the agriculture 
ministers across the country.  Let us deal with it in that way to 
see if we can finally come up with a program that works for 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that we need a long term safety net program where, on 
one occasion in one year, there will be a certain group of 
farmers accessing the money, perhaps in southeast Saskatchewan or 
southwestern Manitoba, for example, because of the flooding there 
which wreaked havoc.  That might be for this year, and then next 
year there would be another.  There will always be uneven results 
in farming.  In those happy years where there are not, it may 
very well be that we could set aside some money and have a larger 
pool on which to draw in future years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the position of the New Democratic Party and I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak about it this afternoon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
let me begin by congratulating the Leader of the Opposition for 
moving this motion on a matter of real urgency, not simply to 
people who live in rural Canada, as the member across the way 
indicated earlier, but to Canadians as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me serve notice that I will be splitting my time in this 
debate with my colleague from Brandon—Souris who, as the House 
will know, moved the first emergency debate on this issue when 
the House resumed after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last night Statistics Canada reported that 63,000 Canadians 
have left agriculture in the last year.  They are farmers, farm 
workers and farm families.  What is most concerning is that of 
those who remain, the average age is steadily increasing.  People 
do not see a future in farming in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear about what that means.  There is a financial 
crisis now in agriculture.  There could be a food crisis tomorrow 
in Canada.  Consider for a moment a related field, that of 
energy.  Whether the Bush administration in the United States is 
right or wrong, it has now embarked on an energy policy to reduce 
the reliance of its consumers on foreign energy producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In agriculture, the Liberal Government of Canada is embarked on 
a program to increase the reliance of Canadian consumers on 
foreign food, because that is the natural consequence of driving 
Canadian farmers off the farms.  That would be food that could 
cost more than households in urban Canada are paying today.  It 
would be food that might be of a lower quality.  It would be food 
that could go to families in other countries if they were 
prepared to pay more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken for granted Canada's ability to produce large 
quantities of high quality food.  We will lose that ability if we 
continue to drive farmers off our farms, and driving farmers off 
the farm has been a consistent result of the Liberal government, 
which has cut the federal budget for agricultural support by 
nearly $3 billion since it came to office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this happen?  One way it happens is that governments 
too long in power or too easily in power become so arrogant that 
they ignore what the public is saying.  Indeed, in this House on 
this question, without any doubt at all, the government ignores 
what its caucus is saying.  That is why the proposal by the 
Leader of the Opposition to have this as a vote that is not 
construed as a question of confidence is of such great 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government governs by public opinion poll.  When it 
does that it runs the risk of enormous harm.  The Liberal 
government has done that before.  This is the government, after 
all, that let Canada drift to the brink of losing the last 
sovereignty referendum.  Do members remember the arguments?  The 
Prime Minister claimed there was no crisis.  He ignored the 
people on the ground.  He said that public opinion polls showed 
there was no crisis.  He nearly lost Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, again, he claims that there is no crisis in agriculture. He 
took a poll on the farm crisis in Toronto, Vancouver and 
Montreal.  The people his pollster questioned have not seen much 
of a farm crisis, not in Scarborough, not in Etobicoke, not in 
Ville Laval.  Therefore, since they did not see it, the pollster 
did not report it and reality cannot exist.  The Prime Minister 
puts rural Canada at risk because he has let urban Canadians 
believe that a cheap food policy is their natural right and there 
is nothing that would threaten it in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Prime Minister who nearly lost Canada in a referendum 
is in danger of losing now is rural Canada and, in doing that, 
losing the capacity to provide quality food grown here at home 
for Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If farmers keep leaving the land, more Canadian supermarkets 
will have to look abroad for their supplies.  They will have to 
look to Europe for their beef and their lamb.  They will have to 
pay higher international prices that consumers are spared from 
today because past governments have protected a strong 
agricultural industry at home. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not look after rural Canadians.  It changed 
the employment insurance program, thus penalizing workers in 
seasonal communities in Canada, communities that live primarily 
off fishing, forestry, tourism and other industries that are 
inactive during the winter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these communities are located in rural settings and the 
Liberal government continues to pick on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reductions in federal funding for health care have hurt all 
Canadians, but nowhere more than in rural communities where the 
quality of health care has largely diminished.  It is impossible 
to attract doctors and nurses to many rural communities and to 
encourage them to stay there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not helping the situation at all.  And 
so now, the government is turning its back on the Canadian 
agricultural industry and driving our farmers to bankruptcy. 
The Prime Minister, however, is saying that the polls reveal no 
crisis in agriculture. 
Why?  Because the majority of the people polled live in large 
cities.  They take agriculture for granted.  That is unfair and 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we lose our farming capability, the cost of food will shoot 
up in Canada.  Our country can do better.  We have done better 
in the past.  It was my privilege to be part of a Canadian 
government that was familiar with agriculture and concerned 
about the sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Liberal Party has cut substantially the programs we 
had put in place to help farmers.  Federal aid paid out to the 
farm sector today amounts to nearly $3 billion less than in the 
time of the Conservatives.  Agriculture is not a priority for 
the Liberal government.  Rural communities are not either.  This 
has to change. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about fiscal restraint or fiscal prudence.  This is 
about priorities.  The government is quite prepared to spend 
public money.  Let us look at the fountain in Shawinigan or the 
$1.3 million given yesterday to book publishers because Heather 
Reisman's company is paying publishers with returned books rather 
than cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is new money to spend, why is the heritage minister 
so much more influential in the government than the minister of 
agriculture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More damningly, let us look at the spending estimates for the 
government's own propaganda.  What is euphemistically called 
communications co-ordination services in the department of public 
works translates into government advertising.  It has a budget of 
more than $75 million this year.  That does not cover crown 
corporation advertising.  It does not cover what the Prime 
Minister will spend in Quebec.  The figure does not cover the 
cost of the polls which tell the Prime Minister there is no 
crisis in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadian farmers leave the land and Canada's food security is 
put in jeopardy, what is the government spending its money on? 
Perhaps the House has seen the expensive television ad for the 
Royal Canadian Mint featuring a little girl dancing over her 
birthday cake, lip-synching to the tune of <I>All I Want Is 
Money</I>.  Now there is a celebration of Canadian values and a 
model to which young Canadians can aspire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume the little girl in the expensive Liberal ad also 
wants her cake.  Because the government is driving farmers off 
the land, the odds grow every day that the grain and flour in the 
cakes that Canadians eat will come from foreign fields and will 
be grown by farmers whose governments make agriculture a 
priority, as is not the case in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wholeheartedly support the idea that there needs to be broad 
public debate about the future of agriculture.  We have serious 
issues to face:  the real nature of the viable family farm; what 
to do about international corporations and competition; what to 
do about vertical integration; what to do to ensure we are 
competitive around the world; and how do we sustain rural 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those issues are critically important to the future of the 
country but they are being ignored.  The House has a duty to play 
a leadership role in ensuring they are discussed.  We must face 
them.  We cannot simply let the future of farming drift away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The urgent issue now is money.  If it is urgent for us as a 
group, it is particularly urgent for Canadian farmers who want to 
continue to produce quality food for Canada, but who must go to 
their bankers and must put seed in the ground in the very next 
few weeks and have no help in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly support the motion, but we also strongly support the 
need for a very real, thorough debate on agriculture, the place 
of food security in Canada and the importance of a food policy 
that will not only keep our rural areas active but ensure the 
security and quality of the food eaten by our urban populations.

I thank the right hon. member for Calgary Centre for his most 
eloquent speech as well as his understanding of the issue.  As 
most members of the House recognize, the right hon. member for 
Calgary Centre has been in the House a long time and has 
experience in the House that I and others do not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question.  Looking at 
agriculture over the years, particularly in western Canada, has 
he ever seen the type of desperation that is now etched on the 
faces of producers he meets on a constant basis?  Has he ever 
seen such a lack of the political will necessary to give those 
producers hope, not only for this spring but for springs to come, 
with respect to their livelihoods in farming?  Has the right hon. 
member ever seen anything so desperate as what is now before the 
House with respect to agriculture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have not before, 
in my career in public life, seen this level of despair.  This 
despair is not simply among farmers one might consider as 
business people, but also among families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never in my life forget a conversation I had with a 
kindergarten teacher in rural Saskatchewan near Carnduff a little 
over a year ago.  She told me the story of a five year old who 
had been missing classes because he had to go home and walk 
around to restore the confidence of his father who was on the 
verge of losing his farm.  That is a terrible reversal of the 
roles that should exist in families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened that night in Carnduff is happening across the 
country in agriculture.  It is a human crisis, it is an economic 
crisis and it is a security crisis for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the government, my only explanation is that, try as he 
might, the minister of agriculture has no influence in the 
government.  I have never before seen a government in which a 
minister of agriculture had so little influence.  It makes me 
long for the days of Eugene Whelan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the right hon. leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party has had experience as prime minister.  He has had 
experience as a minister at the cabinet table.  He made remarks 
about priorities.  I would ask him a very specific question. 
Where would he suggest the cuts come from to find the $500 
million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say respectfully that a $200,000 fountain in Shawinigan 
or a portion of government advertising would really not make up 
the critical mass necessary to do the job here.  What will need 
to happen eventually are deep and profound sectoral cuts because, 
as the member would understand, there is a limited amount of cash 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the right hon. member is:  Where would he find 
that $500 million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a serious 
question and it emphasizes the point that we are dealing here 
with a question of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally would not spend the $500 million, or whatever it is 
we are spending, on the gun registry.  It is a waste of money and 
a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about government advertising.  The government is 
spending excessively on advertising; $75 million, that we can 
trace in one piece of the estimates, for ads that need not run 
and serve no public purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much money can we gain here?  We can gain millions of 
dollars here.  There is money in the EI account that could be 
directed toward this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the member's point.  This is a difficult question of 
priorities.  We must, when considering it, consider not only the 
moneys we might need to take from other expenditures or from 
government services, but we must also consider the cost of doing 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will be the cost in the future if our farm population 
continues to age and no young people are prepared to go into the 
production of secure, high quality food?  What will we do in the 
future if we continue to downgrade the infrastructure that is 
available in rural communities, communities that contribute 
significantly to the quality and distinctiveness of Canadian 
life?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions are serious but when they are considered by the 
Liberal government agriculture always comes out last.  That is 
not acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I commend the right hon. member for his remarks. 
I also commend the member opposite, the hon. member for 
Toronto—Danforth, who has a great personal interest in the issue 
and has taken initiatives that have furthered the cause of those 
in crisis in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the right hon. member focuses on remarks he made 
about priorities.  I would also put to him that this is an issue 
of leadership.  With respect to the department of agriculture, I 
have a quote from one of the Liberal members from Prince Edward 
Island.  An article that was in the <I>Guardian</I> newspaper 
quotes the hon. member for Malpeque as saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying problem from the start has been that the very 
department (Ag Canada) supposed to be working in the interest of 
the farmers has been the greatest obstacle. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—but to be honest, it's virtually useless talking to Ag Canada— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a quote from a Liberal member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in Prince Edward Island is outside the normal 
circumstances of federal-provincial problems.  The P.E.I. 
industry has made large sacrifices to protect the rest of Canada 
and there is no certainty that the U.S. border will even be open 
for the remainder of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the right hon. member could focus a little bit on 
that situation, on the lack of leadership shown there, and on the 
fact that the federal government has come up with less than half 
of what P.E.I. potato farmers were looking for to address their 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think we sometimes 
forget that P.E.I. potato farmers have made sacrifices at the 
behest of the federal government to ensure their sales were 
within Canada.  The sacrifice they made on Canada's behalf should 
surely be reflected in the aid the Canadian government gives them 
at a time of exceptional crisis, a crisis that grows from one 
field, not from several fields.  The support that has been given 
so far is not only inadequate, it puts at risk an industry that 
is fundamental to the future of that province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
as always, it is difficult to follow the right hon. member for 
Calgary Centre.  He speaks so eloquently and knowledgeably about 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry that I must once again stand in the House to speak to 
an issue I thought the minister of agriculture and the Prime 
Minister would have by now realized is of such a serious nature. 
I am sorry that the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake had to put 
forward a motion on his own supply day to once again profile what 
is a very serious crisis in our communities and in our country. 
Unfortunately that is what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to continue to profile the issue because 
unfortunately the government has not seen the seriousness of the 
crisis.  It is serious.  It is extremely serious.  I am talking 
of farmers whose livelihood comes from the land, farmers, whom I 
deal with on a daily basis by telephone and in my constituency 
office, who are absolutely desperate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a way of life.  It is their livelihood.  It is all they 
know.  Their families before them and their families before them 
came from the land and they are now in my office and on my phone 
saying that they do not know what to do.  They want to grow 
products for the rest of the country and the rest of the world 
but they have found themselves in a position where they may not 
be able to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is spring today, March 20.  One month from now a lot of 
them should be on the land.  Unfortunately the government, 
without the necessary supports, has thrown them onto the garbage 
heap of our society.  That is sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just about farmers.  It is about their families. 
It is about their children who go to schools in the 
communities.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about the wives who work off farm and have always worked 
off farm to provide a livelihood for those families.  It is about 
the same children the hon. member for Calgary Centre spoke of who 
are concerned about the welfare of their parents.  This is 
extremely serious.   It is about the communities that surround my 
community and the communities of the member for Palliser and of 
the member for Souris—Moose Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community the backbone of our economy is agriculture.  It 
is desperate when we walk into a small rural community and we see 
boarded up businesses, schools being closed down, and elevators 
being ripped out.  We see the way of life being destroyed in 
those communities.  That is what this is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not about the ego of a prime minister.  It is about 
families, communities and farmers.  It is about businesses that 
have tried to develop in communities and because of lack of 
support are closing their doors.  When those businesses close 
their doors, they close the doors on employment. The people 
employed in those businesses then leave their communities.  Where 
do they go?  They go to Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto.  They go 
to urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a rural way of life that we want to preserve, not only 
in western Canada but across Canada.  That rural way of life that 
should and must be preserved is not even on the government's 
radar screen.  Why has this happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not happening because farm families, communities and 
businesses said that they were making mistakes and therefore they 
had to live by them.  That would be easy to fix.  The reason they 
find themselves in this position is unfair competition with the 
Americans and with the Europeans.  They are eating our lunch and 
the minister of agriculture is allowing it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening right now with unfair subsidies is that the 
Americans, between 1998 and 2000, provided $48 billion of support 
for agriculture.  In that same timeframe in Canada it was less 
than $3 billion.  That is despicable.  The government is allowing 
the Americans to put us out of business through no fault of our 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem we have right now is increased costs.  In most 
cases when people are in the business of making things they can 
pass on costs to consumers.  In our particular case the costs are 
going up quite dramatically because the fertilizers being 
utilized on the land are natural gas based.  We know what is 
happening in the natural gas industry right now.  Costs are going 
up by 100% over last year's costs.  Fuel being put into a 
tractor, a swather or a combine has gone up again about 100%, or 
45% coming back in the other direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These costs cannot be passed on because the commodity price that 
is being driven down by these unfair subsidies is now less than 
what it was in 1995-96.  It does not take a very long time to 
realize that when it costs more money to make a product than to 
sell it one cannot stay in business very long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not only finding ourselves in this position because of 
unfair competition and increased costs.  It is also because, as was 
mentioned earlier, we have a government and particularly a Prime 
Minister who have lost the priority and the profile of this 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also mentioned earlier that the government wants to 
govern by polls.  I was told by a member of the backbench that 
the Prime Minister said that they had done plenty for agriculture 
and that nobody out there was making any noise as to what the 
problems are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last four weeks we have had a minister of agriculture 
burnt in effigy in Saskatchewan.  We have had a rally here in 
Lansdowne Park, at which I, the member for Palliser and others 
spoke in front of thousands of farmers.  We have had people in 
the Manitoba legislature sleeping overnight with their families, 
without sleeping bags because they were not allowed to take them 
in.  Why did they do this?  It was because they were desperate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was there a profile given to the seriousness of the industry? Of 
course there was.  Where has the Prime Minister been when he 
cannot see what is going on around him?  We had members of his 
own party, his own backbenchers stand to say very effectively 
that there must be more support now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three issues with respect to support.  The first one 
is support now.  The motion is very specific.  It asks for an 
additional $400 million.  The hon. member for Toronto—Danforth 
said that $400 million was an awful lot of money above the $500 
million that has already been expended.  On a per acre basis, 
that probably, in most cases in Saskatchewan and Manitoba alone, 
would mean less than $5 per acre.  That does not even take into 
consideration the cost of what the inputs are that are going into 
the land for the coming year.  Four hundred million dollars above 
the $500 million is the minimum amount that is necessary to make 
sure our producers can get onto the land.  That is an ad hoc 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember listening to the minister in the House saying many 
times that the government does not like ad hoc programs in 
agriculture.  He said that the government would like a long term, 
well thought out safety net program that will solve the problem. 
I see no evidence that the government is leading in that 
direction.  Everything that has been dealt with, in my experience 
in the House, in agriculture, has been totally ad hoc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know about the ice storm in Ontario and Quebec back in 
1998.  It was ad hoc.  The government gave money to Quebec and to 
Ontario for issues that have never been dealt with before on an 
ad hoc basis.  I remember the 1998 flood in the Red River Valley. 
What was the program for agriculture?  It was an ad hoc program. 
They received lost inputs, seeding requirements and a lot of 
programs that were kind of made up on the go and put into place 
ad hoc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, when the hon. member for Palliser's area and my area in 
southwestern Manitoba were affected by extreme rain conditions, 
to the point where 1.1 million acres were not planted, we asked 
the minister for some programs.  He told us that he could not do 
ad hoc programs.  He said that we had a wonderful program called 
AIDA that would take into consideration all the losses suffered 
in the area and that AIDA would fix everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half of what my office handles in my constituency are complaints 
about the AIDA program.  The program has not solved the problems. 
In fact maybe the minister was getting off track.  Maybe he 
should have gone to an ad hoc program.  I would have been much 
happier, believe me, because I would have had some compensation 
for people who required it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough say 
that there is no program right now in P.E.I.  The government came 
along, pulled $14.6 million out of the air and it is an ad hoc 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We desperately need money now.  All members in the House must 
vote in favour of the $400 million.  We need long term programs 
that will put some hope back into agriculture.  We need a 
government and a Prime Minister who will say publicly that there 
is a problem in agriculture and that, yes, they are prepared to 
fix it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I might say, without telling my 
age, that I have been directly or indirectly involved with this 
industry probably longer than anyone in the House, but I have 
never seen people so absolutely at a dead end as they are now. 
This is no longer a question about agriculture.  It is now a 
question of human tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to direct a question to the hon. member.  Would he 
not agree that there is a lack of funding right now to see that 
the crops in my area and his area get into the ground?  If the 
money is not there, is the government saying that it will let 
this human tragedy play its full course and maybe it will die out 
and go away? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if the government had the will it would come to 
the rescue.  Obviously it does not have the will so it cannot 
find a way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Madam Speaker, I could not agree more 
with the hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain.  I said that 
earlier.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There always seems to be demonstrated a lack of political will, 
to the point where the Prime Minister says that there is no 
problem.  He does not talk to the same people we talk to on a 
daily basis, because then he would recognize that there is a 
problem. He received thousands of phone calls from producers in 
my area and the hon. member's area.  We know because the his 
office returned the calls.  Why is he not getting the message? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were political will, could it be fixed?  Absolutely, 
and let me give an example.  Prior to the election we sat in the 
House when the Minister of Finance stood and announced a $1.3 
billion program for an energy rebate.  There was no protest. 
There were no ministers burned in effigy.  There were no phone 
calls made. There were no people protesting in legislatures.  All 
of a sudden this was the major issue of the day.  The 
government's political will was to do something, so it put in 
$1.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have to do to tell the government that it is also an 
issue in agriculture and that if it comes up with the same amount 
of dollars we will be able to fix the problem in a very short 
period of time?  There is no political will and that is the 
problem. That is why it is necessary that the motion stays in the 
House and that the government listens to us regarding the 
agriculture industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I congratulate the member for 
Brandon—Souris on his great speech.  I also congratulate him on 
his basketball club that played St. Francis Xavier in Halifax. 
They were great ambassadors of the Manitoba people.  They should 
be congratulated on a great effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Canadian farmers know what east and west coast fishermen 
have been going through for many years.  It is sad for me as a 
member of the New Democratic Party representing Nova Scotia to 
stand in the House to make that comparison.  That is exactly what 
has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and previous governments have basically said to 
the family fishermen that they are finished.  It does not even 
have the stamina or the wherewithal to tell the truth.  It says 
quite clearly that the family farm is finished.  If that is the 
direction of the government, it should stand up on its hind heels 
and tell the people of the farming community throughout the 
country that is the game plan.  That is exactly what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a tragic policy on behalf of the large corporate sector 
which will gobble up these farms and destroy the hopes and 
aspirations of many young people who wish to pursue agriculture 
as a proud and noble career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Alliance for bringing forward the motion today.  It 
is very important as the member and others have indicated.  We 
only hope the government will honour this commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Saskatchewan party, Elwin Hermanson, a 
previous member of the House, said in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be no guarantees to small business.  There should be 
no loan guarantees to farms.  We should not treat farmers 
differently. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the leader of the Reform Party said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brute truth is the prairie provinces cannot support the 
number of farmers they have been supporting. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud and would like the Conservative Party member to 
elaborate on why there is a change of policy in the Reform Party. 
We are glad it is doing it, but it may be a little too late.  All 
the government is doing is honouring the Alliance policy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sorry, but the 
member's time is up.  I will permit the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris to give us a short answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Madam Speaker, my answer will be very 
short because I cannot speak for the Alliance.  I do know that it 
has had some changes in policy and some changes in thinking on 
any number of issues in the House, regardless of whether it be 
Stornoway, pensions or whatever.  It seems to change its mind on 
a number of issues.  This is just another one where it seems to 
have finally seen the light.  It has come to the issue a bit late 
but we certainly thank the Alliance for that.

the motion moved by the official opposition leader, the member

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call on the government to authorize an 
additional $400 million in emergency assistance for Canadian

or in place to date), to be paid out in 2001, and that the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is customary, the motion was amended by adding the word 
“immediately”. The government is therefore now being asked to 
pay out this additional $400 million immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am gradually becoming familiar with the world of agriculture 
which is a completely new portfolio for me, but one thing I have 
understood.  Recently I attended a meeting of leading 
agricultural stakeholders in a room here and I heard the 
minister of agriculture say “In Canada, there is always someone 
somewhere saying that it is too little, too late.  There is 
always too much rain, or it is too dry, there is too much of one 
thing or not enough of another. 
It is never possible, in the world of agriculture, from coast to 
coast, to please everyone”. Fine, but what is amazing is that 
the minister of agriculture manages to displease everyone at the 
same time. This is amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are unanimous in saying that the half a billion dollar 
effort—and I do recognize the effort—announced by the Canadian 
government two weeks ago is totally inadequate. On this, people 
are unanimous from coast to coast. Some have their own way of 
putting it but, generally speaking, people agree on that. For 
example, the Quebec minister of agriculture said that it is a 
good initiative—he is being positive—but that there is still 
two-thirds of the way left to go. It is not enough and everyone 
agrees on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should have announced an investment of $1.5 
billion, not half a billion dollars. With regard to that 
announcement, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture also 
confirmed that this amount is far from the minimum of $1.5 
billion a year that would be required over the next three years 
to help farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need to look at all the releases issued on that 
occasion. Each stakeholder has its own style of communication. 
For example, in Quebec the UPA says that the amount is barely 
enough to keep one's head above the water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Brandon—Souris rightly pointed out that the 
fact that the government wasted $1.4 billion in January 2001 to 
fulfil an election promise was rather shameful. He said $1.3 
billion, but I have always known the amount to be $1.4 billion. 
We will not argue over $100 million. After all, it is peanuts 
considering how the government seems to be throwing money 
out the window. 
We know that money was very badly spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government could find close to $1.5 billion quickly in 
order to keep a campaign promise, one might well wonder how it 
can be that the ministers were incapable of sitting down for 
discussions in order to acknowledge that Canadian agriculture 
was in urgent need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend I met a number of my constituents and many of 
them told me “Being made responsible for agriculture may be 
interesting for you, but it will not be easy.  It is a difficult 
area, because farmers are rarely content”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I got involved with agriculture especially I have an 
understanding of why farmers are never content. 
They are constantly having to beg for help, and when they do get 
any it is always out of synch with their needs.  When they get 
half a billion, they have to continue to demand the full billion 
they really need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to understand why the government is not capable of 
giving them what they are calling for.  We ought to be able to 
sit down for once and for all and say that crisis management is 
over, that now there will be long term planning and find out 
what the needs of agriculture are.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to stop seeing agriculture as a holdover from the 
past.  Obviously it is a style of life that must be maintained, 
but agriculture is also a vital industry contributing nearly 10% 
of the gross domestic product.  It provides jobs for hundreds of 
thousands of people across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is not just the lifestyle that must be maintained 
so we can go for a drive in the country and say there are farms 
around still, we will go camping on a farm or stop over there or 
do all sorts of things on the farm to keep it traditional. 
No, we have to do something and find a way to provide the 
millions of dollars families need to resolve their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be more specific about the contribution agriculture makes to 
our economy, in 2000, 46% of net farm income in the United States came 
from government subsidies.  Canadian support for the agri-food 
sector has been cut by half over the past ten years, shrinking 
from $5.1 billion dollars in 1991 to $2.6 billion in 2001.  In 10 
years, spending on agriculture has decreased from 3.6% of the 
federal budget to 1.7% of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from these reductions that since the Liberal 
government has been in office, the surpluses it now has coming 
out of its ears it found in employment insurance—as we have 
said—the former unemployment insurance. 
According to the auditor general, it helped itself to at least 
$28 billion, mostly in worker contributions.  But there are also 
billions of dollars in subsidies and assistance that our farmers 
used to receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Canada has become one of the OECD countries providing the 
least support for agriculture, $163 per capita, as opposed to 
$336 per capita in Europe and $350 per capita in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With figures such as these, it is not hard to understand why the 
farmers of Quebec and of Canada cannot go up alone against the 
competition from the U.S. and European countries which provide 
generous subsidies for farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our WTO agreements are being held up as an excuse for being over 
zealous and cutting our support to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the disasters so eloquently described by the 
members who spoke before me, our farmers have had to face many 
difficulties with much less assistance from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have another problem as well:  the increase in production 
costs, which is largely the result of the increase in fuel costs. 
This is exacerbating the structural crisis in the agricultural 
sector.  On the whole, producers have seen their fuel costs alone 
go up $400 million since 1998. This in turn means that it will 
also cost more to produce fertilizers.  There goes another $400 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So while the motion is asking to immediately give farm families 
an additional $400 million, the total amount would still be 
$600 million less than what is needed by farmers. But it goes 
without saying that an additional $400 million would be helpful 
and might enable farmers to keep a little more than their heads 
above water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec and Canadian farmers are confronted with soaring 
production costs and a reduction in prices on the market. They 
are suffering a shortfall that is now in excess of $1 billion. In 
a period of budget surpluses, Canada refuses to provide fair 
assistance to its agriculture industry and is letting the 
situation deteriorate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the agricultural sector currently accounts 
for 10% of the gross domestic product. It also accounts for 
about 10% of the jobs in the country and provides Canadians—and 
this is worth noting—with the world's least expensive grocery 
basket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we are number one in the world. In spite of the fact that 
the government does not look after them, our farmers continue to 
produce food items at a reasonable price after all since our 
grocery basket is the least expensive in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to solve the crisis, the government must implement long 
term structuring measures based on the actual costs of 
production. The Canadian agri-food sector includes not just 
farmers but suppliers, processors, shippers, grocers, and restaurant 
workers.  This entire industry is the third ranking employer in 
Canada.  It is far from insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must therefore ensure that an industry that generated in the 
year 2000 more than $95 billion worth of business is worthy of 
our taking the time to reflect on how best we can give it a hand 
up out of the mess it is in, and enable it to at least move 
onward and upward like any other industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, there was no hesitation when it came to giving a 
tiny little business like Bombardier a $87 million hand up. 
With it, Bombardier was able to finance the development 
necessary to make it into a company that is now flourishing both 
in Canada and in the rest of the world.  If we want our 
agricultural sector to develop a degree of self-sufficiency and 
if we want to see it develop further, it needs to be given 
the required assistance for that forward move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the federation has said that the requirement was $1.5 
billion over three years, I asked the farmers of my region—the 
lower St. Lawrence, a tiny region when compared to the whole of 
Canada—to give me some idea what amount of money I would have to 
give them if I had the means of meeting their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The means are there, the needs corresponding to catastrophes 
they have lived through, but there are also needs that relate to 
development of what I call planning of medium and long term 
visions.  For example, another $750,000 would be required to 
compensate producers who have lost their herds as a result of 
scrapie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the government decided to provide compensation. 
However, it sat down with business people, not with producers. 
They used that and said “Fine, that will be a good thing.  We 
have to develop traceability.  We will therefore use this 
opportunity to spend $1 million of the money we are giving you in 
order to produce, in the field of informatics, everything 
necessary to keep track of your sheep production from the farm 
to the table”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this time while they were taking the means to set up 
this system, which I consider praiseworthy, it would for 
example, make it possible to take $750,000 away from producers, 
money they could have applied to the purchase of animals to 
rebuild their flocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region agricultural lime production is being developed. 
It would require $400,000.  There is a plan to develop cattle 
farming over a five year period which would require 
$2.5 million.  A potato marketing project—because my region 
produces potatoes—would require $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to establish the standards so dear to the Food 
Inspection Agency for the abattoir located in my riding just to 
put the standards into effect it will take $150,000. If it does 
not get $150,000 to implement the standards, I wonder what sort 
of job the Food Inspection Agency will do if the money is not 
available to put the standards into practice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the lower St. Lawrence region is a farming region we have 
tried to develop quality products.  The humus in the region is 
excellent and we must therefore develop quality products.  We 
are very advanced in the development of organic farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One brand name, Les saveurs du Bas Saint-Laurent, has been put on 
the market.  Expanding this line would require $175,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our region also produces maple syrup and honey an 
investment of $60,000 would be necessary to develop a shared 
brand name for these two products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also large sheep production operations in our region. 
Since we have no wool processing plant $500,000 would be 
necessary to set one up.  Otherwise, we can do nothing with the 
wool and this entire sector of the economy will be unproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would need $500,000 for a meat processing centre in addition 
to $100,000 to build a cheese factory to process the goat's milk 
produced in our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An investment of $150,000 is needed to rebuild the Centre 
Avibier.  Finally, $60,000 is needed to develop farm tourism so 
that we can keep our rural way of life alive, just to mention 
this aspect in passing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So a small region like mine needs $5.375 million to meet urgent 
and real needs that relate to sustainable development and that 
require long term policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region could be further developed which would create jobs 
and allow most people to leave the employment insurance program. 
Jobs would be created in primary and secondary processing 
plants if only the government showed some vision and stopped 
relying on crisis management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government thinks that people will be happy with half a 
billion dollars. We do not even really know how all the issues 
will be solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleagues from the Canadian Alliance for bringing 
forward this motion today. 
This is an extremely important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Minister of Finance said that he is leaning toward 
fall budgets, we should not expect too much this spring. Yet 
today is a beautiful day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be important for the minister of agriculture and all 
his colleagues to understand that action is urgently required in 
agriculture since it is a leading industry in Canada. It is an 
industry we should be proud of because we will be increasingly 
dependent on what is produced worldwide if we cannot become 
increasingly self-sufficient in the agricultural industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time today 
with the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quickly deal with three questions today:  Why are we 
here, where are we going with agriculture, and what are we doing 
with it?  We are faced with a desperate situation in agriculture 
today.  This morning I heard people criticize the Alliance for 
its agriculture policy.  I want to read it to them to assure them 
it has not changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our agriculture policy reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure a self-reliant and economically viable agricultural 
sector, we will vigorously seek free entry of Canadian products 
into foreign markets.  We support and will advocate the phased 
reduction and elimination of all subsidies, support programs and 
trade restrictions in conjunction with other countries. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We further go on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe it is in the best interest of Canada and Canadian 
agriculture that the industries under the protection of Supply 
Management remain viable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our agriculture policy has not changed.  It continues to be 
compassionate and based on common sense.  We are in a situation 
now that requires some common sense and we do not seem to be 
getting any direction from the government.  We are stuck in a 
subsidy war with the European Union and the United States, and 
Canada is the third and smallest partner in those trade wars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our grain and oilseed prices have crumbled to the point where 
farmers cannot compete.  Why do we need to help?  When incomes 
have fallen to 20% of the five year averages, something needs to 
be done.  We either let our farmers go down the drain or we help 
out.  We are not prepared to let them go down the drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must expect changes in agriculture as the industry goes 
along, but seeing 23,000 people per year leaving the industry is 
far too many.  We have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is this: Where are we with agriculture and 
what are the specific problems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first problem to which I have already referred is 
financial viability.  People put many years into their farms.  We 
heard the member for Brandon—Souris talk about that.  At a young 
age they begin trying to build equity in an operation.  They make 
the best decisions they can.  They try to raise their families on 
the farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farming is not just a living.  It is a way of life that 
contributes $95 billion to the Canadian economy.  A farmer's 
decisions can be absolutely right but in the end the results can 
be wrong.  They must make their crop selections and guess their 
incomes far ahead of production.  When incomes go down and costs 
go up, as we have seen with the price of diesel and fertilizer, 
grains and oilseeds are no longer viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other problems in our agricultural sector, one of which 
is political interference.  I have talked a little about 
subsidization.  According to reports, U.S. farmers are asking for 
$14 billion more in subsidies on top of the approximately $28 
billion they already get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers cannot afford to be involved in trade wars.  Last week 
we had a discussion on softwood lumber.  It is the small people 
who are affected by trade wars and disputes.  Wheat and cattle 
have begun to get dragged into the softwood lumber dispute. 
Farmers cannot afford that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see trade problems in the area of P.E.I. potatoes.  We feel 
for the people who have produced their product and then are not 
allowed to take it to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern for farmers is transportation.  Our system 
continues to be very expensive, particularly in western Canada, 
and not all that efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers are separated from legislation which seems to be made 
far away from them and into which they have no input.  Two 
examples are the firearms legislation in western Canada, which is 
still a big issue, and the endangered species act that producers 
look at with suspicion because they realize they do not have a 
big say in how it is being put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have concerns over GMOs.  Many have grown them.  They 
are unsure whether they can continue to grow them or even whether 
they should.  The government needs to give some direction and 
regulation in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are food safety issues.  Producers are concerned about 
food safety but they also need to be protected from overreaction. 
Producers have issues over seed patents.  We put public money 
into seed research and then turn around and sell the new 
varieties to private companies, and farmers in turn must deal 
with those companies.  It is one more expense for the farmer and 
for the taxpayer.  Those kinds of things make farmers and 
producers feel marginalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps my biggest long term concern, and the concern of many 
people to whom I have talked, is that there seems to be no 
leadership or coherent direction in Canadian agriculture.  I have 
farmed for 25 years.  For decades we have seen ad hoc programs. I 
would sum up what I have seen over the years by saying that 
policies are often too little, too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial governments need to sit down and 
accept responsibility for the sector, negotiate what they will do 
and begin to develop long term plans.  Uncertainty in this 
business kills.  We have enough of it without the government 
providing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked a little about why we are here and where we are with 
agriculture.  I will now talk about where we are going.  I have 
some suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest we begin by building on the positives.  Specialty 
crops have been a real success story in Canada in the last few 
years.  Organic crops like kamut and the chick pea industry 
which has developed out of nowhere in western Canada are 
examples of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second success story is the development of the pulse 
industry.  It has seen a 2,500% increase in productivity in the 
past 20 years.  It is now a $1 billion industry and within the 
next five years it is expected to be a $2 billion industry.  That 
is a success story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third success story has been our livestock industry. 
Infrastructure is being developed and has been developed to 
support that industry.  We need to protect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are three sectors where we have had limited government 
involvement and have had success.  We need to give the Food 
Inspection Agency the power to keep our cattle industry safe.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we need emergency aid at this point.  People have 
been criticizing the Alliance for what they see as a change in 
policy.  As I have explained, it is not a change in policy at 
all.  Farmers need compensation.  We are prepared to deal with 
that and we want to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an emergency structure for natural disasters. People 
come into our offices on a fairly regular basis who have not had 
satisfaction in dealing with natural disasters such as floods. We 
need long term planning for those kinds of situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to strengthen our insurance programs.  Those programs 
have worked for the most part.  Producers and the government 
contribute to them, and with adjustments as we go along they seem 
to be working not too badly.  It was mentioned earlier that we 
need transition programs.  I would echo that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a long term safety net program with producer 
participation that works better than AIDA.  We also need good 
trade negotiations to reduce foreign subsidization.  We need to 
reduce our involvement in that regard.  We need our trade 
negotiators to sit down and do serious business in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our motion says, we need $400 million of short term aid to 
farmers.  I would call on the government to do more than just 
criticize the opposition.  In the last two weeks it has changed 
its tactics.  Last week members such as the member for 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey expressed the opinion that it is 
the opposition's fault the government has not responded to the 
crisis.  I reject that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week there has been a very expensive Canada-wide media 
campaign to convince Canadians that farmers are well off as it is 
now.  The government still does not understand that driving a 
wedge between people is not good agricultural policy.  Perhaps 
again its agriculture policy is being driven by poll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe the lack of planning and commitment we see in 
the government.  Liberal backbenchers today need to stand and 
show their influence.  The opposition has done its work.  We have 
tried to bring the issue to the forefront and we have done so 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many opposition members agree with the Liberal member for 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex who said, in response to the 
government's last announcement of new agricultural funding: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was one of my darkest days in politics so far.  I had really 
honestly thought the Prime Minister understood the plight of the 
grain and oilseed farmers...I just really felt my knees were cut 
out. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call on members opposite to support our motion today to get 
involved, take care and do their part in correcting the emergency 
situation we have on the farm. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the 
debate to support the motion to immediately authorize an 
additional $400 million in emergency assistance for Canadian farm 
families.  It is clear that the concerns of Ontario farmers have 
been falling on deaf ears with the government.  Farmers have been 
facing their worst income crisis since the great depression.  It 
is also clear that only a Canadian Alliance government would 
listen to the problems facing rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Renfrew-Nipissing—Pembroke, farmers are 
experiencing the same income crisis that is being experienced 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that a large portion of the terrain in my riding is 
the Canadian Shield, which has poor, rocky soils where there is 
soil, production is substantial.  Beef farms account for over 50% 
of all farms in Renfrew county.  Dairy, field crop and 
miscellaneous specialty farms account for most of the remaining 
farms.  Renfrew is a leader in hay, maple syrup and Christmas 
tree production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the profile of farming in my riding is changing.  The 
number of beef farms is steadily declining and field crop and 
miscellaneous operations are on the increase.  That is happening 
because our farmers are searching for ways to make a living in 
light of the problem of low commodity prices.  Here in Ontario 
the federal government has developed a reputation of being 
anti-farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past year Ontario farmers have been faced with bad weather, 
reduced yields and declining prices due to the international 
agreement the Liberals signed that created the World Trade 
Organization.  Not only did the new agreement end the provision 
which protected supply management from imports, it exposed 
Canadian farmers to penalties which the Liberals claimed would 
not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1999 the WTO ruled that Canada was dumping milk on 
to the world market and it ordered Canada to change or to stop 
exporting. 
This exposed the lie told to farmers when they were advised that 
supply management would not be affected by the Mulroney-Liberal 
trade agreements, and that there would be no effect on domestic 
supply management.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals then tried to cover their tracks by incorrectly 
stating that a Canadian Alliance government would unilaterally 
end domestic supply management.  That is false and the worst form 
of negative politics from a federal government that thrives on 
negative politics.  The Canadian Alliance knows that farmers want 
straight talk from Ottawa about what is happening in agriculture 
here at home and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes it is in the best interest of 
farmers, Canada and agriculture that the industries under the 
protection of supply management remain viable.  While the 
Canadian Alliance supports greater international trade, our 
farmers will only benefit from increased trade if it is rules 
based fair trade.  We will continue to support supply managed 
farmers.  Tariffs will only be reduced and my party and I will 
only consider changes to domestic policies if other countries 
match our existing commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that a significant segment of the Ontario farming 
community did not support the Mulroney-Liberal trade agreements 
because it feared the deal would mean the end of the family farm. 
The Mulroney-Liberal trade agreements are a direct assault on 
rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario since the current government took power, according to 
Statistics Canada the number of farmers for whom farming is their 
principle means of livelihood have declined from 121,200 to 
88,200, or a loss of 33,000 farmers.  Farmers' worst fears are 
being realized with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Ontario Corn Producers Association, federal 
statistics on farm income data for all provinces show that the 
total net farm income was substantially lower in Ontario than in 
Saskatchewan in both 1998 and 1999, even though the scale of 
agricultural output was larger in Ontario.  Total net farm income 
was $484 million in 1998 and $281 million in 1999 in Ontario. For 
Saskatchewan the figures were $603 million in 1998 and $531 
million in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the past federal election in rural Ontario, some elected 
politicians had big words of encouragement but the sad fact is 
that it was just another last minute vote ploy.  With two days 
before an election call, when this cynical government thought it 
might need the votes from farmers, it promised bigger and more 
flexible AIDA program payments.  The AIDA funding, offered two 
years ago, is for the most part still in Ottawa.  Funding 
programs are meaningless unless they reach those who need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes Ontario's market revenue program 
must be maintained or it will be lost for good.  We believe the 
program has served Ontario producers well.  We will not allow the 
program to run out of money or be scrapped because if it does the 
Mulroney-Liberal trade agreements will not allow us to start it 
up again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario farmer in rural Ontario is an endangered species. 
The Prime Minister and his contemptuous advisers knew that they 
did not have to make commitments to farmers but were quick to 
throw money at rich urbanites, including $500 million for the 
Toronto waterfront and $380 million for new four lane highways 
and bridges for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in Ontario have long feared that the Liberal government 
policy of driving them off the land would mean a loss in 
political influence.  That grim realization has come with the 
November 27 election results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario farmers are asking for a level playing field. 
Agriculture is important.  I say that to all members of the House 
but I particularly direct my comments to the Liberal MPs in 
Ontario who have rural constituencies but cannot seem to convince 
their leader that agriculture is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just a western Canada issue to ignore, as the 
Liberal Party tends to ignore the west.

not forget because as their voice on Parliament Hill I will

Canadian Alliance dated January 2000 and reads:

elimination of all subsidies, support programs and trade 
restrictions in conjunction with other countries.

is twelve years old and the other one which is nearly one year 
old, are very contradictory to the motion proposed by the Leader

whether or not she agrees that there is a contradiction in the 
two statements and which one she supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was not aware that 
my rifleman talents were known that widely.  The Canadian

away subsidies from Canadian farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to this issue.  I represent an urban riding 
in Ottawa Centre, the riding in which the House of Commons is 
situated.  I am a bit at a loss when I see the official 
opposition come forward with motions such as the one before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated in an earlier question to the member of the 
Reform Party, her party policies call for the exact— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to know what the member is talking about.  I 
thought the Reform Party of Canada was demised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I would caution the 
hon. member to use the official name of the official opposition 
which is the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Madam Speaker, my deepest apologies.  It 
was an honest oversight on my part.  It is difficult for a 
government member to differentiate between the old party and the 
new party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy of the Canadian Alliance Party speaks very much to 
the opposite of what the motion is speaking to today.  As I told 
a colleague on the other side earlier, it is quite clear and 
quite unequivocal that in essence it contradicts what is in the 
motion.  I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Elgin—Middlesex—London. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair game when we have consistency before us, but when we 
see situations like this one it is quite frustrating because we 
do not know where that party sits on the issue.  At the end of 
the day the issue before us is an issue of fairness. 
It really has nothing to do with partisanship.  It has nothing to 
do with the political affiliation of one member or another.  It 
has to do with the issue of fairness.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where the farming communities across Canada 
are telling us that they are faced with a situation where farmers 
in other countries, in particular south of the border, are 
getting unfair subsidies.  As a result they are putting our 
farming communities at a disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an absolutely fair statement and fair game.  Ultimately 
at the end of the day it is imperative that those in the farming 
community are playing with the same rules.  Therefore, if 
subsidies are being put on the table by other countries, it does 
not necessarily mean that we will have to bring in more 
subsidies.  It means, though, that we will have to do our utmost 
to ensure a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime what should we do?  Should we let our farmers 
leave?  Should we let our farmers suffer the inequity that exists 
while we are fighting the injustice that is taking place 
elsewhere, or should we fight for them and at the same time do 
something to support them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the government has done.  Every business 
venture and every trading nation has to play by the rules set out 
by the World Trade Organization and by the rules set out 
previously under the free trade agreement and eventually under 
NAFTA.  We all have to abide by and to follow the same rules.  We 
have to subscribe to those rules and we have to ensure that our 
industry subscribes to those rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see situations such as we are seeing now in the farming 
communities, or when we see situations such as we will see at the 
end of this month with the softwood lumber issue, we get 
frustrated.  We as elected officials feel that we have an 
obligation to do what is right and not just to correct what is 
wrong.  This is exactly what the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and what the Minister for International Trade have been 
doing consistently over the past few months to address the whole 
issue of inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is enough?  The minister just announced a support package 
for farming communities to balance the imbalance that exists. 
What is enough?   Frankly I would say that $500 million may not 
solve the problems of the farming communities for good.  Even $1 
billion will probably not be enough to solve the problems of the 
farming community for good.  What will solve those problems is 
the removal of unfair subsidies from anywhere in the globe where 
farming products and farming services are provided.  That is the 
only way for us to ensure fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of that we have to be exceptionally careful not 
to create the impression that we have a well with an endless 
amount of resources into which we dip every time there is a 
problem and wait for the problem to go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be consistently persistent in trying to speak out on 
behalf of farming communities, as the minister and the government 
have done.  We have to consistently seek justice when it comes to 
the World Trade Organization and NAFTA to ensure a level playing 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we have to eliminate subsidies all at once 
and for good.  However there are others who have already embarked 
on eliminating subsidies altogether.  That has happened in New 
Zealand.  Others may also follow suit and eliminate subsidies 
altogether so the market can decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were asked as an elected official from an urban riding 
whether or not I am calling for the removal of subsidies, I would 
say no.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That cannot be done unilaterally and cannot be done by one 
country in the absence of action by others.  We must do it 
collectively.  As nations we must collectively set the rules of 
law and ensure those rules are respected by member countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fairly hurtful when we see situations like the one the 
farming community is faced with now.  To a large extent it is 
being discriminated against.  I commend the minister of 
agriculture who is very knowledgeable about the file.  I also 
commend the Prime Minister and the Minister for International 
Trade for speaking out on behalf of farmers.  That is responsible 
action on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the official opposition says if we throw another $400 
million at the problem it will go away, I challenge it to tell me 
the exact amount the government must put on the table to make the 
problem go away.  No sum of money will make the problem go away 
as long as other nations outbid us and subsidize more than us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day what is required is corrective action like 
the government has done:  work with farm communities and leaders 
and speak out on the international scene.  We must bring sanity 
to the system so that farmers around the world will play by the 
same rules.  When they play by the rules, they know that all 
other farmers in every other country are also playing by the same 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an unjust situation that is made worse by the fact that 
some member countries of the World Trade Organization are not 
playing by the rules.  That is the issue before us.  Rather than 
telling the government it is onside in the fight to ensure equity 
and a rule of law that is fair across the board, the official 
opposition says that if we throw more money at the problem it 
will go away.  That will not work in the long run.  It might be a 
bit of a band-aid solution in the short term, but ultimately it 
is not the answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I think the hon. member has put his finger on it. What 
will solve the problem?  Successive governments in the past have 
failed to respond with a long term solution to agricultural 
problems.  The problem before farmers right now is very clearly 
that their production costs exceed the compensation they get for 
the sale of their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may say it is not the government's responsibility, but it 
is the Liberal government, with its majority, that has mandated 
that western Canadian farmers must sell their grain to the wheat 
board.  In essence we are back to the Trudeau salute. Trudeau 
asked western farmers why he should sell their grain for them. It 
is because the government passed a law that said it would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply comment on the member's speech.  We are looking for 
emergency aid.  It is needed.  It is absolutely necessary for 
farmers this instant so that they can stay out of bankruptcy and 
not lose their businesses, their farms and their homes.  That is 
the immediate measure.  How we wish the previous Conservative 
government had signed agreements with the Americans and other 
trading partners in the world that they were willing to live by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member comment on the fact that he is part of a 
government that has failed in the very area he is talking about: 
the lack of a long term policy to meet the needs of Canadians for 
a secure food supply through our agriculture industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Madam Speaker, we do have a long term 
policy.  Negotiations have been going on for years. 
We had the GATT, under which the rules of law were set up for 
member countries.  That was followed by the World Trade 
Organization, the free trade agreement and then by NAFTA.  These 
organizations represent hundreds of countries around the world. 
The rules of law are there for everyone to follow.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying on this side of the House is that at the end 
of the day the long term solution my colleague has called for is 
for everyone to respect the law of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation now where some member countries are not 
respecting the law of the land.  The policy of the government is 
to ensure that member countries respect the rules of law and do 
not create unfair subsidies that put our farmers at a 
disadvantage.  We must fight and continue to fight on their 
behalf and we must provide them with the support they need, which 
is exactly what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at the end of the day, and I repeat this one more time, 
there is no amount of money that will solve the problem.  The 
only way to solve the problem is for everyone to play by the same 
rules.  As long as people from other corners, doors or windows do 
not play by the rules, the situation of inequity will repeat 
itself.  We will see our farmers in front of the House of Commons 
and elsewhere protesting and asking for assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention another point to my colleague.  In any operation 
or business, every time there is a crisis, whether it is 
financial or otherwise, inefficient operations will fall victim 
to it.  What we must do is ensure we have a support mechanism to 
assist those who are in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the government has done on a number of 
occasions.  I will not repeat this for the record, but speakers 
before me have, and speakers after me will, put on the record 
specific programs the government has put in place to support 
farming communities.  Through such programs we will continue to 
work with farmers to ensure they can support themselves and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However for my colleague to say that we do not have a long term 
policy is grossly unfair because we do in fact have long term 
policies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is my honour to rise today to discuss the very 
serious issue of the agricultural crisis.  Let me begin by 
commending the opposition for bringing it to the attention of the 
House and for using one of its opposition days to discuss the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, my riding in southwestern Ontario is one 
of the richest farm areas in the country.  The counties of Elgin 
and Middlesex have a vast array of agricultural producers, 
whether in wheat, corn, soybeans, livestock or supply management. 
The health of the agricultural industry and its livelihood is a 
very critical issue to my riding, to my community and, as such, 
to me as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important when we define the problem, and it is a very 
real and serious problem, that we acknowledge that not all of 
agriculture is suffering.  Certainly areas involved with supply 
management, whether dairy production, the feather industry or the 
production of eggs, continue to do reasonably well.  That is 
because they are protected from the games foreign countries play 
in terms of increasing subsidies at a rapid rate.  They know when 
they go to the marketplace that they will get a reasonable return 
for their production and one that will cover their production 
costs and allow them to feed their families and make a good 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of the farm sector that is doing well right now 
is the whole area of cattle.  Hog production is also doing well 
because the prices those producers are enjoying are reasonably 
high. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1340

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, not all parts of the farm economy are in a crisis.  It is 
a particular part of the farm economy.  If we look at the numbers 
in Ontario we see that farm incomes went up last year, which is 
not what one would expect given world prices for grains and 
oilseeds and the awful weather we had in terms of a very wet 
spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn my comments to the issue at hand, which is the farm 
income crisis in the grains and oilseeds business.  I will 
provide some statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario average for the price of grain corn has dropped from 
$4.65 a bushel in 1995-96 to $2.85 a bushel.  That is a huge drop 
in a very short period of time and farmers cannot make money at 
that price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario average for the cash price of soybeans has dropped 
from $9.66 in 1995-96 to $6.90, which is more than a 30% drop in 
the space of about four to five years.  At the same time, the 
cost of production has risen through the roof.  Farmers are 
facing the lowest prices for their product, in nominal terms, for 
the last 27 years while incurring an increase in the cost of 
fertilizer.  Fertilizer costs have gone up primarily due to the 
cost of oil that goes into making it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Costs have increased for things like drying expenses.  When 
harvest corn is taken from the field and shipped to market, it 
must be dried to prevent it from moulding on the way to market. 
Because of the high input costs involved in that and the low 
revenue, the farmers are suffering and going broke.  They incur 
high costs for the rental of land and a variety of other costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average cost of production for corn is estimated in Ontario 
at $3.50 per bushel.   If one compares that with the number I 
gave previously, we see that the price farmers get for corn is 
$2.85 per bushel.  The breakeven for soybeans is estimated to be 
$8 per bushel compared to the $6.90 per bushel.  These numbers, 
as well as any, highlight the difficult times farmers are having. 
The worst part is the source of the problem:  The Americans have 
increased subsidies to farmers fourfold over the last few years. 
They are paying their farmers to produce at a level that distorts 
the marketplace both in Canada and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have a policy of not giving up market share around 
the world, and they have gotten into the business of paying their 
farmers to produce without getting a normal price from the 
marketplace.  For example, when Ontario corn farmers go to the 
marketplace they sell corn at a certain price.  When American 
farmers go to the same marketplace they get a certain price plus 
a very high subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The market is not signalling to U.S. farmers or to European 
farmers that they should cut back production because the market 
is being distorted by high subsidies.  Ontario farmers are 
extremely frustrated by this and by the fact that they have no 
hope or optimism that it will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people have talked about signing new trade 
agreements that would bring in new rules so that subsidies would 
go down.  Even if we did that, farmers in Europe or the U.S. 
would go through a period of adjustment, some say from five to 
ten years, but the Ontario corn and soybean farmers would get no 
immediate relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That highlights the level of frustration and how difficult the 
situation is.  It indicates that the federal and provincial 
governments need to be cognizant that the situation has changed 
dramatically since 1993-94 when the Liberals first came into 
office.  Our support for agriculture at the time, in terms of 
safety nets, was roughly $600 million.  We did not hear squawking 
or complaints that it was too little money because the price 
farmers got from the marketplace compensated for the fact that 
they did not get subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They now find that when they go to the marketplace they cannot 
get a fair price so they are looking to the federal and 
provincial governments for help, as is their right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to say that the federal government has responded. It 
may not have responded as aggressively or as generously as some 
farmers and farm organizations would have liked, but it moved the 
$600 million in safety net programs from the 1994-95 budget year 
and increased it by $500 million to what was then called AIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>AIDA was designed to deal with sudden and quick dramatic drops 
in price.  It played an important role two or three years ago in 
maintaining a hog industry in my riding when the price of hogs 
fell through the floor and a number of livestock farmers were 
facing very difficult times.  They made good use of AIDA, and I 
was pleased to see a government safety net program come into 
play.   It was virtually put in as a permanent program.  It is 
now a multi-year commitment that farmers can rely on for the next 
few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister just announced an increase of $500 million. One of 
the two debates surrounding that $500 million is whether it 
should be higher.  As someone who represents a farm riding, I 
would have liked to have seen it higher, but I understand the 
government has a lot of competing calls on resources and it came 
up with $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we go back to 1994-95, when we went from $600 
million of total safety net programs, we added roughly $500 
million to AIDA.  We also increased our $600 million bottom line 
safety net programs by another $85 million.  We have now 
increased it by another $500 million.  In my view, that is not 
bad.  We have almost tripled the support for agriculture and the 
safety net since I have been in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than the amount of money that we should be putting into 
agriculture, we also need to call on the government to make a 
multi-year commitment.  The $500 million we have is a one year 
commitment.  I will have an opportunity in a take note budget 
debate to talk about this, but if the Minister of Finance is 
taking note tonight I would tell him privately or publicly that 
we need to be more generous in our multi-year commitment to 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the difficulties in making a decision now.  We do 
not know where the economy is going.  We do not know what 
resources the government will have in six, eight or nine months 
from now.  However, I call on the government to be as generous as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I commend the opposition for what it has brought 
forward today, I should point out that it did not mention a word 
about increasing support to farmers during the campaign.  The 
only party that had a coherent platform in terms of increasing 
cash support for farmers during the campaign was the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  Its leader came down to my area in Woodstock 
and spoke about how we need to do more to support our farmers and 
he talked about increasing the budget.  I never heard— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The hon. member for 
Lethbridge has the floor to ask a question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam

and who asked for what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day there was a comment from across the floor that I 
did not ask an agriculture question until the fifth spot.  What 
is that all about?  The fact is that our agricultural community 
is in trouble and needs some help.  Let us get past all the 
rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just received a letter today from a couple who live on 
Heritage Road in Georgetown, Ontario.  They have asked me if I 
would ask the Liberal government some questions.  The letter 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing so, please be sure to ask the government, who is having 
difficulty finding the moneys desperately needed to sustain our 
food system and ensure food sovereignty the following question: 
Why did they spend valuable consumer tax dollars on an 
anti-farmer campaign that ran in Canadian newspapers on March 
15th? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to explain how much money the government proposed to 
have spent.  It ran in all the big city newspapers, although I am 
not sure what that was all about.  The couple wants to know why the 
government did that?  They also want to know how much that cost 
and why the money was spent on something like that instead of 
going directly to farm families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member should 
know that I have no idea how much the advertising campaign cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As question period will start in about 25 minutes, that question

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the comment about it being an anti-farmer campaign, the 
opposition likes to make the point that Canadians have a right to 
know how their tax dollars are being spent.  It is absolutely 
ridiculous to suggest that because the government is explaining 
how we spend roughly $1.7 billion in terms of annual farm support 
programs to Canadians that it is somehow anti-farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are telling Canadians how we spend the money.  Is it not 
implicit in that argument that we need to spend the money and 
that our farm sector is important? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will preface my question with a statement. There 
was once an American president who defined liberal economic 
policy.  The policy was very clear and concise.  It stated “If 
it's alive and it's moving, tax it.  That will slow it down.  If 
it doesn't slow it down enough, regulate it.  And when the thing 
is almost dead, subsidize it.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have an industry in Canada that is in the third 
stage through that type of policy.  When the government starts 
subsidizing using the Liberal way, it does not want to make the 
subsidies too big because it might get healthy again.  Keep it 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some mention made in the throne speech about helping 
agriculture move to become a value added industry.  We have a 
good example of what the president of the United States was 
talking about with liberal economic policy in Saskatchewan.  The 
Americans blocked or restricted Canadian durum, the best durum in 
the world, from the U.S. market.  For people who do not know what 
durum is used for, it is used to make spaghetti, pasta and those 
types of products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A group of farmers trying to help themselves, tried to form an 
organization that would grow its own durum, build its own pasta 
plant, crank out its own pasta and export it directly into the 
U.S. market so it could get away from government regulations and 
subsidies.  These farmers wanted to empower themselves to help 
themselves.  Unfortunately, Canadian Wheat Board regulations 
prevented those farmers from going ahead with that very 
worthwhile venture.

understanding of the pasta plant in southern Saskatchewan, but 
off the top, if in fact the wheat board prevented that plant from 
developing, that was a mistake in policy.  We need more pasta 
plants and food processing plants and any regulation that gets 
in the way of that should be abolished.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we are here today to speak in support of the opposition 
motion to get an additional $400 million into the pockets of our 
farmers this spring before seedings starts.  We want to do it in 
a way that is quick and efficient, not like some of the programs 
that have been developed in the past by this government.  We need 
to do something that responds quickly to the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just spoke to a gentleman a couple of minutes ago to ask if it 
would be all right to read a letter that I received last week 
when I was at home.  It is from a company with which I did 
business while running my farm operation.  Last year this 
organization won one of the awards given out by the Lethbridge 
chamber of commerce for businesses that excel in what they do and 
how they promote their business.  I read the letter even though 
it is a form letter.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin this letter by saying thank you for giving us an 
opportunity to serve you and allowing us to work with you.  We 
have dealt with some of you since 1977 and through that time we 
have come to know you very well and it has been a very rewarding 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son, Tim, made an interesting comment a few years back after 
he returned to work with us following his legal training in B.C. 
We were sitting talking about our business and he remarked that 
one of the things that he liked about agriculture was the kind of 
people with whom he dealt.  I agreed with his feelings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had an opportunity to work with some very fine people. 
We have found that the small size of our company was continually 
a limitation on what we hoped to achieve.  In recent years it has 
been very difficult to run a profitable business.  I know you 
face that same struggle.  Getting financing continued to grow to 
be a larger and larger challenge.  The competitive environment 
also became tougher as the grain companies battled for a market 
share and used ag inputs as part of their marketing levers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drought last year was the final straw.  It was financially 
very damaging and even though we improved in every aspect of our 
business we cannot overcome the impact of the drought and the 
resultant drop in sales.  The prospect of another such year was a 
factor that convinced us.  We no longer were strong enough to 
survive in this market so on January 6 of this year we began the 
plan to shut down the fertilizer, pesticide and seed sector of 
our business, and the related services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was with considerable sadness that we realized that the close 
working relationship we had with you would not continue in the 
same manner.  It was also very painful to have to lay off our 
crew, 12 full time people and 20 part time people after working 
with them and watching their skills develop.  Some of them had 
also been with us for a very long time and we had been watching 
with much interest hoping that some good opportunities would come 
to them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a small business in southern Alberta that has gone out 
of business because of the farm crisis.  This goes further than 
farmgate.  We are not only talking about primary producers, we 
are also talking about the entire industry of agriculture when we 
talk about the seriousness of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dramatic increase in input costs is one of the things that 
caught farmers in a real vice in the last few years.  Commodity 
prices, as we know, are low in the grains and oilseeds sector, 
and to compound that with the increase in inputs, plus, in our 
area, a very severe drought that has not relinquished yet, could 
really send us into a crisis situation this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a combination of all those things, as this gentleman has 
indicated, it has put a well run family business that had been 
in place since 1977 out of business.  They were award recipients 
for the way they ran their business.  They had to lay off 32 
people. That is just a part of what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the misplaced and misguided policies of the government, it 
went ahead of the rest of the world and took away the subsidies 
or any support that our farmers had.  It did that before anybody 
else did, before any other countries with which we deal.  We have 
now placed our people at a competitive disadvantage.  It is not 
because of the marketplace or low commodity prices, which are all 
part of this, it is because of misplaced government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government policy has more to do with the price of goods 
than the marketplace does.  We have done that through very 
ill-advised policies, whether it is trade, foreign or domestic 
policies, that affect our farmers.  We now have a situation that 
some feel is irreversible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do something in the interim while we decide what we 
will do in the long term for our agricultural community.  We have 
to do some things in the short term and that is what we are 
talking about today.  Let us get this out.  Let us put some of 
the crisis decisions that are being made on farming on hold until 
we can have a long term plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Canadian

address the anguish of Canadian farmers by tossing out some old 
money and claiming it was new.  The fact that the amount was 
still too little does not seem to bother the government.  In fact 
it diverted untold thousands of dollars to big city newspapers to 
brag to urban Canadians about their phony compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture minister claimed he was merely trying to inform 
all Canadians about the great job he was doing.  However, the ads 
failed to mention that farm programs were slashed over the last 
year while our trading partners continued to prop up their 
industries.  The ads did not mention that almost half the money 
promised back in 1998 was never delivered, while the part that 
was delivered is now being clawed back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government advertising is not the real issue.  Did it ever occur 
to the government that thousands of Canadian travellers should be 
informed that the hoof and mouth virus rampaging through European 
herds can be carried on shoes, clothing or on fresh foods?  Did 
it ever occur to the government to stop patting itself on the 
back and to put resources in the hands of farmers and inspectors 
who will save Canadian agriculture, despite the Liberal 
government?

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inflation has been creeping up and is now pushing on the upper

<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

of Canada is independent.  Monetary policy will be decided by the 
Bank of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of stimulus in the Canadian economy, again as the hon.

a result of its fiscal actions and its spending actions provided 
the Canadian economy with a larger amount of stimulus than any of 
the major industrial countries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

frantically and stubbornly to his policy of maintaining a weak 
Canadian dollar, the savings of Canadians continue to erode.  Mr.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue to have our heads in the sand about this, we are 
going to wake up one day and we are going to see a 60 cent

are now, when they are talking of deflation in Japan, when there 
is a banking crisis in Japan, and when there is a major slowdown 
in the world's largest economy, the United States, it is 
incumbent upon all political and economic leaders to show a sense 
of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to do that.  As we 
discussed yesterday here in this room, he knows full well that 
the government does not have a weak dollar policy.  It makes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

words.  There was a question to the Prime Minister when he was in 
opposition about the fact that the dollar was too strong and he 
did not like that.  He said again that he wanted the dollar to 
flow downward.  He then said 12 years later that it was time to 
accept a weaker dollar. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 15 years, the Prime Minister has been an avowed

Mr. Speaker, when the Liberal loonie tanked four years ago, the

at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are facing new record high commodity prices, so I am 
wondering what is the finance minister's excuse.  Could it 
possibly have something to do with the fact that his boss, the

years? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the policies of the government are the result of the economic 
consequences of the actions taken by this government under this 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just simply say that our mortgage rates, as an example, 
will now save the average Canadian over $750 a year.  That cut 
has occurred since January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go on.  Our building permits have surged to a record

income taxes in the G-7, the highest corporate income taxes in 
the OECD and the second highest debt in the developed world, has 
led to a 64 cent dollar which may be going to 60 cents, and he 
said it is irresponsible.  What is irresponsible is an economic 
policy which is impoverishing Canadians and diminishing our 
standard of living.

question is for the Prime Minister.  Today we learned that

preferential access to world leaders at the Quebec summit of the

For a mere half a million dollars corporations can pole vault 
right over the three metre high chain link fence.

invited corporations in Canada to help the government offer the 
best reception possible.  Everyone does it on a voluntary basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these people have interests in Latin America.  As they 
are all coming to town they want to show that they are good

will be present with hundreds and hundreds of other people at 
receptions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first 
we hear that it is about extending hospitality, then about saving 
money.  What on earth is next?  Will the Prime Minister pull the 
maple leaf down from the peace tower and replace it with a 
McDonald's flag? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has nothing to do with saving money.  It has everything to 
do with giving corporations preferential access.  Half a million

Mr. Speaker, I never said that the Government of Canada will bow

will most certainly meet with industry leaders if they request 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I had the opportunity to meet with British Columbia 
producers.  The industry in British Columbia did not ask me 
to impose an export tax.  They were far more prudent 
than that.  They asked whether the suggestion made in this

They did not, however, make the suggestion attributed to them by

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective is clear and firm and we are going to act 
responsibly in order to ensure that all of the very important 
interests in the softwood lumber matter throughout the country 
are respected by this House and by our government, which will

American producers above all, who are only concerned with 
protectionism in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's Regina <I>Leader Post</I> the Saskatchewan minister of 
agriculture stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $500 million in aid announced recently by the federal 
government to address the current problems in the industry is 
clearly an inadequate response given the emergency situation 
facing the industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister listen to his provincial counterparts and 
commit the additional $400 million being called for today? 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. member, in reference to 
the province of Saskatchewan, that the federal contribution to 
NISA crop insurance and companion programs is $175 million this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian farm income protection program is estimated by its 
officials and ours to be $200 million this year.  When it puts 
its 40% with the announcement that the government made two weeks 
ago, it will be another $200 million.  That is close to $600 
million for Saskatchewan alone this year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the agriculture minister is more 
concerned about fighting with provincial governments to force his 
own programs upon everybody rather than allowing some provincial 
discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister trying to tell the House that the governments of 
Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are wrong in 
saying that at least $900 million is needed from the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the current agriculture minister could unite two 
Conservative governments and two NDP governments with the 
separatist government of Quebec.  Why does the minister continue 
to ignore the advice of governments and—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting and quite sad 
that the province of Saskatchewan, for example, did not offer to 
put in any more money until the federal government was there.  It 
did not offer any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the combination of all of us it is over $600 million.  In 
the spirit of negotiating and discussion I remind the hon. member 
that those five minister walked out of a meeting rather than stay 
and discuss it.  I stayed there.  I had a press conference.  They 
walked out of the meeting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister for International Trade.  U.S. political 
leaders in industry say that our forest management system 
subsidizes our industry and hurts the environment.  Is this an 
accurate assessment?  Is it true that the U.S. system offers 
stronger environmental protection? 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our forest practices absolutely do not 
unfairly subsidize our industry.  We are actually much better 
than the United States in protecting our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada protects its forests from depletion.  For every tree that 
is harvested, two new ones are planted.  We only harvest one-half 
of one per cent of our commercial forests each year.  Ninety-four 
per cent of Canada's forests are publicly owned and strictly 
regulated.  By comparison, 90% of U.S. timber comes from private 
lands.  It has virtually no regulations on forest management.

Minister does not particularly care if farmers can even plant 
their crops this spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government spends money advertising government rhetoric 
rather than giving emergency money directly to farmers who need 
assistance.  Why will the government not make agriculture a 
priority and deliver the additional $400 million needed by 
farmers?

do.  It must have been shock treatment.  The Alliance Party 
finally got interested in agriculture.  It is nice that it was 
interested this winter.  It was the first one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding to what I commented on a few minutes ago, the government 
increased interest free loans for farmers this year two and a 
half times what they were last year, up to $50,000 per farmer. We 
estimate that farmers will borrow interest free over $700 million 
to help put their crops in the ground this year.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>OFFICIAL REPORT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order to complain about a situation and to clarify 
another, as I indicated earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I put a question to the Prime Minister in the House 
which included conditions, in my opinion, in my text and in the 
way I asked it and which hinted conditionally at an infringement 
of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On reading <I>Hansard</I>, I realized that the last part of the 
sentence did not reflect my thinking. It was not what I had 
intended to say, and I wanted the sentence to be in the 
conditional, since I was questioning the Deputy Prime Minister 
on a hypothesis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I asked the people at <I>Hansard</I>, as is a regular 
practice, to correct a part of the sentence I did not consider 
represented reality, which was not at all the intent of my 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was given no explanation.  This morning I realized they had 
rejected my correction, and yet, I regularly saw as House 
leader that substantial corrections had been made to the 
answers given by the Prime Minister or the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, for example, to such a point that it was 
even impossible to raise a question from the blues since 
<I>Hansard</I> was so different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time it was explained that the changes in <I>Hansard</I> were 
made more to have the record reflect what the person speaking 
wished to say, what had actually been perceived here in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say simply that I find it unfortunate I was denied the 
opportunity to correct <I>Hansard</I>.  In this regard, obviously, I 
have no problem, as you discussed with me, with removing the 
last part of the sentence of my question since it did not 
really reflect what I had intended to say, which I had asked, 
before you spoke to me to have corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore fitting, both for the Prime Minister and for 
myself, that this sentence be withdrawn from <I>Hansard</I>. 
Since you allowed the question yesterday in the belief that it 
was in the conditional, I too thought I had put it in the 
conditional, but I realized that it had been put in an 
affirmative style. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context I think you will be satisfied at my requesting 
the end of the sentence be removed so that my question concludes 
with “acted in his own interest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the rest is in the context in which I wanted to 
ask my question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair greatly appreciates the retraction 
requested by the hon. member for Roberval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that I referred to yesterday's <I>Hansard</I> to check 
what had been said and was somewhat shocked at what I read.  I 
indicated to the hon. member that it was important in my 
opinion both for the House and for the Chair for there to be a 
retraction.  I greatly appreciate the hon. member's co-operation 
in this matter.

<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I should like to finish this portion of my speech.  I 
was talking earlier about the far-reaching effects of the farm 
income crisis.  We are talking not only about the people who are 
on the land, the primary producers.  We are talking about the 
communities and the businesses that support the industry and how 
it reaches into all aspects of our society and all aspects of our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to mention a couple of points besides the 
immediate influx of cash into the farming community we are 
talking about today in addition to what the government has 
already done.  This is much needed money which we think should be 
going out immediately before spring seeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could do other things in the long term to improve 
the plight of our agriculture community.  Certainly in western 
Canada one of the things that needs to be done is to maximize 
marketing opportunities.  We need the ability to market our 
product the best way we see fit and to get rid of the monopoly 
the Canadian Wheat Board has on certain aspects of our marketing 
abilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that is peculiar to western Canada. Producers 
in other parts of Canada have the ability to choose who they wish 
to deal with in selling their grain.  Western Canadians do not. 
Our party has advocated forever that marketing choice should be 
part of the mix when it comes to curing the ills of the 
agriculture community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also worked an awful lot on the reform of the Grain 
Transportation Act, the changes to that act when they were before 
the House last spring.  The government had an opportunity at that 
time to make some meaningful changes and put some market forces 
back into the costs farmers have to pay to get their product to 
the coast to be shipped to other countries.  It fell very short 
of what was needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from personal experience that when grain is taken to the 
elevator the amount of money taken off the top of the farmer's 
cheque for transportation and grain handling is huge.  We could 
do something about that tomorrow.  We could do something about 
the wheat board.  We could do something about the transportation 
system.  The government chooses not to work on those angles as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about increased input costs.  Input costs in the last 
few years have gone right through the roof.  Energy costs have 
skyrocketed.  However there is one area the government could act 
on tomorrow which would leave $100 million in the pockets of 
producers in Canada:  the elimination of the excise tax on farm 
fuel.  This tax collects $100 million that the government could 
very well leave in the pockets of producers.  All these things 
could be done to add up to a whole that would be better for the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done some extensive travelling across the country.  I 
remind members opposite who keep insinuating our party has done 
nothing as far as agriculture is concerned that it was our party 
which twice asked the agriculture committee to travel into 
Ontario, the rest of Canada and the maritimes to discuss the 
crisis in agriculture, and twice we were refused.  After the 
feeble attempt the government made to have the committee travel 
in western Canada, we took it upon ourselves to travel 
extensively across Canada to discuss face to face with primary 
producers the situations they were facing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things they told us was not to leave them hanging. 
They said that if it was the policy of the government to destroy 
the family farm, then let them know.  If they knew there was no 
further support for them, they would not use up all the savings 
and equity that they have in their land and machinery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking the government to be up front with them.  They 
are asking the government to be forthwith.  Hopefully the 
government will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we want to reiterate that on a short term must have 
basis, we implore the government to top up that support to the 
farmers by $400 million.  That is what we are asking for today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
ironic that through the motion today, not only the speaker who 
just spoke but all the speakers in the Alliance are now 
supporting a subsidy.  However, they ran a campaign against 
subsidies of various types. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is involved in subsidies in all sorts of areas.  Other 
countries are involved in subsidies, and we have to match them. 
Many of the subsidies the opposition spoke against are there 
because other countries have them.  Yet they are inconsistent in 
this one situation.  I made this point before in the House. The 
reason I did was because it hurts my riding.  It needs these 
subsidies for other things than just agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a town called Faro which has the largest open pit lead 
zinc mine in the world.  The people of Faro want to be heard in 
the House because they have nowhere else to go now.  Their only 
industry has collapsed, the ore has run out and they do not want 
to leave their homes.  They believe in their land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to compliment the people of Faro.  They are very 
ingenious.  They are trying to come up with all sorts of things 
to improve their economy.  The chamber of commerce of Faro, the 
town council, citizen groups are trying to think of things. 
Through think tanks, they are also trying to come up with ideas 
on improving the economy.  Without some sort of start up O and 
M money or capital, they will not be able to get back on their 
feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to help people we have to have a philosophy that 
helps people in all parts of this country equally, so that we can 
all get back on our feet, including the citizens of the town of 
Faro. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I imagine one of the 
reasons the member opposite was elected and sent to the House by 
the people he represents was to work hard for them.  I applaud 
him for fighting to keep the industry in his town open. That is 
why I was sent here.  I will stand in the House every day if need 
be to fight for my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He inferred that we did not campaign for farmers during the 
election.  I will read what it says in our Alliance policy.  This 
is misquoted time and again by the agriculture minister and it is 
very unfortunate that he does that.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure a self-reliant and economically viable agriculture 
sector, we will vigorously seek free entry of Canadian products 
into foreign markets.  We support and will advocate the phased 
reduction and elimination of all subsidies, support programs and 
trade restrictions in conjunction with other countries. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the government has gone wrong.  It has gone out 
ahead of other countries and reduced the subsidies for our 
producers while other countries receive subsidies.  This has put 
our producers in a very bad situation.  They will not agree with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A component of what the agriculture community needs on a long 
term basis is a disaster program that responds to the need and 
gets the money out quickly.  We need a long term income 
stabilization program to put some stability back into the 
program.  We need opportunities to market our product the way we 
see fit.  We need a government with some guts to go to the United 
States and the European Union and fight down the subsidies that 
are killing our producers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague has in a very effective way presented the 
parts of the puzzle to solving this agriculture problem by 
reducing high taxes, unfair user fees, changing regulations that 
will make the grain transportation system less expensive and 
getting our product to market more reliably which will increase 
price.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also talked about the problem with subsidies.  He mentioned 
subsidies in a broad scope, but the subsidies that drive Canadian 
farmer prices down most are export subsidies.  That is money 
spent to put a product into the market at a reduced rate.  That 
is what hurts farmers more than anything.  We are talking about 
compensation for that harm.  Could the member comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the thing we are 
advocating.  We have to come to the plate to support our 
producers when their lives are being ruined by forces beyond 
their control.  The export policies of the United States and the 
European Union are distorting the marketplace.  The price our 
producers are receiving for their commodities is no longer market 
driven, it is driven by poor government policy.  Because of the 
situation that exists, we have to do something in the short term 
to keep our farm families alive.

Speaker, I rise today to speak in favour of the motion put 
forward by my colleague, the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake. 
I will read it for the benefit of members who have missed some of 
the earlier part of the debate.  It states:

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a little bit added on the end about not being a 
confidence motion to avoid giving the government an excuse to 
require their MPs to vote against this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by paying tribute to my colleague's 
dedication to the cause of Canadian farmers, which is admirable. 
He is my seat mate of course, so I get to see his passion and 
enthusiasm up close.  It has been an education to me, to see the 
way in which a member can take on and responsibly advocate the 
interests of a community within Canada.  He deserves to be 
applauded for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost single-handedly 
my colleague, the hon. member for 
Selkirk—Interlake, has pushed the crisis in Canadian agriculture 
to the top of the policy agenda.  The very first question that 
was raised in the House following the Speech from the Throne was 
raised by my colleague and related to agriculture.  In fact, he 
set a bit of a precedent in asking a question in that manner at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is assured, along with a few others from this caucus, that 
the Canadian Alliance will lead the charge on this issue, keeping 
our traditional place as the most vigorous defenders and indeed 
as the only serious defenders of the legitimate interests of 
Canadian farmers in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all too easy to forget, because of the way this has been 
brought to the fore of the agenda, just how far agriculture had 
been pushed from the mainstream agenda over the past year.  It 
was almost completely absent from the 2000 election campaign, so 
much so that when a debate on the subject was finally held in my 
riding, five days before the election, I felt compelled to begin 
my remarks by saying “Tonight's debate is about agriculture, the 
most important issue not being discussed in this federal 
election”.  Well that has changed, thank goodness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is partly due to the work of my distinguished colleague and 
is partly due to the remarkable efforts of farmers from across 
the country who have met and who have demonstrated in cities to 
draw attention to their situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Wednesday an enormous farm rally was held here in Ottawa. I 
was honoured to attend it.  This was the lead item on that 
night's news.  The surest sign that Canadians are finally turning 
their attention to the farm crisis is this.  After having utterly 
ignored the agriculture issue in the election campaign and in the 
first three and a half months of this parliament, even the leader 
of the Progressive Conservative Party was finally willing to ask 
a question in the House of Commons last Wednesday relating to 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Where was Stockwell Day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  A member has just asked where Stockwell 
Day was.  He has asked so many questions, it is hard to keep 
track.  He also addressed that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I know the hon. member

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  I thank you for that, Mr. Speaker.  The 
member obviously needs to get some wax removed from his ears 
because on so many occasions, and it is hard to keep track, our 
leader has in fact addressed this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply continue now to give a little information on the 
background of the agricultural industry.  I think Canadians 
forget sometimes just how important this industry is to the 
country.  Agriculture is one of the pillars of the Canadian 
economy, accounting for just under 9% of our gross domestic 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian farm produces enough food to feed 120 
people.  One result of this remarkable efficiency is that food 
prices have dropped to record lows.  Canadians were able to eat 
better and to do so at a lower cost than at any time in our 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another less fortunate result of this efficiency is that the 
number of farmers, as a percentage of the Canadian population, 
continues to decline.  In fact it is in steady decline.  This 
means that increasingly governments are able to ignore farmers 
and the farm vote and still get elected.  Heaven knows the 
government is proof positive of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of the policy of ignoring the interests of farmers 
can be seen everywhere.  It can be seen most dramatically in the 
number of dollars that the Canadian government has been willing 
to devote to farm support.  To make this point, in 1997 for every 
dollar the Canadian government spent on farm support, Japan spent 
$3.47, the European Union spent $2.14 and the U.S. spent $2.06. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These policies of our competitors have led to a worldwide glut 
of agricultural product and to dramatically declining prices. 
Corn prices have dropped from $3.60 a bushel two years ago to 
around $2.60 at the time of last year's harvest, and soybean 
prices from around $8.60 to about $6.50.  Break-evens on 
soybeans, incidentally, are around $8.00 per bushel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is forcing even more farmers off the land.  According to 
Statistics Canada, agriculture employment in my province of 
Ontario has dropped by 33,000, or 27%, since the Liberals first 
came to power in 1993.  The facts clearly show that farming in 
Canada, and in Ontario in particular, is in crisis.  It is a 
simple statement of fact that Canadian farmers are facing their 
worst income crisis since the great depression.  This is made 
worse by the doubling of fuel costs which have driven up input 
costs for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers need a government that is on their side.  I would like 
to describe two of the key elements that would need to be set in 
place before farmers could really feel that the government 
believes in them and in their industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Canada claims to have a strong system of safety net 
programs, including emergency disaster relief, crop insurance and 
net income stabilization accounts for the immediate delivery of 
emergency compensation.  Farmers need to know that these programs 
will be adequately funded and that the funds put into these 
programs will be genuinely available in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must launch an aggressive campaign through the WTO and 
through NAFTA to ensure that our trading partners reduce their 
subsidies for their farmers so that our farmers can compete on a 
level playing field.  Until that happens, we have to defend fair 
trade, as well as free trade, and that means that we must ensure 
that farmers get timely compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time I have left I want to talk a little about some of 
the red tape that is involved in getting access to some of these 
funds.  A farmer in Mississippi Mills, which is a rural township 
in Lanark county in my riding, described the following mess to 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October the farmer applied for relief under the Ontario 
whole farm relief program.  The terms under which relief money 
was available was sufficiently vague that he had to acquire the 
services of an accountant, which of course was not free.  He used 
these services for a full day.  At the end of the day neither the 
accountant nor my constituent were actually sure whether he 
qualified.  The forms were submitted anyway in October and he 
still does not know whether or not he is getting aid or, indeed, 
the amount that it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am describing a problem in an Ontario government program. 
However, this problem of red tape is hardly unique to provincial 
programs.  In fact it is even worse in federal programs.  I have 
a copy of the application forms for the year 2000 for the 
Canadian farm income program. 
There are eight spreadsheets to fill out.  There are 13 pages of 
explanatory material as to eligibility requirements.  Even the 
instructions on how to fill out the forms take up an additional 
10 pages. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, farmers are required to have further documentation in 
the form of the official Canadian farm income program price list. 
If they dispute the prices on that list, they have to append 
copies of receipts.  Non-participants in the net income 
stabilization account program must append to their applications a 
form called a CFIP supplementary package for non-NISA applicants, 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point to be made here is simply that when these programs are 
produced, if they are made so hard to get at, government can 
forget about promising $500 million.  Why not promise $500 
billion?  The farmers cannot get it.  It does not count.  That is 
the situation farmers are faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money is needed now.  It is needed before seeding.  It is 
needed through a non-bureaucratic mechanism.  The history of the 
programs offered by the government over the past seven years has 
been that they have been exceedingly hard to get. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad I 
will soon have the opportunity to address the debate.  However, I 
know the very excellent and hard working member who just spoke 
would want me to clarify something for the people watching and 
listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something he may have omitted, but the fact is that the 
Ontario whole farm income program is administered by his 
colleagues at Queen's Park, the Harris government.  The money is 
there and the cash is there to be spent between now and the end 
of March.  I would ask my colleague to speak to those colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess I could have made up 
a story, but the farmer told me a story about this particular 
program so I cited it.  My point was to suggest, and I think 
accurately, that the problem with filling out these forms and 
trying to apply for these forms is that they are too 
bureaucratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Provincial forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  That is why I cited the federal forms; 
they went on at great length about them.  I am sorry that my 
colleague was not listening to that and I am sorry he cannot put 
a sock in it and listen now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to mention that when we look at the amount of money 
ostensibly available under AIDA for the years 1998 and 1999 we 
find that fully 38% has not yet been accessed by farmers.  That 
has not yet been handed out to farmers, despite the fact that it 
was meant to be disaster aid.  That forces farmers to pay more 
for their inputs because they are unable to function as properly 
operated businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the farmers in my riding told me he expects his input 
costs this year to be pushed up by about 15% because he cannot 
take advantage of various discounts such as early payment 
discounts, because his aid, federal aid, is not available to him 
in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the federal government is as much at fault 
here as any provincial government.  I would think a great deal 
more. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleagues on 
this side of the House, especially those two who are from 
Ontario, for joining in this agriculture debate today.  Those of 
us from Saskatchewan sometimes feel like we are the only ones, 
but we know we are not.  Statistics Canada actually has said that 
63,000 jobs were lost last year alone because of the agricultural 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan announced recently by the government requires the 
provinces to contribute 40% to the federal programs already in 
existence.  Saskatchewan has already removed all the provincial 
taxes on farm fuels.  I wonder what the government would think if 
it were forced to match that move.  My question to my colleague 
is this:  what does my colleague have to say about the 
requirement of the provinces being forced to put their money into 
the federal programs rather than being able to add it directly to 
their own? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course it is the standard 
procedure of the federal government on all issues to try to put 
moneys forward in the form of matching grants and then take 
credit for the entire amount as if it had in fact spent the 
entire amount.  That would explain the largest proportion of what 
is going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original claim of the government was that it had in fact met 
the farmers' demands for $1 billion, with the government saying 
that after all, it was putting in a good chunk of that and the 
provinces would put in money too but only because the federal 
government was, so therefore the federal government really spent 
the money even though provincial taxpayers paid for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously farmers have not bought that.  That is in fact why 
they were protesting here in Ottawa and elsewhere, including 
Saskatchewan.  Clearly proposals similar to those made by my hon. 
colleague would have been precisely the right direction to go in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I know this is a very important debate in the House.  The 
minister on many occasions has said the Alliance has not raised 
questions about the agriculture issue, but we have, and I think 
it would be incumbent upon the government to have at least one 
minister of the crown here to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The hon. member knows 
very well that he cannot allude to or refer to the absence of 
anyone in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with my hard working rural caucus colleague 
from the great riding of Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I put some of the good programs before the House, I have 
to point out some falsehoods that were put forth by the last few 
members who spoke, especially those from Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very careful and very accurate in my description 
here.  They talked about the money that has not gone to the 
Saskatchewan producers, which we are all working for.  I say to 
my colleague from the Alliance, I would not laugh when we see 
from the statistics that it is very fair to point out that 
Saskatchewan farmers have now received very close to $400 million 
from AIDA.  Yes, more than 80% of that money has been delivered 
directly to those producers.  Yes, the province has helped up to 
this time, but now the province is denying the money to the 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last $500 million, half a billion—yes, it could have been 
more—will be invested.  The cash will get to the producers 
between now and the end of March.  That is how fast we want to 
hand out the money.  I would ask my colleagues, for all the right 
reasons, to lobby their own minister, as we members will, so that 
we can get the money through to our producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, my colleagues across the way were very correct in pointing 
out that we must have the co-operation of the European Union and 
the United States in bringing down the tariffs.  They are right. 
I want to point out that our minister of trade spoke with his 
counterparts in the United States in the last few days.  In fact, 
the minister of agriculture spoke to his counterpart in the 
United States yesterday.  Our minister spoke to his colleague 
yesterday in Washington, and we are working on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to join this debate, but I would ask my 
colleagues on the far side to clarify where they stand on this 
situation.  Perhaps that is why only once have we heard the 
leader of the CA Party on his feet asking questions in the House 
on this very important issue.  The rest of the time the CA leader 
never stood up on this subject.  That leader never stood up to be 
counted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today my colleague from the great riding of Ottawa 
Centre pointed out that several years ago Reform Party policy was 
against all subsidies.  When it comes to present research, the 
same situation exists.  Less than one year ago the policy 
papers—I am sure they come from the leader's office and the 
backroom people, and I am sure my colleagues are ashamed of 
them—pointed out that the party is still against subsidies for 
our producers and our growers.  It is very unfortunate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly agriculture is very important in this country and we 
in the government will continue to be there for our farmers.  It 
is true that agriculture is essentially a rural industry, but 
rural Canada, its people and its communities are more than 
agricultural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has resolutions and plans in place to 
address rural needs.  Whether or not it is the main industry, 
whether it is agriculture or not, the government will be there 
for the people.  In fact, rural and remote communities are a 
vital part of our national fabric and the Government of Canada is 
committed to ensuring that they are able to share in and 
contribute to our prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most rural communities rely on the income and the industry that 
agriculture generates, which is why it is essential that we 
support this sector beyond our farm income programs, and that is 
exactly what we are doing.  We believe that two factors are 
critical to the success of our communities.  First, communities 
must take charge of their own future.  Second, the programs the 
government puts in place must stimulate economic development 
rather than just supplement it.  Also, the programs must be 
initiated by local individuals.  In other words, they have to 
come from the bottom up, from the grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to look at what I believe are the two specific 
roles for government in this process.  The first role is to 
ensure that communities have the tools to pursue their particular 
interests.  The federal government has worked hard over the last 
several years to develop a series of tools that communities can 
access in a way that makes sense for them.  I would like to take 
a minute to review some of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian rural partnership is a four year, $20 million 
initiative that was launched in 1998.  It has proven to be a 
great success.  It includes a pilot project component that has 
helped fund 239 community based projects in the first three 
years.  There is also a rural dialogue, which has given rural and 
remote Canadians a real voice in the decisions that affect their 
communities, and a rural lens, through which all government 
policies, programs and services are examined to make sure they 
respect the needs of rural and remote Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community futures is one of the greatest programs we have had 
for the last decade.  Our government has expanded this program by 
an additional $90 million in the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that the Secretary of State for Rural 
Development accompanied me to my riding this past Friday.  The 
government invested $750,000 in the riding.  The money was 
invested because the decisions on the money lent to small 
business and invested in small business and entrepreneurs will be 
made by the grassroots people, the great people who give their 
time and who are the directors of the CDC in North Hastings and 
Central Hastings.  I would like to extend a thank you to those 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget 2000 we announced $2.65 billion over the next five 
years to rebuild our national infrastructure.  Work will include 
improvements to grain roads in the west as well as federal 
bridges and wharves.  Most of these will be in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer the secretary of state and the hon. minister of 
agriculture announced the Canadian agricultural rural communities 
initiative, CARCI.  Funding of more than $9 million will be 
provided over the next three years to help agricultural rural 
communities adapt to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some of the ways our government and our programs 
help rural communities, including farmers, achieve profitability 
and stability in the long term and prevent sole reliance on farm 
income programs.  By encouraging and investing in local 
development, the risk of becoming one industry towns is 
minimized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second role for government.  Community development 
requires more than the investment of dollars.  It requires an 
investment in people, an investment in community leaders, not 
just the decision makers but all the people who have innovative 
ideas and all the people who make important contributions to 
provide the vision their communities will have in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to foster that culture of creativity in our communities. 
We can have initiatives that sound great on paper, but without 
the individuals who have the skills and the initiative to set the 
economic wheels in motion, we will not succeed in achieving long 
term sustainable development in our communities.

crisis management—leading to more genuine diversification and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if there is a disaster in Canada, the 
Prime Minister usually visits the area.  I personally delivered a 
letter of invitation to the Prime Minister but he has 
consistently refused to meet with farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the Prime Minister could ignore the plight of 
grain farmers, if he could personally witness this disaster.  Why 
does the Prime Minister not come to Saskatchewan and personally 
meet with farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for the invitation.  I am sure he wants to include all 
of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have visited his great riding, which includes Yorkton, in the 
last two years.  I am glad we have an infrastructure program so 
we can do a little better job on the roads north of Indian Head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I know my colleague will agree that I have met with 
many farmers from Saskatchewan in the last few weeks.  Many of my 
colleagues, urban and rural on both sides of the House, have met 
with these farmers.  Our Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
has met with the farmers and spokespeople.  We met with them here 
on the Hill in the last few days.  As I said, our minister spoke 
to our U.S. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer my colleague, I would like to see the Prime Minister 
also visit his riding.  However, let us put forth right now the 
fact that the Prime Minister has met with farmers from 
Saskatchewan more than once in the very last few months.  The 
Prime Minister was very kind to extend an invitation to Nick and 
his combine.  I did not say that the combine was on the grounds 
at 24 Sussex, but I was very glad that the Prime Minister met 
with Nick.

the other issues surrounding agriculture, his stand on issues has 
not been in keeping with the agriculture sector.  I would quickly 
point out that he supports a Canadian Wheat Board monopoly.  Our 
organic farmers have voted overwhelmingly that they want to have 
marketing outside the wheat board, along with many other farmers

believe we still will.  It is a committee that gets along 
probably better than any other committee on the Hill.

and support them.  However they are asking, as they and their 
colleagues have before, that we not support giving money to our 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have it both ways.  I am not asking my colleague to 
stand up and say that we will hand out a few dollars today, but 
we will not be there tomorrow.  We will be there tomorrow for our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, I want to take this opportunity to thank the 
opposition for bringing forward a motion today on agriculture. It 
is a very important issue.  I believe we have a crisis in 
agriculture today.  As rural members in the House, it gives us an 
opportunity to speak on agriculture.  It is very much 
appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time too, I want to thank the Prime Minister, the 
cabinet, my colleagues in our rural caucus and some of our urban 
members, such as the member for Toronto—Danforth and the member 
for Parkdale—High Park, two downtown Toronto members who stood 
up and voiced the concerns that many Canadians have on the crisis 
in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank the Minister of Finance, the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of National Defence who are 
all urban cabinet ministers but who are in the House today 
talking about this issue.  They are concerned about this and have 
been listening to the concerns of all members about the crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today, aside from the politics of the issue, because 
agriculture in Canada is in crisis.  We have heard from many 
different people who have many differing views on what the crisis 
is, how best we can solve it and whether or not money should be 
flowing into the hands of agriculture, farmers and rural 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the bias of coming from a rural area, a small town Ontario 
riding which has very many similarities with the ridings of the 
hon. members across the floor who are from other provinces, I say 
there is a crisis out there and we need to further recognize 
that.  As parliamentarians and as a government, I believe we need 
to move to do more in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition suggests that we need to put more money into it. 
Our rural caucus and our cabinet ministers who supported us came 
up with a good package that addressed many of the immediate 
concerns that farmers have today, particularly those concerns of 
getting crops into the ground this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that, I believe we need to do more and can do more. In 
fact we not only need to look at the immediate crisis, but we 
need to look at the long term solutions.  First and foremost, we 
need to talk to Canadians, inform them and let them know why 
agriculture is so important to this country and why it is in need 
today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is the third largest employer in the country.  It 
accounts for 8.5% of our GDP.  It is important to the future of 
the country that we have a healthy industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we in crisis today?  We are in crisis today for a number 
of different reasons.  As was pointed out, our international 
partners are putting direct subsidies to exports.  Exports are so 
important to the agricultural community today.  We have $22 
billion or $23 billion in exports across the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our farmers try to export into foreign markets that use 
export subsidies, it lowers the price that that farmers gets for 
his commodity.  Hon. members may not be aware that in certain 
areas farmers are not making back their costs of production. They 
are paying more out than they are taking in from their crops.  I 
saw on television last night, I believe it was on CTV, that in 
some cases 75% of farmers' incomes come from the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot continue to survive as a country and we cannot 
continue to thrive as an agricultural community, if that 
continues to be the case.  We need to get our income out of the 
marketplace.  As parliamentarians we need to sit down and try to 
find solutions to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One solution being put forward is to put $100 million of new 
money into it and that somehow will solve the problem.  It will 
not solve the problem that we are facing today.  We need to go 
beyond that and look for broader solutions that involve all 
provinces and involve not only farmers and rural Canadians but 
also those who live in the urban centres who purchase the food 
farmers produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not being done.  There has not been enough dialogue from 
the farm leadership, from the parliamentarians or from farmers 
themselves.  There has not been enough done to bring in more 
Canadians and inform them of the problems that farmers face 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved for a number of years in international 
trade.  What I try to do, and what our Minister for International 
Trade is doing as we speak, is deal with how other countries 
subsidize their farmers and get these export subsidies down.  If 
we can get those export subsidies down, if we can get the trade 
distorting subsidies down, our farmers will be able to compete. 
However that issue will take a while to resolve.  It will not be 
resolved overnight.  International trade negotiations take years. 
In fact I believe the last one took seven years.  This one could 
even take more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we have to make a decision.  Do we want viable farm 
families?  Do we want to support our families in need until we 
can internationally negotiate these subsidies down?  Those are 
the questions we are faced with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should.  I believe there is a public good in having 
Canadian farmers produce the food we eat because we can regulate 
exactly what is in that food.  If we did not have Canadian 
farmers producing the food, then we would not have control over 
what is in it.  We would have some control, but we would have a 
lot more control if we were assured that Canadian farmers were 
producing our food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only can we regulate it but we can guarantee that we will 
have that supply.  If we start losing farmers, which is what is 
happening now, if we do not invest in young people getting into 
farming today, if we do not invest in the research and 
development that is needed not only to produce better crops 
but to produce better crops that will sell, if we do not put our 
emphasis on those areas, then we will not have an industry here. 
We will not have the guarantee that Canadians need:  that the 
industry will grow the food we eat.  In fact, we will just import 
it and the price will be at the whim of what is in the product, 
which other countries will produce and we will not.  We have the 
cheapest food prices in the world.  We have some of the most 
productive farmers in the world.  In order to keep these things, 
we need to continue investing in the industry.

in grains and oilseeds, but in areas such as apples and 
horticulture and particularly in areas that other countries are 
putting a lot of emphasis on in subsidizing their producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will deal with the international problems, but in the 
meantime as parliamentarians and as a country we need to take 
seriously the problems that farmers face today and deal with them 
in a non-partisan way.  I have tried—and I will wait for the 
questions from the opposition—to deal with the issue in a 
non-partisan way because I believe that is how Canadians will 
listen to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Prime Minister, cabinet, my rural colleagues and 
members of the opposition who have raised this very important 
issue.  I believe we can and should do more.  On behalf of my 
constituents, I guarantee that I will stand to speak at every 
occasion on behalf of my constituents and farmers in southwestern 
Ontario. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly in a non-partisan way I 
intend to stand here on behalf of Selkirk—Interlake constituents 
and vote yes to support farmers with an additional $400 million. 
I think that opportunity is open to everyone in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member if he does not believe that in fact there are 
many ways to help farmers through non-direct subsidies.  Would 
the member support a voluntary Canadian Wheat Board?  Would he 
support a lowering of the federal excise tax on diesel fuel to 
zero from four cents, where it is today?  Would he look at 
supporting grain transportation, so that it is not the highly 
regulated system it is today, and putting it on a commercial 
contract based system?  All those things would add up to close to 
$400 million for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the 
hon. member that I have only been here for 13 years or so.  I 
used to chair the agriculture committee and have probably spoken 
on agriculture as much as most people in the House.  Even though 
I come from southwestern Ontario, I have always stood up for 
western grain farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been out there and have talked to farmers in the west.  I 
have looked into the whole issue.  The member talks about the 
wheat board.  I want to assure him that I and members on this 
side will stand up for the wheat board and for those farmers in 
the west, who are the majority, who support farmers having a say 
in the sale of their wheat.  There is no question that if we ever 
got rid of the wheat board, as the hon. member would like, the 
farmers would be at the whim of foreign nations and foreign 
multinational companies.  They would not have a voice in the 
marketing of their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always believed, as I have in terms of marketing boards, 
that the best way we can market our products, the best way 
farmers can have a say in their livelihoods, is to do it through 
a marketing system.  I disagree with the hon. member.  I believe 
that the best way we can support farmers is through marketing 
boards, to make sure they have a say in the way their products 
are marketed and to make sure they have a say in the House.  That 
is why I feel it is important that farmers have an opportunity to 
have debates like this, and I appreciate the fact that the debate 
was brought forward by the opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member who just spoke has no real 
understanding of the Canadian Wheat Board and he has clearly 
demonstrated that by his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he know that if a farmer wants to take his durum wheat, 
process it into pasta and add value to it he has to first of all 
sell it to the wheat board?  He does not own the grain.  He has 
to sell it to the wheat board.  He has to buy it back at a price 
considerably higher because he is charged for transportation to a 
seaport whether he uses that transportation or not.  He has to go 
through all kinds of hoops and hurdles which discourage him and 
cost him a huge amount of money before he can add value to it. Is 
that right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have property rights in Canada and that is one of our 
key problems.  A farmer who challenges this will be found by the 
courts to have no basis for it.  That is absolutely wrong.  There 
is no way the Liberal government should be hamstringing our 
farmers this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member could change this entire debate.  If 50 or 60 Liberal 
MPs with rural components stood up and let their voices be heard, 
they could break the power of the Prime Minister's Office and we 
could get on with some meaningful assistance.  I wonder if the 
member would support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assure the hon. member 
that I will not be drawn into his political debate because I 
believe this should not be politicized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a lot of hon. members say that the Prime Minister's 
Office somehow has a grip on hon. members.  I talked with a lot 
of my Liberal members yesterday and they see through the tricks 
that the Alliance Party is putting on.  They do not buy what it 
is trying to do with this holier than thou sudden coming forward 
to ask for funds.  In fact, now I learn that it is not money 
Alliance members are asking for.  They just want us to somehow 
change the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that members on this side of the 
House will continue to stand up and speak for farmers in this 
country, and in all parts of Canada, not just in the west.  We in 
this party represent all parts of the country and we represent 
the farming community in all parts of Canada.  We will continue 
to stand up and fight on behalf of farmers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is really frustrating to see how 
Liberal MPs are twisting the entire meaning of this debate.  We 
have an opportunity today to tell the agricultural producers of 
the country that we are not only concerned about their plight, 
but we are willing to do something about it.  This motion to 
provide added financial support to our struggling farmers is not 
about politics or party policy.  This motion is about ensuring 
that the primary producers of Canada are given the same 
opportunities as other sectors of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night on our government funded public broadcaster, there 
was a report about the amount of subsidies Canadian farmers 
receive. The CBC reported that in 1999 this country's producers 
received 57% of their income from the government.  They project 
that by the end of this year a farmer will have received 75% of 
his income from the government.  The CBC is crediting these 
numbers to Statistics Canada.  Common sense would tell us that if 
these numbers are true then our farmers are in bigger trouble 
because their incomes are so low.  The reason we are really in a 
crisis today is that the government puts so little into 
agriculture in Canada compared to what other nations do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tone of the report gives a completely false picture and it 
only serves to make the government look good.  The figure the CBC 
is using is not an accurate portrayal of farm subsidies in 
Canada.  The Organization for Economic and Co-operative 
Development, known as the OECD, which is the authority in 
determining agriculture subsidy levels, stated that in 1999 only 
20% of a Canadian farmer's income came from government.  That is 
quite a difference from the 57% reported by the CBC.  Why is 
there that difference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD is actually taking into account the entire farm 
receipts received.  Statistics Canada figures use the net farm 
numbers.  When we use the net farm numbers it appears as though 
our producers are receiving some great subsidies, because a 
farmer's expenses will have been removed from the figure.  If we 
use the net farm numbers, we are in effect counting the 
government subsidy level twice.  If we count the government 
subsidy level once on the gross farm numbers and then when we 
eliminate the farm expenses and compare the subsidy level again, 
we come up with the preposterous figures that were delivered on 
the CBC last night.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inaccurate reports from our publicly funded broadcaster are 
inexcusable and hurt the very people forced to pay for them. This 
irresponsible reporting is one of the main reasons we are here 
today.  This type of misinformation gives the impression to our 
city cousins that farmers are receiving some type of huge payout 
from the government.  However, that is far from the truth. If 
farmers were receiving 75% of their income from the government, 
does anyone think we would even be here today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that after hearing today's debate our national 
broadcaster will correct last night's report and accurately 
reflect the level of farm income support in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our minister of agriculture was on a CBC show this weekend.  He 
made the comment that farmers should be treated like any other 
business.  I could not agree with him more.  Unfortunately, the 
minister and the government do not treat farmers like other 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at how they are not treated fairly.  The most 
obvious difference is the treatment at the international 
bargaining table.  In 1986, Canadian wheat producers received 
about 45% of their income from the government.  Since that time, 
support for our primary wheat producers has been reduced to the 
point where it is only about 11% from government.  This would be 
fine if our competitors would have reduced their subsidy levels, 
but that did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the United States in 1986 had its wheat farmers 
receiving about 49% of their income from government.  In 1999, a 
U.S. wheat producer received 46% of his income from the 
government.  In the last year, that level of support has gone 
higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inequality in subsidization is the reason we are here today. 
Subsidies distort the marketplace and have resulted in 
overproduction of grains, which in turn has forced the price for 
these commodities downward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers in many cases are growing these crops below the cost 
of production.  By doing that, they continue to subsidize 
consumers in our cities and keep food prices low.  People 
shopping in our supermarkets today should understand that one of 
the main reasons a loaf of bread is not $4 is that our farmers 
continue to produce this product cheaply and efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our food prices start to rise substantially, then there is 
going to be a public outcry.  Will the government then realize it 
should have supported our agricultural sector?  Unfortunately, 
then our family farms will be gone and it will be too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of government preparing for problems 
within different sectors, but when it comes to agriculture, the 
planning is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the mid 1990s, when the government was balancing its 
books on the backs of farmers, it removed the Crow rate subsidy. 
At that time Reformers told the government that eliminating this 
program did not remove government from having to support farmers. 
We explained that even though times were good then, commodity 
markets would come down and the government had better be prepared 
to help when it happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we told the Liberals to take 80% of the money in the 
Crow and put it into a trade distortion adjustment program to be 
used when farmers needed it.  Did the government listen?  No.  We 
would not be here today making this motion if it had done what we 
asked.  If the government had listened to our suggestion, by 
1998, when this crisis started to become apparent, there would 
have been over $4 billion to help farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact the government was not willing to plan for the future 
relates to my main theme, in that government does not treat 
agriculture like other sectors of the economy.  The government 
will plan for the future when looking at other sectors and 
industries, but when it comes to agriculture there is no long 
term agriculture policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Bombardier issue.  This is a company that 
made $700 million in profits last year.  It was competing with a 
Brazilian company for a $3 billion contract to build airplanes. 
The Brazilian company was receiving subsidies from its national 
government to give it a competitive advantage.  Canada's response 
to this was an industry minister who said Canada could no longer 
afford to be the Boy Scout of the international trade world. This 
statement was also combined with a $1.5 billion loan guaranteed 
to help Bombardier compete against Brazil for a contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have the government supporting a business that is being 
forced to compete against unfair foreign subsidies.  Does this 
not sound familiar? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last four years we have been explaining to the 
government how our farmers are competing against unfair foreign 
subsidies, yet we do not have an industry minister or an 
agriculture minister who is willing to back up our farmers by 
making the same commitment that was made to Bombardier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am saying agriculture is not being treated like 
other businesses or industries by the government.  There are two 
sets of standards here and it has to stop.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of the government preparing other sectors for 
problems down the road is our Canada infrastructure program.  The 
government has committed $2.65 billion to deal with the need to 
replace aging infrastructure in communities.  This is a prime 
example of how government can provide support to a sector by 
looking ahead, determining a need and addressing that need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the agriculture department is not doing 
the same thing.  It has used ad hoc programs to address the 
current crisis.  The programs are not working and the department 
still has not prepared long term solutions to help support 
agriculture.  This is not treating agriculture like other 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at grain transportation.  It is not treated like 
other industries.  The government promised $178 million in 
savings when it rammed its new transportation bill through the 
House of Commons last spring.  After talking to grassroots 
producers, I can tell members that there have been little or no 
savings in transportation.  Without implementing a commercial and 
competitive grain handling system, the savings will never be 
achieved.  By government overregulating and not ensuring 
competition among the railways and grain companies, farmers 
continue to lose out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MP for Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington said 
farmers should be allowed to be entrepreneurs and I agree, yet 
when I talk to backbench Liberals they have no idea of how the 
wheat board works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one glaring difference between prairie grain producers 
and other businesses:  farmers cannot sell their wheat and barley 
to whomever they want.  Producers are forced to sell their wheat 
and barley to the Canadian Wheat Board.  They cannot process 
their own product and sell it to consumers without going to the 
CWB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other sectors of the economy are not treated like this.  I do 
not know of any other industry that has to sell its product to a 
government controlled bureaucracy and then buy it back at a 
higher price before it can reap additional profits through 
processing.  If another profession or industry would not stand 
for this, why should our farmers be forced to accept this type of 
approach?  The government once again does not treat agriculture 
like other businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are, asking the government to approve an additional $400 
million in support for our agriculture producers.  This is not 
some cap in hand payment.  This is treating our farmers like any 
other business in the country.  When other businesses are sold 
out at the international bargaining table, there is an obligation 
to stand behind them.  Why not agriculture?  We have to put our 
political ideologies to the side and look at what is needed for 
our agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from all political parties in the House have expressed 
concern for the primary producers of the country.  Now is our 
chance to not only talk the talk but walk the walk.  This action 
would provide some immediate relief to producers to help them 
through this cropping season. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member mentioned in closing that maybe we need to put ideologies 
aside.  He is far from doing that.  We have had the usual rant 
against the Canadian Wheat Board, and the Canadian Wheat Board is 
one of the vehicles that is there to maximize returns back to 
producers from the international marketplace.  We have had that 
kind of rant from the Canadian Alliance before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants to set the ideology aside when it comes to paying 
subsidies, which the Alliance Party is opposed to doing, although 
they are talking about it now, but when it comes to the wheat 
board he wants to keep his old ideology.  Does he want the 
government in or out?  He cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to correct for the record what the member said about 
government controlled bureaucracy or something along those lines 
in terms of the Canadian Wheat Board.  The fact of the matter is 
that he was in the House when we passed a new act in terms of the 
Canadian Wheat Board, in which the Canadian Wheat Board, after 
much debate, was turned over to the control of the farm community 
through an elected board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cannot have it both ways.  For Pete's sake, he should 
give the real facts to the House instead of the malign ones he is 
producing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish we could get 
the real facts into the House.  I agree with the member on that 
last point.  The members across the way are the ones who are 
distorting the predicament farmers are in right now.  Not 
defending them or the motion is not looking at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, philosophically we are opposed to subsidies, but clearly if 
other countries are engaged in subsidizing their farmers and we 
have hung our farmers out to dry at the international bargaining 
table, we have to stand behind them.  We have a clear obligation 
to do that and we have said since 1994 that this is what has to 
happen.  That is why we proposed that 80% of the Crow subsidy be 
put into a trade distortion adjustment program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member made the point that there is a double standard, that 
agriculture is treated differently, and he is exactly right.  It 
is the Alliance that is treating agriculture differently, wanting 
to offer subsidies only to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already offered $500 million to agriculture, but we have 
also offered subsidies for exports.  We offer subsidies in Quebec 
through FEDQ, in northern Ontario through FedNor, in eastern 
Canada through ACOA, and in western Canada through western 
diversification, to the aerospace industry, to the technology 
industries, to the sustainable development industries and to 
communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have four quick questions for the hon. member.  Did he support 
the rural pilot projects that help projects in rural Canada?  A 
number of them are related to farming and people living in 
farming communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was he incredulous when the previous Alliance member criticized 
the Liberals for their subsidize, tax and regulate philosophy 
when the hon. member is proposing a motion on subsidy that causes 
more taxes and when the member had just spoken against 
regulation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the member find it strange when the member from Pembroke 
said she is the spokesperson for her province when there are 50 
times more Liberals in her province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, did you find it strange when the hon. member said this 
is fighting export subsidies while the leader of the official 
opposition, in his response to the Speech from the Throne, spoke 
against export subsidies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I know the hon. member 
is new to the House and I remind him to address his comments to 
the Chair, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was more like a 
little rant.  In this debate we are trying to indicate clearly 
that the subsidies the government should be engaged in are those 
where we can clearly demonstrate that a sector is being hurt by 
another foreign subsidy.  It is absolutely clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to some of the programs he was listing, the businesses 
in competition with those being subsidized would have to pay 
those subsidies.  That is blatantly unfair.  We would not support 
that because that is within Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are talking about this being a 
non-confidence vote.  The member for Malpeque has said that the 
department seemed unable to come up with a solution in terms of 
an assistance package.  He said that there were always 16 reasons 
why the bureaucracy could not do something and never one why it 
could.  He also said that this country had to support the farm 
community to nearly equivalent levels with the United States and 
Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member if he does in fact believe that a 
confidence motion should not be held on this and that members 
should be able to vote according to their constituents' wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was hoping that this 
would provide an opportunity for the 50 or 60 rural MPs on the 
government side of the House to represent their constituents.  I 
was hoping that would be what would take place today.  We wanted 
to make this a non-partisan debate and suddenly we are shouting 
at each other, and those members are going to use it as an excuse 
not to support the farmers in their ridings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, farming is the heart of this country. 
It always has been and hopefully it always will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating the Alliance motion calling on the 
government to inject the additional emergency funding necessary 
to keep Canadian farming alive through the coming year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sometimes seems like we are speaking to a brick wall over 
there.  As a farm partner myself and one of the hundreds of 
producers in my riding, I know firsthand how serious this crisis 
is.  The magnitude of the emergency cannot be overstated.  We 
need the money, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's announcement a couple of weeks ago was clearly 
inadequate.  He said so himself.  Here is a quick rundown.  All 
farm groups are asking for at least $900 million.  Five 
provincial governments are calling for at least $900 million. The 
Canadian Alliance is calling for at least $500 million.  The 
Liberals knew about this crisis at least three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than continuing to point out the obvious to the 
government and the minister, I thought it would be beneficial for 
you, Mr. Speaker, and your colleagues to hear from farmers in 
their own words.  Before I entered the political arena, through 
the media I put out a plea to farm people to tell me their 
stories.  These are some of the letters I received.  I was 
overwhelmed by the response from these people, and there were 
heartbreaking ones from all of them, but especially from the men.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like all hon. members in the Chamber to pay careful 
attention to the letters I am about to read, particularly my 
colleagues opposite, some of whom clearly need to learn a thing 
or two about farming and farmers.  The first letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we didn't put a crop in—we are finished farming. That 
sounds so simple “didn't put a crop in”.  How do I put into 
words the despair, the tears of anger, frustration, the 
heartbreak.  My husband is so defeated.  He used to be up for a 
challenge.  If something didn't work the first time, he kept on 
trying.  He'd find a way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband feels that he is a failure—no amount of me telling 
him that it's not his fault changes the way he feels.  Something 
is gone inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took a crushing debt load with us, as we try to start a new 
business.  Our little community is in jeopardy.  The rail line 
has been removed and our elevator closed.  In the past five 
years, many families have left the community.  Approximately 18 
school-age children have left.  In a small school with a 
population of 97—those numbers are devastating.  We're fighting 
to keep our school open.  Everything is a fight—and there is 
little fight left in anyone. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad thing is, if it happened suddenly like a lot of 
disasters, we would have gotten noticed.  But the grey depression 
that has settled over southwest Saskatchewan where we live has 
been coming for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been so many marriage breakups, alcoholism, 
depression, cancer and farmers leaving the land.  The whole 
stressful household is worn out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All our neighbours are in the same position.  It just seems 
there is no joy in farming anymore.  We are puppets with big 
corporations pulling the strings.  I see sadness and depression 
everywhere I look. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I farm with my husband and I know the crisis we're in.  I need 
not say more.  When the government took away the “Crow”, that 
was their first mistake.  It was to be here as long as the grass 
grows and the rivers flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is putting millions of dollars into other 
countries and have a deaf ear to their own farmers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-eighties when grain prices started to fall, my 
husband became really stressed out and was ready to sell out and 
quit.  This is where our problem arises.  Our older son has 
always wanted to farm.  He saved enough to buy a quarter of land 
so we sold him one.  He tried renting some land from a neighbour 
but found he only had a profit one year of the four he rented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had worked off the farm for about ten years and was ready to 
take over more land and responsibility so we are gradually 
selling everything to him.  We didn't want him to borrow from the 
FCC or a bank to pay us as the yearly interest alone would be 
move than the profit from farming.  He has no money to pay us 
even though he does off farm work.  He is always busy and if 
anyone deserves to make a living farming, he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 31, he is still single, which probably is just as well as the 
stress would be too much for a lot of young women who haven't 
lived on a farm...He really needs a break but can't afford a 
holiday even though he has enough air miles to fly almost 
anywhere.  It really bothers him that he owes us so much money 
and it bothers us too now that we are retired, we are so limited 
in what we can do.  Everything we put into the farm as “the farm 
is our retirement” is still tied up in the farm. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth letter states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm crisis in Saskatchewan is real—it is happening, it is 
a tragedy, it is preventable.  It is impossible to make a living 
on a farm of any size with the present world situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will it take for the Canadian federal government to take a 
long hard look at an industry that feeds millions and yet the 
principal players cannot make an honest living through no fault 
of their own?  How can a democratic country like Canada stand and 
watch the death of the western Canadian grain industry?  The 
break basket of the world is being destroyed by an eastern 
Canadian government that refuses to accept responsibility for its 
demise.  And a demise it is as every other grain producing 
country subsidizes their grain growers because they value their 
product, they value the farming industry as an integral part of 
their country's business world and they recognize the importance 
of the farmer and his family to their way of life.  But not here 
in Canada—the very country that should be supporting farmers is 
destroying them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the sixth letter, written by Nicole Stenerson of 
Sonningdale, Saskatchewan, a University of Regina first year 
student, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very sad situation has evolved in our prairies.  A morbid cloud 
has rolled onto its beautiful sky.  Hopelessness is in the air 
and you stop for just a moment, you can almost hear the land 
weeping in mourning for what used to be.  The death of a family 
farm is upon us.  The tradition that this country was founded on 
is dying along with the spirit and the pride of the farmers that 
are left to preserve the land.  Today, every family farm on the 
prairies is in danger and many of them are indeed dying.  This 
story is the truth and it is happening today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's farming economy affects everyone.  This is a fact that 
is most misunderstood.  Most Canadians think the farming crisis 
does not involve them, and approach the issue with great apathy. 
In truth, this crisis affects every Canadian.  If sympathy for 
the struggling farmers cannot cause you to surrender your 
support, perhaps fear for this country's economy can.   Canada's 
economic base was originally farming, with the prairies 
considered the “bread basket of the world” and today they still 
are.  Unfortunately, this is a fact that has become forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada loses its farmers, it begins to suffer economically. 
The disappearance of the farmer would affect the economy in a 
very direct way.  Farmers with less money spend less money.  This 
would mean the demise of both small businesses and large 
corporations.  Without farmers, there would be no need for farm 
equipment dealerships, fertilizer and chemical companies and many 
other large businesses that base themselves solely on farming. 
This is not a prairie crisis; this is a Canadian crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians, we need to stand up for our fellow countrymen.  We 
need to show the farmers empathy for their plight. Unfortunately, 
if this government continues to do nothing to stop the extinction 
of the family farm, we will soon be in mourning for a culture 
that has disappeared completely.  We cannot stand idly by as a 
culture of the country is in such great suffering and not even 
offer our heartfelt sympathy and support. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What more can we offer the government?  What more can we say? 
How can we convince the backbenchers of the government that 
cannot see what kind of a plight agriculture is in?  How can we 
convince government members to stand up and vote tonight on the 
Canadian Alliance motion? 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there has 
been some firing of derricks from the other side in terms of how 
we might vote on this issue tonight.  Let me make it clear off 
the top where I stand on this resolution today by the Canadian 
Alliance.  I will vote against it.  I will outline the reasons 
why I will vote against this resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I believe that we must do more.  We must do much more to 
encourage the minister of agriculture and cabinet in terms of 
assisting the farm community.  However, I do not want to see that 
decision handcuffed by this narrow motion by the Canadian 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party across the way, the Canadian Alliance, was the party 
that came to Ottawa and said it was going to do politics 
differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here it is today basically saying what it has said all along and 
that is get government out of agriculture, get rid of the 
Canadian Wheat Board or dual marketing, and it attacks supply 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Alliance is really doing with this motion is violating 
its own principles.  It is asking for government subsidies when 
it has said all along it does not believe in subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance cannot have it both ways.  Its position, and I have 
fought against it, has been to get the government out of the 
farmers' lives.  That is why it attacks the Canadian Wheat Board. 
That is why it attacks supply management.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always believed there is a role for government in farm 
policy and I continue to believe so.  I advocate a much stronger 
role in terms of farm policy by government than we currently have 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to my party on this issue of support, I believe we must 
support at levels close to that of the United States so that we 
are not a poor country.  I believe we are a very strong 
industrial nation.  We have good fundamentals in our economy.  We 
should be there for our farm community when our farm community 
needs help.  However, we should be there in a number of ways, not 
just by subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found the discussions over the last number of weeks very 
interesting in terms of some of the people who came to us looking 
for government subsidy support.  I spent 17 years in the farm 
movement and many of the people today who are calling for 
government subsidies are the very people who said “Get 
government out of the business of farming.  Do not allow it to 
subsidize things.  We can survive in the marketplace”.  We 
cannot have it both ways.  We either believe in the farm market, 
live by the sword and die by the sword or we do not believe that 
that market is the absolutely determining factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers, governments and political parties have to think this 
through.  What is the best way?  Is the marketplace really the 
answer?  If the marketplace is really the answer, and the farmers 
and the parties believe that, then they should not be in the 
House asking for government subsidies.  I believe in them, but I 
come from a different philosophical base because I believe there 
is a role for government in farming, to assist the farm 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight I am not going to align myself with a party that says 
one thing and does another.  I stand by my principles. If it is 
willing to rethink its position, I am willing to work with it in 
order to try to find a long term solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To comment on the remarks of the hon. member for Lethbridge, we 
see where the Alliance Party stands through its attack on the 
Canadian Wheat Board again.  The fact is, as bad as prices are in 
the grain industry as a result of international subsidies and the 
export enhancement program in the United States forcing prices 
down, the Canadian Wheat Board is able to protect the interests 
of farmers and producers somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is able to at least maximize the 
returns that are in the marketplace back to the primary producer. 
As well, through single desk selling, the Canadian Wheat Board in 
selling into that competitive international market has created a 
situation where farmers are not competing against themselves and 
are maximizing the price that is in that marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first crisis that farmers have faced since we 
became a nation.  In the 1930s, under emergency measures, the 
Canadian Wheat Board was brought in partly to challenge the 
unbridled power of the grain companies and the railways at that 
time.  It remains today, and we have made improvements to the 
wheat board in the interests of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the sixties and seventies, dairy, poultry and egg producers 
were in much the same situation as grain producers find 
themselves today.  The buying power of who they sold to was so 
concentrated that they could basically drive prices down.  There 
was not too much product in the marketplace but product was 
manipulated, the market was manipulated and farmers were being 
driven out of business.  What did farmers do?  They got together 
and came to the government.  We had a minister, a department and 
a party that was willing to go out and say that the market was 
not working.  They were willing to challenge that market.  They 
implemented the supply management systems which remain in place 
today and which that party attacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not hear supply management producers in here today.  Those 
farmers went out and changed the system that was not working, 
with the support of government.  I maintain that is what we have 
to do in this area as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Elbert van Donkersgoed perhaps said it best, certainly 
better than I can say it.  He was talking about the minister of 
agriculture's $500 million in federal funding and the total of 
over $2.6 billion.  He said  “The commitment is timely and 
welcome.  Rural Canada will breath a small sigh of relief”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that the minister of agriculture said “With 
this funding in place we must now focus on our ability to compete 
over the long term”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We've been there and done that!  If Canadian agriculture has done 
anything well over past decades, it is focusing on our ability to 
compete—almost to the exclusion of all else...reinvested assets, 
latest technology, faster machines— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still producing more for less.  The answer is not to just 
go that route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying the current crisis will require short 
term assistance.  The Alliance Party resolution is not going to 
do it.  Yes, in my view there should be more on the table, but it 
will require long term, global solutions and changing how that 
marketplace operates.  We have to change the marketplace so it 
operates for farmers rather than against farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Selkirk—Interlake mentioned something I said 
earlier in a past debate in the House relating to the department, 
and I stand by that view.  I believe that the people within the 
department do not really understand the practicality on the farm, 
and we have to change that too.  That does not mean those people 
are not good people.  They are just in the wrong department at 
this point in time.  We are going to have to change this thing 
from stem to stern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The departmental level and the farm community are going to have 
to come together and analyze this from the total perspective, not 
just a subsidy or a dollar here and a dollar there, but in terms 
of putting in place the kinds of marketing programs and 
transportation policies that will assist the farm community so 
that it can be the best in the world in agricultural development. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am dismayed and disappointed by the 
comments made by the member.  I am not sure why the member who 
just spoke wants to twist what we are doing today or why he wants 
to twist our policies.  The attacks he made are false.  People 
watching television may not realize they are false.  We have not 
opposed supply management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he made the point that somehow the Canadian Wheat Board was 
an indication of supply management.  People watching television 
might not realize that there is no relation between supply 
management and the Canadian Wheat Board.  The two are completely 
different concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he said that the Alliance was opposed to subsidies and now 
it was coming forward with this.  We have made it abundantly 
clear that we need to support our farmers because of the 
subsidies that are put in place by governments in other countries 
that stand behind their farming sectors.  That is very different 
from subsidies within a country that have nothing to do with 
trade distorting programs in other countries.  Those are two 
completely different concepts.  To mix them is totally 
inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are correcting the record here today.  Back in 1994 we were 
calling for 80% of that Crow money to immediately be put in a 
trade distortion adjustment program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we really are opposing is our tax money being used to 
subsidize projects in the Prime Minister's riding that cost more 
than all three prairie provinces get in similar programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I had the policy 
statement of the Alliance Party here, I guess I could get into a 
discussion on those points and what they really mean in terms of 
supply management, the Canadian Wheat Board, et cetera.  However, 
I will not take the time of the House.  I can give the member a 
copy of his party's policy, if he wishes, so he can understand 
it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned that the Canadian Wheat Board is not supply 
management.  Of course it is not.  Supply management is a system 
that came into place where producers of certain commodities, 
dairy, poultry, eggs and turkeys, decided that under legislation 
they would produce to meet effective market demands.  In other 
words, they were not producing surpluses.  A 5% surplus can drive 
down the whole price by 105%.  They manage the supply.  That is 
what supply management is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return for doing that, consumers are assured of a high 
quality product at reasonable prices.  That is a very good 
system.  However, it will not work for every commodity and I 
recognize that.  It certainly will not work for commodities where 
the major amount is exported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will work and can work in that area, if we have the right 
international environment, is orderly marketing.  The Canadian 
Wheat Board is orderly marketing.  It sells through a single desk 
and tries to maximize what is in that marketplace back to primary 
producers.  That is what the Canadian Wheat Board is doing, given 
the rough prices internationally.  In other words, with the 
orderly marketing system within our country, we are not competing 
against ourselves to drive prices down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite talk about subsidies.  That is the party 
that says, and there are other farm groups out there that will 
agree with it on that point, let the market decide all things. As 
I said earlier, if that is its position, to let the marketplace 
decide all things, then let it live by the sword and die by the 
sword. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we are ready now, after facing this crisis and 
seeing that the system does not work, then let us come to the 
table.  Let us discuss it and decide where we will go as a 
country on the recognition that the marketplace does not work in 
its entirety.  There is a need for government involvement in 
terms of farm policy, be it through assistance, through marketing 
programs or through whatever, but let us have that kind of 
discussion.  The resolution on the floor today does not lead us 
to that kind of discussion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have reflected on this, and the member opposite is already 
chirping that I am a resident agricultural expert before I have 
even started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make, if the member is at all interested, is 
that this is the first time I have seen an issue that has 
galvanized rural and urban members on all sides of the House, and 
certainly in this caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chair of the Ontario caucus, I have to present the views 
of my colleagues from Ontario before the Prime Minister, 
cabinet and national caucus.  I had to really study this issue, 
get to understand the significance of the problem and what some 
of the solutions might be.  I arrived at a couple of conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, a farmer from Saskatchewan called me and asked me if I 
realized that the $500 million that the federal government was 
giving to farmers would not solve the problem.  That is a lot of 
money.  It is curious how we can give out $500 million and still 
not solve the problem.  The catch phrase from the opposition 
would be hard earned tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to the urban members in my riding that they should 
understand the extent of the problem.  That $500 million to a 
1,000 acre farmer in western Canada means about $1,800 in 
subsidy.  Let us think about this.  A 1,000 acre farm is a 
serious business.  The amount of subsidy that farm will receive 
is $1,800.  What happens if we basically double it, which in 
essence is close to what the opposition motion is calling for? It 
is almost $400 million which will generate about $3,000 in 
subsidy.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will that particular farmer be satisfied with $3,000?  Will the 
farmer's problem be solved so that he or she will not be knocking 
on the door again?  Will the farmer go away and say that it is 
wonderful, that the $3,000 has turned life around?  We know that 
is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course members on this side of the House would have liked to 
have given more.  However, we also have much greater 
responsibility than some people in this place.  We have to take a 
look at all aspects of society and prioritize the issues for all 
Canadians.  A responsible motion would have called on the 
government to establish a policy platform to develop some long 
term sustainable solutions to the agricultural crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it amazingly entertaining to sit here and see members of 
the Canadian Alliance back-pedalling.  They are trying to defend 
policies that their predecessor, the Reform Party and their 
former leader, talked about and had in place, policies that they 
have ratified since becoming the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will share them with the House.  The member could say that 
people watching might not understand what the members on this 
side are saying.  Do not even ask them to try.  Let them try to 
understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that party's last convention, it adopted a new policy book 
which called for the government to force “a self-reliant 
agricultural sector”.  It was a policy declaration from the 
Canadian Alliance adopted in January 2000.  Let us put that on 
the record.  What does that mean?  Words are very important in 
this business.  Words are supposed to tell people what one is 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went on to say  “We will support and will advocate the 
phased reduction and elimination of all subsidies”.  These are 
not my words.  They are policy words from the Canadian Alliance 
convention adopted in January 2000.  It said “the elimination of 
all subsidies, support programs and trade restrictions”.  This 
is where they hide behind the words, when it said “in 
conjunction with other countries”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so the folks at home understand, I guess what Alliance 
members are saying is that they are going to call their buddy, 
George W. and say that we have a problem in Canada and that they 
want him to stop handing out money to his farmers so that we 
do not have to hand out any to ours.  George W. is going to ask 
who is calling and then wish them a nice day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance should talk straight to farmers.  It should 
tell them whether or not it is prepared to support them.  On one 
hand it wants to eliminate all subsidies.  The predecessor party 
went dramatically further than even this policy book does when 
it called for the elimination of support to the agricultural 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Southwest said in this place, “Spending 
more taxpayers' money is not the answer to any industry's 
problem”.  He went on to say, “Reformers continue to call for 
reduced federal expenditures.  Reformers on the other hand call 
for a phased clear cut reduction of the dependence of the 
agricultural sector on both levels of government”.  Let us not 
play games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party actually ran election after election advocating the 
elimination of support to the agricultural sector.  It has the 
unmitigated gall to stand here in front of the nation, in front 
of the House of Commons, and try to pretend that somehow were it 
on this side of the House, it would have written a cheque for 
$900 million.   We just know it would have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actions in this case speak louder than words.  The actions that 
have been shown by that party are despicable in the area of 
support.  Did it raise the issue in this place?  It did not raise 
the issue in this place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did it raise the issue in interviews and on talk shows?  On an 
ongoing stead, it sustains an attack on the Prime Minister rather 
than sustaining the issue of support to the agricultural sector. 
That is what Alliance members have done over the past several 
weeks in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the media raise this issue?  Were there screaming headlines 
that farmers need help?  I read all the papers every day and I 
did not see it anywhere.  The media did not raise it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members in opposition during question period today 
said that they asked questions but that we did not answer them. I 
wonder who they asked?  They must have asked each other because 
they sure as heck did not ask them in this place.  The 
proceedings in this place are recorded.  We know who has been 
fighting for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who have been fighting to get the $500 million, which 
is a lot of money, to support farmers and convince the government 
that they need help are members of the rural caucus, supported by 
people from urban Ontario and the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People such as my friend from Toronto—Danforth held a rally in 
the Air Canada Centre, in that wonderful agricultural metropolis 
called Toronto, where thousands of people attended to celebrate 
and support the family farm.  I was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just about farming, it is about security of food.  It 
is about knowing that our children will have food to sustain them 
as they grow.  It is about building great communities.  It is 
about restaurants and grocery stores.  It is about jobs and 
business. It is extremely important and is all encompassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, it would be a wonderful opportunity for any 
government to simply say yes every time someone came to it with a 
particular problem.  We did say yes, with a $500 million 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is simply playing politics in an attempt 
to embarrass the government.  It will not work.  We are going to 
support farmers, as we have, and will continue to do just that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I notice that once again the hon. 
member across the way is long on rhetoric and good at throwing 
words around, such as despicable.  Then he says in his 
intervention, let us not play games here.  He says that words are 
very important in his business.  I would submit that is very 
true.  They are very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that our party and the one that 
preceded it, the Reform Party of Canada, raised this issue time 
and time again over the last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most frustrating things for myself and a lot of my 
colleagues is the number of bona fide farmers who exist in the 
Canadian Alliance caucus.  These are people who have been raised 
on farms.  Their families are trying to earn a living on farms 
all across western Canada.  I was raised on a farm.  I farmed 
actively for 20 years in western Canada.  My brother still 
endeavours to operate the family farm in the Peace country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that there is a lot of knowledge on this side of 
the House, not just in our party but in the other opposition 
parties.  It is continually ignored, to our frustration, by hon. 
members like the one who just spoke and who thinks he has all the 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had the unmitigated gall to suggest that we should be 
advocating long term solutions.  We have been doing that for 
seven bloody years in this place.  The government has done very 
little, other than come up with ad hoc programs that do not work 
and do not address the needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to give it some more thought.  If he 
wants to truly fight for farmers, then he should go back and ask 
the government why it has not instituted some long term 
solutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear.  I 
certainly would not purport to have all the answers to the 
farming crisis or, frankly, to just about anything else around 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a collective in the sense that we all have input. 
However for the member to suggest that because he was raised on a 
farm he knows more about the issue than other members in this 
place is just nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never worked in a mine but I believe the importance of 
the mining industry is significant in my province and my 
community.  I may have never worked in a steel plant or a car 
plant but does that mean I do not have a right to stand in this 
place and defend the workers in those places and talk about how 
we can support those industries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand that farming is a business.  I heard a member 
opposite refer to it as a culture.  The member should get over 
it.  Maybe he would like it to be a culture but it is a business. 
To survive as a business it must have new markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I absolutely agree, at least with the premise that the member 
puts forward, that we must work together, as a government and as 
opposition members, to bring ideas forward so we can develop long 
term sustainable solutions to this crisis that happens year after 
year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for once I would be delighted to see opposition members put 
a motion for debate in this place that would lead us in that 
direction, but they do not.  They continually play politics, 
trying to create problems that do not work toward solving the 
crisis.  At least we are trying with an infusion of $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The caucus will stand strong to help farmers survive in the 
country so it will be a sustainable business for years to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was just over three years ago, as 
a rookie MP with a farming background from a rural riding in 
western Canada, I stood here with a certain amount of pride and 
dignity to talk about farming issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago agriculture in western Canada was on a slippery 
slope.  We started to realize that farming out west was 90% 
politics and 10% producing the product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen agriculture over the last three years decline to 
the point that we have an industry in crisis.  Agriculture is one 
of the largest industries in the country when we consider the 
inputs that go into the ground, the processing that applies to 
everything we produce and the jobs created on the in and the out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture minister stood in this place and said to western 
Canadians and Ontario producers that crop insurance and NISA were 
the answers to global subsidization problems.  What a ridiculous 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later the Prime Minister stood in his place and we heard him say 
that there could not be an agricultural crisis because he did not 
read about it in the <I>National Post</I> or the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those newspapers do not represent the problems we have in 
western Canada or in rural Ontario, let alone in Quebec or the 
maritimes.  An editorial writer from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> who 
is based in Winnipeg decried the whole situation.  What a joke. 
Those people should get outside the city, have a look around and 
talk to producers who cannot afford to put bread on their own 
table let alone put a crop in the ground this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of talk about the $500 million that has been 
allocated.  There are a couple of problems with that number. When 
we look at the budget that the government handles, close to $160 
billion this year, $500 million is not a lot of money in that 
context.  It is a lot of money when compared to other industries 
that receive money from the government, but we are talking about 
the third largest contributor to the GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem has gone way past the farm gate.  As I alluded to, a 
tremendous number of service industries feed into the 
agricultural sector.  Input costs have gone up 50%, 100%, or 200% 
in some cases, for fuel, fertilizer, chemicals, land taxes, 
machinery costs and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke before talked about a 1,000 acre western 
farm.  That would be a hobby farm out there.  The average farm in 
the west approaches 3,000 to 4,000 acres.  There are all kinds of 
large farms in my riding with 10,000, 12,000 and 15,000 acres 
that try and make a go of it.  The average cost of machinery is 
in excess of $1 million to $2 million on each farm.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with all those inputs, the parts and everything 
else that keeps them running, is our low dollar.  All the input 
costs are based on American money.  We are starting out 37 to 40 
cents behind, and those costs are rising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says that the low dollar is great for 
everybody because it helps with our exports.  Well it has not 
seemed to help with my export prices on commodities that the 
wheat board handles but it certainly has cost me a lot in the 
pocketbook on the input side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The freight system in western Canada is now based on conflict 
and animosity rather than being commercially based and properly 
tendered.  Rising transportation inputs are probably the highest 
costs on my farm.  Transportation costs me at least one-third off 
the top, which is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to rising transportation costs on the prairies is to 
go higher up the food chain.  Let us value add to the grain, 
durum, barley and so on.  Let us run the flour mills and pasta 
plants, which have been tried and shut down because of 
regulations controlling the way we must buy and re-buy our own 
products.  It is absolutely ludicrous.  We are forced to pay 
freight and elevation charges on a product that never leaves the 
farm.  How smart is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that is explained to backbenchers on the other side they 
say that it is ridiculous.  They ask why durum growers cannot 
build their own pasta plants and grind their durum into flour and 
recoup the extra $3 a bushel.  The Canadian Wheat Board says that 
we cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers, like the one from Prince Edward Island who stood here 
and said that the wheat board is a great thing, do not live on 
the prairies.  The people who come from these opposition benches 
do live there and we all got elected in 1993, 1997 and 2000 
campaigning on an open and accountable optional marketing system. 
We need that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board does not export out into the global market as it 
used to.  Everything it buys and sells now goes through a line 
company, hence the transportation, freight and elevation 
charges to tidewater.  There are no terminals on the west or east 
coasts.  It is run back through one of the line companies.  Who 
is making the money?  It is not coming back to the producer at 
the farm gate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we go?  The debate today is on subsidies, safety nets 
and the role of government.  The role of government in this 
institution is to play catch up.  The farm is in crisis.  We must 
have a cash injection before spring.  Farm groups and provincial 
governments are lobbying for a minimum of $900 million from the 
federal government and the balance of 40 cents on the dollar from 
the provinces.  They thought that would get the crop in the 
ground and that hopefully the European and American subsidies 
would start tailing off.  We have seen crop problems in the rest 
of the world that may bring the price back up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need those options.  We must be able to do that.  We must be 
able to value add, as I said.  We need the government to look at 
the tax component of our input costs and the huge freight problem 
in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are answers.  We need a safety net system.  There is talk 
about short and long term situations.  In the short term we need 
cash to get the crop in the ground.  There is no doubt about it 
because we are playing catch up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term we need a NISA account that will allow us to 
level the playing field for good and bad years.  Even the 
agriculture minister now realizes his previous position was 
wrong.  We must be able to use the NISA account to level out the 
bad years.  We must change the fundamental way NISA is handled so 
young farmers can get a start.  The average age of farmers in 
Saskatchewan is 60.  We have lost two generations of young 
producers because they cannot afford to get into the industry. 
We need a NISA account that will allow that type of thing to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need crop insurance that is user friendly so we can insure 
crops that are not covered properly now.  When there is a claim 
we need results to be specific to one farm and not calculated as 
a general average, as is done with the costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a long term trade type of cushioning mechanism.  It can 
be the trade distortion thing we talked about with the Crow money 
or a system like GRIP or MRI in Ontario, but it must be able to 
soften the blow of offshore improper trade subsidies.  That is 
the long term requirement, but we need cash today to be able to 
keep on farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sharing my time with the member for Crowfoot who I know has 
some great points to put on the record today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the farmers in my region, Mr. John Downer, brought to my 
attention a comment made on CBC last night that $2.6 billion in 
government support will be 75% of net farm income. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that Canadians hear that with 270,000 farms 
in Canada, the net farm income this year would be $12,800. That 
would be about $4.30 an hour based on a 60 hour week.  That is 
without benefits, and with wives and children adding their labour 
for free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my city a policeman is paid $26 or $27 an hour.  A nurse gets 
$25 or $26 an hour.  Even though the CBC statement was factually 
correct, it was terribly misleading to all Canadians because it 
took out of context what really happens.  I am appreciative of 
the opportunity to put it on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would be ashamed if they realized that based on a 
60 hour week the average hourly rate was $4.30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
intervention.  He is quite right that the net income on a farm is 
a very elusive target if there is any at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-five per cent of the farms in western Canada are viable 
only because of off farm income, that is husband and/or wife both 
working off farm to keep the cows in the barn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the AIDA money, and he is talking about the 
$2.6 billion that was in the global budget, is that less than 60% 
of it ever left the cabinet table and got on to the kitchen 
tables.  That includes 1998 and 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Distraught farmers in my riding have been phoning me.  Less than 
two-thirds of what they applied for in 1998 ever came to them. 
Now they are getting clawback notices from the minister of 
agriculture and his friends asking them to send back two-thirds 
of it because they were overpaid.  Can we imagine being on the 
bankrupt rolls and being asked to send money back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has rejigged the formula to include things that 
were not in the original formula.  That would be fine if it 
triggers more money when the government could not get it all out 
in the first place, but it will now claw back the two-thirds it 
sent out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The payments for 1999 are finally coming out.  Guess what year 
it is?  It is 2001.  Is it a bankable program?  My sweet aunt 
Fanny, it never got out there.  It is sending out only two-thirds 
of the 1999 money because it is scared it will run out of money. 
What an absolutely ludicrous reason. The government never sent 
out more than 60% to begin with and it just put another $500 
million in the same clogged pipe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That pipe must be clogged with Liberal logic because we never 
saw any of the money out west.  The Saskatchewan grains and 
oilseed sector is hardest hit in the country.  How can the 
government sit across there and vote against any more money being 
topped in?  It would not matter if we were asking for $10 billion 
today.  Nobody would qualify.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that today, as we brought this debate 
to the House, the House leader on the other side stood and for an 
hour we questioned the agricultural difficulties and the problem 
here.  We lost an hour of debate.  There are now six people from 
my party, many on the other opposition sides and a few on the 
government side who would love to speak to the agricultural 
crisis.  However we spent an hour on a technicality when the 
country is in a disaster and a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fourth time I have stood in the House on behalf of 
the many farmers in my predominantly rural riding and pleaded 
their case for assistance.  Today is the first day of spring, the 
day most farmers look forward to getting on the land and putting 
a crop in the ground, a time when calves are being born and 
equipment is being fixed.  Many farmers in my riding are not 
looking forward to much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every farm group across Canada has asked for a minimum of $900 
million.  The government says it can give $500 million and that 
should do. 
That will not do.  It will not help the plight of our farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today the Department of Industry received a 
communication through its communications directorate from the 
owners of the Grand-Mère Golf Club in response to questions which 
have been raised regarding the shareholders list of the golf 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter in question is being released and made public with 
the consent of the shareholders as is required by law.  It was 
dealt with earlier today before the standing committee on 
industry.  The letter makes clear that since 1993 the Prime 
Minister has not been a shareholder in that golf course.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  This is not a statement by 
ministers.  We are ready to move to private members' business and 
while it is always in order for a minister to table a document, I 
must say in this case the minister seems to have stretched the 
sense of tabling by making a bit of a statement.  Clearly it is 
creating difficulty in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tabling of documents is one thing and ministers making 
statements that cannot be replied to is another and we are 
getting into the statement category here.  I really think it is 
not appropriate to carry on with this at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Not only is it inappropriate that the minister is trying 
to table the document now, but furthermore I think inquiring 
minds want to know why the ethics commissioner did not have the 
information in his hand, but it was withheld from him as a 
contempt— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I remind hon. members that 
question period happens at two o'clock.  It does not happen at 
6.30 p.m.   I suggest we draw this to a conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things to remember.  The government does not 
require consent to table a document in the House.  A minister may 
do that at any time.  What does require consent are statements by 
ministers.  We are not getting into that now and that is why I 
have tried to draw this to a conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think that the Minister of Industry and the Prime 
Minister would find unanimous consent if they would agree to lay 
upon the table the document of an option for purchase between Mr. 
Jonas Prince and Akimbo Developments and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  As I pointed out, this is 
not question period.  It is time to move to private members' hour 
and I respectfully suggest we do that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.37 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of private members' business as listed on today's 
order paper.

<A NAME="LINK331">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK332"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-217, an act to provide for the taking of samples of 
blood for the benefit of persons administering and enforcing the 
law and good Samaritans and to amend the criminal code, be read 
the second time and referred to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to stand here 
today and speak in favour of Bill C-217, the blood samples act. 
Before I discuss the pith and substance of this legislation and 
give three excellent reasons why members should support the bill, 
I would like to tell the story of how this legislation came into 
being and how it developed to the stage it is at now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 12, 1999, I received a letter from a father who lives 
in my riding.  I will quote from his correspondence: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My eldest son was involved in an incident at work (Canadian Tire 
in Abbotsford) a few weeks ago which has raised a large question 
for me.  He helped apprehend a would-be shoplifter and in the 
scuffle some blood from the accused came to be on my son. 
My son is now on medication from the Aids Prevention Society (St. 
Paul's Hospital in Vancouver).  We won't be able to test him to 
see if he has contracted any disease until after three months 
(because the HIV antibody does not show up until then).  However, 
all it would take is for the accused to take a blood test to see 
if he has any such disease (he's a known heroin addict to the 
RCMP in Abbotsford).  The accused refuses to take such a blood 
test and the law, I've been told, supports him in his refusal. 
Here again, is a case where the victim is being punished and the 
accused's rights take precedence over the victim's rights.  What 
can we as a family do?  What, as our MP, can you do to help us, 
to help my son? 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took this father's plea to help seriously and I started 
researching his very deep and legitimate concerns.  What I found 
was that this father's assertions were correct.  When a good 
Samaritan, a police officer, a health care worker, a doctor, a 
nurse, a paramedic, a prison worker, a security guard, a 
firefighter or an emergency personnel worker of any kind is 
exposed to someone else's bodily fluids in the course of their 
duties, antibodies for HIV, AIDS or hepatitis may not appear for 
weeks or months in their bodies after the initial infection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the best way for these individuals to know if they 
have been exposed to a particular virus at the moment of initial 
contact is to acquire a blood sample from the person who infected 
them and then have that sample tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information from the blood test allows frontline workers and 
good Samaritans to make properly informed decisions about 
post-exposure treatment and lifestyle activities.  It also helps 
reduce severe anxiety levels for them and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, let me read to the House just the known side 
effects of post-exposure treatment for HIV:  potential harm to 
reproductive capacity; hair loss; coughing; abdominal pain; 
kidney stones; higher risk of contracting diabetes; total 
exhaustion; severe headaches; and perpetual nausea.  The Canadian 
Police Association is also tracking one case involving a police 
officer who is gradually losing his eyesight since taking the 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If frontline workers can discover through a blood test that they 
have not been exposed to someone who has HIV or hepatitis, they 
do not have to take the drug treatment that causes these 
symptoms, symptoms that can last for several months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oftentimes blood samples are given voluntarily and people should 
be praised when they do so.  The crux of the debate here today, 
however, is what should the government do and what should public 
policy say when someone refuses to give a blood sample to hurt 
someone else and has the legal right to do so, even when the 
information being held is extremely valuable to society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer that question, I tabled Bill C-244 in the House of 
Commons on October 19, 1999.  Bill C-217 is exactly the same 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, Bill C-217 allows a judge to order the taking of 
a blood sample from someone who accidentally or deliberately 
exposes a good Samaritan, a health professional, an emergency 
professional or a security professional with his or her blood or 
other bodily fluids.  The blood would be tested for HIV and 
hepatitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would only be applied on rare occasions when 
someone refuses to give a blood sample for testing.  The 
information would only be shared with the medical staff and 
affected individuals.  The blood test analysis would only be used 
for medical purposes, with the highest levels of confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I do want to mention my deepest sympathy for 
HIV-AIDS and hepatitis sufferers in Canada.  The trauma and pain 
they feel is great.  I want to reassure all of them that this 
legislation does not single out any individual or group who may 
suffer from a disease in Canada.  It will not make life more 
difficult for people who find themselves in such trying 
circumstances.  Rather, it is designed for those rare occasions 
when someone refuses to give a blood sample, which will in turn 
damage someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 is about helping others.  It is about compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After Bill C-244 was deemed votable, it received enormous 
support from thousands of individuals and organizations across 
the country, including the Canadian Police Association, whose 
members have been on the Hill today on their annual lobbying day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also on the Hill today is a lady by the name of Detective Isobel 
Anderson, who was exposed to a suspect's bodily fluids a few 
years ago.  She has played an instrumental role in supporting and 
promoting this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read to the House part of her story, which was published 
on November 15, 1999, in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Isobel Anderson's nightmarish experience began when she arrested 
a man for armed robbery in October 1997.  While searching for 
weapons, she reached into his pocket and felt a stab of pain. She 
pulled her hand out to find a bloody needle stuck in her palm. 
My first thought was “God, I have AIDS”, recalls Constable 
Anderson, a mother of three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As she feared, doctors told her that the needle may have 
infected her with HIV.  She was advised that if she started 
treatment with the anti-HIV medication AZT within two hours of 
being jabbed, she might not contract the virus.  Then she learned 
that the robbery suspect refused to take the HIV test and could 
not be compelled by law to give a blood sample.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, hours later the man agreed to be tested, but only 
after another police officer—and I hate to say this, but it is 
the truth—offered the man a hamburger.  The man said for a 
hamburger he would provide a blood sample.  Thankfully he tested 
negative for HIV, although he was positive for hepatitis C.  Upon 
hearing this news, Isobel discontinued taking the drug cocktail 
that was causing her severe physical harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of excellent and supportive people like Isobel 
Anderson and groups like the CPA, the paramedic association of 
Canada, hospitals, doctors and emergency workers of all kinds 
that Bill C-244 received unanimous consent to proceed to 
committee on March 21 last year.  The legislation then went on to 
receive two days of committee hearings and died on the order 
paper October 22, 2000 due to the election call.  I reintroduced 
it as Bill C-217 in the 37th parliament and that is the 
legislation before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the questions before parliament are the following. 
Will we continue to support a system that allows those who help 
others to become helpless?  Will we continue to support a system 
that allows those who sacrifice to become sacrificed?  Will we 
still support a system that allows the heroes to become the 
victims?  Or will we today, in the debate that follows, support 
cautious, moderate and balanced change in the form of Bill C-217 
which will protect frontline workers and good Samaritans?  For 
their sake, we need to send the bill to committee where experts 
can make suggestions, propose amendments, strengthen the bill and 
make sure that it is acceptable to the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who would oppose protecting frontline workers 
and good Samaritans by placing roadblocks in front of the 
legislation.  Let me review some of these hindrances and why they 
can easily be overcome.  I will then describe the three reasons 
why the House must support the legislation and send it to 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, people will say that Bill C-217 does not meet the 
criteria for federal criminal law power, but that is not true. 
Let me explain why.  For a law to form criminal law, it must meet 
three criteria.  The first step is to consider whether the law 
has a valid criminal law purpose.  Valid purposes include public 
peace, order, security, health and morality.  Bill C-217 meets 
these criteria because it is aimed at providing security and 
protecting the health of those who help and protect society.  It 
also attempts to contribute to public peace by protecting those 
who enforce the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in determining whether the purpose of a law constitutes 
a valid criminal law purpose, courts look at whether laws of this 
type have traditionally been held to be criminal law.  Bill C-217 
meets this criteria because the criminal code already contains 
two provisions that deal with the non-voluntary taking of bodily 
fluids:  section 487.05, the DNA provisions, and paragraph 
254(3)(b), the impaired driving provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the purpose of the law must also be connected to a 
prohibition backed by a penalty.  The bill also meets this 
standard because it uses a penalty to prohibit the act of harming 
someone by refusing to give a blood sample.  I have heard 
testimony from many police officers and prison guards who say 
that they have been confronted by a blood wielding opponent with 
a needle full of blood or bodily fluid who exposes them to it and 
then says they have AIDS or hepatitis.  The bill tries to 
eliminate or reduce this harm by letting those officers know 
whether that is true or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 also places a criminal penalty on someone for failure 
to take a certain step.  The supreme court, for instance, upheld 
the gun registry as criminal law because it penalizes someone for 
not doing something.  In other words, it is not just a commission 
of a crime, it is also the omission, not doing something, which 
in that case, of course, was registering their firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second hindrance that people will put forward is that Bill 
C-217 would offend charter rights.  There is no question that 
section 7 of the charter, security of the person, and section 8 
of the charter, unreasonable search and seizure, are engaged by 
the legislation.  Some argue that the bill should not become law 
because it would violate the charter in those respects.  However, 
again I beg to differ, for the following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 provides a fair and proper balance between the 
charter rights of the sick, injured and perpetrators of crime, 
and the rights of those in the service of helping others.  It is 
a balancing act.  Under the present system, emergency and law 
enforcement professionals and good Samaritans have no right to 
the security of their own persons.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 would not violate the charter because it can 
be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.  A 
constitutional expert who appeared before the justice committee 
last June asserted that the Diment decision established a 
standard by which compulsory blood testing would be allowed under 
the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said the following about the decision: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Justice writing for the Court said, and he made it very 
clear, that the invasion of privacy such as compulsory blood 
testing will only be sanctioned by the charter where societal 
claims outweigh the privacy interests and where clear rules exist 
setting forth the conditions under which the privacy right can be 
violated.  Such rules would of course also be subject to charter 
scrutiny. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize this point, for a case to be demonstrably justified 
in a free and democratic society the societal claims must 
outweigh the privacy claims, and clear rules must exist setting 
forth the conditions under which a blood sample could be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Bill C-217 meet this standard?  Absolutely, yes.  Emergency 
workers and police officers, the very people who help and protect 
us, receive protection under Bill C-217 and thereby society as a 
whole benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some argument that emergency personnel do not receive 
any valuable information from the blood tests of those who expose 
them.  I will rebut that argument in a moment, but I also want to 
say that in regard to clear rules, this legislation is only 
activated with the approval of a judge and with the utmost 
sensitivity to people's basic human rights and privacy.  It is 
done in rare cases that warrant this kind of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third hindrance that you will hear from people, Mr. Speaker, 
is that a blood sample does not offer societal value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote Dr. Shafran.  He is an infectious disease 
expert from the University of Alberta who appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Justice last year on the bill.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are a number of benefits to the proposed 
legislation.  The specific benefit of the legislation is that 
since the prevalence of infection with all three blood-borne 
viruses in Canada is low, the majority of individuals, if the 
source individuals are tested, will test negative and very 
quickly the anxiety level will be reduced in the exposed 
individual.  Secondly, in the event that transmission does occur, 
there will be documentation as to how it occurred and this is 
relevant in terms of issues of occupational exposure. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, he stated further that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prompt identification of infected source patients will allow 
the most appropriate and judicious use of post-exposure 
prophylaxis.  In the voluntary testing that happens in the 
hospital patients, if they test negative, we do not offer 
post-exposure prophylaxis.  It very much influences the way we 
practice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the best response to this question of societal value is 
the personal testimonies of the people themselves.  Ask those 
that have been exposed if this has value.  Ask Isobel Anderson 
and the hundreds of police officers who have been on Parliament 
Hill today.  Ask the thousands of groups and people who support 
this legislation.  Ask my young constituent and his father.  Ask 
the police officer who is losing his eyesight.  Ask the justice 
official who represented the Department of Justice before the 
committee last year when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Don't get me wrong.  If I were the one who had been involved in 
an incident like this, I would be very much interested in getting 
as much information as I could as to whether or not I had been 
infected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it is quite obvious that mandatory blood testing in 
rare cases would meet the societal benefit standard of the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, there are three reasons why the House should support 
this bill.  I hope all members will be able to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 is about positive change to the legal system, change 
that would provide fairness, a better balance between differing 
rights and assistance for those who are in the service of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the blood samples act is about fairness.  Presently 
emergency workers and good Samaritans do not have the right to 
know what blood-borne virus may have invaded their bodies from 
another person.  We need a sensitive, balanced procedure to help 
those people make an informed choice about their health.  Bill 
C-217 will do that for them.  It is a balanced approach, it is 
fair, and it treats privacy conditions properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the blood samples act is about balancing rights.  Under 
the present system, only the perpetrator of a crime or the 
injured or sick person has the right to the security of their 
person.  However, I believe the same security should also apply 
to the protector and the caregiver.  Bill C-217 will do that.  It 
will balance the rights so that charter rights are protected for 
both groups of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the blood samples act is about compassion and helping 
those who help others in our society. 
If people put themselves in harm's way trying to help or trying 
to arrest someone, there should be some safeguards for them when 
they are exposed to risk.  Let us be compassionate with this 
legislation and help those who are helping others.  Bill C-217 
will do that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT99"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT99"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1855

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this legislation has also been called the good 
Samaritan act after my young constituent who was covered in blood 
during his good Samaritan act.  Some would say it is also called 
the good Samaritan act because the bill would benefit the health 
and peace of mind of thousands of emergency, health and security 
and paramedic workers who give of themselves every day so that we 
can enjoy a better life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also argue that Bill C-217 is also called the good 
Samaritan act because it provides an opportunity for members of 
parliament to act like good Samaritans.  The choice before us 
today is clear.  We can refuse to support the bill and in so 
doing deny frontline and emergency workers their health and their 
peace of mind, or we can in, the spirit of good Samaritanism, 
provide health, compassion and assistance to those who are hurt, 
needy and give of themselves in the service of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must allow privacy sensitive, human rights sensitive and 
balanced mandatory blood testing in rare cases to build a system 
that allows those who help others to be helped and allows our 
heroes to stay heroes instead of becoming victims.  Let us pass 
Bill C-217 to help those in the service of others. 
<P><A NAME="LINK333"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the bill proposed by the member for Fraser Valley raises a number 
of important issues that must be thoroughly examined.  There is 
no question that he speaks with passion on this issue and I 
commend him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 provides that a justice may issue a warrant 
authorizing a peace officer to require a qualified medical 
practitioner to take or cause to be taken by a qualified 
technician samples of blood from a person in order to determine 
whether the person carries hepatitis B virus or the hepatitis C 
virus or the human autoimmune deficiency virus, which is commonly 
known as HIV, if the justice is satisfied that there are 
reasonable grounds to do so.  These reasonable grounds are 
subsequently enumerated in the proposed bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first blush, the bill appeals to our desire to help those on 
the front lines, those individuals who in their daily work 
confront the possibility of putting their health at risk.  We are 
speaking here of medical practitioners, health care 
professionals, firefighters and police officers to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health appreciates the work that has been done 
by emergency responders in Canada, as we all do.  They are an 
essential component of the Canadian health care system.  Health 
Canada has collaborated with emergency responders on many 
occasions, leading to the development of a national consensus on 
guidelines for the establishment of a post-exposure notification 
protocol for emergency responders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who work on the front lines as emergency responders can be 
exposed to blood and other bodily fluids in the course of their 
work.  Of concern in this proposed piece of legislation are those 
injuries that could result in exposure to blood-borne pathogens, 
namely HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  It must be pointed out 
that exposure to the blood or bodily fluids of a person infected 
with HIV, HBV or HCV does not necessarily result in transmission 
of the virus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to properly prevent these exposures and to respond 
appropriately when exposure does occur, emergency response 
organizations need an overall occupational health protocol that 
includes immunization against hepatitis B, personal protective 
equipment such as gloves, and safe work practices.  If possible 
exposure does occur, emergency responders need to be educated 
because of the protocols on how to obtain immediate assessment 
and follow-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217, the blood samples act, would authorize the drawing of 
blood samples from individuals who may have been accidentally or 
intentionally exposed—frontline service emergency providers or a 
good Samaritan—to hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a suspected exposure, an emergency service provider would 
be permitted to apply to a justice for a warrant.  This warrant 
would authorize a medical practitioner or technician to take a 
blood sample from the patient in question, test for the 
aforementioned diseases and provide test results to the patient 
and to the emergency service provider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Refusal to submit to a blood test could result in a prison term 
of up to six months.  While we recognize that emergency service 
providers must act promptly to counteract the negative effects of 
exposure to serious diseases, it is important to note that 
previous requests for such testing have been rejected by the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preventive measures should be taken within hours of exposure. 
According to Health Canada guidelines published in the Canada 
communicable diseases report, the option to administer 
post-exposure prophylaxis should be established within a few 
hours. 
It is unlikely that the legal and medical procedures necessary to 
draw an authorized blood sample, to test it and distribute its 
results could be accomplished within this brief time frame. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1900"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT100"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1900

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While mandatory blood testing of sources in cases of genuine 
exposure might assist in making more informed decisions regarding 
the use of post-exposure medications, there would also be the 
potential for endangering the health, especially the mental 
health, of the victim by breaking the rules of patient 
confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines referred to above and established by Health 
Canada, in conjunction with firefighters, police and ambulance 
workers in 1995, demonstrate the concrete actions taken to 
address the risks, and by consequence have already anticipated 
the objectives of the bill.  These guidelines, which ensure that 
emergency responders will be notified quickly regarding exposures 
obtained in their line of work, have been implemented by a number 
of parliaments, specifically Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, 
Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories, and in other regions 
and hospitals in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 a second protocol outlining assessment, testing and 
treatment procedures to be used to promote the well-being of 
health care workers, including firefighters, police and ambulance 
workers, was released by Health Canada.  By following the second 
protocol, emergency responders will receive up to date care 
directed toward reducing the effects of an exposure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines recommended by Health Canada for emergency 
responders reflect the same standard of care given to all other 
health care workers, including nurses and physicians.  The 
guidelines recommend testing the source in such cases but always 
with consent.  By following Health Canada's notification 
protocols, emergency responders can be assured of timely, 
rational and effective assessment and treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of blood testing has been the subject of extensive 
study in the criminal field in the context of sexual assault. 
Medical experts advise that the only way a victim of sexual 
assault can be sure that he or she has not been infected is by 
undergoing hepatitis B or C or HIV antibody testing, according to 
recommended procedures.  A random test is simply not 
determinative of the health of an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On its face the bill does not apply solely in cases where an 
offence is alleged to have been committed, but rather in any case 
where there has been an exchange of bodily fluids.  Thus a 
warrant to obtain a bodily sample is sought without any offence 
being committed.  There is therefore no nexus for criminal law. 
This is most troubling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also raises important concerns relating to privacy, 
searches and seizures and human rights guaranteed by the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The taking of bodily substances 
always raises significant constitutional issues and charter 
issues.  The taking of bodily substances without any charges 
being laid or before conviction raises considerable 
constitutional questions under section 7, life, liberty and 
security of the person, and section 8, unreasonable search and 
seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of blood testing clearly belongs in the domain of 
health.  The Department of Justice is actively working with other 
departments, in particular Health Canada, to ensure that there is 
more done to provide support and assistance to those who may be 
concerned about the risk of hepatitis B or C or HIV infection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I support measures to protect our emergency 
workers, firefighters, police officers and good Samaritans. 
However, it is questionable whether Bill C-217 does this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK334"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
wish to congratulate the spokesperson and sponsor of the bill. I 
know that he is acting in good faith. I know how much he cares 
about this issue because this is the third time he has introduced a 
bill such as the one before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that today is a special day in that several 
members of parliament met with police officers on this national 
day of lobbying for police officers. I personally met three of 
them, including a very dedicated police officer who has been in 
the public life for a number of years and who is himself a 
brilliant spokesperson for his union. I am referring of course 
to Mr. Prud'homme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an easy topic for me as a parliamentarian. My oldest 
brother has been a police officer for eight years and I would 
not like to see him risk being contaminated by the AIDS virus or 
any other harmful substance. Moreover, I shared my life with a 
person who died of AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's bill raises the question of how to protect the 
confidentiality of those who do not readily want to disclose 
their serologic status. How are we going to comply with the 
state of law? I will get back to this later on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT101"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT101"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1905

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we going to guarantee to police officers that, as 
parliamentarians, we will give them the most modern and useful 
tools for their work? For police officers who come onto a scene, 
there is a risk factor that does not exist for other 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the bill does not concern only police officers but 
also medical practitioners and firefighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to tell members right now that I hope—and I discussed 
this earlier with the parliamentary secretary—the bill will be 
referred to committee, where we may responsibly analyze it and 
hear again from the Canadian Police Association, the Association 
of Chiefs of Police, representatives from the field of health 
care and representatives of those affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, since we must be clear, I must say that in its 
current form, I would not recommend the bill to the Bloc 
Quebecois caucus for its support, although—and I say this for 
those watching—we have a tradition in the Bloc Quebecois that 
when private members' bills are involved of giving free voice to 
members to vote either way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make the following three comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is a risk in using search warrants issued by a 
justice of the peace in situations in which—and I think the 
member for Fraser Valley will recognize this—it is possible to be 
objective in a situation where a justice is asked to issue a 
search warrant where there has been no offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very troubling because it is recognized under our system 
of law, rightly or wrongly—but this is the law in force at the 
moment—that a search warrant is closely linked to the finding of 
an offence and gives considerable powers to those who wish to use 
them, although these powers are not described as extraordinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we know that since the early 1990s—and this is what I 
told the police officers I met with earlier—there has been a 
national AIDS strategy with an annual budget of $45 million.  The 
entire strategy is based on respect for the confidentiality of 
serologic status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago, when we listened to the witnesses who appeared 
before us to talk about the member's previous bill, there were 
two distinctly different camps.  The police officers will see 
that their fellow officers were among those who supported the 
bill.  Of course we can understand why.  As I said, I have an 
older brother, aged 39, who is a policeman.  I would certainly 
not want to learn that in the course of his duties he had been 
exposed to contamination factors such as hepatitis B or C or to 
the AIDS virus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, those appearing before the committee fell into two 
camps.  One consisted of police officers who were in favour; 
the other consisted of Health Canada, which was opposed; the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission, which was also opposed; the 
Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, which was opposed; and the 
Canadian coalition of organizations representing persons with 
AIDS, which was also opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the bill is that once it is passed it will 
change a fundamental approach in the criminal code.  A situation 
could arise where someone who did not wish to reveal his 
serologic status would be required to do so.  Not only would it 
be possible to oblige someone to allow a sample of their blood 
to be taken but, in addition, the bill would provide that the person 
must be told the result of this blood test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where some caution is in order. 
What is the solution?  I make no claim to have found it. 
Reflection in a parliamentary committee is needed and it is 
important for the bill to go before a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to tell the police, those who are infected, and our 
colleague is that we are going to work very seriously in 
committee.  I wish to remind him, however, that Health Canada 
has indicated to us that, when a health professional, police 
officer or firefighter has reason to think that he or she has 
been infected, it is urgent to seek prophylaxis. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT102"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT102"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1910

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People must not believe that the blood tests that are available 
are the be-all and end-all.  What the Health Canada professionals 
have reminded us of is that in two-thirds of cases, because of 
the serologic window—that twenty or so days before an infected 
person develops antibodies even if infected—blood tests cannot 
necessarily give a proper indication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, Health Canada told us that the most up-to-date 
solution, reflecting the progress made by the medical profession 
and what was available for those who wish to avoid developing 
the disease, was for people to seek prophylaxis right away. 
We must keep this possibility in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I do not share the analysis made by the sponsor of the 
bill because the supreme court clearly indicated that we cannot 
force a person to disclose his serologic status since this 
would contravene section 7 of the charter. I would like to quote 
from that ruling. The supreme court ruled that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of a person's body without his consent to obtain 
information on that person is a violation of a part of his 
private life that is essential to the preservation of his human 
dignity, and the Canadian charter prevents a police officer or 
an agent of government from collecting a substance as intimately 
personal as a blood sample. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying three things. Let us support the hon. 
member's initiative and let us work seriously in committee. 
However, it is not obvious that in its present form the bill 
should get the consent of our colleagues and of all House 
members because it opens a breach in the provisions of the 
charter that could lead to abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Bloc Quebecois is determined to work seriously in 
parliamentary committees because we owe it to police officers, 
health professionals and firefighters. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK335"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I begin my remarks by commending the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley for bringing the issue forward and for pursuing it 
with great vigour and sincerity.  By virtue of his remarks and 
the wisdom behind the particular legislative initiative, it is 
quite clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217, referred to as the blood samples act, is for with a 
very practical purpose.  It is for the taking of blood samples 
for the benefit of persons administering or enforcing the law and 
good Samaritans.  There is a need to protect those individuals 
and it clearly encourages selfless acts of courage.  It is 
clearly there to safeguard persons who quite often because of 
their profession or because of their own good will find 
themselves in harm's way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police, firefighters, ambulance attendants, nurses and many 
other professionals are clearly those who are most vulnerable and 
most affected by the ill that can come from being subjected to a 
potentially deadly or lifelong disease, if they find themselves 
in that circumstance.  However, it also goes further than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also affect and encourage good Samaritans and 
individuals who find themselves in a situation where they may be 
called upon to aid someone who has a heart attack, for example, 
or is drowning.  It encourages these selfless acts of courage 
that many in other professions, like police, routinely perform or 
routinely find themselves facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an individual comes in contact with another individual's 
bodily fluids, whether it be by accident or by deliberate 
contamination, their professional duties, their emergency skills 
and first aid response is often required.  It is demanded of 
them.  It makes good sense to me, and I think to members present, 
that they should be afforded some protection. 
Where they are required to act, should we not do everything we 
can to enhance their safety?  The bill goes a long way to achieve 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people in the constituency of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who routinely put themselves in 
harm's way.  I take this opportunity to thank them and tell them 
that members in this Chamber fully appreciate what they do.  We 
owe a debt of gratitude to all those who perform these acts daily 
and routinely around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned the broad nature of the bill, where it 
refers to good Samaritans who might be performing CPR in 
circumstances where an individual is afflicted by a sudden 
illness in a public place.  The legislation is there to enhance 
the protection of those who put their own safety second, when 
trying to administer help to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are doctors present who probably have faced that 
situation on numerous occasions.  Police officers, ambulance 
attendance and others very often have to get a blood sample from 
an individual who is receiving some kind of emergency service. 
In the performance of their professional duty, they can get stuck 
by a needle or they might, by virtue of having a wound 
themselves, receive a transfer of some deadly disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very much in a high risk category, just by virtue of 
their job description, and they may then face the serious 
prospect of not knowing whether they have in fact been infected 
by a communicable disease.  Intravenous drug users quite 
frequently are carriers of HIV.  They are carriers of hepatitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who might come into contact with this faces a lifelong 
illness or death.  The consequences could not be more grave, 
which puts greater emphasis on the importance of the bill before 
us.  A high risk person is well within their rights to refuse to 
give a sample of their blood.  On many occasions, as we have seen 
in the example that the hon. member from Fraser Valley 
illustrated, individuals currently have the right to refuse to 
give a sample of their blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blood can be analyzed for communicable diseases.  HIV and 
hepatitis are two that have been referred to.  The analysis is to 
establish a course of treatment for that individual who may have 
been exposed, that good Samaritan or police officer.  This is a 
basic right that any person would want.  Even if the news is 
horrible, they would want to know rather than be inflicted with 
this lengthy period of waiting before knowing whether the illness 
has in fact been transferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without consent, the victim can undergo a series of chemical 
cocktails within the first six hours of the incident in an 
attempt to stop it.  We know that sometimes the side affects of 
the treatment are horrific as well.  Even with this treatment, 
this emergency effort to prevent the spread of disease, they may 
have to wait for years.  There are powerful drugs that can 
produce these terrible side effects, but there are powerful drugs 
now, at the very least, that can give an individual a chance to 
fend off this transfer of illness.  However, there is still very 
much an element of a gamble that is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 2001, a Calgary police officer was bitten by an HIV 
positive suspect during an arrest for hit and run.  The suspect 
proclaimed “Welcome to the world of AIDS”.  This veteran police 
office is married and will now have to undergo a year of painful 
tests, taking the AZT cocktail, which makes a person violently 
ill and physically weak for months at a time, to ensure that he 
did not contract this virus.  An incredible, debilitating 
experience, both physically and mentally, for the officer and his 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of examples that also illustrate this point. 
An individual rightly has concerns, as do many good Samaritans 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example.  Colonel L.R. Johns, a commandant 
and CEO of the Canadian Corps of Commissionaires in Nova Scotia, 
has expressed his concern on behalf of individuals in the 
private sector industry, who are often working in hospitals, in 
situations where they are called upon to act for the betterment 
of others and are in harm's way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have expressed support for this legislation, 
including many police officers from the Canadian Police 
Association, who have gathered here in Ottawa today to make their 
point on this and other important bills, and the following people 
from the province of Nova Scotia: Kevin Scott, Gary Thibadeau, 
Brian MacDougall and Bruce from Kentville.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those officers and others are here to make the important point 
that there is a duty upon parliamentarians to listen, to be 
informed and to change legislation, where possible, for the 
betterment of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person who has blood taken from them, their rights are already 
protected to a large extent.  Police officers must obtain 
warrants and they must go before a justice before a blood sample 
can be taken.  In most instances there are exceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blood is taken by qualified medical practitioners in most 
instances where it involves an accident.  Blood cannot be 
analyzed for anything other than the purpose specified in the 
warrant, which is punishable on summary conviction.  This is not 
just a guideline.  There are sufficient safeguards there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology is advancing in the methodology in which blood, DNA, 
hair and other types of samples can be extracted.  This is very 
much a humanitarian idea.  It goes beyond partisanship.  It goes 
very much to the heart of helping individuals who, but for the 
grace of God, could very much find themselves in this situation: 
professionals, good Samaritans, or anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill protects Samaritans and professionals.  It is something 
that may very well be tested by the courts.  This is why the 
suggestion that it be examined at a committee is certainly 
another way to safeguard the charter protections that currently 
exist to vet any problems that may exist from a legal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that there are some deterrent effects. 
Some enforcement provisions are already built into the bill that 
could be examined in further detail at committee.  For example: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No qualified medical practitioner or qualified technician is 
guilty of an offence only by reason of a refusal to take a blood 
sample from a person for the purposes of this Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no criminal or civil liability for anything necessarily 
done with reasonable care and skill in the taking of such blood 
samples.  That has been contemplated in the legislation.  It is 
fair to say that judges would exercise discretion on the merit of 
the individual case as to whether or not it was appropriate.  All 
of this is done with the reasonable test to be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 is an important bill that has received the support of 
many groups which have been listed already, many groups who I 
know are most susceptible.  I hope the government is listening 
because we are often left wondering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-217 has been carefully drafted so as not to go too far 
afield into breaching a person's human rights.  Current sections 
of the criminal code would also apply to compel those who would 
use the particular section not to go outside a person's human 
rights.  There are current sections that apply to impaired 
driving, sexual assault and the new DNA databank that would come 
under similar scrutiny in the judicial chambers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important step toward protection and enhancement of 
safety for everyone.  I again commend the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley for this initiative.  It is a tremendous, common sense 
initiative, one that the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada 
wholeheartedly endorses and I would encourage all members to do 
likewise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK336"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to address this bill which has significant merit.  I 
should like to give an example from my own life of what the bill 
would mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity to hear a story which troubled me so 
greatly that I told it to probably 1,500 high school students 
over my time in parliament.  The reaction of the kids in high 
schools when I tell them this story is dismay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young woman was attacked, traumatized and hurt by a sexual 
predator, a rapist.  Luckily her assailant was captured fairly 
quickly.  That capture resulted in his being in custody.  The 
young woman had some medical background and knew she was at risk 
for infection.  She asked the officers who had made the arrest 
what provisions would be made for the individual to be tested for 
the diseases that she could be infected by. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The officer said that if the individual agreed, they were fine. 
The individual did not agree.  She said that her rights as a 
citizen who had been attacked were impacted upon by the 
individual's rights as a perpetrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have told that story to young people in and outside my riding. 
I asked them this question.  When the rights of the victim and 
the rights of the rapist collide, whose rights should take 
precedence?  I have yet heard one single youth say that the 
rights of the rapist should be equal to the rights of the poor 
victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take that as an endorsement from young people who are not 
sophisticated in legal matters.  They are not lawyers but they 
have common sense.  That common sense is one that I recommend to 
my colleagues across the way who say they support the concept of 
looking after the good Samaritan but follow that with a but. That 
but means the support for firefighters, paramedics, police 
officers and good Samaritans.  It is not going to cut it in 
the groups I speak with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to give a more personal example.  For those watching 
television, I have been a practising physician for 25 years.  I 
came to parliament with very specific goals.  One evening I was 
coming home from the hospital on a slippery road and I came 
across a severe motor vehicle accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to my reaching the accident, a young RCMP officer had 
arrived on the scene.  I knew him and I enjoyed his company.  We 
played sports together.  The victim of the accident was trapped 
in the vehicle.  He did what he could to get her out.  In order 
to successfully pull her from the vehicle, he cut himself on the 
broken window.  In doing so, his blood came in contact with an 
open wound on the accident victim's forehead.  He told me that he 
was in trouble because he thought that he could be infected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under normal circumstances, we would ask the poor victim to give 
a blood sample and everything would be fine.  There is a period 
of time when the antibodies are not evident if someone was 
recently infected.  However, somebody like that would never be 
recently infected.  This victim refused.  This took me aback.  I 
could not imagine why that would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She happened to confide in me the reason why she refused.  She 
said that when she was young she had done some things with 
illegal drugs that may have infected her.  She said she could not 
have that known because it would affect her ability to work.  It 
would affect her ability in the community.  It would also affect 
some of the things she did.  The victim left the police officer 
exposed.  In my mind, at that instance she completely forgot 
about a good Samaritan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the bill have an impact on many individuals?  It would 
not.  It would have an impact on those individuals who for 
whatever reason would not willing to be forthcoming with their 
medical histories.  Usually these individuals would be criminals 
or people with vindictive attitudes.  Surely my colleague across 
the way with his but would not want those individuals when their 
rights collide to take precedence over the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is such common sense that it should be supported by 
everyone, even those individuals who say that it is an invasion 
of privacy for the individual who is the victim.  In a case where 
it is an individual who benefits from the good Samaritan 
activity, there is an invasion of privacy.  Is it an invasion 
that is too great?  In my view it is reasonable, constrained and 
balanced.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have watched private members' business since 1993 when I came 
here.  I have watched which proposals from private members that 
get voted on freely.  For those watching in the gallery, the bill 
will be voted on freely in the House when it finally gets to 
voting time.  Occasionally the government will support a private 
member's bill that comes from across the way or from its own 
members, then send it to committee and have it die in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very seldom does a private member's bill get passed in this 
place.  Perhaps I understand when it is for partisan reasons, but 
surely there cannot be a partisan reason in terms of this bill. 
The member and two other members said that the proposals could be 
improved upon in committee if there are overriding reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes such good sense that surely we could set aside those 
partisan considerations and consider it in committee.  For that 
reason, at this point in time I suggest that we have unanimous 
consent of the House to send the bill to committee.  It is 
something that happened in the last parliament. The sky did not 
fall.  The bill went to committee and there was some discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for unanimous consent to send Bill C-217 to the justice 
committee to have it reviewed and for members opposite to improve it 
if that was necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to send 
the bill to the justice committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK337"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would just like to add a few comments.  I thought the attempt 
to have the bill sent to committee after less than one hour of 
debate was an honest attempt to take it back to where the bill 
was in the last parliament.  I do not have a big objection to 
that, except I do think there should be full opportunity for due 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are three hours of debate.  Having looked at the 
bill, the chances of it going to committee are probably pretty 
good.  We should not take the procedural wrangling which has 
occurred in a negative way, without having the full opportunity 
for debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too commend the member for Fraser Valley for bringing forward 
this concept.  I was interested in the story of the previous 
speaker about the individual refusing the blood test.  One would 
wonder why. Interestingly enough, though, not only do certain 
rights collide here but certain responsibilities collide that we 
need to hash out in committee.  I hate this because it is 
bureaucracy but it is also the reality that there is potential for 
the justice ministry to collide with the responsibility of the 
ministry of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That needs to be discussed.  I am sure the member, being a 
medical doctor, would appreciate that health issues are involved 
in addition to justice issues.  If the individual who refused the 
blood test did so out of spite, ignorance, fear or not 
understanding the outcome of it, maybe there is some 
justification for being concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about if the person were concerned about finding out 
something related to her past that would then preclude her from 
making certain declarations for insurance or for whatever 
purpose?  That might be a stretch, but perhaps it is something 
that needs to be discussed in committee and that needs to be 
reported on by committee staff.  Perhaps it could even hear from 
witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to be an hour of storytelling.  I too have an 
interesting story which the bill brought to mind.  My oldest son 
works in management for Home Depot.  He is not an emergency 
worker or a frontline worker, but one of the big problems in the 
store he works in is that there is an awful lot of theft. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT107"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT107"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1935

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are an awful lot of people who walk out the door with 
something off the shelf.  My son observed a person putting 
something in his clothing and walking out the door, so he 
confronted him.  I found it bizarre that all of a sudden the 
person pulled out not a gun or a knife, but a syringe.   He 
threatened my son with the syringe and all of a sudden everyone 
in the store panicked.  People were screaming and falling down. 
It turned into the potential for an incredible tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news is that the management at Home Depot train their 
people.  I cannot believe they go to that extent, but it shows 
the society we live in.  They tell their employees about the 
possibility of being confronted with a syringe or being put in 
danger of coming in contact with a customer's bodily fluids. They 
tell them that they should avoid a situation like that at all 
costs because of safety concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son started to run back but he tripped and fell over. All of 
a sudden the guy was on top of him with a syringe and everybody 
was quite excited.  They managed to disarm him.  It is an 
interesting use of the word, but there was no question this was a 
weapon.  They managed to disarm the individual and no damage was 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting perspective.  This was not an ambulance 
worker, a policeman, a firefighter or someone like that.  It was 
simply a manager in a store being confronted by someone who could 
have caused very serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be sure.  From what I have read so far, it does 
cover people other than emergency and front line workers.  I 
think of sports injuries and the potential problems that could 
occur there.  I would want to be sure that was covered as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring it to committee makes sense.  I would add, by the way, 
that I understand the treatment.  When someone is confronted with 
that kind of situation, whether a front line worker or a store 
clerk, they can be forced to take what is referred to as a 
cocktail in a hospital emergency room under examination.  I heard 
a story today from some of the police officers who visited me. 
They said they knew of an individual who went blind from the side 
effects of the cocktail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of questions.  There are health questions, 
justice questions, rights questions and, as the former speaker 
said, there is the collision of human rights and the 
responsibilities of various ministries.  When the time comes I 
think it will go to committee.  It has merit, but we should take 
time to answer the questions properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired and 
the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on 
the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24.
