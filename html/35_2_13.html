	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present two petitions.
<P>
	The first petition has to do with the family. The petitioners 
would like to draw to the attention of the House that managing the 
family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

	The petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House 
that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health 
problems or impair one's ability, and specifically that fetal alcohol 
syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have two petitions to present on behalf of my constituents.
<P>
	The first petition calls on Parliament to ensure the equality of all 
provinces by refusing to designate one province a distinct society, 
if such a designation confers special status or powers not enjoyed 
by all other provinces.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr.Speaker, the 
second petition is one of an ongoing series of petitions that many 
members receive.
<P>
	It concerns the lack of necessity of including the phrase sexual 
orientation in any amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act 
and asks Parliament not to amend the human rights code, the 
human rights act or the charter of rights and freedoms in any way 
which would tend to single out same sex relationships and give 
them some kind of special status.
<P>
	I would like to table these two petitions.

	The House resumed from March 13, consideration of the motion, 
the amendment, and the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if you were to seek it I believe you would find unanimous 
consent for the following motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That notwithstanding any special or standing order, at the conclusion of the 
debate on the motion of the hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, 
but not later than 11 p.m., all recorded divisions on the said motion and 
amendments thereto be deemed to have been put and deferred to Monday, March 
18, 1996 at 6.30 p.m., and that during any debate on the  said motion after 3 p.m. 
this day, no quorum calls or dilatory motions shall be received.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have the unanimous 
consent of the House to move the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The House has heard the terms of the motion. Is it 
the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, at the close of business yesterday, the 
member from Rimouski had just finished her address to the House. 
I am wondering whether questions or comments can be addressed 
to the member.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The member has concluded her remarks. Because 
we have just passed a motion that the debate be not further 
adjourned, there will not be any questions or comments put.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	So we will all know, all of the debates will now be 20 minutes. 
There will be no questions and comments at the end of the debate. 
If members are splitting their time, would they please inform the 
Chair when they get on your feet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with another member from the Reform Party.
<P>
	On March 12 when my colleague, the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, stood in the House to raise a 
point of privilege against the member for Charlesbourg the Speaker 
said the House was being faced with one of the most serious 
matters we have faced in this 35th Parliament. It was so serious that 
it did not matter that some months had passed since the incident 
under discussion took place, and so serious that the House should 
deal with the accusations forthwith.
<P>
	Later that day following a short but heated exchange between 
two members of the House the Speaker rose again and stated that 
everyone would have an opportunity to speak to the issue: ``My 
dear colleagues, this is one of the most serious debates we have had 
here in this House. We shall all have the chance to speak here in the 
House. We are Canadians, we are democratic, and you will have the 
opportunity to speak''.
<P>
	There can be no doubt for any member listening to and watching 
our Speaker as he said those words that he did assess the situation 
as very serious and that he was concerned that we would have the 
opportunity to speak to it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="682"> 682 </A></B>
<P>
	I can honestly say I have never seen our Speaker look so 
disturbed by the events he was called to deliberate over, and I have 
never heard such emotion in his voice. The only time I have ever 
heard our Speaker use a stern  and almost angry tone of voice has 
been during these debates.
<P>
	In addition, the outpouring of emotion from members of all 
parties during the debate leaves no doubt for any observer that this 
is a very serious matter. Obviously a great number of members 
wish to be heard, although I notice the PC members have yet to 
show any interest at all in the debate.
<P>
	Some MPs want the opportunity to represent the views of their 
constituents while others want as badly to represent the views of 
their party, as they are accustomed to doing, using their canned 
speeches prepared by the spin doctors upstairs.
<P>
	It struck me this was probably the reason the government wanted 
adjournment of the debate on the first day. I noticed that when the 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt introduced his 
motion it did seem to catch the government by surprise and it was 
afraid to follow through and allow its members to begin speaking 
to the motion right away.
<P>
	We watched as the government whip rushed around between the 
benches checking on what his members might want to say of a 
spontaneous nature. He made sure none of them would say 
anything that would embarrass the government side or be contrary 
to the call of the whip.
<P>
	Even so, there can be no doubt the people of Canada want this 
matter discussed; they want it fully and publicly discussed. They 
want to see every aspect of the issue explored in the House where 
they can observe and read, if they do not get the opportunity to 
watch, the deliberations.
<P>
	We heard the Speaker say everyone in the House would have the 
opportunity to speak. I repeat that quote because it is important: 
``My dear colleagues, this is one of the most serious debates we 
have had in this House. We shall all have the chance to speak here 
in this House''.
<P>
	Now what happens? The government effectively takes away our 
right to have everybody speak. It has invoked a form of closure by 
not adjourning the debate. I will explain for members who may not 
understand what that means. It means we must continue putting up 
speakers without interruption. If there is no one available to stand 
immediately when someone else sits down, the debate will cease.
<P>
	Is that reasonable? It is like passing a law that people can mow 
their lawns any time, one at a time, starting now, but when the last 
mower is finished if there is no one to take his place the right to 
mow lawns ceases immediately.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	Obviously people will not stay up all night starting their lawn 
mowers one after the other to mow the lawns.  Sooner or later 
someone will say: ``It is too late. It is not reasonable. We will all go 
to bed and we will start mowing our lawns again in the morning''.
<P>
	That is exactly the situation we are faced with now by this 
motion. I have been lucky enough to be one of the people who can 
rise to speak to it. However, there will come a point at which it will 
become unreasonable to expect any of us to be here until the small 
hours of the morning so that we can continuously have our 
opportunity to speak. It is unfair and it is impractical.
<P>
	In the end, I guess the outcome of this entire debate was known 
even before it began, just as the outcome of debates on legislation 
in this place is predetermined. The government will always get its 
way.
<P>
	This place costs something in excess of $125,000 an hour to run, 
but it is not a place which enacts the will of the people. It is simply 
a place which enacts the will of the parties, particularly the party in 
power. All of the debates, questions, statements and committees 
associated with this motion or any piece of legislation rarely 
change anything. In this case I am certain that will also be the case.
<P>
	In the case of this motion, the most serious ever to come before 
the 35th Parliament, the Liberals will get their way. In the end they 
will get their way. They will rework the motion so that they gut it 
completely, so that it has not the meaning with which it started, so 
that they can force it through to committee where they can control 
the end result. The first step in that process was to amend the 
motion of the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. The next step was to 
effectively cut off debate. The third step will probably be to make 
the motion disappear somewhere into committee.
<P>
	They insulted the people of Canada by taking the member's 
motion and removing all of the words preceding the word ``that'' 
and all of the words after the word ``that''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And that is that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> As the hon. member says, that 
is that. They left only the word ``that''. It is ridiculous. It is an 
absolute insult to the people of Canada. They took all of the words 
before the word ``that'' and all of the words after the word ``that'' 
and substituted their own Liberal Party spin, which made the 
motion virtually meaningless. They suggested the actions of the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg might be offensive to Parliament 
and that we should take it in that vein rather than using the word 
``sedition''.
<P>
	The people of Canada could not care less if the actions of the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg are offensive to Parliament. The 
actions were offensive to them. They want this matter discussed. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="683"> 683 </A></B>
<P>
They want it debated where they can see what we have to say. They 
would like every  member to have the opportunity to stand and say 
what he or she thinks of the motion.
<P>
	The hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt placed 
the motion before the House because the people of Canada are 
offended. They have been telling us that they want this matter to be 
dealt with. They want us to treat it seriously. As our Speaker has 
indicated, it is serious. He considers it serious. However, the 
government obviously does not consider it serious. It has placed us 
almost in a position of defiance of the Speaker's words by causing 
us to wind down the debate within a very restricted timeframe.
<P>
	For those of us on the Reform side of the House who have been 
standing to speak, we have been doing so because it is called 
representing our constituents. It is a concept which may be 
intellectually unattainable for some members opposite because 
they are lap dogs to the whip. It is totally foreign to them. I think 
they are far enough away from us sometimes to be foreign.
<P>
	Times are changing. We are in the information age and 
taxpayers, the people who pay the bills to run this place, will not 
put up with this sort of thing much longer. They feel it is about time 
we started to properly represent them. They will not be pleased the 
debate is being shut down on this motion.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	I like to quote a famous politician of the past when talking about 
things like these attacks on democracy. I like to quote him not 
because I admire him but because he represents the politics of the 
past, the old line parties and the old line ways so detested by the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	That parliamentarian is Edmund Burke. I am sure everyone has 
heard of him. In 1774 he said: ``Your representative owes you not 
his industry only but his judgment. And he betrays instead of 
serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion''. Mr. Burke made 
this statement more than 220 years ago, nowhere even close to the 
information age. The level of education was pretty low and it 
probably would have been true that an MP would not have been 
doing his constituents a favour if he sacrificed his judgment to the 
opinion of the voters.
<P>
	Today we have the information age and people get well informed 
on things like the motion before the House right now. They have 
had the opportunity to read the communiqué put out by the member 
for Charlesbourg because it was faxed to every corner of the 
country using the tools of the information age.
<P>
	In response, MPs around the country received communications 
about the communiqué using fax machines, Internet, E-mail and 
regular mail, by telephone, by all of the modern means available to 
constituents these days. It is a vastly different place from what is 
was in 1774 when Mr. Burke spoke.
<P>
	Constituents today are truly interested in what happens in this 
place and they are able to follow what happens in this place either 
by reading a hard copy of <I>Hansard</I> or taking it off the electronic 
system of the Internet or by actually watching the procedures on 
television. They have a right to be properly represented here and to 
see what happens.
<P>
	In the 1990s when people are well educated and well informed, I 
think a modification of Mr. Burke's quote is in order. I would like 
to hear modern politicians saying: ``Your representative owes you 
not his industry only but his commitment to alert you to the affairs 
of government that affect you so that you may become informed 
and so that you may instruct him on how to represent you''.
<P>
	In case members are curious, Edmund Burke was thrown out of 
office by the election that followed his famous statement. Even 220 
years ago it did not pay to insult your constituents, just as it does 
not pay today.
<P>
	The problem is that even if every member of the House agreed 
today that they would represent their constituents on this 
discussion of the motion before the House and decided they would 
support the motion of the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt in its entirety, intact, without 
taking away all the words in front of the word ``that'' and all the 
words after the word ``that'', but to actually look at it, listen to their 
constituents sending faxes and letters and making calls, and say 
yes, it is true and we should support it, the whip for the Liberal 
party runs around telling them they must toe the party line.
<P>
	Let us imagine they decided they would support it. The problem 
is in order to get to that point we really have to overcome the power 
of this old line whip controlled system. As people learn more about 
the procedures that happen here they take great interest in the 
debate, because this debate is also a serious matter for them, as it is 
for our Speaker and everyone here.
<P>
	This debate has come to the attention of the whole country. It is a 
serious debate. As they watch, listen and understand what we are 
saying, they begin to realize when they watch the votes what is 
happening here. The pressure will increase for change in the 
system, change that is well overdue, change that needs to be made 
in the information age we have entered today.
<P>
	I recommend to members a television comedy on the women's 
network which aired each Sunday night last year. It is called ``No 
Job for a Lady'' and is based on the experiences of a rookie woman 
MP in England.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	While the program is funny, it is also a fairly accurate portrayal 
of what happens in the U.K. Parliament and in this place too. The 
writers obviously have a good knowledge of the workings of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="684"> 684 </A></B>
<P>
House of Commons and they have no difficulty showing viewers 
that  committee meetings and travel junkets have very little use 
other than to keep MPs busy between votes. Busy between 
engineered votes, the result of which we already know, before we 
even enter the House.
<P>
	My colleague for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia said 
it very well last year in one of his speeches and I will quote from 
<I>Hansard</I>: ``My colleagues and I on both sides of the House know, 
and the public knows, that what we say about a bill is of little 
consequence''. This could just as easily apply to a motion. ``A 
dozen or so people make the decisions and all the debate in the 
world will not change those decisions. Even if government 
backbenchers and members of the opposition were here in great 
numbers, the ministers, the people we might hope to influence are 
almost never here except for question period''.
<P>
	It is a shame that we have a situation here where what we say 
about this motion will be of little consequence in the end because a 
few people or perhaps just one person on the other side has already 
decided what will happen to the motion. It has already been 
decided. As we continue with this debate for the rest of the day, 
maybe through the night, who knows, the decision has already been 
made. In the end when the vote comes on Monday or if it is 
deferred until Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, eventually the will 
of that one person or few people who are running everything will be 
seen to be the will of the House.
<P>
	There is a growing awareness among the public that the 
deliberations here have very little relevance to the overall scheme 
of things. The taxpayers, the people who pay our salaries, are 
getting very very interested in what is happening here. They are 
going to be applying pressure to change the system so that we 
really and truly begin to reflect the will of the people here.
<P>
	The evidence is out there. Parliamentary democracies around the 
world are finding ways to adapt to the information age. The 30 
years of experience under the old system that the Prime Minister 
has are not going to be worth anything in the next few years of 
dramatic change that we are facing.
<P>
	In the country I came from, New Zealand, the Citizens Initiated 
Referenda Act was passed in 1993. We were always told that 
initiative and referendum was incompatible with a parliamentary 
style of democracy. It was not. It all came down to political will.
<P>
	We are masters of ourselves in this place. We can do what we 
wish. If we had the political will to support the motion of the 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, if we had the 
political will to be independent and if those members opposite 
particularly had the political will to be independent on this motion, 
the most important motion to come before the 35th Parliament, we 
would see a totally different outcome to the one we all know will be 
the result on Monday.
<P>
	In New Zealand where initiative and referendum legislation was 
introduced, the people now have the power to direct the operations 
of Parliament. Several initiative petitions have been successful in 
getting the number of signatures necessary to force a referendum.
<P>
	Instead of having to have a referendum at perhaps great cost to 
taxpayers, in each case where that happened the Government of 
New Zealand moved to enact legislation consistent with the will of 
the people. What a powerful tool. It did not even have to go to a 
referendum. The very fact that the people had the power to gather 
the signatures to force a referendum was enough to make the 
government enact the people's will. We badly need that here. Boy 
do we need that in this place.
<P>
	For the moment the Prime Minister still has power over his MPs 
forcing them to toe the party line in defiance of the wishes of the 
voters of Canada. Lots of them will get letters after they vote on 
Monday or Tuesday. People will be watching what they do. People 
will know that they took out every word before the word ``that'' 
and every word after the word ``that''. They will know. They will 
read it in the newspapers. They will have heard it on television. 
They have seen it in this debate. They can read it in <I>Hansard</I>. They 
will know and they will send letters and faxes and will make phone 
calls. The message will get through.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Times are changing. In the next election true democratic 
representation is going to be a bigger issue than any one of us 
realizes at this time. It will be the issue of the 1990s. The 
information age will change this House in ways members cannot 
even imagine today. For those members who have been here for 20 
or 30 years they are going to be shocked at the changes that will 
take place in five, six or seven years. They will be embarrassed.
<P>
	Little by little the demand for real democracy is gaining ground. 
Hopefully soon all members of the House will be free to build a 
Canada consistent with the wishes of the people who pay the bills 
through taxes.
<P>
	No wonder MPs are held in such low regard by the taxpayers. 
They see very little being done in this House that reflects their 
wishes. No wonder they consider us to be porkers slurping at the 
trough. It is a well deserved label.
<P>
	In the next election the political elites are going to suffer damage 
they cannot even comprehend at this time. In the future when a 
motion like the one of the member from 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt comes before this House there 
will be an opportunity to see the truth, to see the opposite side of 
the House stand one by one and truly represent their constituents. 
They will truly represent the feelings of those constituents instead 
of worrying that the government whip will look at the papers and 
tell them that they cannot say this but they can say that. What sort 
of democracy is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="685"> 685 </A></B>
<P>
that? It is  changing and I condemn the government for its failure to 
keep its red book promise to make government more open, to 
permit MPs to be accountable to their constituents and to start 
having some free votes in this House.
<P>
	It is ridiculous to watch what has happened over the last couple 
of days. In the votes associated with this motion, 100 per cent of 
them stand up and vote the same way. It is ridiculous. Anyone with 
a brain in their head can see it is engineered. That is not a reflection 
of the will of the voters. It is about time some of them had the 
gumption to stand up and do what should be done.
<P>
	I urge members of this House, on such an important motion, to 
stand and represent their constituents when the House votes on the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my 
riding we have a very proud heritage of Canadian military and 
reserves. I have received many communiqués from my constituents 
on this matter. I felt it was important that I rise in the House to 
comment on behalf of the people of Mississauga South.
<P>
	For the information of my constituents and for others, this issue 
has to do with a motion moved by the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt which stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Member for Charlesbourg, acting as the defence critic for the 
Bloc Quebecois and supported by the then Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition, released a communiqué on the letterhead of the Office of the Leader 
of the Official Opposition on October 26, 1995, before the referendum in 
Quebec inviting all francophone members of the Canadian Armed Forces to join 
the Quebec military in the event of a ``yes'' vote supporting separation from 
Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, this action by the Honourable Member for 
Charlesbourg, and the then Leader of the Official Opposition should be viewed 
as seditious and offensive to this House and constitutes a contempt of 
Parliament; and consequently, the House refer the matter to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for examination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Subsequently a motion to amend was proposed by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons. The motion to amend basically said that the 
motion should be changed so that the matter of the communiqué of 
the member for Charlesbourg released on October 26, 1995 with 
reference to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.
<P>
	Ostensibly the original motion and the amendment proposed by 
the government require and request the same thing. They request 
that a particular matter relating to the event of issuing a 
communiqué relating to the Canadian military and all of its 
ramifications be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs. The difference between the Reform motion and 
the motion proposed by the government is very simple  and reflects 
a principle of law which is so very basic that no one could 
misunderstand: the principle of innocence until proven guilty.
<P>
	Everyone in this place, everyone who is familiar with the issue 
has an opinion. However, the Reform motion with regard to this 
matter assumes guilt until proven innocent. The government 
motion assumes innocence until proven guilty. That is why this 
matter should be referred to the committee.
<P>
	This same issue was raised by the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata yesterday when again, she accused the 
government of being complicitous with the Reform Party in the 
matter. In fact, that is not the case. It is simply for the principle of 
law of innocent until proven guilty. That is the only difference 
between the motions. Both motions require and request that the 
matter go to the standing committee where it can be dealt with 
properly.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver Quadra is a very eminent scholar on 
these matters and has advised many governments, international as 
well as in Canada and the provinces. Yesterday he lamented about 
the ramblings that were going on about details in which there were 
allegations, speculation and other accusations, none of which in 
debate require to be proved. He lamented that this was not the place 
to analyse nor to do the job a committee or other jurisdictional 
body could do. It was like a kangaroo court, which was the term 
that was used. Indeed the member for Vancouver Quadra indicated 
that we did not have focus in the debate, we did not have focus in 
the dialogue, we did not have the resources to do it here. It was a 
stage.
<P>
	The best thing to do, and I believe all members agree, is to have 
this matter go forward to the committee for debate. In that way the 
facts will be brought forward and the right things and the right 
recommendations based on facts rather than on rhetoric will come 
back to this House.
<P>
	The Bloc member for Mercier also spoke on this yesterday. One 
point which caught my attention had to do with the timing of the 
communiqué. The insinuation from the member as I understood it 
was that it was not a problem that the communiqué went out.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	As everyone knows, the communiqué was issued on October 26. 
It was a very sensitive time in the days leading up to the October 30 
referendum. It was strategically positioned. It stated that almost 
immediately, if the yes vote won, that the francophone members of 
the Canadian military would be invited to join a separate Quebec. 
That is contradictory to even the question which was posed during 
the referendum.
<P>
	Basically the question stated that Quebec would, after an offer 
was made to the Government of Canada, seek an independent or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="686"> 686 </A></B>
<P>
sovereign state. The offer had not been  made and has still to be 
addressed and presented to the Canadian government.
<P>
	There have been allegations in the House that the communiqué 
had been voted on and agreed to by the entire caucus of the Bloc 
Quebecois. I do not know if those are the facts, but that will come 
out when the committee deals with it.
<P>
	The issue is that the member for Mercier did not acknowledge 
that there was a critical period between October 26 and the 30 
which would have had an influence. As far as I am concerned, it 
represents an arrogance on behalf of the Bloc with regard to that 
referendum.
<P>
	The member for North Vancouver went on and on for some time. 
I wondered why he was so upset. I believe I do understand his 
frustration with democracy. I do understand his frustration with 
being a backbencher. However, I do not understand or accept for a 
moment that what happens in this place is not influenced by all 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	The member for North Vancouver said: ``The Liberals will get 
their way. They have gutted the motion''. As I indicated, the 
motion raised by the Reform Party basically stated: ``This member 
is guilty''. We have to determine whether he is innocent. The 
Liberal motion states: ``This is a matter of allegation. This is a 
matter of facts and figures that must be presented. We will decided 
with all of the resources and facts and not base the decision on the 
rhetoric of members who are just grandstanding in order to cover 
up some of the facts that may come up''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Is it deliberate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> No one will ever be charged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> It was interesting to read today's press on how the 
Reform Party has been lamenting everything that has happened 
lately. It is slowly starting to fall apart for them. They have had 
members crying in caucus. They do not know what to do to correct 
the record.
<P>
	However, the issue that the member for North Vancouver raised 
was with regard to the automatic nature of decisions made here. I 
would refute that totally. I can give specific examples. The member 
knows that the House raised Bill C-7 on controlled drugs and 
substances. That bill was in the purview of the House for almost 18 
months. Seventy substantive amendments were received in 
committee which changed the intent of the bill.
<P>
	Another example would be with regard to private members' 
business. Reform members know that 11 private members' bills 
had passed second reading at the time of prorogation. They voted 
against the motion, but the government voted to allow private 
members' bills which had passed second reading to be reinstated 
and put back in the same place in the legislative process. Even  my 
Bill C-204 which proposes health warning labels on alcoholic 
beverages is reinstated. It is an important bill to me and many 
members of the House. I was the one who had the opportunity to 
bring it forward, not the government. I know many members have 
had the same opportunity. Eleven bills are alive today because 
private members were given an opportunity to bring them forward.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Although the member for North Vancouver has a problem and is 
frustrated with democracy, he should consider carefully that in this 
place it is not the government which is taking action at the whim of 
a handful of people. The people of Canada responded to a program 
outlined by each political party in the last election. Those parties 
made undertakings to the people to do certain things and were 
elected in majority numbers to this place to carry out that job.
<P>
	Reform Party members are telling us that we are wrong for doing 
what we promised to do. I refute that totally. The Reform Party 
unfortunately is frustrated with democracy. I believe the right thing 
to do is make sure that democracy is protected in this place and that 
the principles of justice, particularly the principle of innocent until 
proved guilty be protected in this place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Indeed, 
Mr. Speaker, we are living extremely serious times. I believe this 
week is probably the most important so far in Canadian 
parliamentary history. Not so much because of what a Bloc 
member said in a communiqué, or what was said about the 
Canadian armed forces outside the Commons, but because of the 
comments and speeches made here in this House.
<P>
	We should not kid ourselves, what is at stake in the motion 
moved by the Reform Party, and amended by the government, is 
freedom of speech, the right for a duly elected member to speak, in 
short, democracy.
<P>
	As far as I know, this is the first time a parliamentary committee 
is going to review a statement made by a member outside the 
House. I know that, in the past, parliamentary committees were 
called to study certain members' behaviour, or certain statements 
made by members in this House, within this chamber. But what we 
are dealing with here is a communiqué issued by the member for 
Charlesbourg, outside the House. And do not tell me that the 
communiqué was on the Leader of the Opposition's letterhead; this 
is common practice; the government does it all the time; it 
announces all kinds of programs on its letterhead, using taxpayers' 
money. It plays politics with taxpayers' money. It is part and parcel 
of a member's job to make his views known.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="687"> 687 </A></B>
<P>
	In this case, because we are dealing with a Quebecer who was 
explaining a few things in connection with the debate on Quebec 
sovereignty, it is a different matter, and members find it appalling.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	I think Parliament has crossed a very dangerous line, infringing 
some acknowledged rights. Through the Reform and government 
speeches, Parliament is politicizing the Criminal Code, to serve 
some partisan and undemocratic purposes.
<P>
	Maybe some members feel the description of the word 
``sedition'' as found in sections 59 and 62 of the Criminal Code is 
not precise and clear enough, that the Code does not cover all 
elements, but I doubt it, I really think that the Criminal Code 
answers all questions that people might have in relation to actions 
from outsiders wanting to incite a member of the armed forces to 
rebel against authorities.
<P>
	I think the Criminal Code is clear, but if the Reform members or 
the Liberals do not agree, it is not with a motion like this one that 
the government or the Reform Party should say it; they should 
introduce a private member's bill or a government order to add to 
the definitions of the Code and cover some elements not now 
included in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	They should not be impugning motives or making a case against 
someone because of his political opinions, as the Liberals and the 
Reform members are doing to a duly elected member.
<P>
	I had been given the following warning: ``In politics, you will 
hear and see all sorts of things''. But I never would have thought 
that they would stoop so low as to interpret the Criminal Code for 
purely partisan and political purposes. The Criminal Code is an 
extremely important piece of legislation in this country, and I think 
they are now using it for political purposes.
<P>
	Why? Why has this communiqué, published on October 26, 
1995, been raised as a question of privilege in this House, in March 
1996? I will not surprise anyone by saying there will be some 
byelections soon and that the Reform Party, unable to rely on its 
performance in the House or elsewher, reasoned that, to score 
points, it would have to play politics at the expense of Quebecers, 
that it would work for the byelection in Ontario, that in Quebec 
their chances are nil, but in Ontario and Newfoundland, there will 
be byelections and the tactic would work. So they decided to play 
politics at the expense of Quebecers.
<P>
	Reform is playing politics at the expense of the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg, whom they picked out randomly, since all Bloc 
members made similar statements, released similar communiqués. 
They used the hon. member for Charlesbourg to put Bloc members 
and the whole sovereignist movement on trial. That is quite 
serious.
<P>
	I know that Reform members realized they were missing the 
boat, because of their slightly different approach to the question of 
privilege they had raised at the very beginning and because of their 
subsequent comments. They are no longer making accusations. 
They have stopped making unwarranted accusations.
<P>
	On March 12, 1996, the Reform member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan said this, and I quote: ``-my comments call 
attention to the fact that in my time of 35 plus years in the 
military-so this is someone who knows the rules-the most 
serious offences were sedition or mutiny from within the ranks of 
the military. For it to come from an outside authority such as a 
parliamentarian makes it an even more serious offence''.
<P>
	Although they are now trying to wriggle out of this, to say that 
was not what they meant, it is clear that they are accusing Bloc 
members, a specific Bloc member, the whole sovereignist 
movement, of sedition. This is extremely serious.
<P>
	Why are they accusing him, accusing us sovereignists, of this?
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I will now quote the relevant passage of the communiqué, and 
you can draw your own conclusions. This communiqué is similar to 
those released by all members' offices, an unexceptional, even 
harmless communiqué drafted for information purposes, because 
people wanted to know what would occur in this or that area-in 
this case, the Canadian Forces.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The day after a yes win'', he says-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Not today, not right now, no matter what happens-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The day after a yes win'', he says, ``Quebec should immediately create a 
Department of Defence, the embryo of a major state, and offer all Quebecers 
serving in the Canadian Forces the chance to integrate into the Quebec Forces 
while keeping their rank, seniority and retirement funds as a means to ensure a 
better transition''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Is this akin to fomenting sedition among soldiers, to urging them 
to revolt against authority? No. Finally, since we are talking about 
loyalty, is this what is bothering Reform and Liberal members 
today? The communiqué ends in this way:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-All of this expertise will not disappear with Quebec's accession to 
sovereignty and, personally, I think that soldiers of Quebec origin will respect 
the people's decision and will transfer their loyalty to the new country whose 
security they will ensure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does this amount to sedition? Is this urging members of the 
military to revolt? No. Sovereignists, Quebec men and women are 
simply telling soldiers: ``The day after a yes vote, we will welcome 
you with open arms. If you want to come and work for the country 
of Quebec, if you want to ensure the security of Quebecers, we are 
ready to welcome you, to enlist you in a sovereign Quebec''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="688"> 688 </A></B>
<P>
	Those soldiers wishing to remain in Canada have the choice of 
staying in the Canadian Forces. We are not exerting undue 
pressure on them. What is the logic behind this? Why is it that, 
all of a sudden, it sounds like this communiqué says such terrible 
things when in fact, as everyone knows already, this is what we 
have been discussing in Quebec for years now?
<P>
	Books, programs, all sorts of things have been written in Quebec 
about sovereignty, about our vision, about what we planned to 
accomplish in a sovereign Quebec, including about Canada's 
commitments to foreign countries. We were saying before the 
referendum campaign, we said during the referendum campaign 
and we continue to say and explain today-government 
intimidation has no hold on us-what we, Quebecers, intend to do 
for the military as for all other citizens.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign and even before, Bloc 
members handed out various information packages to almost every 
household in their ridings. They sent out the Parti Quebecois 
agenda, as well as the Bloc Quebecois agenda outlined in our 
working paper on ideas for winning, released in April 1995. As for 
the PQ agenda, it dates back to 1993. It was stated in very clear 
terms that Quebec would have an army. Quebec, as a responsible 
country, would honour commitments made to international 
organizations such as NATO. None of this is new but, all of a 
sudden, the Reformers woke up and raised the issue because, 
apparently, it pays to play politics at the expense of Quebecers.
<P>
	Reformers are telling themselves: ``We have a Prime Minister 
who has scored political points at the expense of Quebecers all his 
life, and he was elected in 1993. Why not do the same? We will try 
to score political points at the expense of Quebecers and see if we 
do well out of it''. I can assure you that no one will, neither the 
Reformers, nor the Liberals, let alone democracy.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The reason it will not pay off is because, contrary to the situation 
that existed in the good old days, Quebec is represented in this 
House. The people of Quebec democratically elected 
representatives to look after their interests. And we will stand up 
for ourselves. There is no way that we will leave Reform and 
government members a clear field to make all kinds of false 
representations. No way. We will set the record straight, as we did 
throughout the referendum campaign, and we will keep at it.
<P>
	I think that I just hit a nerve. The fact that, in October 1993, the 
people of Quebec entrusted a group of members from Quebec with 
the job of looking after their interests is significant, in my opinion. 
I take this opportunity to thank the people of my riding of 
Berthier-Montcalm for the mandate they have given me.
<P>
	We can see clearly today how important it is to have 
representatives capable of standing up for Quebec in this House 
because
<P>
these people would have us believe all sorts of things. The time has 
come to stand up and say: ``This is wrong. That us not how 
democracy works. This is not the kind of democracy that our 
forefathers have built over the years''. The time has come to show 
the right way.
<P>
	Finally, regarding the motion put forward by the Reform Party, 
which was longer than the government's amendment, much was 
said and the hon. member for Charlesbourg was clearly accused of 
having made statements viewed as seditious and offensive by the 
Reformers. At least, they had the merit of making themselves clear. 
Reform members must at least be credited for saying what they 
think. I cannot say as much about the Liberals, unfortunately. This 
motion has been amended by the Liberal Party; I feel this 
amendment is hypocritical. They took the original motion, and 
removed whatever did not suit them. There is no mention of 
anything being seditious or offensive; the communiqué is simply 
referred to a House committee for consideration. What should be 
studied other than the communiqué itself, other than the member's 
statement?
<P>
	In my opinion, the proposed amendment is obscure, it hides 
something, because the hon. members are not saying the truth. 
They could have acted openly and publicly by saying: ``We think 
what the member for Charlesbourg and his Bloc colleagues have 
done is unacceptable, and we want the issue to be examined by a 
House committee.'' Would that have been politically wise? I doubt 
it.
<P>
	I doubt that voters, particularly in Quebec, would go for such a 
statement. Liberal members, being really able to express their 
opinion on an issue raised by Reform members, have simply 
decided to hide this opinion behind a small amendment.
<P>
	At this point, several questions come to mind. Why should we 
refer the communiqué to the House committee? While we are at it, 
why not ask the committee to examine the Bloc's program as well? 
Why not start referring to that House committee all Bloc members' 
past and future communiqués? Why not have all that examined as 
well? Why not-since things are going so well-ask the House to 
censor the statements that we are about to make here? Why not 
strike a parliamentary committee on censorship? This would 
provide us with a committee that, given its great wisdom, would 
decide what could or could not be said, what Quebec members 
could do or not do.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	That is the objective of this whole show put on by the Reformers 
and the Liberals. They are true Siamese twins as regards this issue: 
two bodies but only one head. But I will not tell you about the level 
of intelligence in that head.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="689"> 689 </A></B>
<P>
	I sincerely think that it is dangerous to refer to a communiqué 
released by a member of Parliament to have that member judged 
by his peers.
<P>
	We are talking about using a communiqué released by a 
politician expressing his political ideas to have that person judged 
by a parliamentary committee. What will be the outcome of that 
exercise, given that the individuals who will review the issue are 
for the most part Liberal and Reform members?
<P>
	We already know the outcome: the accusers will be the judges, at 
least most of them. In what country do we live? Where are we 
headed? One wonders.
<P>
	Those who condemn the member for Charlesbourg really want to 
put on trial the whole sovereignist movement-and it is indeed the 
case, given some of the comments made in this House. Two justices 
of the peace, one in Quebec and one in Ontario, have ruled that the 
statement contained in the communiqué is nothing more than a job 
offer. In spite of that, parliamentarians in this House decided to go 
against these decisions and engage in this political procedure. And 
that is dangerous.
<P>
	I have a confession to make: I too made the same statement as 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg in my own riding. All the other 
Bloc Quebecois members did, whether it was to federal public 
servants, Canada Post employees, workers at the Canada 
Employment Centre, or to RCMP officers at the Joliette 
detachment. I told them: ``It will be nice; the day after a yes vote, 
you will be working in a sovereign Quebec''. There is nothing 
wrong with such statements. People were wondering: ``What will 
happen to our jobs? What will happen to us the day after a yes 
vote?''
<P>
	It is perfectly normal to provide details, as the federalists did 
when they told our seniors: ``If you vote yes, you will lose your 
pensions''. Consequently, we had to use similar arguments and say: 
``Come on, the federalists are trying to give you a good scare about 
your pensions. The day after a yes vote, your cheque will come 
from Quebec instead of Ottawa. It is with our taxes that they pay 
you that pension''.
<P>
	It is the same with members of the military; they had to be 
reassured because they were wondering. When I am told that, with 
a communiqué, we exerted influence on members of the military or 
incited them to disloyalty, I think this shows a lack of confidence in 
the people serving in the Forces. I even feel it is an insult to them 
because a closer look at the referendum results would show that the 
vote of Quebecers in the Canadian Forces, whether male or female, 
francophone or anglophone, followed about the same pattern as 
that shown by the national results in Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, about 50 per cent of Canadian Forces members voted 
in favour of sovereignty and about as many voted against.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	If it is a crime to advise people about what would happen after a 
yes win on sovereignty, then I plead guilty. If it is a crime to 
reassure people faced with the nonsense put forward by the 
federalists, I am guilty of that too. If it is a crime to stand for the 
interests of my constituents, for the interests of Quebec and for 
sovereignty, I am guilty of that too.
<P>
	If inviting people in general-and I will close with that-to 
respect a democratic decision and, after a yes win, to transfer their 
loyalty and their love to the new country, the country that would be 
called Quebec, is a crime, then I plead guilty. I am guilty of being a 
democrat.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, like most of the members who have participated 
in this debate, I feel this is a very serious matter. That issue has not 
escaped anyone in the House. We all feel that way.
<P>
	What we have been debating over the last few days is also a very 
emotional issue. It is an emotional issue to me. It is an emotional 
issue to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces; indeed it is an 
emotional issue to every single Canadian.
<P>
	I applaud the Speaker for the leadership he has given us by 
immediately recognizing the seriousness of this matter.
<P>
	This debate is much more than about the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg. It is much more than a debate about the former 
leader of the official opposition. It is much more than a debate 
about the separatist caucus in the House. This debate is about 
Canada.
<P>
	I am a federalist. I love this country. It is not just one part of this 
thing we call Canada that makes us Canada; it is the sum of the 
parts. It is all the provinces. It is all the people. It is every citizen. It 
is every man, woman and child from coast to coast to coast that 
makes this country Canada. If I might use the term, Canada is truly 
a distinct society.
<P>
	Five times in my life I have had the privilege of swearing my 
oath of allegiance to the sovereign of Canada. The first time I was 
17 years old. It was in Calgary, Alberta when I was joining the 
Canadian Armed Forces. I was going through some things last 
night, thinking about the debate we are having in this, the highest 
court of the land. I pulled out some old papers to see if I could find 
my oath of allegiance from when I joined the Canadian Armed 
Forces. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I, James A. Hart, do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to 
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors, according to the law, 
so help me God.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="690"> 690 </A></B>
<P>
	It was signed on April 12, 1973 by me and the attesting officer 
at the Canadian Armed Forces recruiting centre in Calgary, 
Alberta.
<P>
	That was an important time in my life. Every member of the 
Canadian Armed Forces, regardless of whether they are 
anglophone or francophone, swears the same allegiance today. That 
is significant. It says they will abide by the laws of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	During the time in the navy I served on three Canadian 
destroyers on the west coast of Canada, I worked with francophone 
people. I worked shoulder to should with people from Quebec. 
Every one of those young people who worked on those ships with 
me had a very important job to do for Canadian sovereignty. They 
did not speak of themselves as being francophone or from Quebec 
or from Alberta. They talked about being proud Canadians.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> All in English.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> The hon. member is wrong in his assertion. Those 
people spoke French on board ships and they worked alongside 
anglophones as a unit, a team for Canada.
<P>
	I have asked myself many times over the last couple of days and 
months since the referendum in Quebec what those young 
Canadians would say about this communiqué. I know those young 
Canadians would find this communiqué offensive to them.
<P>
	Over the last five months I have heard from Canadians from 
coast to coast telling me Canadians found this communiqué 
offensive. It crossed the line. It brought those men and women of 
the Canadian Armed Forces into a debate of secession of a 
province. They should not be brought into this. They have sworn 
allegiance to the whole of Canada, not to one part.
<P>
	Over the last couple of days some questions have been raised in 
the House about my motion. The motion represents the views of 
Canadians who have consulted with me for some five months now 
on the subject.
<P>
	I am not a lawyer. I stand here and say I am an ordinary 
Canadian. I do not practice law and I never have practised law. I am 
an ordinary Canadian. With the resources at my disposal I put 
together the feelings Canadians expressed to me through letters, 
telephone calls, faxes. I put those feelings into a motion I presented 
in the House which the Speaker found to be in order and also to be a 
prima facie case.
<P>
	If there is anything wrong with my motion, it is not in the 
drafting or in the spirit of the motion. It is in the way it is being 
interpreted by some people in the House who would have been 
against any motion that draws the line in the sand for Canadians 
which says clearly: ``If you cross this line, it is wrong''. That is 
what I was trying to accomplish. I believe I did in the intent of the 
motion.
<P>
	The Liberals are trying to ignore the original charge of seditious 
and offensive behaviour. Let us talk about that for a moment. There 
have been accusations in the House that I have prejudged, 
convicted the hon. member for Charlesbourg. There is nothing 
further from the truth. In my remarks when I introduced the motion 
I said this was to be an opportunity for the member to have his day 
in court, for due process to take place.
<P>
	If we go outside these hallowed halls and talk to the police, the 
first thing that must happen when a crime is committed and there is 
a suspect is that a charge must be laid. That is what I did in the 
House. I laid a charge.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	How can we be certain the Liberals will investigate the specific 
spirit of what my motion intends to do? We cannot. Once again the 
Liberals are worried about the politics of this thing. They are so 
afraid of offending someone from Quebec that they are willing to 
abandon the possible criminal aspects of this matter and put 
politics first. They are seeking to once again pursue the mandate of 
the status quo. They are concerned only with what is politically 
correct.
<P>
	As Canadians how do we make our laws? How do we choose 
what is right and wrong in society? The answer is clear. The answer 
lies in what is morally acceptable to Canadians. That is what it is 
all about. It is about what is morally acceptable to Canadians, 
whether it be in the Criminal Code, whether it is a murder charge or 
stealing. That is where we draw the line in the sand. That is when 
we say if you step over this line you will be charged. That is what 
we are doing here. If that is not what the House is for, this place 
where we have come to represent our constituents, what are we 
doing here?
<P>
	My motion's intent is clear. It is aimed at the House to decide if 
what the hon. member for Charlesbourg did was over that line. That 
is what I was asking. The charge had to be laid because there is no 
way to proceed unless a charge is laid, as there is no way to proceed 
in a case outside these walls if a policeman comes across a crime 
and a suspect. Otherwise he would have no vehicle to make his 
charge.
<P>
	That is what I have done. I have used the vehicles and the 
resources available to a member of Parliament to bring this matter 
forward and debate it in the place it should be debated, the most 
open forum in Canada represented by every corner of the country, 
the Parliament of Canada, the highest court in the land. We should 
all be concerned with the integrity of the House. We should be 
trying to decide if what has been done is appropriate.
<P>
	Yesterday I offered to co-operate with all sides of the House to 
get to the bottom of this situation. I discovered the Liberals had the 
intent to gut my motion, to rip it apart, to pull the life out of it. At 
the hands of the Liberal whip my motion has been torn to shreds, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="691"> 691 </A></B>
<P>
which is a  shame for the House, a shame for the men and women in 
the Canadian Armed Forces and a shame for all Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians are not getting what they wanted here. Canadians 
wanted to draw that line to ensure that when there is a threat of 
secession again members of the Canadian Armed Forces do not get 
drawn into that debate.
<P>
	It is not the same as the post office, it is not the same as a crown 
corporation. Those people are not the same as that. Why? Because 
of the oath of allegiance they have sworn to their country and to lay 
down their lives if they have to for their country.
<P>
	I will shift to what the Liberal government has done with this 
matter. As a private member of Parliament on the opposition in the 
third party I took it upon myself to do something that should have 
been done right over there by the Liberal Government of Canada, 
which ignored the issue and did nothing. It says it did something.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence in many newspaper articles 
and many media interviews called this act outrageous, that 
Canadians should be outraged at this communiqué. He said it was 
inappropriate. He went so far as to say the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg should be removed as the official opposition defence 
critic. He also said that he would consult with the Minister of 
Justice. He said that he would consult with the judge advocate 
general of the Canadian Armed Forces. He did that and we heard no 
more.
<P>
	What did we hear from the Minister of National Defence? We 
heard nothing. We heard not a word. Now the government says that 
the judge advocate general has issued a report. Canadians are 
waiting to hear what this report has to say and we are told: ``We are 
not going to tell you. We are simply not going to tell you what is in 
the report''.
<P>
	The judge advocate general wears two hats in this country. First 
and foremost his job is to administer the military justice system in 
Canada to make sure it operates properly. The second hat he wears 
is as legal adviser to the executive management team at the 
Department of National Defence and he is the legal adviser to the 
Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	That is why the judge advocate general cannot release the report 
he was asked to write. He is the lawyer for the Minister of National 
Defence. He would be betraying a confidence if he did. The 
Canadian people are out of luck because of this situation with the 
judge advocate general.
<P>
	It is a sad situation. Canadians would naturally expect that if the 
judge advocate general felt there was no basis for a charge in this 
regard, then what is the problem with releasing the report? One 
would think there would be no problem at all and it would be 
natural to release the report saying that nothing has been found. I 
guess that will not be done unless considerable pressure is put on.
<P>
	I will go back for a moment to the issue of laying a charge. If for 
instance a police officer came upon a murder scene and he had a 
suspect, would he charge the suspect with murder or would he 
charge him with the misuse of a blunt instrument or the improper 
use of a pillow or a rock, or probably under this administration poor 
storage of a handgun? I would say that the charge would have to be 
murder. There may be other charges but the main charge would not 
be ignored. Only in this place is that done.
<P>
	I ask that each member of the House consider if the action of the 
member for Charlesbourg was offensive to himself or herself. 
People watching at home, Canadians, ask yourselves the same 
question. Then each member of this House should do the right 
thing and vote against the amendment the government has put 
forward and endorse my motion as originally placed before the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, yesterday I stood in this House and chastised the 
Leader of the Opposition for what he said in his response to the 
issue before the House. His approach was unreasonable. What he 
said was factually incorrect and I indicated that. Today I am 
unfortunately forced to do the same thing, except that what the 
member just did if anything is worse than what we heard yesterday.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The member has the gall to stand before us today and tell us that 
his motion is correct even though he knows there are factual 
inaccuracies in it. For instance, he states in the motion: ``inviting 
all francophone members of the Canadian Armed Forces'' and so 
on. I have read the press release and those words are not even in it 
and the member has privately indicated he knows those words are 
not in it. Yet today he is urging the House to adopt a motion which 
he knows is wrong. He is just as bad as the other guys, if not worse, 
because he knows what he is doing is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> What was in the press 
release?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The press release has been read in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Read it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Hon. members know I do not like the press 
release. It should never have been done. The press release should 
never have been released by the hon. member. We know that. The 
Speaker has already ruled that there is a prima facie case of 
privilege and the issue could be sent to the parliamentary 
committee with the appropriate motion, but what happened? 
Instead of moving the appropriate motion, the member chose to  
move the diatribe we have before us. Why did he move that diatribe 
instead of the usual motion?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="692"> 692 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Because the government would not act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Countless other issues have been sent to the 
committee on privilege. Never have I seen one with a motion like 
this. Only Reformers could take an issue that should otherwise 
work and manage to spoil it themselves.
<P>
	In the speeches of the hon. member and his leader yesterday, 
they indicated that they were prepared to sacrifice justice on the 
altar of Reform Party propaganda. I do not like what the Bloc 
Quebecois did in the press release but what the Reform Party is 
doing now is just as bad, if not worse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Where were you? You did nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member can heckle, as we would say in 
Glengarry, until the cows come home, but that will not change the 
facts. He began his speech earlier today claiming that he was an 
ordinary Canadian representing his constituents in this House. Well 
so am I.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not 
believe there is a quorum. I would ask you to check if there is a 
quorum.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There is a 
quorum in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I was just going to do a quick check procedurally 
of what would have happened to the hon. member's motion had we 
lost quorum.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Where is he now? He is gone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It could very well have been that the issue would 
have disappeared. I notice that the hon. member does not seem to 
be in a position at this point to move a motion for quorum. In any 
case, while he is being lambasted by his whip, I will continue my 
remarks.
<P>
	Let us get back to the motion before the House. What is before us 
is that a member of Parliament issued a certain press release. Some 
of the words in it are not to my liking and certainly not to the liking 
of the member who proposed that it was a prima facie case of 
privilege. Furthermore, there is a ruling by Mr. Speaker that there 
was a prima facie case of privilege. All of those things have been 
established.
<P>
	What is before us now is not to determine whether or not a prima 
facie case of privilege exists, that has been done. Mr. Speaker 
invited the hon. member to propose the usual motion to refer the 
matter to committee. Perhaps I should not use the word invited. He 
indicated that he was prepared to receive the usual motion. 
Technically I believe that is the appropriate term. The appropriate 
motion was never drafted. Instead a motion which has factual 
inaccuracies which the hon. member himself has recognized is 
before us.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	That motion also has in the recital, not in the preamble, a 
determination of guilt and that is wrong. Yesterday an amendment 
was proposed by my colleague to refer the issue to the committee 
in the usual manner, removing from the motion the declaration of 
guilt simply because it is inappropriate. Even if it were appropriate 
which it is not, this Chamber certainly is not a substitute for a court 
of law to handle criminal cases. That is an issue to be dealt with by 
a court of law.
<P>
	I see the hon. member is now in a position to call for quorum, if I 
can put it without referring to the presence or absence of hon. 
members, which I cannot refer to but if I could I would.
<P>
	The hon. member across the way is now indicating his 
procedural expertise by comparing the private members' ballot 
item under my name in reference to the hon. member for 
Lethbridge to this issue. I will explain that to him briefly so that he 
can understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London--Middlesex):</B> Go slowly, Don.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I will try to do that too.
<P>
	The issue in question, were it brought forward as a motion, 
which it is not under privilege and which I certainly could do and I 
still may, would then of course be the subject of debate in the 
House. The motion to refer the issue to the parliamentary 
committee happens later once the Speaker indicates he is prepared 
to receive the usual motion. The usual motion is a different thing. 
The hon. member can listen very attentively and we will explain all 
of this to him later.
<P>
	Let us get back to the issue before the House today. The issue is 
whether or not it is appropriate to make in the motion the 
affirmation with regard to guilt as stated by the honourable 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> You do not want to deal with the separatists but you 
want to deal with the hon. member for Lethbridge for doing his job.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Could we have 
a little order in this House please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I guess this is all part of the new 
way of doing politics.
<P>
	As I was indicating before I was so rudely interrupted by the 
member from across the way, the issue before the House is whether 
or not a motion as presently worded is acceptable. It is not. I have 
indicated the factual inaccuracies in the preamble and in terms of 
the recital there is also this affirmation of guilt on the part of 
someone. Now that is wrong procedurally. Procedurally it is not out 
of order, but it is still wrong to have it worded that way.
<P>
	Also, there is a reference to a criminal charge. This House will 
not, should not and I would argue will never handle issues 
involving criminal offences. That is for a  court of proper 
competence to decide. My opinion in this case were there such a 
charge, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="693"> 693 </A></B>
<P>
person would have to lay an information before a court of law, 
probably under provincial law in the province where the release in 
question was released, or if the press release was circulated in more 
than one province, in another province as well. Who knows. In any 
case, that is not before us today.
<P>
	What is before us today is not whether this House should 
transform itself into a criminal court. What we are dealing with is 
whether or not we should refer the matter in question to the 
parliamentary committee on procedure, privilege and election.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker will recall that on the first day we discussed the 
question of privilege I indicated that the task of the committee, on 
which I happen to have the honour to sit, is to deal with issues 
involving procedure and House affairs but also to deal with such 
things as privilege. It is used for that purpose occasionally but not 
very often.
<P>
	The last case I remember was in approximately 1992 when an 
issue was brought before that committee. To refresh the memory of 
the Speaker, it was a case where an individual had testified before a 
parliamentary committee and had used in her presentation a video 
which had been produced by the CBC.
<P>
	The CBC producer saw fit to phone the person and threaten her 
with a lawsuit because she had used the material without 
permission, as if that were necessary when appearing before a 
parliamentary committee. The Speaker ruled that it was a case of 
prima facie privilege and it was brought before the committee. That 
is the most recent case that I can remember.
<P>
	Although that case is quite different, this case would be brought 
before the parliamentary committee and things would be heard. 
What would the committee hear? It would hear a variety of things.
<P>
	I understand that the French and the English texts of the release 
are not even the same. There are differences in the way in which 
some words are expressed. As someone who knows something 
about both languages, I have read them both and I think they are 
different. The release is stronger in one language than in the other. I 
happen to think it is stronger in the English text than in the French 
one.
<P>
	The committee could deal with all of these things. It could hear 
witnesses, not as to whether or not a criminal offence has taken 
place, because that is not its job, but to determine whether or not 
the prima facie case of privilege referred to it is an offence to the 
House. That is the issue. I hate to put it so bluntly, but even 
Reformers can understand that. Let us send the issue to committee.
<P>
	It says in the motion that this issue should be referred to the 
committee, yet we have been debating that for two days. There
<P>
seems to be little interest in sending it to committee, even though 
that is what is sought.
<P>
	We, and I am speaking for my colleague the parliamentary 
secretary and I, have proposed an amendment which would remove 
the offensive words and restore the traditional form of such a 
motion. Guess what the Reform Party did? It introduced a new 
amendment, again alleging a criminal offence in the motion, even 
though it now knows that the committee will not hear such issue.
<P>
	How serious is this? Parliament is bigger than all of us. It was 
here long before I came, even though I have been in this building 
for a very long time. It will be here long after I go, long after the 
Reformers go and long after the Bloquistes go. What we owe to this 
place, to this institution and to this country is justice and not the 
kind of opportunism which we have been witnessing over the last 
two days.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
debate is very sad for Canadians, and it is very sad for Quebecers 
because it casts a glaring light on the lack of understanding of a 
major event that, ultimately, is the source of this conflict.
<P>
	That fact is that a different and distinct people held a referendum 
on October 30. The level of participation was 94 per cent, and the 
yes side lost by a very narrow margin.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	This referendum was held on the sovereignty of that people, but 
with an economic and political partnership with Canada.
<P>
	Quebecers are looking for a way out of the impasse, because it is 
impossible to settle the constitutional issue which has gone 
unresolved, despite its urgency, for more than 30 years. Almost 50 
per cent of Quebecers-and probably more than that today-know 
that no solution will come through minireforms inside Canada. I 
think a majority of Canadians also think this country needs 
courageous leadership to face the real facts.
<P>
	To shed a little light on the issue, let me tell the House that 
preparations by a sovereign Quebec to provide for its own defence, 
whatever form it may take, is included in the partnership proposal. 
It deals with Quebec's participation in NATO and NORAD as a 
full-fledged country. Debate on this issue has been going on for a 
long time.
<P>
	When I was a program adviser for the Parti Quebecois, I took 
part in seminars organized by academics and attended by federalist 
and even royalist professors from the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean, on the theme of sovereignty and defence. The issue has 
been discussed.  We had to deal with it in a responsible way then, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="694"> 694 </A></B>
<P>
and we still have to do so now. That is why we have seminars and 
discussions, and that is why questions are being asked too.
<P>
	During the referendum, Quebec soldiers and officers looked at 
what was happening and at survey results, and they wondered: 
``What will become of us?'' And some had reasons to worry. 
Learned scholars wrote newspaper articles where they said that as a 
sovereign state Quebec would need this or that kind of armed 
forces, this or that kind of a defence system, to meet its 
international obligations.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois, in its platform and in the information it 
released on sovereignty and the referendum itself, included details 
on this issue. The hon. member for Charlesbourg, critic for national 
defence, was asked what would happen to Quebecers the Canadian 
Armed Forces, what would happen to these Quebec soldiers and 
officers, would they still have a job, where, when and why.
<P>
	It was the natural, normal and responsible thing to do for him to 
say what he thought would happen and what he knew would 
happen. It never was our intention, our goal or our will, at least in 
any discussion I took part in, to ask these Quebec soldiers to switch 
allegiance before the results of the referendum were known, before 
we had the support of the majority of the population in Quebec.
<P>
	We were simply getting ready, and we acted in a very responsible 
way. We did it openly and publicly. We did not try to hide anything. 
We made it clear in all the documents that were made available. If 
this act seemed seditious, why was the issue not raised before?
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	It is totally incomprehensible and inconsistent, unless the goal 
here is not to reassure the population nor to tell the truth. It is 
totally inconsistent and illogical. It is absolutely dangerous, 
because it arouses strong feelings. It is absolutely dangerous, 
unless the goal is not to respect the people of Quebec and the 
democratic choices they make.
<P>
	The lesson to be learned, the bottom line here is that, even 
though we were elected on a platform that was widely known, this 
House does not accept that the people of Quebec is preparing 
openly and publicly for its own sovereignty.
<P>
	I deeply regret what I will not call Reform's motion but its call to 
intolerance, and a refusal to understand where things are now in 
Canada, as I have said before and will say again. And this may be 
more an expression of their indignation because they do not form 
the official opposition. But what kind of official opposition would 
they be? And what would they have to offer to Canadians? 
Understanding the situation in Quebec? Helping the country out of 
a situation that has significant  social, economic and political 
implications-and a situation we want to get out of, for our part? 
No.
<P>
	Maybe the sole purpose of this motion is to prepare for the next 
elections, which will surely be an excuse to go about badmouthing 
Quebecers and Quebec.
<P>
	This does not surprise me on the part of the Reform Party. I am 
disappointed but not surprised. What surprised me though and 
disappointed me even more was to see the Liberal Party, which is in 
power and is responsible for Canada's future, also give in to the 
temptation to badmouth Quebec.
<P>
	There is not even the shadow of a doubt that if the Liberal Party 
is voting today on this proposition, this means that, according to 
them, charges could be brought, since otherwise there would not be 
any investigation. Therefore, this means that the Liberal Party 
thinks that charges could be brought. They do not want charges to 
be pressed but by referring the matter to the committee, they are 
implying that some charges could be brought.
<P>
	It would seem that the government party also wants to badmouth 
Quebec, and to deny what is going on.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I deeply regret that it did not close the matter. If there had been 
the slightest doubt right after the referendum, would this great 
party have waited four months before raising such an important 
question which monopolizes the proceedings of the House at the 
present time?
<P>
	Would this great party then be unworthy of the public's trust? I 
believe that the Liberals, the party in power made a mistake. But 
when one has made a mistake, it is never too late to retract.
<P>
	I wish to inform you that we are all guilty of the member for 
Charlebourg's felony, his potential felony, according to the party in 
power. If, whatever means are used, you want us out of here, others 
will be elected with stronger majorities, other felons, because our 
only felony consisted in preparing democratically to have our own 
country, while thinking, of course, that Canadians would be sad. 
We understand that, but would they also democratically accept that 
Quebec become the master of its own destiny? Would they accept 
to negotiate a partnership, and to discuss, as Canada now does with 
the United States, the organization of the continent's defence?
<P>
	Yes, we need an army to organize our defence and take part in 
peace missions. We only acted in a responsible and normal manner 
in preparing Quebecers for that. If doing something responsible, 
normal and based on democracy, on the express condition of 
democracy, is a felony, if it is potentially seditious, then 
sovereignty itself is potentially seditious, democratic though it may 
be.
<P>
	This debate should at least allow us to show very clearly that we 
are the representatives of the Quebecers, Quebecers who seek to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="695"> 695 </A></B>
<P>
sovereign, who asked for arrangements but to no avail, who wish to 
maintain ties.
<P>
	The people of Quebec will never forego its identity. And if the 
members opposite cannot accept the fact that, as sovereignists 
members, we respect Canada-because we do-we respect this 
country because we want a country of our own and we want it to be 
respected. But, if they cannot accept the fact that we form a people, 
then the least one can say is that a vague, difficult and confused 
period is awaiting Canada.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We understand that the October 30 vote was a shock. It was for 
us too. And bear in mind that if it had been up to us, we would not 
be here today. We would rather be busy negotiating with Canada, 
finally getting ready to give our serious attention to the economic, 
social, political and cultural framework, to stability and the future, 
to problems important to everyone.
<P>
	I make an appeal. I know that I am speaking on behalf of all 
Quebecers. This Parliament must be able to accept the course of 
history. We are a people and we still seek our sovereignty. We will 
attain it; we will organize ourselves. We respect Canada, but we 
expect to be respected as a people. And any attempt to crush us, to 
stop us, to silence us, to broaden-as the Reform proposal 
does-just for us the meaning of sedition will take us well away 
from the primary responsibility of this Parliament, which has the 
weighty task of preparing the future, of understanding the 
situations, of understanding that this people will not disappear into 
thin air, of co-existing with them and of respecting them.
<P>
	It is my deep hope that this debate, instead of further adding to 
the misunderstanding, the anger and the intolerance, will at least 
give us an opportunity to say: ``There is no use wishing that we 
would disappear. You may get rid of us, but there will be others to 
take our place''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, in my 
remarks today I will make two basic points. I will look at the 
purpose of the motion before us and I will look at the implications 
of the motion in terms of the future.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mercier said very clearly it is the intent of 
the Bloc Quebecois to do everything in its power to move toward 
separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. It wants to do it under 
what it calls the democratic process and open discussion. That 
sounds fine as it is.
<P>
	However, we must look at the motion before us in that context, 
what we are doing specifically here today. We are leading as the 
Reform Party a debate on a question  put clearly before the House 
by my hon. colleague, the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. In his remarks he said: ``The 
question to be answered is whether the member is guilty of 
offending Parliament and in the opinion of the House is the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg guilty of sedition''.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	We ask that question and place it before this assembly so that 
bridge can be crossed. We all know another referendum in Quebec 
is in the waiting. It is there being considered and planned. We are in 
the period of calm before the storm. When will the storm occur? 
Maybe in June, maybe in September or possibly in early 1997.
<P>
	We also know that mixed in with that will most likely be a 
provincial election in Quebec. There will most likely be a federal 
election in Canada in the mix of that scenario.
<P>
	I believe before we move into the storm of elections, of 
pronouncements, of adversaries and partisanship we have a period 
of calm when we can consider some questions that will be raised at 
that time. We are raising one very important basic point here, the 
question of whether a member of the House put himself in a 
situation which took away from the privilege of other members or 
was offensive in his actions. We in the Reform Party believe those 
actions were offensive.
<P>
	The question of whether it is seditious should be considered by 
the committee on procedure and House affairs. If it is and the 
House rules and the law of the country do not deal with it 
appropriate, the committee of procedure and House affairs can 
make a recommendation on how to handle that specific situation in 
the future. Maybe related things will happen during a major 
discussion that will occur 6 to 12 months from now about the future 
of the boundaries of Canada.
<P>
	There are other question which have already been raised. They 
were raised in discussions during and prior to October 23, 1995. 
The deputy premier, Bernard Landry, contacted foreign diplomats 
in a bid to win support for immediate recognition of Quebec's 
sovereignty in the case of a yes vote.
<P>
	Premier Parizeau said the Quebec treasury and its pension fund 
would set aside billions of dollars in preparation to defend the 
currency of Quebec. The question is do they have a right to make 
those statements? Do they have a right to make those commitments 
within Canada? Are they acts of sedition? Other situations will 
occur in the same way with regard to boundaries, the use of 
currency, pensions and the debt of the country. There are many 
other situations that will be put on the table as we enter into this 
potential debate that lies ahead. We must consider those now.
<P>
	What happened in the situation before us today? The hon. 
member for Charlesbourg, with the approval of the Bloc Quebecois 
caucus, directed a communiqué to the  armed forces. It was not a 
knee-jerk reaction or something thought up in a few moments. The 
letter was well planned. It was part of the campaign and it was 
approved by a body recognized in Canada as the official 
opposition, a major part of this democratically elected Parliament 
of Canada. A major decision was made that they would send a 
communiqué to the armed forces urging them that if they wished to 
leave the Canadian army and defect to what would become a 
Quebec army, they could do so and they would be protected in 
doing that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="696"> 696 </A></B>
<P>
	What right did the member have to do that? We do not believe 
the member had the right. We believe the act was seemingly 
seditious. It was an act to break up Canada saying that our 
Canadian army could be eroded by what in a sense could be an 
enemy of our nation as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	What if some other country tried to do the very same thing? 
What if some country offshore of the North American continent 
said to our army personnel that they could leave and support 
another side of the argument. In case we were in a conflict, how 
would we view that kind of a situation? That would be totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	It is important that we cross the bridge and that this matter be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs and dealt with in haste. It should not be left on the table for 
a long period of time. I hope that early in this session, by the end of 
April or early May, we can deal with the matter in Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	Then the matter should come back to the House with a 
recommendation to clearly deal with this specific instance. Also I 
think that we should look at the broader questions that are implied 
by this specific matter. We will have to cross other roads and 
bridges as well in June of this year or September or possibly early 
into 1997.
<P>
	The committee to which we are referring this matter has a heavy 
and major responsibility in determining the future of this country 
and how we deal with some of these matters.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada has placed a discussion paper 
before Canadians. We talk of 20 terms and conditions that must be 
met. Then we are asking Canadians to add others that they think 
should be added to it.
<P>
	It is time to look at this question. A part of our country is going 
to leave. In this instance Quebec says it wants to leave Canada. If 
that happens, if a democratic vote takes place, what are the terms 
and conditions by which that separation should occur?
<P>
	The hon. member for Mercier said that Reform Party members 
are slowing up the process and are doing this for our own political 
gain with the discussion and setting out the 20 terms and 
conditions.
<P>
	Nothing could be further from the truth. That is absolutely not 
true. We believe that the matter in dispute must be dealt with, and 
hopefully settled by very democratic means. The terms and 
conditions by which those negotiations take place should be set out. 
It is incumbent on the Liberal government to do that. At the present 
time little has been said about terms and conditions. That says this 
problem is going to go away.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mercier in her comments a few moments 
ago said: ``It will not go away. If the current Bloc Quebecois 
members disappear and are not elected again to this body, there 
will be a new group somewhere that will fight for the cause of the 
separation of Quebec''. I am sure that is true. Some 30 per cent of 
the people in Quebec are very committed to separation no matter 
what the consequences are, economically, socially or politically. 
They want to push ahead to have their own boundaries and their 
protection for a culture that they feel will survive under those 
insulated conditions.
<P>
	From my own perspective I am not sure that can happen in this 
new world of technology and communication, this new world of 
openness both economically and socially. That is one of the reasons 
I cannot agree with the concept of separation even beyond the great 
argument of keeping Canada together because of the great future it 
holds.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The other argument that has been placed before us with regard to 
the hon. member who signed the communiqué on behalf of the 
leader of the official opposition, now the premier of Quebec, Mr. 
Bouchard, is whether in the motion we placed before the House 
asking whether sedition has occurred is imposing on his right to 
freedom of speech. What are the limits to freedom of speech within 
Parliament or within a country? Have we the right to speak of 
breaking our country apart without penalty or consequence?
<P>
	We elect people democratically. We argue issues. We agree on 
issues. I am sure this House would not agree if a vote were taken 
here for Quebec to leave. In that context, was the motivation of the 
hon. member proper? Could it be included in the definition of 
freedom of speech?
<P>
	He has said to the armed forces: ``If you want to leave, come 
with the Quebec army''. Is that not eroding the integrity of our 
country? Is there no penalty for that kind of thing? That is the key 
question which has to be answered.
<P>
	Every country must have rules to maintain its integrity. There are 
limits to what can be said and what actions can be taken. This was 
not only the spoken word of the hon. member; it was a request for 
action on the part of members of the armed forces to leave their 
employment to go to the Quebec army. It was a deliberate 
undermining of the integrity of our nation.
<P>
	Can we accept that? I do not think so. If we want to have 
tolerance and understanding of one another with regard to culture, 
ethnic identity, religious attitudes, social beliefs and a variety of 
ideologies where we work together and let all prevail as forces 
within our society, that is fine. However, when it comes to the point 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="697"> 697 </A></B>
<P>
where a group of people or a single individual takes away from the 
integrity or to intentionally erode it, can we accept that? What 
would our country be if we allowed its most extreme enemies to do 
that?
<P>
	Let us say, for example, that we were still in the cold war with 
Russia. Would we allow the Russians to come in and take over part 
of our army? Would we allow them to come over and take over part 
of our natural resources? Would we say: ``Fine. Go ahead and do it. 
It is no problem?'' What then would be the integrity of our 
country?
<P>
	There must be some kind of rules to protect what we are doing. 
That is why we are referencing this matter to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. It can look at the 
issues and rule clearly on them. There must be rules for this kind of 
behaviour. If the current rules were violated by the hon. member, 
then the member, on behalf of his caucus, must pay the 
consequences. That is the responsibility that the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg will have to take. I believe it is incumbent upon him 
to accept it in those terms.
<P>
	Where do we go from here? Parliament has the power to deal 
with the matter. It is clearly within the terms that are provided for 
us in Beauchesne. It is also provided in our House rules and orders.
<P>
	We should look at all aspects of the issue, not just the narrow 
aspect of the communiqué itself and whether it was a good 
document or a bad document or whether the member should not 
have sent it out. We can examine this matter, not only in the narrow 
context of the communiqué itself. We can examine whether the 
hon. member's actions constituted sedition. We can look at whether 
the rules of Parliament and the laws of our country are adequate 
enough to deal with these kinds of situations. We can look at other 
acts by members of this assembly which are not only a contempt 
for Parliament but an act of sedition.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We can look at a broad range of those things in committee and 
come back with a comprehensive report that will do our country 
proud and maintain the integrity of this nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we are 
looking at a case submitted to the House through a motion of the 
Reform Party. We are entitled to ask what is going on in this House.
<P>
	We are into our second day of debate on this issue and, 
meanwhile, important things are going on in Canada that should be 
dealt with, and the deficit continues to grow. In fact, during these 
two days, the deficit will have grown by $280 million. I think that 
we in this House would have many other things to consider rather 
than discuss a document that I would characterize as a job offer to 
Quebecers who now serve in the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	The motion brought forward by the Reform Party talks about 
francophone members of the armed forces. However, it is clear in 
the document that it is addressed to Quebecers. Last Monday night, 
in Montreal, the premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, met with 
representatives of the anglophone community and opened his arms 
to them. This document is in the same spirit. It is addressed to 
Quebecers, all Quebecers who are interested.
<P>
	I will take the document and review it with you because there are 
important things in it that have to be looked at.
<P>
	The document was translated in Canada's both official languages 
and members will remember that it was released on October 26 of 
last year, that is about four months ago. It has already been four 
months since the document was released, and thank God Canada is 
not governed by the Reformers because it took them four months to 
react on a document that, to me, is nothing more than a job offer.
<P>
	I would like to look at certain parts of the document with you and 
make some comments. On page 2, it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Jacob believes that Quebec needs a defence force, especially to watch 
over and intervene on its territory-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This refers to the territory of Quebec which, on October 26, was 
a would-be country. For those who do not remember, the 
referendum was held on October 30. The member said in his 
document that we would have to develop certain policies. There is 
nothing in it that says that members of the armed forces should vote 
yes in the referendum. In his document, the member never incited 
Quebecers who serve in the armed forces to anything. The 
document was released in Quebec. Nowhere in it does the member 
ask members of the armed forces to vote yes in the referendum.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	You know, we can imagine that people were talking about 
politics on the military bases around October 25 and 26, because 
soldiers do have the vote. They have the right to vote and they have 
the right to be informed about what is going on. There was a 
referendum going on. I think that the Reform Party does not know 
what a referendum is and did not know what the last one meant for 
the future.
<P>
	Had the referendum been won, Quebec would be on its way to 
becoming a sovereign country. During the  referendum campaign, 
we proposed a partnership with the rest of Canada and, of course, it 
was clearly stated that after one year of discussions with the rest of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="698"> 698 </A></B>
<P>
Canada, Quebec would have been entitled to declare itself a 
sovereign country.
<P>
	What would have done Canada with its extra soldiers? I sit on 
the national defence committee and right now, we are studying 
ways to downsize. We are reducing the number of soldiers in the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Quebec contributes about 24 per cent of the national defence 
budget. However, we do not get that share in defence spending, we 
receive a lot less. At that time, I think it was normal for the Bloc 
Quebecois' critic-the hon. member for Charlesbourg was and still 
is the Bloc's critic-to set out the facts and to inform Quebecers 
who are members of the Canadian Armed Forces of what would 
happen if, and only if, the yes side were to win. He did not say in 
his communiqué that the yes side was going to win, he did not ask 
them to vote yes, he only told them that should the yes side win, 
Quebec would create its own army and that it would only be normal 
for trained soldiers who wanted to to join the Quebec army.
<P>
	If some soldiers want to stay in the Canadian forces after a yes 
win, they can do so. I can hardly believe that we are discussing this 
motion today. When interviewed on the subject, the Reform Party 
defence critic at the time, the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands, in British Columbia, said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``But Reform MP Jack Frazer said: `Jacob's press release has 
been misinterpreted. I don't think this can be considered inciting 
mutiny', said Frazer. `We have to accept that in the Canadian forces 
right now are some people who were in favour of separation. From 
a Canadian point of view they'd have to relinquish their 
commitment to us and swear allegiance to Quebec. Had there been 
a separation this would have happened'''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The member who said that was in the air force for several years. 
He is a colleague for whom I have great respect. He said that on 
November 4, in other words after the referendum and after this 
statement, and I think that the member was quite right to say what 
he said.
<P>
	You see, the Reformers perhaps think that when Quebecers hold 
a referendum on Quebec's sovereignty, it is just so we can try to 
negotiate a little bit more for ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	But that is no longer it at all. Take my own case and that of most 
of my colleagues. We were born in Canada, I was a Canadian and 
still am, I was Canadian to the core, I grew up in this country. Even 
at a concert, as one of the Petits Chanteurs de Granby, I sang O 
Canada. That was meaningful for me at the time. Now I am older 
and wiser.
<P>
	In the first referendum held in Quebec I voted yes. At the time I 
wanted to give my premier, René Lévesque, negotiating power. At 
the time, I believed that it was perhaps still possible for Quebec to 
survive as a people, as an entity, within this country. I continued to 
reflect on the question. I came to the realization, and I still believe, 
that this is no longer possible.
<P>
	There are two countries within this country. That is what must be 
understood. When he made his statement, the member for 
Charlesbourg was perfectly within his rights. We were in a 
referendum period. It was important at that time for us to inform 
people, to explain things.
<P>
	If I may be permitted, I have here a document that summarizes 
the various positions, militarily speaking, of a sovereign Quebec. 
You will understand that these documents were prepared before the 
referendum. It is normal, in preparing for an important event, to 
have documents.
<P>
	One part of this document, which is a document drafted by the 
Bloc Quebecois, says: ``Without necessarily creating large armed 
forces, Quebec could nevertheless adopt a coherent defence policy 
suited to its needs''.
<P>
	I am a member of the Canadian national defence committee. It is 
the same thing there. We try to have a defence policy suited to our 
needs and aspirations. If one takes a closer look, the vote of our 
young soldiers on and around bases, because those in Quebec did 
vote in the last referendum, is comparable to the vote in other 
areas. Actually, there are people in the armed forces who are 
inclined to vote yes to a referendum. Not all of them are 
sovereignists, but there are some among them. I would say there 
are as many there as in other groups in society.
<P>
	This does not mean they are traitors, far from it. They have 
sworn an oath and they stand by it as we speak. They carry out the 
duties assigned to them, and they do it well.
<P>
	They do their job well and very often they have to fight to 
preserve their language and their culture. Francophones who are in 
the Canadian Forces have to fight on a daily basis to speak their 
language.
<P>
	The hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Meritt, the 
author of this motion, seemed to believe and appeared to say that 
there is total and perfect bilingualism in the Canadian Armed 
Forces. I have here a quote from this member. In 1994, there was a 
reform, and suggestions were made to the government. A joint 
committee of the House and Senate travelled all around Canada to 
see what had to be done and then made recommendations to the 
government.
<P>
	Now, the member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt was 
very frustrated during his visit to Quebec. I have a document here 
saying ``French only briefing angers MP'', a press clipping of the 
time, dated May 8, 1994. The hon. member for  Okanagan was 
frustrated because the briefing at a Quebec base was in French. 
This frustrated the poor man since he does not understand 
French--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="699"> 699 </A></B>
<P>
there was interpretation into English-he felt frustrated. So the 
hon. member says:
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The English speaking committee members were provided with 
translators who translated while the briefing was going on, but for 
Hart that was small consolation. You can bet that if the situation 
were reversed there would have been screams of outrage''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I toured the country and, as you know, in several places we 
accepted briefings by members of the Armed Forces who did not 
speak French, yet that did not frustrate us in the least. On the 
contrary, it was no surprise at all.
<P>
	I do not mean to say that efforts are not being made, for they are, 
but one needs to be consistent when making statements in this 
House. At that time, the hon. member was surprised to hear French 
being used in the Armed Forces, and surprised that it was used to 
address guests on a francophone base in Quebec. That surprised 
him. Probably he was not familiar with the Official Languages Act 
at that time, since he was a new member.
<P>
	I think it is important to tell it like it is. Quebec, if it becomes 
sovereign, has set itself some objectives, which I shall read because 
they are so close to what we are hearing here: ``To ensure that 
Quebec's commitment to the installation of a lasting peace and the 
recognition of international law as the basis of relationships 
between the nations will be translated into concrete actions 
subscribed to by all the people of Quebec''.
<P>
	It was also stated that ``a sovereign Quebec will make concrete 
commitments in this regard, and these will be given priority once 
the post-independence transition period is over-and will oppose 
any use of force as a solution to disputes between nations''-I 
believe that is to be expected, here in Canada-``will seek active 
membership in the United Nations Organization; will seek to 
become an active member of the Organization of American States, 
the OAS, and work with it in building; will seek to be part of the 
UN peacekeeping forces''-according to our means, Madam 
Speaker-``and to maintain its commitment to the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, NATO, NORAD''. And so on.
<P>
	There is therefore absolutely no doubt that the document which 
is the subject of the Reform Party's motion was what I would call a 
job offer. Its aim was to provide some security to people in the 
Canadian armed forces-young Quebecers who are in the Canadian 
forces-and let them know that, if Quebec became  sovereign, they 
would have a place in the forces, a career in the Quebec armed 
forces.
<P>
	This is why I ask you to consider this document for what it is, a 
job offer and an update.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a privilege to speak to this motion. Unfortunately because of 
the government's actions on limiting debate not all members of the 
House will be permitted to speak to what the Chair has ruled to be 
the most serious issue ever brought before the 35th Parliament. 
That is a shame and the Liberal government which brought forward 
the closure motion should rightly be ashamed. The people who are 
watching the debate can see the Liberal actions for what they are, 
which is an attempt to squelch honest debate on the topic.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I believe I am allowed to say that in the debate Liberal and Bloc 
members have been very economical with the truth. They have not 
been willing to deal with the crux of the original motion. The chair 
has ruled that it is a prima facie case of privilege which should be 
brought before Parliament and that every member should have a 
chance to debate it. They have not been willing to deal with the 
motion.
<P>
	Just so that people will know, the Liberals have eliminated every 
word before the word ``that'' in the original motion, and every 
word after the word ``that'' from the motion of the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. In other words they have 
completely emasculated the motion and left it meaningless at this 
stage. As I argued in my address, the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs can do almost nothing with what is 
left.
<P>
	Canada's Parliament is really Canada's heart. It is one of its most 
vital organs and the life and direction of the entire country is or 
should be represented here in the House. I know we are dealing 
with the amendment but the original motion after the preamble 
read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, this action by the Honourable Member for 
Charlesbourg, and the then Leader of the Official Opposition should be viewed 
as seditious and offensive to this House and constitutes a contempt of 
Parliament; and consequently, the House refer the matter to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for examination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Parliament is like a living organism that can tolerate all kinds of 
trials and body blows and many kinds of disease. However when 
something strikes at the very heart with an intention to undercut its 
authority, then Parliament must react like any other organism. It 
must move to defend itself.
<P>
	There may be disagreements, even strong disagreements in the 
House among members of different parties. We all accept that as 
part of a healthy debate. They are the growing pains of a healthy, 
vital society.  However, when it becomes the purpose of one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="700"> 700 </A></B>
<P>
member inside the House to strike right to the heart of this 
institution and then to abuse the privileges of the House in order to 
do it, then the House must react to that. It must deal with that 
member just as a person would fight back against somebody who is 
striking at their heart. This charge is different from other more 
political charges. This is far more serious.
<P>
	It was agreed by the Chair that our original motion was designed 
to make the matter clear and to bring the issue to a head, to say that 
this is not just a discussion of political expediency or desire for one 
member to put forward a political agenda. It was designed to bring 
forward the case that this could be seditious and that the House may 
wish to view it as seditious when we had a chance to review it and 
send it off to committee.
<P>
	I will go through a few of the logical questions which spring 
from the original motion about what the member for Charlesbourg 
said and what was done. Allow me to quote from his controversial 
news release. ``A sovereign Quebec will have need of all 
Quebecers now serving in the Canadian Armed Forces. Quebec 
needs a defence force to watch over and intervene on its territory, to 
participate on foreign peace missions and to respond to local needs. 
Quebec will have need of all Quebecers presently enlisted in the 
armed forces. The day after a yes win, Quebec should immediately 
create a department of defence, the embryo of a major state, and 
offer all Quebecers serving in the Canadian forces the chance to 
integrate into the Quebec forces while keeping their rank, seniority 
and retirement funds''.
<P>
	The intent of the document is clear, but what things in it and in 
the actions could one consider as to whether it is seditious or not? I 
will put forward a few ideas.
<P>
	First, the timing of the release of the document would be all 
important. In other words, it would show that the document was not 
a joke and not idle chatter, that it was not simply arrogant boasting. 
Its release would have to be timed to have maximum impact. This 
timing would show the true motive of the writer. This document 
would be released to maximize its impact against the state and to 
maximize the probability of the military actually deserting the 
Canadian Armed Forces and supporting a new regime.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	In this regard the hon. member for Charlesbourg sent his 
document to the armed forces bases on October 26, just a few days 
before the critical October 30 referendum. It was a time when 
excitement among separatists was nearing a fever pitch and it was 
an explosive week in the history of Canada and Quebec. There 
could be no better time to appeal to the sentiment of separatists 
within the armed forces than just a few days before a potential 
victory result at the polls in Quebec.
<P>
	The second consideration should be that of authority. If the hon. 
member was not from a recognized party, if he had been an 
independent member and did not have a widely recognized 
influence, it would have had perhaps less authority and power 
within the House of Commons. In that case a press release urging 
sedition would be taken less seriously in one sense because of 
where it came from.
<P>
	However, the hon. member is a member of the official 
opposition. He stood arm in arm with 52 other members at the time, 
having as their sole purpose the removal of Quebec from 
Confederation. This is already a formidable challenge to the House 
and the member's intention was in line with the intent of all the 
other members of that party.
<P>
	I remind the House that the hon. member is the defence critic for 
the Bloc Quebecois. As such he has a special stature in the House 
and a special obligation in question period and standing 
committees. He has a research budget to back him up and he has all 
the privileges accorded to an opposition critic.
<P>
	I remind hon. members that the hon. member for Charlesbourg is 
a member of the Standing Committee on National Defence. As a 
matter of fact he was the vice-chairman of the standing committee 
on defence, the voice for the Bloc Quebecois to the Canadian 
Armed Forces. He is the voice of the Bloc to all Canadians on the 
military policy of the separatist movement.
<P>
	Membership means he has access to privileged information, 
inside knowledge, an inside chance to tour facilities which 
acquaints him with the strengths and weaknesses of Canada's 
military establishment. Membership on the defence committee also 
allows him the opportunity to meet the most important people 
within the Canadian Armed Forces, and potentially to get to know, 
and even if he wished, to plant the seeds of separatism within 
Canada's own defence establishment.
<P>
	It is a special affront to this House and to every Canadian that a 
member might have used his position of privilege and perhaps even 
privileged military information given to him by this House in an 
attempt to turn the military establishment against the very heart of 
our country.
<P>
	It is interesting that the hon. member said that the day after a yes 
vote Quebec would have its own department of defence. Who 
would staff the headquarters of this Quebec national defence 
establishment? Who would be the one to direct the armed forces? 
How would it be set up? The only people who have that expertise in 
Canada are now working for the Canadian Armed Forces. Was 
there another communiqué that went out that was actually 
addressed to the senior management that said: ``Let us get this 
rolling and get the armed forces organized tomorrow''?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="701"> 701 </A></B>
<P>
	Another important indication of the writer's motive was the 
letterhead he used. It was the letterhead of the Leader of the 
Opposition, not even the member's own letterhead. The leader at 
that time was Mr. Lucien Bouchard, a name very well known and 
respected in Quebec. He has gone on to become the premier of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The use of the leader's letterhead added legitimacy and political 
weight. It added the tremendous asset of public recognition of the 
person sending the communiqué. It was much more likely to have 
an effect on the French speaking armed forces personnel than if the 
release had been written on the member's own letterhead.
<P>
	Where the appeal was directed is also relevant. It was not sent 
willy-nilly to all armed forces personnel in Canada. It was targeted 
toward certain people for maximum impact. It was sent to 
francophone forces in Bosnia and to the military school in 
Kingston where a large number of people from Quebec are in 
training.
<P>
	This was not just a useless appeal to sentiment. It was a strong 
appeal, complete with salaries, seniority and benefit arrangements 
carefully crafted to appeal strongly and to encourage nationalist 
sentiment. It was written to succeed in its purpose and had the 
federalist cause failed in the referendum, it may have worked 
indeed. Who knows what disastrous consequences could have 
befallen the Canadian Armed Forces and the people of Canada 
because of it?
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I note the member's release urged potential recruits to the 
Quebec army to be prepared to intervene on its territory. I do not 
know what that means but intervening on the territory when it is not 
even its own country yet is a very scary proposition.
<P>
	This release was carefully timed, authoritatively drafted and sent 
to the people most likely to defect. The former leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois did everything short of actually signing the document 
himself. Why did he not sign that document? It was on his 
letterhead. It was being sent in order to recruit an army for his own 
purposes. I would say he did not sign it because he knew what was 
likely to happen. He was likely to be called on the carpet for 
sedition. He let his flunkey from Charlesbourg sign it for him.
<P>
	That is exactly what happened. It was on his letterhead and he 
would not even sign it. He should have signed it himself. If he had 
the guts to bring it forward, he could have at least put his signature 
to it. He did not do it because he knew we would be debating it in 
the House and he would have to face the Reform Party even if he 
did not have to face the weak-kneed Liberals across the way.
<P>
	We have moved to have this matter referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for examination. We 
have made a charge and we want the  committee to examine it. This 
is a legal process that should be used in the House of Commons. 
Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 28 refers to a Speaker's ruling 
from 1959. It tells us about the process. It states in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Members of the House of Commons, like all other citizens, have the right to 
be regarded as innocent until they are found guilty, and like other citizens they 
must be charged before they are obliged to stand trial in the courts. Parliament is 
a court with respect to its own privileges and dignity and the privileges of its 
Members.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Parliament is a court. First the charge comes. Next is the 
consideration of the charge. That brings me to the amendment 
moved by the Liberal government, one that would totally 
emasculate the Reform Party motion.
<P>
	Suppose somebody robs a bank. The person is caught and they 
would like to bring charges. What do they do? Do they come 
forward and say they would like to charge that money is missing 
and they would like to get together and talk about it? Of course not. 
They would bring forward the evidence, determine it is a prima 
facie case, and then charge the individual with bank robbery.
<P>
	In this case we would charge the member with sedition. We have 
to charge him with something. We cannot suggest that we get 
together to shoot the breeze. We have to charge him with something 
and we had. We had charged him until the Liberals completely 
neutered the motion by taking out all the words before ``that'' and 
all the words after ``that''. They will just say that is that and talk 
about it in committee.
<P>
	Mark my words, this matter will go to committee and it will be 
lost and gone forever. The way to eliminate it is to bring it forward, 
send it to never never land where the committee can use every 
procedural gong show effort in order to make sure it never sees the 
light of day again.
<P>
	This matter should have been discussed in the House of 
Commons. Closure should not have been invoked. We should have 
been here as long as it took to discuss the issue to its conclusion.
<P>
	It is not without precedence in this House that the Liberals are 
afraid to tackle these difficult issues. We just went through the 
motions of electing vice-chairmen for committees. In talking to 
Liberal members afterward they would say: ``I am sorry. I hated to 
do it but I had to vote for the Bloc Quebecois as chairman. Why? 
Because the whip told me to''.
<P>
	My mother used to say: ``If they told you to run and jump off a 
cliff would you do it?'' I sometimes wonder if we would have a 
lemming stampede on that side of the House if the whip ever said 
the wrong words. They would all go charging off into the Ottawa 
River or would drown in the canal. We are facing the attitude all the 
time where they do not want to deal with the difficult issues.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Year after year, this being the third year running, we are faced 
with a separatist vice-chairman on the Canadian citizenship
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="702"> 702 </A></B>
<P>
committee. The vice-chairman of the Canadian heritage committee 
will be a separatist. That makes sense. It does not make sense when 
we get out of this town. I hope the members opposite realize when 
they talk to their constituents back home that this kind of stuff is 
not selling people. They should be dealing with these issues rather 
than sweeping them under the carpet.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister was in Vancouver he said: ``The Bloc 
makes my blood boil. I would like to see it out of there. I would like 
to see the Reform leader sitting in the official opposition seat''. 
What does he say when he is in Ottawa or, worse yet, when he goes 
back home to where he was elected? He says: ``You know, I did not 
really mean it. I am just musing and I do not want to talk about it''. 
In one end of the country he says one thing and in the other end of 
the country he says another. It has been in the papers and people in 
B.C. have heard it time and again. They are sick of it.
<P>
	The Liberals will not deal with the issue. I should give them my 
annual truth is stranger than fiction award. It could be a daily award 
in this place because the people on the government side will not 
deal with any of the substantive issues that should be dealt with 
both on procedure and on issues of national unity. Their idea of a 
national unity campaign is a concerted effort to give out flags. I 
like the Canadian flag, but to think that is their total national unity 
plan is enough to make me gag.
<P>
	What about the seriousness of the charge we brought forward on 
the sedition issue? What kind of a military would Quebec people 
have access to on their own soil? There is no shortage of assets in 
Quebec. The Royal 22nd Regiment is based at Valcartier. There are 
two CF-18 squadrons which fly 37 planes. There are another 22 
CF-18s mothballed in the Montreal area. About half of the most 
useful part of our air force is in Montreal. There are certainly 
makings of a very significant military force within Quebec.
<P>
	Many of our naval units are manned by our very capable 
francophone crews. Four of the twelve new coastal defence ships 
being built by the navy will be stationed at Quebec City. There is a 
$100 million supply depot full of military hardware, the biggest in 
Canada, located in Quebec. There is certainly a significant military 
presence there. In other words, it is not an idle threat. The 
separatists could build an army if they could get the people and the 
assets of the Canadian Armed Forces quickly.
<P>
	General MacKenzie said about this issue: ``Only in Canada 
could you get away with something like this. In some countries 
people would be executed or waiting in jail. In Canada the attitude 
is ignored and maybe it will go away. I am absolutely amazed that 
it died with a whimper rather than a bang. If I was commanding the 
army when that communiqué came out I would not do anything 
with it other than get a hard copy, get in a plane, parade myself into 
the minister's office and say  this is well beyond the military's 
capability to deal with. This is a serious national issue''.
<P>
	This is a serious issue which deserves serious national debate. 
Unfortunately it is typical of the government to want to sweep it 
aside and not talk about it because it might ruffle some feathers.
<P>
	If the Liberal government does not let this charge go to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs it will prove 
that it is not standing in defence of the country. It will say to loyal 
Canadians working in the Canadian Armed Forces: ``We are 
satisfied to just hope this thing does not happen again. We will not 
set any rules to make sure it does not happen again. We will not 
instruct our military personnel on how to deal with this in the 
future. We will not tell the House of Commons how we will deal 
with members who choose to use the privileges of the House to put 
forward their own seditious ideas. We will continue to ignore it and 
hope it goes away''. It is this same policy that brought us this close 
to losing the last referendum vote in Quebec.
<P>
	We cannot ignore this thing and hope it goes away. It must be 
dealt with in whatever method the House decides is necessary and 
then move on.
<P>
	I call on all members of the House to defeat the amendment put 
forward by the government and bring back the amendment brought 
forward by my hon. colleague from 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The communiqué we are discussing today is a challenge to the 
heart of the country. It is a challenge to this position in Parliament 
and it is a challenge to every member here to do the right thing and 
vote in favour of the original motion and defeat the amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> You know, Madam 
Speaker, I do not think I will ever get used to the incredibly large 
number of senseless and implausible comments uttered by Reform 
members every day. But I will admit that, in the last three days, 
they have really outdone themselves.
<P>
	They hijacked a procedure outlined in the Standing Orders of the 
House of Commons to make a mockery of Parliament. This is 
unfortunate, since the serious accusations against my colleague 
from Charlesbourg called for a more serious debate on this. But, for 
the last three days, our friends in the Reform Party have turned this 
into a circus. They are using this excuse to put the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg, the former leader of the Bloc Quebecois, and the 
Bloc Quebecois itself on trial, going as far as questioning the 
legitimacy of our presence in this House. I would remind my 
colleagues from the Reform Party that we were duly elected by the 
voters in each of our ridings.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="703"> 703 </A></B>
<P>
	As I was saying, they hijacked a procedure of the House that 
has been used only three times so far. It was used once against 
Louis Riel and this, I think, speaks volumes. Louis Riel was 
suspended from this House; his right to sit in this House was 
suspended. Years later, under the last Conservative government, 
Louis Riel was recognized as one of Canada's founders. This 
shows a lack of consistency on the part of this House. Louis Riel, 
as you may recall, was charged with treason and hanged.
<P>
	However, in the case of my colleague from Charlesbourg, two 
criminal complaints against him have been dismissed. They were 
thrown out by the courts. Yesterday, the leader of the Reform Party 
himself came right out and said that there were no legal grounds for 
charging my colleague from Charlesbourg with sedition.
<P>
	Of what are they accusing him, if he is not guilty of sedition? As 
my colleague from Laurier-Sainte-Marie pointed out, are they 
simply accusing him for his views on certain things? Is having 
conflicting views a new offence in Canada? Has it become illegal 
to voice opinions that differ from those of the government majority 
or, hopefully, from those of our hon. friends seated to our left, 
whose ideas are nonetheless way off to the right?
<P>
	We have heard our friends form the Reform Party complain. For 
three days now, we have heard them whine because they are not the 
official opposition and because their members were not elected as 
vice-chairpersons of committees. They have been whining for three 
days. But if they want to take over as the official opposition, all 
they have to do is to defeat Bloc Quebecois candidates and Liberal 
candidates in the six byelections scheduled for March 25. They 
should come to Quebec and talk about sedition to Quebecers. They 
should come to Quebec and talk about partitioning. They should 
come to Quebec and talk about becoming the official opposition 
instead of trying to hide their game under the cover of an economic 
debate. They should come to Quebec and talk to us about all that; 
then we will see whether they can gain official opposition status.
<P>
	There are major issues being discussed in this Parliament, or at 
least that should be discussed in this Parliament, issues like the UI 
reform, for instance. There are people who need us to look at and 
discuss this reform in this House. Instead, the Reformers have led 
the House to neglect its proper business with this absolutely 
ridiculous motion.
<P>
	We should be debating the budget. They claim to be very 
concerned about financial matters. Yet, they do not want to talk 
about the budget; they would rather talk about sedition, although 
their leader actually admitted, as I said earlier, that there was no 
legal basis for charges of sedition.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	It is rather strange that they should choose this time, some four 
months after the facts and precisely during the debate on 
unemployment insurance reform and the debate on the budget, to 
bring
<P>
up the question of the so-called sedition of my colleague for 
Charlesbourg. What is unfortunate in all of this, is to find that our 
Liberal colleagues are going along with this disgraceful manoeuvre 
on the part of Reform members.
<P>
	The government whip told us: ``When something is poorly done, 
you replace it, you start all over again''. Thus, he recognizes that 
there was some basis to the motion; when something is poorly done 
you start all over again, of course, but when something is 
ridiculous, you simply ignore it. Yet, the government chose not to 
ignore it. It associated with the Reform members and is therefore 
guilty by association.
<P>
	Let us look at the communiqué from my colleague for 
Charlesbourg. He never called on military personnel to desert. He 
never called for rebellion or revolt. He simply stated that, should 
Quebec become sovereign, Quebecers presently serving in the 
Canadian armed forces would be offered the opportunity to join the 
Quebec armed forces. Is that a call to sedition, to rebellion or to 
desertion? Not at all, not in any way.
<P>
	In his communiqué, my colleague for Charlesbourg was talking 
about Quebec participating in peace missions, participating in 
NATO, recognizing therefore that Quebec would abide by its 
international commitments. He was talking about respect for 
democracy, respect for civil and human rights. Is that 
unacceptable? No. This is a very responsible behaviour on the part 
of the hon. member for Charlesbourg.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are motioning to me that my time is up-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Not at all, my dear colleague. You have 12 
minutes left. It being 2.00 p.m., however, we shall proceed to 
statements by members, and you will be the first speaker after 
question period.

	Over the break I lent my support to two Calgary families 
attending the parole hearing of a man who had sexually assaulted 
their children over a four-year period.
<P>
	The National Parole Board gave this predator of babies two 
hours of their time while the victims' parents could not utter a 
peep. Nonetheless, parole was denied. Until our laws are changed 
our children will not be safe.

	I believe in compassion, but that compassion must be tempered 
with responsibility. We have a responsibility to those who are 
victims, to those who cannot defend themselves. We have a 
responsibility to protect our children and to ensure they are free 
from threat.
<P>
	Making Canada safe for our children should be a priority of the

to develop a registry of sex offenders and pedophiles. For two years 
we have had no action. When will the solicitor general join in our

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the new 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services has inherited a 
real mess on the Hill.
<P>
	The architects who estimated the current Peace Tower repair 
project said it would cost $2.5 million. The companies that bid on it 
bid about half of that in order to win the job. Then job in hand, 
months later, they obtained a change order for an additional $1.2 
million, thus doubling the original bid and bringing the cost close 
to the original estimate.
<P>
	In the meantime, staff at the bidding companies harassed a 
female engineer, Anne Rainey, off the site. Ray Wolf and fellow 
masons walked off in protest. Yet in spite of a very clear, 
non-discriminatory clause in the contact from public works, the 
former minister took no action.
<P>
	The harassment appeared to have been condoned with the 
issuing of a subsequent further contract to the same offending 
companies to do further work on the tower and the House of

	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to inform my colleagues that Elliot Lake, Ontario in my riding of 
Algoma is now the home of the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame.
<P>
	Recently eight more Canadians were inducted into the Hall of 
Fame: Edmund Horne, Noah Timmins, William Wright, Donald 
Hogarth, Lloyd Pigeon, Joseph Hirshhorn, Paul Penna and Robert 
Haullbauer. They were selected for their accomplishments in 
exploration, mine development, technology or management and for 
their contributions to mining and to Canada.
<P>
	They span the history of the mining industry in our country 
which started in Bruce Mines, also in my riding, and which 
continued throughout Canada, including in Elliot Lake, once 
known as the world's uranium capital.
<P>
	We can all take pride in the accomplishments of these eight 
people and other pioneers that paved the way for the development 
and economic success of many Canadian mining communities. 
They remind us that mining is important to our past and deserves 
our support in the future.
<P>
	A special thanks to the Mining Association of Canada, to Fred 
Mann and to the city of Elliot Lake for their efforts in bringing the 
Hall of Fame to northern Ontario.

	The federal government has not contributed one penny to the

	Why would Ottawa not let provinces that are interested manage 
the program?
<P>
	Workers and employers pay over $18 billion annually for 
insurance, in case of a period of unemployment. In the current 
austerity context, it is unacceptable for the federal government to 
directly take money from that fund to make its books look good, 
while systematically dismantling the program.

<BLOCKQUOTE>I was delighted to learn that you are seeking input from Canadians on CPP

<BLOCKQUOTE>CPP should start at age 55, not 67 as you have suggested, and for citizens who 
have worked more than 6 years prior to 1994, CPP should start immediately the 
citizen quits, or is fired from a job.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CPP should be fully indexed, and I would be willing to pay higher premiums 
for this benefit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, I would also like someone else to contribute $4 for every dollar I 
contribute to CPP.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And Mr. Minister, please be sure to arrange for my pension to accrue at twice

	Recently the Toronto <I>Star</I> published an article on Haiti's slave

<P>
	The problem appears at first glance insurmountable, yet groups 
in my constituency such as Fergus' St. Andrew's HEARTS are 
helping to support a school, orphanage and feed program in Cap

misery.

	I was delighted to hear that Canada is supporting a global effort

the programs to adjust to children's needs. I encourage the 
Canadian government to look to the needs of the children of Haiti.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the end of a conference on interprovincial trade, 
ministers representing federal and provincial governments seemed 
to agree to open government procurement to Canadian businesses 
in general.
<P>
	The Quebec minister responsible for industry and commerce, 
Rita Dionne-Marsolais, puts a value of $100 billion a year on 
government procurement. According to the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce, 1.9 million jobs, 470,000 of them in Quebec, are 
directly related to this major market. The minister, who was 
obviously satisfied when she returned from the conference, thinks 
that, unless there are unexpected circumstances, the agreement will 
come into force in 1997.
<P>
	We are pleased to see that the Quebec government decided to 
take part in this conference and is ready to sign this agreement on 
the easing of interprovincial trade. That proves that Quebec has 
everything to gain from being a part of Canada.

two separate paths to a country where equality of natives and 
non-natives no longer applies.
<P>
	Bureaucrats and politicians have designed a compensation 
package for natives that is far too generous. Compensation should 
deal with loss of aboriginal interests as has already been 
determined by the courts and is limited to aboriginal rights to hunt, 
trap, fish and gather sustenance. It does not include interest in land 
or resources, or priority rights to engage in commercial activity.

Speaker, the U.S. legislation to punish Cuba and those who do 
business with Cuba is just another example of the inequity and 
inconsistency of the United States in such matters.
<P>
	The U.S. continues to carry out a policy to isolate and punish 
Cuba despite the fact that the cold war is over, the Soviet Union has 
ceased to exist and Cuba is in no way a military threat to the United 
States.
<P>
	How does the U.S. justify such a policy when at the same time it 
is cosying up to China and Vietnam, which are both communist 
countries and have much worse human rights records.
<P>
	The shooting down of the two U.S. planes was indeed a 
deplorable incident. Both sides claim to be right. Consequently, 
that is a matter for the International Court and not one for unilateral 
reprisals.

``Mr. Speaker, what is clear is that this does not fall under the

<P>
	On February 26, 1996, the Supreme Court of Canada clearly 
indicated that Indian bands cannot operate gambling places without 
obtaining a permit from the province or signing an agreement with

the Supreme Court of Canada that contradicts the Indian affairs

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SCIENCEANDTECHNOLOGY">SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has finally announced the creation of the 
technological fund promised over two years ago. It is about time. 
The government announced in the budget that $150 million will be 
available in 1996-97 to fund projects approved in the technology 
partnerships Canada program. There are some things the Minister 
of Industry did not say.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that the amount actually available 
to fund new projects in 1996-97 is $85 million and not $150 
million, since $65 million have already been committed to another 
program, the DIPP, focusing on defence industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know whether the hon. member saw this 
allegation in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> or whether he read a translation in 
another paper, but it is incorrect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the minister could explain what is 
``incorrect''. It would be interesting to hear what he says was 
``incorrect'' in what I have just said. We are prepared to listen.
<P>
	Will he ensure that the $150 million will go totally to funding 
new projects, and not to swelling figures by promising money that 
has already been committed by his government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, indeed, a portion of the funds announced had already been 
allocated for business under the old DIPP program. It amounts to 
very little.
<P>
	I think he will understand clearly that, under technology 
partnerships Canada and the projects we will support, the money 
committed to the business sector will not be spent for a long time. 
That is why businesses, particularly in Montreal, with experience 
in the aerospace and defence sectors, which have made use of the 
old DIPP program, firms such as Pratt &amp; Whitney, Bombardier, 
Spar and CAE gave the new program a warm welcome.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I think both he and his colleague, who frequently asked 
questions on defence conversion, will be very happy with the 
creation of this partnership program-which is not funding, but a 
partnership-not only in the aerospace and defence sectors, but in 
the environmental technology sectors as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, the minister said that it was incorrect. Then he 
acknowledges it. He has again just said it is true and that it amounts 
to very little. Sixty-five million dollars of a total of $150 million is 
about 40 per cent, which means very little to them. Interesting. In 
addition, the auditor general recommended in his report greater 
transparency in the government's science and technology 
activities.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that this recommendation was 
swept under the carpet, since the National Advisory Board on 
Science and Technology, which published public reports, was 
abolished and replaced by a single advisory board of 12 individuals 
appointed by the Prime Minister and reporting to the Prime 
Minister alone?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a very important question. The issue of the advice 
the government receives on science issues has been controversial.
<P>
	The former government cancelled the Science Council of 
Canada, which produced advice and wrote reports on science. The 
council the honourable member refers to, NABST, also was very 
good at writing reports. Some would say one of the things that 
science policy in Canada was very good at is writing reports.
<P>
	What we have proposed to do instead of focusing on writing 
reports is to create a very small council of the very best science 
minds in Canada who, instead of devoting their effort to writing 
reports, will be devoting their efforts to meeting with ministers on 
the economic development policy committee as well as providing 
advice directly to the Prime Minister so that those who make 
decisions are closely informed by the people who have the greatest 
stake in the outcome and can form therefore the best possible 
policy.
<P>
	This is an approach that is not oriented to writing reports. It is 
oriented instead to changing behaviour and changing the practice 
of government. I think the test will be in whether that proves to be 
the case. I invite the honourable member with the rest of the 
science community, which I am sure will continue to make sure we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="709"> 709 </A></B>
<P>
hear its opinions through all the media available, to  make sure we 
actually do see a change in behaviour as we shape the new science 
policy for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. For two years 
now, the defence industry has been lobbying the government to 
create a fund aimed at defence conversion, in order to save the 
10,000 jobs in that industry which are in jeopardy in Quebec. The 
people in charge of that new fund, which bears the name of 
Technology Partnerships Canada, inform us that this new program 
has no specific component dedicated solely to conversion.
<P>
	Can the Minister tell us whether his new program, Technology 
Partnerships Canada, will provide the necessary support to the 30 
Quebec firms in urgent need of government assistance to convert 
their industry?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is an area the member has worked very hard and 
constructively on for the last two years.
<P>
	The way we have structured this fund will certainly not enable 
me to say today that any funds are dedicated to any particular 
companies, nor that a certain proportion of the funds is dedicated to 
a certain industrial sector. We are doing some very different things 
in structuring this fund.
<P>
	For example, we will be creating a private sector advisory 
committee which will essentially play a role of enabling us to 
exercise some technology foresight in areas in which the 
government ought to be putting its resources. It will also provide us 
with a review mechanism on how the fund is being allocated 
among sectors; where is the greatest technology advantage for 
Canada.
<P>
	I am sure the honourable member would agree that if we could 
have more money for this fund we could find some very good ways 
to spend it.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	However, resources are tight and it is necessary to be very 
focused and strategic in the way resources are allocated. We will 
endeavour to do that. In doing so I can assure him there are two key 
red book commitments being fulfilled with this fund: to see to it 
that we do have a program for defence conversion and that we meet 
our requirements in order to fund environmental technology.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if there is a program for defence conversion, let  him state 
it clearly, for what it looks like from here is abandonment of the 
industries needing government assistance. I would ask him to recall 
that, in 1994, a financial report involving Industry Canada, the 
CSN, the FTQ, the City of Montreal, the Quebec department of 
industry and commerce, and the Montreal Urban Community 
assessed the figure for defence conversion at $55 million.
<P>
	Can the minister commit, in keeping with what he was 
demanding when in Opposition, to making these sums available for 
defence conversion, as recommended in a study funded by his very 
own department? Is that what consistency is?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is also needed for the strategy. What we need is to find 
better ways of spending funds that are very hard to come by in the 
present financial climate.
<P>
	I must also point out to this hon. member that in the defence 
sector, as he is well aware, since this government was elected 
virtually all funding under the DIPP fund has been earmarked for 
civilian applications. Second, I would remind him that it is 
essential for companies to make the changes necessary for access 
to new markets. Most companies, even in Quebec, have already 
done so. Even in Quebec, even in Montreal, where I spoke this 
morning to the Chamber of Commerce, they are prepared to find 
other business, in sectors outside defence, in order to receive 
assistance from Technology Partnerships Canada.

system failed, why innocent Canadians died and who is 
responsible.
<P>
	However, instead of celebrating Krever's success with the 
families, we are now involved with a government that wants to 
hold up this inquiry.
<P>
	What exactly is the reason behind this ham-handed political 
whitewash? What is the health minister afraid of? Why will he not 
simply put an end to the legal action, stop the political interference 
and let Krever speak?
<P>

there are adjectives to describe the question from the hon. member 
opposite.

<P>
	The premise of the hon. member's questions is false, as it has 
been on several occasions in the House. The hon. member is fully 
aware of the reasons the Government of Canada is in court. It is 
not attempting to block his eminent justice in terms of his 
findings. What it is attempting, based on what the Attorney 
General of Canada has said, because he has an obligation, is 
procedural fairness and the rules of natural justice.
<P>
	Furthermore, I do not think the hon. member opposite does 
himself, his party or indeed people across the country well by 
making such false allegations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister's 
attempt to change the focus of the Krever inquiry by his own 
tainted blood forum he says is comprehensive. The hepatitis C 
group was not invited. The Janet Connors group was not invited. 
The Canadian AIDS Society was not invited. Who is invited? His 
buddies, his friends. What a farce. It is a blatant attempt to divert 
public attention away from the fact that the government is trying to 
silence the inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	My question is very simple. Krever knows. Why not let Krever 
talk?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
slippery language will not help the hon. member opposite in terms 
of trying to define his particular case.
<P>
	The hon. member is fully aware and has known for quite some 
time that the Krever commission has made an interim report. 
Forty-three recommendations have been made, seven of which 
applied to Health Canada. We have acted on the substance as well 
as the spirit of those recommendations.
<P>
	We announced earlier this week that we would attempt to 
commence a consultation process with the provinces and all of the 
stakeholders.
<P>
	I am saddened to hear the hon. member opposite not only outside 
the House but on the floor of the House argue that we ought to be 
taking action. Now we are taking action but the hon. member is 
standing in his place trying to politicize a very serious issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us compare 
what happened in other jurisdictions.
<P>
	In Japan there is a brand new health minister. Immediately there 
was a public apology to those people in Japan affected by its tainted 
blood scandal. In France those responsible are in jail.
<P>
	What happens in Canada? We have legal wrangles. The 
government is not interested in the truth. The government is not 
holding those responsible accountable. The government is looking 
after its friends and subverting justice.
<P>
	Japan and France have put the Liberal government to shame. 
Will the health minister advise his justice colleague to stop the 
legal wrangling and let Justice Krever speak?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
three strikes and you are out. Once again the hon. member has 
falsified, has given misinformation as it relates to what is taking 
place. The hon. member knows fully what is taking place.
<P>
	The Attorney General of Canada has stated repeatedly that he 
has an obligation to ensure that inquiry has procedural fairness and 
that the rules of natural justice be adhered to.
<P>
	At no time has any member of this government, particularly the 
attorney general, the previous minister of health or I, ever indicated 
one iota that we are attempting to preclude or to prohibit Justice 
Krever from making his findings.
<P>
	The hon. member knows the truth. I wish he would speak it once 
in a while.

the Ontario side could meet the terms of the call for tender.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why a tender call is being issued with 
regard to offices located in Hull, when it is usually not the case for 
offices located in Ottawa, as illustrated by the following examples: 
191 Laurier street, where Revenue Canada is housed; 234 Laurier

Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	With the world holding its breath while China flexes its muscles 
off the coast of Taiwan, it appears that China is buying some 
military technology from Canada. Would the minister mind telling 
us just how far he is willing to see Canada or Canadian companies 
go in their efforts to sell technology to China, including military 
technology?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since 1993 the policy has been that ministerial approval 
would be on a case by case basis on any transfers or exports which 
were of a non-lethal, non-offensive kind.
<P>
	Just to show how careful our examination has been, I can report 
to the hon. member that in 1994 the total sum of sales of any kind 
of military equipment, which I believe were suits to allow people to 
fight fires, was all of $10,000.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no such thing as 
non-offensive military technology. The submarine detection 
equipment that has been purchased by the Chinese from a Canadian 
company hardly qualifies as clothing.
<P>
	There is a document marked ``Canadian eyes only'' which 
contains guidelines established by foreign affairs for expanding 
bilateral military relations with China. When were the most recent 
meetings between DND officials and representatives of the 
People's Liberation Army? Can the minister inform the House if 
the government is still interested in expanding its military relations 
with China at this time, given the current situation in the Middle 
East?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we might want to start with a little geography lesson first. 
The last I heard, China was in Asia. It may have moved in the last 
24 hours while I was on an aeroplane, but I hope not.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> If the Reform Party 
would like an answer, I would be more  than happy to give a serious 
response. I will leave discussions of caucus politics up to members 
of the Reform Party. They are good at it these days.
<P>
	If the hon. member had looked at the document which was 
released, it said that the purpose of the engagement was to develop 
relationships with the people's army in China and to begin 
discussing things like peacekeeping and regional security to 
provide a deterrent against the kinds of actions we are seeing today.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that policy is constantly being 
reviewed. If we felt that those actions were leading to any kind of 
serious offensive threat, then we would certainly be reviewing our 
policy.

wanted to inform him of the situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr.

Minister for International Trade is actively involved with the file; 
certainly the Prime Minister is actively involved with the file.

organizations in Canada have charitable status, or is this another 
example of tough talk but no action?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Yes, 
Mr. Speaker, I can confirm that members of my department have 
been in touch with members of the solicitor general's department 
and members of the foreign affairs department.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

the departmental people. I am talking about the people who are in 
the know, the RCMP and CSIS.
<P>
	Since its creation in 1984, CSIS has had a legislative definition 
that terrorism is any activity in support of serious violence against 
persons or property for the purpose of achieving a political 
objective. Since the House has already defined terrorism, I ask the 
solicitor general if this government is prepared to use this 
definition in its terrorist fundraising legislation, regardless of 
whether or not these same organizations may supposedly raise 
money for humanitarian purposes.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the definition my hon. friend has pointed to is in a statute passed by

am sure it will be very useful as we complete our work of updating

	After underfunding social housing in Quebec for the last seven

area.
<P>
	Since 1987, Quebec has never received more than 19 per cent of 
CMHC funding. For Quebec, the annual shortfall averages out to 
$122 million, for a total in excess of $854 million.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us if she intends to compensate for this 
withdrawal by transferring tax points, at least in the case of 
Quebec, which already assumes its responsibilities with respect to 
social housing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I would like is for 
Quebecers or for the hon. member to make up our minds. They are 
always asking us to transfer more responsibilities. Well, we say in 
the budget that we will transfer both the funds and the 
responsibilities to them. What more do you want?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the minister where the money is.
<P>
	Now that the federal government is withdrawing from social 
housing, we can conclude that the injustice done to Quebec, which 
was condemned at the time by the Quebec Liberals-as the hon. 
member for Saint-Henri-Westmount certainly remembers-will 
never be redressed.
<P>
	Since federal programs were never adapted to Quebec's specific 
needs and since Quebec has assumed its responsibilities in this area 
for a very long time, does the minister intend to continue imposing 
federal standards in social housing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

Quebec company that does not even own a shipyard. Halifax 
Shipyard submitted the lowest bid and the best technical bid. It was 
the shipyard recommended by the Department of National Defence

regional patronage above the interests of taxpaying Canadians.

	Could the minister of public works explain to this House why a

contract against the wishes of the Department of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

this country's other official language, public works awards 
contracts in a very open process.
<P>
	The contract was awarded to Fenco MacLaren. The headquarters 
for Fenco MacLaren Inc. are in Nepean and the last I heard, there is 
no shipyard in Nepean. The work will be carried out in Halifax and 
Vancouver as it should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Fenco MacLaren Inc. is a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of 
SNC-Lavalin which is in Quebec.
<P>
	We all remember the CF-18 contract. Then there was the 
Canadian Space Agency. Now we have this. Not surprisingly there 
are many unanswered questions regarding the awarding of this 
contract and this has brought the department's selection process 
under a great deal of scrutiny.
<P>
	The standing committee on government affairs is currently 
reviewing the contracting processes and procedures of the 
government. Does the minister support a review by the standing 
committee on government affairs of the awarding of this contract?

committees are masters of their own affairs. They are free to decide 
what they will and will not do. It is certainly not up to me or my 
department to interfere in that matter, only to co-operate.
<P>
	Speaking of Fenco MacLaren Inc. being partially owned by 
someone from Quebec, that just goes to show how well this country

the arena of trade.
<P>
	The United States has undertaken certain commitments to the 
new World Trade Organization with respect to other bilateral and 
regional trading agreements. The Government of Canada will be 
extraordinarily vigilant in ensuring that the United States and all of 
our other trading partners live up to the spirit and the letter of their 
obligations under those international agreements.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a difficult question for the government House 
leader: What is the legislative agenda for the next few days?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to provide details on the business of the 
House for the next few days. The hon. member's question 
undoubtedly has a very political ring to it today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Tomorrow shall be an opposition day. On Monday we intend to 
call the budget debate. Last week I indicated we would call the 
budget debate on Tuesday but if, as it now appears, we fail to reach 
Government Orders today, we will then have an opposition day on 
Tuesday. Wednesday shall also be an opposition day.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	On Thursday we intend to deal with legislation. I will consult my 
colleagues opposite on this early next week. However, I can tell the 
House now that the highest priorities are Bill C-3, the bill on 
collective bargaining in the nuclear power plant industry, Bill C-10, 
the borrowing authority bill and Bill C-14, the transportation bill.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, the amendment 
and the sub-amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Verchères has the floor. You 
have 12 minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
oral question period, I was saying that the communiqué released by 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg was very appropriate, since it 
points out a number of values that we share with our fellow 
Canadians, such as the will to take part in peacekeeping missions, 
to continue to be a member of NATO, to comply with the 
requirement of democracy, and to respect civil liberties and human 
rights.
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with that. The communiqué released by 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg simply says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The day after a yes win-</BLOCKQUOTE>
We have to be careful here. ``The day after a yes win'' does not 
mean the very next morning; what it really means is ``following a 
yes win'', Quebec would offer:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>all Quebecers serving in the Canadian Forces the chance to integrate into the 
Quebec forces-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I said, this can certainly not be interpreted as a call for 
desertion, rebellion or revolt. On the contrary, this communiqué 
merely sets the record straight regarding the defence policy of a 
sovereign Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="717"> 717 </A></B>
<P>
	The military do not live on another planet. They, like the rest 
of Quebecers, were around during the referendum campaign. Just 
like a number of federal public servants, they wondered about their 
future, if Quebec became a sovereign state.
<P>
	The purpose of the communiqué released by the hon. member 
for Charlesbourg was simply to ease the legitimate concerns and 
fears of Quebecers serving in the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	I also want to point out that the communiqué reads: ``-offer all 
Quebecers serving in the Canadian Forces''. It does not refer to 
``French speaking Quebecers serving in the Canadian Forces'', as 
claimed in the insidious Reform Party motion. The communiqué 
alludes to all Quebecers serving in the Canadian Forces.
<P>
	What brings Quebecers to join the Canadian Armed Forces? 
Some do it for adventure and travel. Others do it out of a deep sense 
of duty, because they are convinced that, some day, they may have 
to defend and protect our freedom, our democratic values, but also 
their property, their close friends, their families.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Where do you think is home for these Quebecers who decide to 
join the Canadian Armed Forces? Where do their close friends and 
family live? In Quebec, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	But in our current constitutional system, how can we defend our 
assets, our close friends and our families who live in Quebec? How 
can we defend Quebec, if not by joining the Canadian Armed 
Forces?
<P>
	Those who join the Canadian Armed Forces in order to be able to 
indirectly defend Quebec are not being disloyal towards Canada for 
all that. For them, being for Quebec does not necessarily mean 
being against Canada.
<P>
	I for one was an officer in the Canadian Armed Forces and I can 
tell you that I was honourably released from my commmission as 
lieutenant in the navy when I was elected. I did not quit the armed 
forces on principle or because I believed that I had to quit since I 
had been elected to the House of Commons as a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois. I quit because I felt I would no longer have the 
time to carry out my duties within the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	However, I was able to see that, within the Canadian Armed 
Forces, we have a sort of microcosm, a scaled-down version of 
Quebec society. There are as many sovereignists in the Canadian 
Armed Forces as there are federalists. And that is no reason to think 
that members of the Canadian Armed Forces who are sovereignists 
are therefore disloyal, or opposed to Canada, or that, as our Reform 
Party colleagues would have us believe, they might want to take up 
the arms provided to them by the Canadian Armed Forces and turn 
against Canada. That is utterly ridiculous.
<P>
	It is no secret to anyone that francophones in the Canadian 
Armed Forces have too often been downtrodden and discriminated 
against. Even today, we still hear older Canadians claiming that 
francophones did not want to fight in the second world war. Despite 
the betrayal in 1942 by the federal government, which, having 
promised not to do so, imposed conscription through a referendum, 
again leaving Quebec isolated from the rest of Canada, despite this 
betrayal, many Quebecers joined the Canadian forces of the time, 
the army, the navy and the air force, and fought in all theatres of 
operation.
<P>
	There were Quebecers in Hong Kong at the time of the terrible 
assault by the Japanese and some of them spent the rest of the war 
in internment camps.
<P>
	Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal were on the beaches at Dieppe. They 
were mowed down during the terrible assault in which the British, 
it was said, were ready to fight to the last drop of Canadian blood. 
Le Régiment de Maisonneuve was on the beaches of Normandy at 
the time of the landing. The 22nd regiment fought in the bloody 
battle of Monte Cassino, in Italy.
<P>
	Quebecers proved their loyalty to Canada as part of the Canadian 
forces. They have proven their loyalty all these years. This does not 
prevent some, many many in fact, from believing that Quebec 
should become sovereign some day. And, with Quebec's 
sovereignty, it should come as no surprise that these Quebecers 
would take the opportunity afforded them to join the Quebec armed 
forces, without any resentment, disdain or negative feelings toward 
Canada. There is nothing surprising in that.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Our friends in the Reform Party wanted to create a tempest in a 
teapot with this debate, which is totally unnecessary and 
inappropriate. As I pointed out at the start of the debate, they used, 
they appropriated the rules of the House of Commons to 
successfully divert the regular debates of this House in an effort to 
put the Bloc Quebecois and my colleague for Charlesbourg on trial.
<P>
	Once the members of the government have become the 
accomplices of the Reformers, when the vote comes up, the matter 
will probably be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs. There, God knows the treatment that will be 
given this ordinary communiqué by my colleague for 
Charlesbourg, which was simply to explain to our fellow 
Quebecers in the Canadian armed forces what the sovereignists had 
in mind on the subject of national defence and the possibility of 
their joining the ranks of the Canadian forces, in the event of 
sovereignty.
<P>
	What treatment awaits this communiqué? No rule has been 
established in this debate on its treatment. Will our colleague for 
Charlesbourg be hauled before this committee for some sort of 
trial? Will this be a remake of  the unfortunate Louis Riel episode? 
Except, of course, for the fact that my colleague from Charlesbourg 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="718"> 718 </A></B>
<P>
cannot be found guilty by the Canadian courts, since-as our 
colleague, the leader of the Reform Party, admitted-there are no 
legal grounds for criminal proceedings.
<P>
	But this committee will become a kind of kangaroo court, before 
which my colleague from Charlesbourg will probably have to 
appear to explain his actions and say that he simply wanted, as part 
of a democratic process, to inform our fellow citizens in the 
Canadian Forces of what the sovereignists had in mind for them.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable in a so-called democratic country 
like ours. However, when the leader of the Reform Party says that 
we in this House are defining a new form of sedition, I wonder if 
our colleague is not being tried for his opinions. In a democratic 
country like Canada, it is normal for us-in a debate, in a 
referendum-to tell all Quebecers, including those in the Canadian 
Forces, about the consequences of a yes win in the referendum.
<P>
	Our fellow citizens in Quebec needed to know about the possible 
consequences and benefits of a yes win in the referendum. Our 
vision is still alive. The very close vote recorded on October 30 
makes it very clear that the issue has not been settled yet and that 
we will eventually have to consult the people of Quebec once 
again. Mr. Speaker, you can be sure that, once again, we will show 
all our cards, as the government party is demanding, and that we 
will explain to all Quebecers, including those in the military, what 
we have in mind for them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address an issue of extreme importance, the motion which 
addresses contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	As an elected member of Parliament I take my job and this 
institution very seriously. An elected representative is just that, a 
person elected to represent their constituents. The government has 
forsaken this fundamental democratic principle for political 
expediency.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	It has been established that the hon. member for Charlesbourg, a 
member of the defence committee, released a communiqué on the 
letterhead of the office of the Leader of the Opposition on October 
26, 1995. It invited Quebec members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces to join the Quebec military in the event of a yes vote in the 
referendum.
<P>
	The original Reform motion called for a recognition that in the 
opinion of the House this action should be viewed as seditious, 
offensive and in contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	The issue is not only whether an action by the hon. member was 
offensive to the public. However, judging by the number of letters 
and phone calls I have received it certainly has been deemed to be 
offensive to the public. The issue is not even whether the action of 
the hon. member was seditious in the sense of sections 53, 59 or 62 
of the Criminal Code. Rather, the issue is whether in the opinion of 
the House the actions of the member should be viewed as being 
offensive and seditious in nature.
<P>
	By allowing the motion to proceed in its original form the House 
will not simply be determining whether a member should be 
disciplined for actions offensive to the House and to all Canadians, 
it will permit the House to consider through an examination by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs guidelines 
for all members in terms of what their constituents deem 
acceptable and unacceptable conduct with respect to urging 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces to break ranks and to join, 
in this case, the Quebec army.
<P>
	These guidelines will clarify for the record what is acceptable 
and unacceptable conduct. This will protect Bloc members, their 
constituents and their province as much as it will protect all other 
Canadians.
<P>
	Without such guidelines the door is wide open for future 
mistakes to occur. It is important to all of us to ensure the 
guidelines are as clearly as possible laid out in law.
<P>
	This is a difficult issue to deal with. The Liberal policy for 
making difficult decisions is not to make them. Its mantra of ignore 
and it will go away has not only shut out Canadians, it nearly cost 
us our country. Canadians expect their government to listen to their 
concerns and to take appropriate action. The government has 
proven time and again that it is not interested in the wishes of its 
electorate. It has followed its own mandate, many times in direct 
opposition to its constituents and the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	On this issue the actions of the hon. member for Charlesbourg, 
on Mr. Bouchard's letterhead, have been ignored. The hon. member 
for Charlesbourg sent a communiqué inviting Quebec born soldiers 
of the Canadian Armed Forces to break ranks and join the Quebec 
national militia. This act has been viewed as a contempt of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The issue of sedition has been raised. The courts have decided 
according to the Criminal Code of Canada that these actions are not 
seditious. The definition is quite clear that violence against a state 
must be involved.
<P>
	What we are asking of the House is that the seditious nature of 
this action be reviewed by the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs and that a decision be rendered. We are not 
seeking to restrict free speech. We are not out on a witch hunt to rid 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="719"> 719 </A></B>
<P>
the House of Bloc members. We are seeking clear parameters 
regarding the conduct of parliamentarians.
<P>
	Members opposite were in full favour of the same committee 
creating rules of conduct and penalties for members of Parliament. 
Now, because this issue is contentious and of great concern to all 
Canadians, they refuse to take a stand and allow it to be dealt with. 
We were elected to this place to make difficult decisions, so let us 
make them.
<P>
	My grandfather was born in Nicolet, Quebec near Trois-Rivières 
in 1867, the same year Canada became a country. He believed in 
democracy and valued the freedom and opportunity Canada has 
offered.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	In his 105 years on this earth my grandfather would not have 
tolerated the actions of the member for Charlesbourg, nor do the 
constituents of Vegreville tolerate it. They have asked me again and 
again why this issue has not been dealt with in the House of 
Commons by the Liberal government. How can I answer? The 
government refuses to deal with the issue. Once again the job of 
government has been left up to Reform.
<P>
	The government illustrates all that is wrong with politics today. 
It has attained the same enviable level of arrogance, greed and 
non-democratic practices as its predecessors. Canadians shouted 
loud and clear in the last election that the political practices of the 
past would no longer be tolerated. Yet this government continues 
the same old style of politics. It is obvious the government's 
memory is as short as its actions.
<P>
	Canadians are regarded around the world for their patience, 
tolerance and understanding. There is, however, a limit to these 
virtues. There comes a time when enough is enough and the line 
must be drawn. That time is now.
<P>
	The Canadian people cried out in shock when the Bloc 
Quebecois became Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. The idea of a 
political party whose mandate is to break up the country holding 
seats in the House of Commons was bad enough, but adding 
official opposition status to the mix had Canadians crying treason.
<P>
	A responsible government would have listened to these fears and 
responded by clearly defining the role of the official opposition; a 
role intended to protect the interests of Canadians from 
irresponsible government, a role as government in waiting. Not this 
government. It was happy to have a separatist official opposition 
rather than one that would hold it accountable to Canadians.
<P>
	The Bloc took the oath of office and promised to uphold, not 
abuse, the office of loyal opposition. A few months later the then 
leader of the official opposition began taking official visits to 
foreign countries. While on these visits, funded by Canadian 
taxpayers, he sought foreign recognition for a sovereign Quebec. 
This was clearly an abuse of the position of leader of the opposition 
and not in the best interest of Canadians.
<P>
	A responsible government would have sought an inquiry to 
investigate this use of Canadian tax dollars and parliamentary 
influence. Not this government. It has no respect for the hard 
earned tax dollars of Canadians. It partook in some name calling 
and refused to take action. The leader of the opposition used the 
influence of his office to wage a war of words against Canada in 
order to facilitate his goal of separation. A responsible government 
would have clearly defined the consequences, terms and conditions 
of separation and addressed other issues that are important to all 
Canadians across the country. Not this government. It fed right into 
the separatist agenda. Its inaction almost proved fatal for the 
country we cherish so much.
<P>
	Now the actions of the member for Charlesbourg have left 
unchallenged and unpunished by the government an event which 
took place during the referendum campaign. A member of Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition, also a member of the Standing 
Committee on Defence, abused his elected position by encouraging 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces to break ranks and form a 
Quebec national militia.
<P>
	A responsible government would have brought forth a motion 
referring this issue to the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs so that a definition of sedition, which reflects the 
wishes of Canadians, could be determined. Instead the government 
watered down the motion the Reform Party presented.
<P>
	The government was quoted as saying the communiqué was 
shocking and outrageous. It was. In fact the chief government whip 
who spoke earlier on this matter used the word ``mutiny'' to 
describe this incident. The chief government whip in this House 
described it as mutiny. One would think that such words would be 
followed by punitive measures. They were not.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The same government whip threatened to take the Reform House 
leader to the bar of the House of Commons over allegedly trying to 
pressure the Speaker of the House into appointing the Reform Party 
as official opposition. It is obvious the government whip considers 
a loyal opposition to be a greater threat than a disloyal opposition. 
It would seem apparent that the Reform Party, whose mandate is 
focused on fixing the country, is considered an enemy of this 
government and worthy of disciplinary measures. This is indeed a 
sad reality.
<P>
	This government prefers a separatist party as loyal opposition. 
Why? Because it fears Reform. We are a threat. Why are we a 
threat? We are a threat because we believe in empowering 
Canadians. We believe in being directly accountable to our 
electorate. These are fundamental principles of democracy and 
responsible government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="720"> 720 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister and other Liberals on occasion have 
outlined their version of democracy. Again today the member for 
Mississauga South talked about practising democracy and said that 
my colleague, the member for Vancouver North, was frustrated 
by democracy. This of course is the furthest thing from the truth.
<P>
	What frustrates me and my colleague is that we do not have 
democracy in this House. We do not have a functioning democracy 
pure and simple and Canadians know this. We have an elected 
dictatorship. It is because we do not have a real democracy that 
important issues like the issue we are dealing with today can be 
ignored by government.
<P>
	I will take some time now to examine the different and opposing 
views of MPs in this House as to what democracy is and really the 
opposing and different views that Canadians have when compared 
to Liberal members of Parliament. There are 295 chairs in this 
House of Commons. To whom do these chairs belong?
<P>
	Let us take a chair on the government side as an example. To 
whom does that chair belong? We have had some members of 
Parliament in the House, including the Prime Minister, who on 
occasion have said that the chair belongs to the member of 
Parliament who sits in it. On other occasions the Prime Minister 
has said that the government chairs in the House all belong to him, 
the Prime Minister. There are MPs, Reform members included, 
who believe that these chairs in the House of Commons belong to 
the constituents who are represented by the member of Parliament 
who sits in the chair.
<P>
	I will talk for a minute or two about the idea that the chair in the 
House of Commons belongs to the member of Parliament. Recently 
on a major radio talk show out of Toronto a Liberal member of 
Parliament was being interviewed. This Liberal member of 
Parliament is considered to be one of the more democratic 
members. At times he has gone against the hardline position of his 
government.
<P>
	A Reform volunteer decided she would phone the talk show and 
congratulate him for doing that. While she was waiting to get on, a 
question was asked of the member of Parliament: If your 
constituents wanted you to vote in favour of capital punishment, 
would you? The member hemmed and hawed and never really 
answered the question.
<P>
	By the time the Reform volunteer got on the line she was angry 
and her attitude had changed a little toward the member. She asked 
him, not once, not twice, but four times whether he would vote the 
wishes of a majority of his constituents if there were a vote in the 
House of Commons on capital punishment.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The fourth time she put the question this way: If 100 per cent of 
your constituents showed in a poll or a survey  that they were in 
favour of capital punishment, if a vote were held in the House of 
Commons on the issue, would you vote the wishes of your 
constituents? The member of Parliament said no, he would not, he 
would vote his conscience. Clearly in that case that member of 
Parliament believes the chair belongs to him.
<P>
	Since I have been in this House our Prime Minister has said that 
he was proud he had the guts to vote against his constituents on the 
issues of abortion and capital punishment. Is it something to be 
proud of, that he voted against the wishes of a majority of 
constituents on the issues of abortion and capital punishment? I 
think not. In that case the Prime Minister believed that the chair he 
sits in in the House of Commons belongs to him.
<P>
	The other view, the predominant view in the Liberal Party, is that 
the chairs in the House of Commons belong to the Prime Minister. 
To illustrate this let us look at Bill C-68, the gun control bill. On 
second reading some Liberal MPs did what their constituents 
wanted; they had done their homework and they voted against the 
bill. How were they rewarded for doing the job they are supposed 
to do here in the House? They were rewarded by being punished by 
the Prime Minister and thrown off committees.
<P>
	Then the Prime Minister said publicly that any member of 
Parliament in his party that voted against a government bill again 
would be punished by his refusing to sign their nomination papers. 
That means their political career would be over. That was the 
public threat. Is that democracy? In that case clearly the Prime 
Minister is saying: ``All the chairs on the governing side in this 
House belong to me, the Prime Minister, and if you do not do what 
I say, you are out of here''. Does that sound like a democracy? It is 
not democracy. Pure and simple, it is an elected dictatorship.
<P>
	There are those of us who have a much different view. There are 
those of us who believe that the chairs in this House of Commons 
belong to the people of Canada. Each chair belongs to the people 
who elected the member of Parliament to represent them. To make 
the change from the chairs in this House belonging to the Prime 
Minister or to the individual MPs, Reform put forth several pieces 
of legislation. These pieces of legislation, had they passed, would 
have given these chairs to the people and would have taken them 
from the members and from the Prime Minister.
<P>
	For example, the hon. member for Beaver River presented Bill 
C-210 that would have put in place recall of members of 
Parliament. This would have given the people in the constituency 
the ability to fire their member of Parliament between elections. 
On the one hand the Prime Minister would say: ``If you do not toe 
the party line, if you do not vote the way I tell you, I am not going 
to sign your nomination papers and your career is over''. On the 
other hand the people in the constituency would say: ``If you do not 
do what a  majority of us want, we are going to kick you out before 
the next election''. Then that chair would belong to the people in 
the constituency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="721"> 721 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam put forward Motion 
No. 89 calling for freer votes in the House of Commons. Had this 
motion passed, this country would have had law putting in place 
freer votes in the House of Commons. The change is very simple 
and was made in Britain decades ago. If a government bill was 
defeated it would not automatically mean the defeat of the 
government. That frees up members of the governing party to vote 
the wishes of their constituents. Now should the bill fail, it would 
require a separate non-confidence motion to pass to defeat the 
government. That gives the power to the people instead of the 
individual MPs, in particular the Prime Minister, the party leader.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam put forward Motion 
No. 459. It would have put in place an elected Senate to replace the 
patronage appointment Senate we have across the way. The 
member for Kootenay East put forward Bill C-365 which would 
have put in place an elected Senate.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Numerous motions that Reformers put forth would have allowed 
the use of referendums on important issues like capital punishment, 
abortion and physician assisted suicide. They would have been held 
in conjunction with federal elections so they would not be 
expensive. That would have given these seats in the House of 
Commons directly to the constituents.
<P>
	In every case this government voted against these bills. It shot 
down the changes that would have moved control of these seats 
from the individual MPs and especially from the Prime Minister. It 
would have given control to the people in the constituencies.
<P>
	It is so sad that these changes, although promised by the 
Liberals, have not materialized. In fact they voted against them. 
The mess we are in now, the issue we are debating today would 
never have happened had these democratic changes been made. I 
encourage the government to make these changes although I know 
it will not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak on the motion put forward by 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	To begin with, I would like to quote from a book that is very well 
known in Quebec, and probably in English Canada as well. My 
hon. colleague must be familiar with it, unlike the Reform Party; I 
am talking about the dictionary. This dictionary contains the 
following definition, which I will be pleased to read my hon. 
colleague. Dictionaries are organized like telephone books; it is all 
very simple: under sedition, one finds:  ``The stirring up of 
rebellion against the government in power''.
<P>
	The motion before us is a motion on sedition. Could you tell me, 
hon. colleagues, through you, Mr. Speaker, when any ``stirring up 
of rebellion against the government in power'' took place? As our 
leader indicated, perhaps sharing one's plans with the national 
media by fax is not the best thing to do if one is contemplating 
treason. It is not the best way of keeping a state secret.
<P>
	Another very important word is defined in this dictionary: 
democracy. We have been asked to provide a definition of 
democracy. According to the Reformers, the big, bad separatists 
were democratically elected by the people, but what does the word 
``democracy'' mean? Are we expected, in this House, to make up a 
definition for the word ``democracy''? I have news for them, a 
definition already exists, and it reads as follows: ``A political 
doctrine whereby sovereignty is exercised by the people as a 
whole; a system of government (often a republic) in which people 
exercise such sovereignty. And they exercise it by choosing their 
representatives''.
<P>
	The fact that people of Quebec chose to elect 54 sovereignist 
members back then, members whose primary task was to defend 
sovereignty for Quebec, was no secret either. It could be, as my 
colleagues told me quite frankly yesterday, during question period, 
that all of the 53 current Bloc members should be accused of 
sedition, of treason, because that is what they really think.
<P>
	The tabling of this motion was a gimmick to waste the time of 
the House and to make a point. What point is that? The point that, 
as far as the Reformers are concerned, the 53 Bloc members are not 
democratically elected members. To prove their point, they thought 
it was simple, that all they had to do was redefine the words 
``sedition'' and ``democracy'', redefine the rules governing the 
official opposition, redefine the business of the House. They want 
to redefine all that. Is that democratic in your books, my hon. 
friends from the Reform Party? I submit that there might be a slight 
breach of democracy there.
<P>
	How did all this begin? Upon our arrival, some very odd people 
took a fancy to bring a $500 million suit against us. I must admit 
that, faced with this, I checked in my bank book how much money I 
had. I was in trouble. So, I set it aside. Fortunately, this silly suit 
was abandoned.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party then asked that the Prime Minister be 
dismissed by the Governor General, thumbing their noses at 
democracy. As has been the case since 1867, the leader of the party 
that had sent the most elected members to Parliament became the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="722"> 722 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Minister; but  that was not right either. So then the Reform 
said ``OK, we will just change the definition, change democracy''.
<P>
	Then they said ``Maybe that is not diabolical enough. Let us ask 
the Speaker to make us the Official Opposition; surely the principle 
of numbers which has been in effect since the beginning is no good, 
since it does not make us the Official Opposition. So, let us change 
the Standing Orders.'' Nothing is too good. Nothing is too good for 
the working class. So, turning up their noses at democracy, they ask 
for the Standing Orders to be changed. Luckily, Mr. Speaker, you 
stuck to the rules as you always do, and everything stayed as it was.
<P>
	Then the Reform Party, great democratic party that it is, releases 
a 20-point document stating how and why, in 20 clear points, they 
are antidemocratic. It is always good to demonstrate things clearly, 
instead of just letting actions speak for themselves.
<P>
	They start off by saying that they are for partition, and this is an 
antidemocratic act. As well, they say ``Aboriginal territories within 
Quebec, within Canada, will be able to remain Canadian'', once 
again turning their backs on democracy. And then what do they 
say? Such a ridiculous motion would never have occurred to us. 
They say ``Well, if that does not work, we will send in the army.'' 
We are not the ones saying all this, they are. What is this about an 
apprehended revolt? Who mentions the army in a public 
document? It could have been kept a little more secret, but no, they 
called a press conference. That's the Reformers for you.
<P>
	Then, another change. They say ``Sedition, that word does not 
work for us.'' There is indeed a dictionary with an explanation of 
what sedition is, but it is not right. So Reform proposes a 
change-perhaps a good motion for next week-in which sedition 
will be defined as a crime of opinion. You are sovereignists, you 
express that as your opinion. We have changed the definition by 
changing the dictionaries, so now we can accuse everybody. That 
will be way easier. And what fun too.
<P>
	Will the Reform Party take over where Barnum and Bailey left 
off? That is a question one could well ask, because they seem to be 
in training to become circus clowns. When will they stop their 
buffoonery and respect the decorum of the House? We are even 
thinking that, next week, they will present a motion in this House to 
abolish winter next year. At that time, we will keep to the level of 
responsibility they have set.
<P>
	A Reform member tabled a motion last week. I am quoting here 
an article by Joël-Denis Bellavance in <I>Le Soleil</I> on March 13. He 
said: ``Last Friday, a Reform member tabled a motion stipulating 
that: ``-before consulting Canadians, MPs and senators in Ottawa 
should first determine, following a free vote-a free vote, nothing 
is too much-whether the question put to voters by the separating 
province-that must be ours-was simple and direct. A majority 
vote by parliamentarians  would then force the federal government 
to organize a national referendum-'' So, forget about democracy, 
which is part of the rules of the game over there, and hold a 
national referendum. Only the best. The article goes on as follows: 
``-to define the mandate to negotiate the terms of separation. If a 
majority of Canadians were to give such a mandate to the federal 
government,-no need to consult Jojo Savard on this, it will 
happen-it would undertake negotiations only with those Quebec 
electoral districts that endorsed the sovereignty proposal. The 
others would remain part of Canada.'' Fine respect for democracy.
<P>
	And then it goes on to say that it would have to provide that 
Quebec would become an independent state, to be respected. The 
province would no longer be part of Canada. If you want to move 
us, send us somewhere warm. And it goes on: ``Quebecers would 
no longer be represented in the Senate and the House of Commons. 
They would lose their Canadian citizenship and passport. They 
would lose their right to enter and travel freely within the 
country-''
<P>
	I would point out that the United States is a sovereign country 
and that you can go there without any problem.
<P>
	Everyday we see more and more examples of how an 
irresponsible party can cause people to lose faith in its members. 
They were elected democratically, and we respect that. We were 
elected democratically, and they should respect that.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	They may have a political program-we cannot tell-but they 
were elected to carry it out, and that is what we are doing with ours. 
Why not tackle real problems instead of paralysing the business of 
this House, deliberately bringing the business of this House to a 
stall with points of information? We informed the military of a 
course of action. In a 20-point document, we were told that the 
army would be sent out in the event of a yes vote. Do we not also 
have the right to inform our people? I would think that we do; after 
all, it is common now, in our society, to inform the people through 
the media.
<P>
	The Reformers said they were disappointed not to have been 
recognized as the official opposition. People watching the debate 
on television must be able to see through their little game. I 
personally feel this is a waste of time, as I said earlier, and this is 
how the Reformers hope to keep the people of Quebec from making 
themselves heard through their democratically elected 
representatives. The word ``democratically'' is in there are well.
<P>
	I would therefore like to tell the leader of the Reform Party that 
we realize that in trying to muzzle the Bloc Quebecois, they are in 
fact trying to silence all Quebecers, because we are their 
representatives. I can assure you that the Bloc Quebecois will not 
shut up and  that the people of Quebec will not be intimidated by 
the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, which is incidentally an 
insidious motion. He referred to francophone Quebecers; I asked 
him to show me where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="723"> 723 </A></B>
<P>
in the press release the words ``francophone Quebecers'' were 
used. ``Nowhere'', he said.
<P>
	So I had a word with him-I cannot repeat it in this House 
because the term ``lying'' is unparliamentary-because of what he 
had done, and he said: ``Yes, I know. It does not matter; we are still 
going ahead''.
<P>
	So they are consciously taking actions that violate democratic 
principles. Reform members should be ashamed of their lack of 
seriousness, of professionalism with respect to all proceedings of 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	Again, asking the Governor General to dismiss the Prime 
Minister from his post has, I think, never been done; at least I hope 
so. They might as well ask the Speaker to ignore the Standing 
Orders and to make them the official opposition, or perhaps ask 
that next winter be abolished.
<P>
	This rather whimsical strategy also seems to reflect a lack of 
preparation on the part of the Reform Party, an obvious lack of 
substance on matters that are much more important to people, and 
probably to their own constituents.
<P>
	I see in the Reform Party's attitude a conscious attempt to delay 
the 35th Parliament. The Riel, Rose and McGreevy precedents in 
this House clearly show that such a serious accusation can only be 
made in a court of law. Yet, in the case of my colleague, the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg, two courts, one in Quebec and one in 
Ontario, have already ruled that this matter could not be taken to 
court.
<P>
	In his communiqué, the hon. member for Charlesbourg was only 
trying to give legitimate reassurances to members of the Canadian 
Forces, as had been done for federal public servants. Armed Forces 
personnel were also entitled to be informed of the consequences of 
a yes vote in the referendum. The hon. member for Charlesbourg 
fulfilled an obligation, namely providing a segment of the 
population with information on their legitimate concerns. I believe 
that was the purpose of the communiqué of October 26, 1995.
<P>
	If the Reform Party thinks to make use of this motion to beef up 
its credibility in the rest of Canada, or with its clientele, it is 
mistaken. All it is doing is beefing up its reputation as a party of 
clowns.
<P>
	Again I repeat, all that the hon. member for Charlesbourg has 
done is to inform Armed Forces personnel, Quebec men and 
women who are in the Canadian Armed Forces, of the Quebec 
government's position in the event of a yes vote. Its orientations 
with  respect to defence were clearly set out in its bill on the future 
of Quebec. The hon. member for Charlesbourg felt it advisable, 
relevant and legitimate, to submit those orientations to the 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	I shall quote, if I may, from section 17 of the draft bill on the 
future of Quebec, drafted well before October 25. A motion could 
well have been introduced accusing every single person in Quebec 
of sedition and high treason, because it said the following 
clearly-and could there be anything more dreadful?-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government is taking the necessary steps to ensure that Quebec continues 
to participate in those defence alliances of which Canada is a member. Such 
participation must, however, be compatible with Quebec's desire to give 
priority to peace keeping throughout the world under the auspices of the United 
Nations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	This can be painless. We will take men and women who are 
already in the armed forces, we will integrate them into the new 
Quebec armed forces, and they will be called upon to carry out such 
missions. This is written in clause 17. We will send you the 
information. You will see what the sovereignist project is all about.
<P>
	The communiqué issued by the member for Charlesbourg did 
nothing more than interpret this statement.
<P>
	I find this debate is dangerous, and I would ask Reform members 
to stop turning this House into a circus. For their part, they could be 
suspected of deliberately trying to diminish the credibility of this 
House. This could be the subject of a motion.
<P>
	Several Quebec soldiers are sovereignists; it is not a mortal sin. 
Several Quebec soldiers would be very happy, in a sovereign 
Quebec, to be members of the Quebec armed forces. Around 50 per 
cent voted yes, and 50 per cent voted no.
<P>
	I should mention that if Reform members want to accuse us of 
all kinds of ills, first they should look closely at the situation of 
francophone soldiers and their families outside Quebec. A case in 
point is the story of Maryse Villeneuve, the wife of a soldier 
stationed in Moose-Jaw, Saskatchewan, who became so frustrated 
that she lodged five complaints with the Commissioner of Official 
Languages regarding abuses under the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	The Commissioner of Official Languages Act deemed the 
complaints valid enough to conduct an inquiry. There was an 
investigation on the five complaints and, later on, another study 
compared services offered to francophones in Moose Jaw, 
Saskatchewan, to those offered to anglophones at CFB Bagotville.
<P>
	I could make 52 copies of this and distribute them because the 
results of the investigation on the five complaints clearly show 
there are almost no services offered to French-speaking armed 
forces personnel in  Moose Jaw, compared to services in general 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="724"> 724 </A></B>
<P>
and to the respect they have for the Official Languages Act in 
Quebec and at CFB Bagotville.
<P>
	English-speaking personnel who practice-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Bill 101.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Bill 101 has nothing to do with it. Come to 
Quebec and you will see that we respect our minorities. I can 
guarantee that, in front of everybody in this House.
<P>
	Bill 101? To all those people who have never been to Quebec, to 
those who present motions accusing us of sedition, to those who are 
investigated because they did not abide by the rules on official 
languages, to those who do not even bother to have a French 
newspaper in their province, I will say that this is much more 
outrageous than Bill 101. That is another thing that should be said 
in this House.
<P>
	The Quebec government said, in a document published on April 
7, 1995, and I quote: ``April 7, 1995''-it would have been more 
clever if you had presented your motion a year ago.-``It is not 
necessary to form a very large army, but Quebec could at least 
adopt a coherent defence policy, suited to its needs''. It is clear that 
the question is not new. It was in our draft bill on Quebec 
sovereignty, it was in a working paper published in April 1995, and 
if you want to accuse people of sedition I will give you another 
name.
<P>
	He was professor of strategic studies at the former military 
college in Saint-Jean and he tabled a report before the Montreal 
commission on Quebec's future. We are talking here about a 
professor who was working for the Canadian Armed Forces and 
was paid by the Canadian government. I can tell you that he was 
being quite seditious.
<P>
	The title of his report was: ``The future for a defence policy in a 
sovereign Quebec''. He works for the Canadian Armed Forces. Is 
he also going to be hanged at Pied-du-Courant on June 24?
<P>
	``Should sovereignty occur, it would be necessary for Quebec to 
consider defining and implementing a defence policy''. What 
would such a policy be like? ``The mandate of a Quebec armed 
force, whether independent or associated with the rest of Canada, 
could be geared to two secondary responsibilities: first, territorial 
surveillance and public order; second, peacekeeping and peace 
enforcement operations.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	A professor of strategic studies at the Collège militaire de 
Saint-Jean dares to write a document alluding to the possibility of a 
sovereign Quebec. Wow! That guy was going rather far, was he 
not? Anything is possible, right? Yet, that gentleman was not 
accused of treason, sedition, lese-majesty or anything else.
<P>
	He was referring to a distinct possibility in Quebec. Quebecers 
did not suddenly wake up on October 28; they were aware long 
before of the real possibility that Quebec might become a sovereign 
state. Are people told about that reality? Are they simply told, as 
Reformers said: ``If you respect democracy, we will send in the 
army''? No. We are civilized and we say: ``Listen, should Quebec 
become sovereign, here is what will happen''. Just like we told 
federal public servants: ``We will sign an agreement to have you 
integrated into the new Quebec public service''.
<P>
	We also told old age pensioners: ``We will continue to pay you 
those pensions''. We said the same thing to retired federal public 
servants. Not because we are richer, but because the money is in 
funds which exist and which belong to those who made 
contributions. This is not a mortal sin. I am warning you now: there 
will be another referendum, so you had better prepare yourself 
psychologically.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that if Reformers are interested in 
working for the Cirque du Soleil, I will be happy to get them job 
application forms and then take the forms to the circus.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join the debate and to express the concerns of my 
constituents on the issue raised by my colleague, the hon. member 
for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	We are debating today whether the comments made by the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg and the actions of the then leader of the 
opposition should be viewed as seditious and offensive to the 
House, whether they constitute a contempt of Parliament and, 
therefore, should be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs to determine what action might be 
appropriate.
<P>
	These are very serious allegations. As the Speaker said, it is 
probably one of the most serious issues with which the House has 
had to deal in the 35th Parliament. It should not be viewed lightly.
<P>
	Yesterday, when my colleague was presenting his motion, some 
Bloc members were laughing and heckling. They found great 
merriment in the presentation of the motion. My constituents 
believe, as do I, that these comments were in fact seditious and 
offensive and, therefore, constitute a contempt of Parliament, as 
well as a breach of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The issue of whether the courts have ruled on this matter has 
come up a number of times in the House. I suggest the statement 
that the courts have found that it does not constitute a breach of the 
Criminal Code is not right. The Ontario court has yet to rule on the 
matter and there is an appeal before the Quebec court because the 
verdict on the original charge was not accepted by the crown, so 
further litigation will proceed on the matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="725"> 725 </A></B>
<P>
	I have also been very upset by the Bloc comments that I heard 
yesterday and today on the matter. Bloc members have tried to 
make light of the issue. They have said that the communiqué, the 
press release, was simply a communication for information to the 
Canadian Armed Forces and that it was information for Quebec 
soldiers. There is no such thing as a Quebec soldier. They are 
Canadian soldiers, each and every one of them.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	I heard it said it was no different than going to athletes from 
Quebec and saying to them ``after we reach independence in 
Quebec you will be invited to participate in athletics and to 
represent Quebec''. It is no different than going to the artists from 
Quebec and saying ``when we become independent you will be 
invited to represent Quebec instead of Canada''. That simply is not 
acceptable.
<P>
	It is entirely different from those circumstances. Each and every 
one of the people in the Canadian Armed Forces has taken a serious 
and solemn oath to protect and to be loyal to Canada. That is the 
difference. I do not know of athletes anywhere who have had to 
take such a solemn and serious oath to represent their country or 
their province in athletic competition.
<P>
	I believe most Canadians find it very offensive to have the 
separatist Bloc Quebecois representing Her Majesty's loyal 
opposition in this House. That is not to say it does not have a 
democratic right to be here. I would support the democratic right 
for that party to be here. The people of Quebec have the right to 
choose anyone they wish to represent them in this House.
<P>
	However, it does not follow that the Bloc has a right, or should 
be sitting as Her Majesty's loyal opposition. I find that quite 
ludicrous. I am most disappointed that the government would hide 
behind legalities, precedents and regulations to allow that to 
continue. Canadians everywhere find it outrageous and a good part 
of the world is laughing at Canada for allowing such a ludicrous 
situation to continue.
<P>
	Did the member for Charlesbourg really think Canadian military 
officers, the men and women, who have pledged allegiance to 
defend Canada, would take up arms against Canada to enforce a yes 
victory after a referendum? Did he really think that his actions 
would not upset Canadians, both English and French, both inside 
and outside Quebec? I can hardly believe he would be so naive as to 
believe that.
<P>
	This act by the member for Charlesbourg and the then leader of 
Her Majesty's loyal opposition shows how ludicrous the pretence is 
that the Bloc Quebecois represents the official opposition and the 
interests of all Canadians, not just the interests of the separatists 
from Quebec. One would have to be an idiot to believe the Bloc 
represents anybody's interests but the separatists from Quebec.
<P>
	As retired General Lewis MacKenzie points out, only in Canada 
would one get away with something like what has happened here. I 
believe, and everyone might agree, that in some countries people 
who had done such things would be either executed or would be 
waiting in jail. In Canada the attitude is simply to ignore it and 
perhaps it will go away. That is what the government had hoped.
<P>
	Canadians had hoped for the last four months that the 
government would do something to address this matter and take 
some action. We waited and waited while the demand for 
something to be done got louder and louder. Since the government 
did not act we were forced to act as the third party in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	The attitude of the leaders of the government, in particular the 
leader of the Canadian military in this government, is simply 
outrageous. For the life of me I cannot understand why the police, 
the military, the courts and government ministers have wimped out 
on this issue of what appears to be an open and shut case of sedition 
or at least an open and shut case of inciting to mutiny, both of 
which carry a possible 14-year prison sentence.
<P>
	One can quote all the dictionaries one wants, that is quite 
irrelevant to this issue. The definition of sedition or inciting a 
mutiny is quite clear in the Criminal Code. It is quite clear that the 
actions of this member constituted a breach of the Criminal Code. I 
understand the defence minister consulted the justice department 
on the issue at the time and was told by a lawyer that there was no 
case. Therefore, no action was taken.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	This incident casts a serious shadow over the loyalty of members 
of the Canadian military which is responsible for the defence of 
Canadian sovereignty. On that issue, I quote an article that 
appeared in the November 25 edition of the <I>Financial Post</I>, written 
by Diane Francis: ``The rumours are that secessionists had obtained 
oaths of allegiance from sympathetic officers eager to set up a rival 
army''.
<P>
	The Bloc member who spoke before me said that we were fools 
to think that there were no separatists and disloyal members of the 
Canadian Armed Forces who were prepared to take up arms against 
Canada. It is reprehensible that this shadow would be cast over the 
Canadian Armed Forces that I respect so greatly and which has 
such a tremendous reputation around the world for the work they 
have done on behalf of all Canadians.
<P>
	Reports in the media also state that there was a problem with 
junior officers. Again, Diane Francis pointed out in her March 2 
article in the <I>Financial Post</I>, that half of the cadets at the Kingston 
Military College were packed and ready to return to Quebec to join 
the new Quebec army if a yes vote had succeeded.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="726"> 726 </A></B>
<P>
	What was the minister's response to this? The minister stated 
in an interview with Diane Francis that he cannot get directly 
involved because it would cause problems within the military, 
already demoralized by the Somalia scandal. That is ludicrous. It 
is his responsibility to get involved, to deal quickly and decisively 
with what might be disloyalty in the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	It is quite unbelievable that this has happened. Had it happened 
in the U.S.A., I can assure the House that the U.S. military and the 
U.S. minister of defence certainly would not be sitting around on 
their duffs doing nothing. This is a serious matter. We have an 
obligation to Canadians to cite this member's statement as 
seditious and then have it examined by the parliamentary 
committee on House affairs to determine what action should be 
taken.
<P>
	We also have to weed out the separatists in the Canadian Armed 
Forces because loyalty is everything in a country's army. If the 
army is not loyal to Canada, then we have a very serious problem.
<P>
	It is a sad that the government has taken no leadership role in this 
matter. It took a private Canadian, Brent Tyler from Montreal, to 
have the courage to take this matter before the courts with an 
unfortunate, unsuccessful result to this point. The story is not over. 
We are hoping with all our hearts that the courts will deal seriously 
with the issue and rule on it in a fair and reasonable manner.
<P>
	Again, Diane Francis, the journalist I quoted earlier, went to the 
RCMP over the issue because she felt so strongly. She asked the 
RCMP to do something about it. They in turn told her that it had 
been turned over to the legal branch of the RCMP which would be 
discussing the matter with the Department of Justice. Furthermore, 
they said that the matter will take some time to investigate. We 
waited and waited. It appears that the whole matter has been 
dropped. We all know why. It is because appeasement of the 
separatists is the Liberal answer to separatism in Canada.
<P>
	Appeasement has never worked anywhere in the world and it 
will not work with the separatists. We have been appeasing the 
separatists in Quebec for 30 years and on October 30 we came 
within a hair's breadth of losing this country. The strategy is not be 
successful. It does not work and I will not support it.
<P>
	I have received numerous letters, phone calls and personal 
interventions from my constituents on this issue. It is important 
that we have the opportunity to express the views of ordinary 
Canadians and put those views on the record. Canadians should be 
able to read in <I>Hansard</I> how the House dealt with this serious issue.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	This is not only my constituents. There was a poll done 
yesterday by Broadcast News, a national news network. A question 
was floated to Canadians: should a Bloc  Quebecois member of 
Parliament be censured by Parliament because he invited soldiers 
to switch their loyalty to a post-referendum independent Quebec 
army? Of the number of calls received, 1,112 people said yes, he 
should be. Only 66 callers said no, he should not be. Ninety-four 
per cent of the respondents supported the idea that this member of 
Parliament should be censured and held responsible for the action 
he took. It certainly was not simply a job offer to members of the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Constituents in my riding, Mrs. Maureen Bizon and Mr. Robert 
Johnson, contacted my office in the last day or two to express 
outrage with this issue. They demanded that since the government 
would not raise this issue we should do something. Mrs. Bizon said 
I should push the Minister of Justice to press charges against these 
members who made this statement in their press release. She 
continued by saying these members should be at least charged with 
sedition or inciting mutiny. At the very least, she wanted a serious 
and thorough investigation of all the allegations. That is typical of 
the many constituents who called, phoned and stopped me on the 
street to talk to me about this issue.
<P>
	The list is endless. Canadians everywhere feel this is very 
serious. However, I wanted to quote that one person because I felt it 
was fairly representative of how all Canadians feel.
<P>
	The comments made by the member for Charlesbourg and by the 
then leader of the opposition were reviewed by ordinary Canadians 
everywhere as seditious and offensive. The inaction by the police, 
the military and the government are viewed as deplorable by 
Canadians.
<P>
	The question now is what to do about it. These Canadians have 
called on the government first to do something about it. They have 
called on the courts to do something about it. Failing that, they 
have now called on our party to do something about it. Will we now 
simply sweep it under the rug or whitewash it as the government is 
now still trying to do? Those nasty Reformers are inflaming the 
separatist movement.
<P>
	Are we to ignore it and sweep it away again like we have so 
many other things, as we have for other racial groups that are 
openly and flagrantly breaking the Criminal of Code of Canada? 
We must not hold them accountable because we will inflame the 
separatists or other racial groups simply for the appearance of 
being politically correct.
<P>
	Did we ever really have to wonder about the military members in 
Alberta? Do we have to worry about them being recruited to an 
Alberta army? I do not think that is very likely.
<P>
	The one thing that concerns me most is that the majority of 
Canadians living in the constituencies of these members across the 
floor probably feel the same. However, we heard an ongoing debate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="727"> 727 </A></B>
<P>
about how  democratic this place is and what opportunities all 
members have to express the concerns of their constituents.
<P>
	It certainly appears that members opposite do not have the 
courage to stand up and speak for their constituents on this issue. 
Instead they hide behind the procedures and the precedents of the 
House. They let us raise this issue which is unmentionable for them 
simply because their party will not allow them to do that. It is truly 
unfortunate that they are not able to speak on behalf of their 
constituents and that the government takes such a casual and a 
laissez fair attitude toward the separatists inciting a mutiny in the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I remember distinctly last year when this issue was first raised 
and was front page material in the press across the country these 
same members were all excited and up in arms over the comments, 
saying how terrible it was and that something must be done, we 
have to deal with this and we have to stop this open challenge by 
separatists to the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	What happened? Nothing was done. Why did the frontbenchers 
in the government opposite not take some action? Why did they not 
answer to what was happening. Why again on this issue, as we have 
seen in so many others, is the government simply supporting the 
separatists in the actions they are taking in committees and in 
Parliament?.
<P>
	The government, until we raised this issue, had every intention 
of using its majority in the justice committee to elect the member 
we are charging here as the vice-chairman of the standing 
committee on national defence. If that is not aiding and abetting the 
separatists in their cause to take Quebec out of Canada, I have no 
idea what would be. The same procedure went on recently in every 
standing committee of the House.
<P>
	I believe the only way to satisfactorily deal with the situation is 
to lay the charges we have and then refer the charge and the motion 
we have put forward to the standing committee for examination 
and for recommendations on action to be taken.
<P>
	I view this as much more than, as the whip for the government 
said, an impetuous act by a member of Parliament, that we should 
send it to committee, he should be slapped on the wrist, he should 
be censured and told he should not do that and then let the whole 
matter fall aside and take no further action.
<P>
	We have to take very serious action. We have to consider the 
expulsion of this member from the House of Commons. We have to 
consider pursuing laying charges under the Criminal Code of 
Canada for the action he has taken.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
getting to the substance of my speech, I would like to comment on 
a number of statements made by the Reform member. After 
listening to him for 20 minutes, I feel that he almost deserves a 
prize for saying so many things that are inaccurate and indicative of 
a lack of sensitivity and vision. All this from people who claim to 
form a national party that wants to settle the constitutional crisis in 
which we find ourselves.
<P>
	One thing that really stunned me was the reference to loyalty. 
The member talked about Quebec soldiers currently serving in the 
Canadian Armed Forces. He said there are no Quebec soldiers. 
However, there are Quebecers serving in the Canadian Armed 
Forces. In my opinion, these people are Quebecers first and then 
soldiers. The member said that these people's loyalty must be to the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	This would mean that even democracy would only come second. 
As everyone knows, if, some day, Quebec achieves 
sovereignty-and I am convinced that it will-it will have done so 
through a very democratic and open process, with the support of a 
majority of the population.
<P>
	It will be after a democratic yes vote by Quebecers that people 
will be asked to respect the choice of the majority, and that we will 
set up the structures that every country has, including a military 
force that will take part in peacekeeping missions throughout the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	We need to face up to reality. The Canadian army does not 
necessarily defend Canada's territorial integrity. It takes part in 
peacekeeping missions. If there was a problem and Canada's 
territorial integrity was challenged, I seriously doubt that our army 
would be up to the challenge, and everybody knows that. Again, the 
main task of our army is to keep or, as the case may be, make peace 
in the world.
<P>
	Let us return to the Reformer member said. He said that these 
people were soldiers who should be loyal to the Canadian Armed 
Forces before being democratic. This comment is rather surprising, 
coming from people who were elected to a Parliament which has 
been democratic since Confederation. Democracy is one of most 
cherished values in this country and, to a certain extent, makes us 
all proud.
<P>
	By his remarks he calls into question the very principle of 
democracy. It is very disturbing to see a member who sits in the 
Parliament of Canada, question, indirectly, the foundations of 
democracy.
<P>
	Of course he extensively quoted Dane Francis, his intellectual 
guru, who prompts him on substance, on political thought. I believe 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="728"> 728 </A></B>
<P>
she alerted the Reform Party to this issue. It should be pointed out, 
in case Reformers had forgotten, that we are now in mid-March. 
The  communiqué was released in October, a few days before the 
referendum. All of a sudden, this week, or toward the end of last 
week, they wake up after reading some articles by Mrs. Francis, 
who found the whole situation outrageous. They decided to make a 
big fuss about it.
<P>
	I find it deplorable that this is going on at a time when we are 
faced with major problems in terms of employment, when all 
Canadians ask themselves how we should manage our public 
finances, which choices we should make, how we should go about 
it, how to guarantee that everybody, especially the most 
disadvantaged can pull through this financial crisis. People wonder 
a lot, and they are very concerned.
<P>
	My constituents, but maybe not those of my Reform or Liberal 
colleagues, are more concerned by these issues. I do not know how 
I will be able to explain to them on the weekend that Parliament 
spent the whole week debating a motion first from the Reform 
Party then from the government, discussing charges of sedition 
against a member from the Bloc Quebecois, when our ridings are 
faced with a lot of problems that we must deal with.
<P>
	We have already talked about this matter for two days. That is 
rather outrageous, not to mention all the energy that all the parties 
have devoted to this issue. And the government should blame itself 
because it could have stopped this by defeating the motion from the 
Reform Party, and that would have been the end of it. But no, the 
government, perhaps because of a lack of imagination or bills to 
introduce, decided to move an amendment to refer this matter to a 
committee, but I will come back to that later.
<P>
	I want to tell you that I find it totally ridiculous that we have 
spent so much time on such a trivial matter, because it is just that, 
even though it has been blown out of proportions. We will get back 
to the heart of the matter in a few minutes.
<P>
	I would like to remind people that it might also be an attempt by 
the Reformers to hide the disarray within their caucus at the present 
time. We know that some of them are questioning the fact that their 
colleagues people are taking positions that are far too radical. We 
have not seen them much in the last few days.
<P>
	At a time when the Reformers' political positions could be 
examined in the House, they are trying to draw attention away, 
toward something else. This is typical, it is nothing new, they did 
not invent anything. I think this is one reason for their actions, but 
the other one, which is probably much more important, is that, 
since October 1993, these people have never accepted, and this 
brings us back to the issue of democracy, that we have formed the 
official opposition, that a greater number of us were chosen to sit in 
this Parliament. According to the rules and traditions of our 
parliamentary system, it is our privilege to be the official 
opposition, because voters have made that choice.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	So, at every opportunity, by roundabout ways, by direct and 
indirect means, they try each time to challenge that. That is the 
objective because, of course, we current have an equal number of 
members, even though that will change in a few days. If they could 
get one of our members thrown out, that would certainly be the 
ideal thing. Perhaps that is the only way for them to become the 
official opposition, because I am convinced that the byelection 
results will demonstrate once again that Reformers are part of a 
way of thinking that does not, certainly not in Quebec, nor I believe 
in the rest of Canada, represent the views of a majority of 
Canadians, as people are far more moderate than that.
<P>
	Yet, their comments are reported by some people in the media, 
like Ms. Francis, who abuse their power in these cases to provide a 
forum for this kind of action, which does nothing to improve the 
current political situation.
<P>
	Let us go back to the facts themselves. What happened? We must 
go back to a few days before the referendum, that is to say, during 
an intense campaign, a vigorous democratic debate, a very tight 
race, a few days before the results were known. I remember that, 
during the campaign and even before, people were asking us what 
we would do after a yes vote. Commissions were also set up to 
consult the people of Quebec. We took part in these meetings, and 
the hon. members opposite would have been well-advised to do the 
same as it would probably have done them some good.
<P>
	People were asking us about the outcome of a yes vote. So, 
throughout the campaign, we met with various groups of people to 
explain to them our vision of Quebec after a yes vote.
<P>
	A few days before the referendum, my colleague, the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg, released a communiqué, according to 
which ``the MP for Charlesbourg believes that-Quebec will have 
need of all Quebecers presently enlisted in the armed forces''. In 
the first paragraph, he talks about the size of the armed forces and 
argues that Quebec will not need such a large military. He then 
talks about international peace missions, how much they cost, how 
they work, how many soldiers are needed. He goes back to the 
international missions and calls on Quebec soldiers to respect the 
democratic decision made by Quebecers, inviting them to join 
Quebec's future armed forces should Quebecers opt for 
sovereignty. He adds that they would enjoy the same working 
conditions and so on.
<P>
	I think that telling people who had the right to vote in this 
democratic process to decide the future of the people of 
Quebec-because this communiqué was released in Quebec-what 
they could expect the day after a yes vote was a responsible thing to 
do. That is essentially what my colleague did.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="729"> 729 </A></B>
<P>
	Yet, a few months later, the motive behind this action is being 
questioned on the grounds that it is an incitement to sedition. Let 
me give you the exact definition of the term ``sedition'' according 
to the French dictionary. The dictionary defines this term as a 
concerted revolt against public authority. A concerted revolt.
<P>
	This afternoon, I read the communiqué over twice, to try to see 
how it could be interpreted as stirring up a rebellion against the 
government in power, when all we are doing is urging people to 
respect the democratic decision that will be made and telling them 
what to expect the day after a yes victory, in the event that this had 
been the course democratically chosen by the people.
<P>
	There is absolutely no mention of any potential uprising. If you 
were planning a rebellion, Mr. Speaker, is the first thing you would 
do be to inform every media in the country that you are staging an 
uprising by making a public announcement? This makes no sense. I 
think this is elementary.
<P>
	Perhaps the Reformers would chose an approach the same way 
they develop their political strategy. However, that is certainly not 
how most people would go about it.
<P>
	After sitting in this place for two years and a half, one gets used 
to Reformers struggling with policy analysis, having a hard time 
maintaining a high standard of responsibility and not always 
understanding how a democratic system works.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Things get more complicated when, this week, in a fit of panic, 
the government gives in to their arguments to some extent and, 
instead of putting an end to this whole thing once and for all, it goes 
along with this approach-because we must bear in mind the initial 
motion put forward by the Reformers, who accused my hon. 
colleague of sedition and so on and wanted to make him pay for it, 
which was eventually amended by the government to have the 
matter referred to a committee of the House for consideration.
<P>
	But there is nothing to consider, absolutely nothing. What is the 
point? What good would this do? What goal would this serve? It 
would just support the Reformers' approach, and that is very 
surprising.
<P>
	As I recall, during the first two sessions of Parliament, and 
during the first one in particular, the Prime Minister and his 
ministers stood up in this House one after the other to praise 
Canadian democracy, saying that this Parliament was the greatest 
example of democracy, since sovereignists were allowed to sit in it 
and that it was a great example of Canadian pride and democratic 
values.
<P>
	Today, by their actions, they finally accept us but our presence 
may not be tolerated if we do not promote ideas or political goals 
that do not suit them.
<P>
	In a democracy, there is freedom of speech and the right of 
dissent. Of course, and we have always made this clear, we stand 
for a political goal which is for Quebec to become a sovereign 
country, a partner. We want to be partners, because there are many 
areas of mutual interest, and we will certainly succeed because 
good sense will finally prevail. On the other hand, we do not even 
have a choice. But all this stopped making sense for Liberal 
members in the past few days, given their major turnaround. If ever 
there was a turnaround, this is it. They, who used to say they were 
true democrats, are re-opening the whole issue because they wish 
to allow this investigation of a sovereignist member's presence in 
the House.
<P>
	As a member of the same party and a colleague of the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg, I feel I am also attacked by this 
procedure. Indeed, what guarantee do we have that, having 
expressed an opinion in our own riding, we could not also be 
accused of sedition?
<P>
	In fact, we are being accused of being sovereignists, and 
therefore seditious. That is what it amounts to, because the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg certainly did not organize an uprising or 
recruit people who were armed to the teeth and ready to come to 
Ottawa and topple the government. He provided an analysis of the 
situation the day after a yes vote. He was expressing himself 
democratically, with the means provided to us as parliamentarians. 
This issue is worrying.
<P>
	I also read the definition of ``sedition'' in the English dictionary, 
and I understood why the Reform members exaggerated. In 
English, it is defined as:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Conduct or speech inciting to a rebellion or a breach of public 
order''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, the beginning of the definition says ``conduct or 
speech''-but you have to read the whole sentence-``inciting to a 
rebellion''. Our friends in the Reform Party should have made an 
extra effort to read as far as the word ``rebellion'', which can be 
synonymous with revolt or something else. As far as I know, this is 
not at all what the hon. member for Charlesbourg was doing. There 
is a problem, either because Reformers find it hard to do their job 
properly, or because they have difficulty understanding words. I 
would say it is a combination of both.
<P>
	I will get back to it. This really should not come as such a 
surprise, given how hard it is for them to grasp current reality. 
However, it is surprising to see Liberal members, including the 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, who is listening 
assiduously, condone that action. That is surprising. This goes for 
all Liberal members, because we expect them to be much more 
serious than that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="730"> 730 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I also want to say that we were elected with close to 50 per cent 
of the votes in Quebec. The Reformer who spoke before me made a 
very serious statement. First, he alluded to a poll conducted by 
CTV and said he was convinced that people in every riding in 
Canada did not accept such an outrageous action. This is not the 
exact word he used, but it was something to that effect. He said 
that, in every riding, people did not accept that.
<P>
	I have to say that, in his speech, the hon. member has already 
excluded Quebec from Canada.
<P>
	I invite him to come to my riding this weekend or next weekend 
and see if the majority of my constituents share his opinion. I invite 
him to debate that issue in my riding of Témiscamingue. I will send 
him a map, with the appropriate directions, so that we can have a 
good discussion and see what the majority of my constituents think 
about it.
<P>
	He mentioned that twice in his remarks -I hear him muttering 
something to the effect that I misunderstood his remarks. He said 
that twice, using the expression ``all Canadians''. To say that every 
Canadian would support him in what he said is going a bit too far. 
Until proven otherwise, I am still one, and I do not support him. In 
that sense, my colleague here does not either, nor do my other 
colleagues, I am sure. Even our constituents and many federalists 
in Quebec do not accept that interpretation.
<P>
	To conclude, because I only have a couple of minutes left, I 
would simply like to say that I am very disappointed with the 
Liberal Party and the government. They made sure that we would 
avoid debates on major issues this week, the week following the 
tabling of the federal budget where the government announced its 
intentions, where it confirmed its cuts in social transfers to the 
provinces and its cuts in the unemployment insurance program, 
two issues of great concern to people in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	We would have had the opportunity to debate those issues more 
thoroughly in order to improve the reforms the government intends 
to make, even though, in some cases, we would like it to withdraw 
them or, at least, pay heed to our arguments so that, while moving 
forward, they might at least take one fact into account, namely that 
some people will be hard hit by their reforms.
<P>
	Instead, the Parliament has wasted two full sitting days, the 
energy of almost a week, to discuss an issue that should have been 
dealt with in a matter of minutes. I will have a hard time explaining 
that to my constituents who are already very cynical about politics 
and tell us frequently, and I am sure the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands will agree, that our institutions are a bit obsolete.
<P>
	We got a good example of that this week. Of course, I will give 
my opinion and I will use up my 20 minutes in  this debate, because 
we can very well spend a whole day on this. That is why I take the 
floor, but the whole situation is disappointing, and it can only 
convince us even more that the only way we can make significant 
changes in our institutions is for Quebecers to take control of their 
own destiny and put in place institutions that would be much more 
modern. That way, Canadians too will have to adjust their 
institutions to their liking.
<P>
	In the meantime, I hope everybody will calm down. The debate 
is not making waves in Quebec. But outside Quebec, and I will 
conclude with this, there are people who are trying to stir up strong 
negative reactions. They are trying to score political points at the 
expense of Quebec, and that is not a healthy attitude. Let me say to 
all these people that they should be very careful about what they 
do, because the consequences can be staggering. I am thinking 
right now of the government, because nothing much can be 
expected from the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has been interesting to listen to the debate today. I am reminded 
of when I was in the ministry and being confronted with what was 
called situational ethics. It was a means by switching words around 
and by looking at things a little differently to rationally justify such 
things as premeditated murder.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The debate today concerns me because words are used so 
casually and definitions are used so loosely. We are talking about 
how we may preserve our democracy. The foundation of our 
democracy is the rule of law.
<P>
	I am not particularly interested in a view of the law like that of 
Inspector Javert in Victor Hugo's <I>Les Misérables</I>. However unless 
we take seriously what the law means, our rights and privileges, 
and how we conduct ourselves, we are fraying the fabric of 
democracy. If we in the House who are responsible for the passing 
of laws do not take it seriously, how can we expect young people 
who are struggling and looking for a way to get by on the streets to 
take seriously laws that are given scant heed here?
<P>
	The matter before us should be reviewed by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to determine if the 
member is in contempt of Parliament and to determine if what he 
did was offensive to Parliament.
<P>
	It would be a mistake not to look at the charge which was 
brought squarely to deal with it. If it is not a correct charge, if the 
person did nothing improper, then it should be set aside. The 
protection the law offers is the protection of all of us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="731"> 731 </A></B>
<P>
	There are two important reasons the matter needs to be 
investigated. Before I explain them we need to clearly understand 
the historical circumstances behind why the subject is before us 
today in the House.
<P>
	On October 26, 1995 the member for Charlesbourg sent a fax to 
all Canadian forces bases in Quebec. He issued the release under 
the letterhead of the then leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Lucien 
Bouchard. In part it read that the day after a yes vote Quebec must 
create immediately a defence department, the embryo of a defence 
staff, and offer all Quebecers serving in the Canadian forces the 
chance to integrate into the Quebec forces.
<P>
	The release concluded:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-I think that soldiers of Quebec origin will respect the people's decision and 
will transfer their loyalty to the new country whose security they will ensure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The nub of the question is that they will transfer their loyalty. 
This was done in the name of the leader of the official opposition in 
the House of Commons. That is offensive in my mind and that is 
the charge I would like to have examined.
<P>
	The federal government's response to the release of the 
member's communiqué came six days after the referendum vote. 
The defence minister, as quoted in a November 7, 1995 Toronto 
<I>Star</I> article, said the following: ``To appeal to members of the 
Canadian armed forces to become part of a hypothetical, foreign 
army, I found this matter perplexing. I found it a bit shocking''.
<P>
	The article also stated that the defence minister asked the 
military's judge advocate general to give a legal opinion about the 
propriety of the communiqué released by the member for 
Charlesbourg.
<P>
	Since these comments were made Canadians have not heard any 
other official word from the government. The government has not 
taken any action against the member; it has not even asked for an 
apology.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	This brings us to the first major reason I believe my colleague 
had a valid point when he asked that the action taken by the 
member for Charlesbourg on October 26, 1995, including the 
charge of sedition, be investigated by the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	Since the referendum I have travelled extensively in my riding 
and throughout the country. I have listened to many Canadians who 
are extremely perturbed and upset at the member's behaviour, that 
he should do something like this and that there should be no 
response. They sincerely believe he did something wrong.
<P>
	The informal broadcast news poll quoted by my colleague 
indicates that I am not one small voice in the wilderness since 94 
per cent of respondents said that  something should be done. While 
this is not a scientific poll with 1,178 respondents it is a larger 
number than many polls with results upon which major decisions 
are based.
<P>
	These are very serious accusations. We have heard many 
definitions of sedition; many dictionaries have been quoted. I quote 
from the Criminal Code, section 62(1)(b) which describes sedition 
and its penalties:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Everyone who wilfully (a) interferes with, impairs or influences the loyalty 
or discipline of a member of a force,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is not talking about a revolt. This is talking about influence 
and this is exactly what was done, in my estimation. The section 
continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) publishes, edits, issues, circulates or distributes a writing that advises, 
counsels or urges insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of a duty by a 
member of a force, or in any manner causes insubordination, disloyalty, 
mutiny or refusal of duty by a member of a force is guilty of an indictable 
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section two defines a force:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) In this section, ``member of a force'' means ``a member of</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a)the Canadian Forces; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>b) the naval, army or air forces of a state other than Canada that are lawfully 
present in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This description of the law is amazingly clear.
<P>
	I mention these Criminal Code provisions to reveal how 
seriously Canadians feel about the situation and to point them out 
to Bloc members who would quote any variety of dictionaries to 
put their own slant on the matter. The definition we are interested 
in is the definition of the law, the definition of our Criminal Code.
<P>
	Just as Canadians are upset about the situation, the member's 
actions infuriate them even more because of the lack of action by 
Parliament. Parliament's inaction in the situation is inexcusable. 
People are outraged there has not been any government 
investigation. They cannot understand why the federal government 
does not see it as an important issue.
<P>
	Is the member's behaviour acceptable for a parliamentarian? 
Canadians deserve an answer to that question. This is what we are 
asking for. They fear the government is simply papering over the 
matter. One newspaper article I read in December 1995 stated: 
``Sources in Ottawa say the government, fearful of turning 
Bouchard and Jacob into martyrs, quietly has decided-''
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt any 
member on a debate of such importance, but it is important that we 
clearly respect our parliamentary regulations, our own regulations, 
and not mention or identify any member by name but only by 
riding or by portfolio. Even in the context of a quote  from a 
publication or otherwise in the House, we cannot do indirectly what 
we cannot do directly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="732"> 732 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead of referring to the member by name we must recognize 
him or her by riding. I ask for the member's co-operation. It was 
probably not his intent, but by the same token and because of the 
importance of the debate we should be very respectful of one 
another and observe all the rules and procedures of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your intervention. 
There was no intention of disrespect. If there is I apologize. I will 
repeat the quote: ``Sources in Ottawa say the government, fearful 
of turning Bouchard and'' the member for Charlesbourg ``into 
martyrs, quietly has decided to drop the matter''. This quotation is 
taken from the Toronto <I>Star</I> of December 18, 1995.
<P>
	Is this true? Is this what the government has done? Is this the 
motivation for lack of action? Where exactly does the government 
stand on the issue? We have not heard a position. We have not seen 
any action taken. Canadians want to know. Canadians do not 
deserve to have their voices smothered by a closure of this debate.
<P>
	The Speaker said only two days ago:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House today is being faced with one of the more serious matters we have 
been faced with in this 35th Parliament-I am of the opinion that nothing will be 
gained by delaying consideration of this issue to a later date.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe the charges are so grave against one of our own members that the 
House should deal with this accusation forthwith.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Speaker assured all members that they would have an 
opportunity to speak to this grave matter. I believe I can speak for 
members of my caucus when I say I am offended by this motion of 
closure.
<P>
	If the matter is so serious, why do the Liberals want to bring 
closure to this debate? Do they not want the interest of Canadians 
represented? Their actions are preposterous. This is an elitist 
attitude and it is undemocratic. It stifles the debate of the elected 
representatives of the people who are deeply concerned by the 
matter.
<P>
	Canadians want it debated. They want answers to the questions 
raised by the communiqué. Let us not try to cover up the matter and 
choke the voices of the Canadian people. Canadians deserve to 
know and have a right to know whether the member's behaviour is 
in contempt or whether his participation in it was an offence to 
Parliament. For once let us allow Canadian people to be heard and 
continue this historic debate until the issue is completely aired, but 
that will not be.
<P>
	The defence minister said that there were certain things we do 
and do not do in public life. I completely agree with that statement. 
That is why we must send the matter to the committee, investigate 
it, and learn if such behaviour by the member is acceptable for a 
public official. Above all, let us represent the interest of  
Canadians. Let us take seriously what our constituents are saying to 
us. Let the matter be clarified in Parliament for us and for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Before I close I need to mention the most crucial reason the 
actions of the member must be investigated. That reason is 
principle. From the argument I have just given the House can see 
that my colleague's question of privilege is not a personal attack. 
He has not taken these steps in an attempt to discredit the members 
of his family or his party.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The main point here is that the people of Canada have seen a 
member of this House make a mistake, if we wish to use that term. 
We all make mistakes, in this House and everywhere. Life is a 
series of mistakes. We say things we should not. We do things we 
should not do and sometimes we do things we do not even know are 
wrong. But in the end Mr. Speaker, there are consequences for our 
actions which you as the Speaker of this House must fairly allot.
<P>
	Canadians perceive that the member for Charlesbourg has made 
a mistake, but to rectify the situation Parliament has done nothing. 
It has not even investigated the accuracy of the accusation. I would 
be incensed if these accusations were flying around and I was being 
accused with no recourse, no redress, no way to clear my name.
<P>
	If we deal with this matter and send this issue to committee as a 
matter of contempt to be considered by the committee, we at least 
tell Canadians that their leaders are treated the same as every other 
Canadian before the law. It tells them that politicians do suffer the 
consequences of improper and illegal actions, that equality matters 
all the time, even when it does not benefit the politicians or the 
elite. Let us do the right and honourable thing and send this matter 
to the committee for investigation. Let the committee receive the 
whole issue without the masks and the deletions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this 
debate. It has raised some very serious issues that the House will 
want to consider before the motion is voted on. When I speak to the 
motion I speak not just of the motion as originally proposed but to 
all the amendments. We are now debating a subamendment to the 
main motion.
<P>
	It is instructive to look at the terms of the original motion and the 
terms of the amendment the government proposed, which in my 
view makes the most sense and which will clarify the situation for 
everyone if it is adopted. I know the Reform members will disagree 
with what I have to say but they are going to have to listen to this 
because it is important.
<P>
	The main motion wants the House to decide the issue in advance, 
decide that sedition has occurred in this  instance and that the 
matter of the seditious acts of the hon. member for Charlesbourg 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="733"> 733 </A></B>
<P>
ought to be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs for study.
<P>
	If the issue is whether or not sedition occurred, and I submit that 
is what the committee should be studying, why would the House 
express its view on the actions of the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg before the committee undertakes its study? If it were 
adopted here in the House as the view of the House, that would be 
the end of the matter and there would be no point in having the 
committee study it.
<P>
	The whole purpose of the referral to committee is to give the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg an opportunity to present his side of 
the case. There is a hearing in committee. The committee hears 
witnesses and evidence. The committee acts as a tribunal or court. 
When it makes a determination of the issue it brings a report to the 
House which the House can accept or reject. The matter could also 
be referred back to the committee for further study or with 
directions that the committee do certain things or present a certain 
kind of report. The fact is the House is master of this procedure. 
The House refers the matter to committee and the committee is the 
one that does the investigating. The committee acts as a kind of 
judge, although the House retains the right to vary the judgment of 
the committee. It is like a right of appeal.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite seem to have missed the point. Certainly 
the hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt who 
proposed the motion spent three or four months studying the issue 
in great detail before he came to the House. The hon. member 
missed that famous reference to a case in the time of James I that 
my colleague from Vancouver Quadra came up with the other day. I 
would have thought that after four or five months the hon. member 
for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt would have had every 
precedent that could be found, but he did not. Nevertheless, in spite 
of all that research, he came up with a motion that in effect 
condemned the hon. member for Charlesbourg before the hon. 
member had any opportunity to explain his position before some of 
his colleagues. This is taking away the hon. member's elementary 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I know the Reform Party has trouble with law and order issues. I 
am glad to see the hon. member for Calgary Southeast. I know she 
is still ashen from the treatment she got in her caucus meeting 
yesterday. I read all about it in the media this morning. Perhaps 
later tonight we will hear her make a speech on the subject and she 
will tell us about law and order.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Calgary Centre has flown the coop 
because of the treatment he received at the hands of his colleagues 
in caucus yesterday. I suspect the member for Calgary West 
skipped the caucus. If he had  any sense he would have stayed 
away. If he had a lot of sense he would join the Liberal Party.
<P>
	These members are being treated like that because they have 
views on law and order that are at variance with their colleagues. 
One wonders if the hon. members were not whipped at their caucus 
meeting because that is certainly a practice some of their 
colleagues seem to favour. They want to introduce whipping in the 
Criminal Code again. When we deal with sedition, we are not 
necessarily talking about whipping. I hope that is clear to members 
of the Reform Party. I know they love that kind of punishment and 
feel it should be meted out to teach people lessons.
<P>
	In this case we have to give people the right to be heard. That is 
an elementary principle of our criminal law system which I hope I 
do not have to repeat too often for hon. members opposite. It is one 
we have to follow in this House when we look at the facts of this 
case. I submit that the proper procedure is to refer this matter to the 
committee and allow the committee to hear evidence and come up 
with a determination as to whether or not sedition has occurred.
<P>
	The subamendment that has been proposed to the government's 
motion wants some words put back in. They have changed it a little 
bit. They have weakened slightly but they want ``seditious nature 
of the'' put in. I cannot tell this House how much I oppose this 
amendment.
<P>
	In my view, the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs is the proper place for a determination of the issues that are 
before the House in this motion. The whole matter should be 
referred to the committee for study without the House expressing 
its opinion on the merits or otherwise of the matter. That is the 
point which seems to have gone clear over the heads of hon. 
members opposite.
<P>
	I have tried to clarify this. Some of my colleagues on this side of 
the House have also tried to clarify it. I hope the point is now clear. 
We will vote against the subamendment. We will support the 
amendment. Once the motion is amended, I will be happy to 
support it.
<P>
	I know members of the Bloc Quebecois are nervous nellies over 
this issue. They have realized that one of their colleagues could be 
in trouble if the committee makes a finding that is contrary to their 
hon. colleague's best interests. That is a matter for the committee 
to decide.
<P>
	I am not going to argue the merits or demerits of this case one bit 
in the House. I am quite prepared, since I am a member of that 
committee, to wait and hear the evidence before the committee and 
make up my mind after I have heard the evidence. I will give the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg the benefit of the doubt, as any trier 
of law or fact in this country should do, as I am sure you would also 
do, Mr. Speaker, if you were sitting  on that committee. It is what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="734"> 734 </A></B>
<P>
any member of this House should do in the event the committee 
comes up with a report on the issue.
<P>
	The fact is that is the question which has to be decided. It will be 
decided in the committee, not here. I am not going to argue the 
merits of the case or even discuss the law relating to sedition in the 
course of my remarks. I want to stick with the procedure that is 
being followed in the House to ensure that we are treating one of 
our colleagues fairly by giving him the benefit of the doubt in terms 
of what may or may not have transpired in relation to these events. 
That is something we have to do. He is entitled to the benefit of a 
reasonable doubt, as is every person who is accused of an offence 
in Canada.
<P>
	I want to turn to some of the remarks made by hon. members 
opposite this afternoon in the course of their speeches on a subject 
that is dear to their hearts, including the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast. That is the issue of closure on this debate. They have 
suggested that by limiting debate today we are restricting the right 
of Canadians to hear about this very important subject.
<P>
	Normally I have opposed closure in the past and I usually do 
now. Our government has used it sparingly and only in cases where 
it is an obvious necessity. In this case there is no need for the debate 
to be a long one. This is a question of referring a matter to a 
committee for study. There will be a further opportunity to debate 
this matter when the committee reports to the House.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Hon. members opposite can rant and rave all they want about 
restrictions today. However, the fact is that some day, at some 
future time, assuming the motion carries, the procedure and House 
affairs committee will table a report in the House and somebody 
will move concurrence in that report triggering another debate in 
the House.
<P>
	There is a lot of opportunity for debate. There will be ample 
opportunity for committee hearings. If hon. members want to go to 
the committee to make their views known, I have no doubt the 
chairman and other members of the procedure and House affairs 
committee will entertain those applications to be heard. If members 
have such strong views on this and feel they can contribute 
evidence to the committee, I am sure they will be heard and I am 
sure they will want to be heard.
<P>
	This is not a motion on which closure is inappropriate, 
particularly given the amount of time we have already spent on the 
matter. I want to point out that when closure is applied under 
Standing Order 57 the House continues to sit until 11 o'clock at 
night. Mr. Speaker, you will recall that just a couple of weeks ago 
we heard hon. members opposite talk about the evils of closure.
<P>
	On Monday, March 4 the government imposed closure on a 
motion which allowed for the reinstatement of bills. I notice that 
hon. members opposite have reinstated  some of their own bills 
under the aegis of this great motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Even though they criticized it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> They thought it was the worst thing since I cannot 
recall what event. They were just appalled that the government 
would do this; yet, when they got the chance to reintroduce their 
private members' bills, up they got, chucked them in and said: ``We 
want this back to where it was at the beginning''. If they were 
principled they would have said: ``No, we will only take first 
reading of this bill and put it through all of the stages. We will go to 
the committee and try to have it made votable and we will take our 
chances on the draw and getting it on the order of precedence''. But 
that was not the way they proceeded. Once they saw the opening 
which was provided for them by a generous and beneficent Liberal 
government, they jumped into the loop.
<P>
	Let us go back to the debate of Monday, March 4. I recall some 
of the speeches because I was quoted extensively. I enjoyed the 
debate. I will not quote from my speech, but I will quote some of 
my colleagues opposite.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre made a wonderful speech. 
He said as recorded at page 214 of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That is anti-democratic and very autocratic. The use of closure which we just 
voted on is a violation of the freedom of speech within the House. It is a violation of 
the freedom to openly express our thoughts and our points of view. By limiting the 
debate, by limiting the time in which we can debate this, we are forcing members of 
Parliament to be quiet. We are allowing this freely, democratically elected Prime 
Minister to be a dictator and he is dictating to us by his very action.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What happened on March 4? What time did the House adjourn 
when there were no more speakers to stand up and speak on the 
motion? I have <I>Hansard</I> here for that day and my goodness, it tells 
us that the House adjourned at 7.25 p.m., and that was after some 
votes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Surely not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Yes. We had a 30 minute bell and then we had two 
votes. In other words, the debate collapsed essentially at 6.40 p.m. 
Of course we had not debated the motion all day. In the course of 
the afternoon we debated another matter. We debated concurrence 
in a committee report until about 6.15 p.m. or 6.20 p.m. Then there 
was a brief debate. Two members opposite spoke. Then there was a 
30 minute bell and then there were two votes.
<P>
	We could have debated until 11 o'clock at night, but we stopped 
at 7.30 p.m. Why did we stop? Because the Reformers apparently 
were not opposed to this. Their right to speak was apparently being 
cut off, according to the hon. member for Calgary Centre, who used 
to be the Reform whip, but when it came time for them to continue 
speaking, they strangely ran out of speakers. Is  it because it was so 
late? Do they not like speaking at night? What do they do at night? 
Why were they not here? I was here. I was ready to sit until 11 
o'clock but hon. members opposite were not. Where were they? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="735"> 735 </A></B>
<P>
Had they not come to Ottawa? Maybe they were still at home in 
Calgary. I do not know where the hon. members were.
<P>
	Let me read another quote into the record. This was said just 
before the bells started at 6.40 p.m. I know the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound was one of those who spoke that day. I 
could quote him too. I would like to, I just have to find the place.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Let me read from the other speech of the hon. member for 
Kootenay East, that most pious of speakers from the Reform Party. 
He has that very deep voice and he is able to make it sound so 
convincing. I know some hon. members get carried away when 
they hear the hon. member for Kootenay East. Had I stayed in the 
House throughout his speech I am sure I would have been 
transported myself.
<P>
	He said: ``This is a very sad way to start the second session of the 
35th Parliament of Canada''. In fact, as I recall he almost wept as 
he said those words. He said: ``We can only hope that the people of 
Canada will not pay attention but will talk to each other and say it is 
really Liberal, Tory, same old story''. He is quite a poet.
<P>
	I could also go back in the same speech on page 270 of <I>Hansard</I> 
where he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I suggest that the government has shown absolute and total contempt for the 
people of Canada in the way it has conducted the affairs on this, the very first 
motion of the second session of this Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yesterday that same member was pontificating in his grandest 
style when the deputy House leader came in and gave notice of 
closure on the debate we are discussing right now, in fact, the 
notice of the closure motion that we adopted earlier today.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kootenay East was interrupted in the 
course of his remarks. As was recorded on page 666 of <I>Hansard</I> he 
was in the middle of his speech. The government House leader 
interrupted him with notice of closure and the poor hon. member 
for Kootenay East almost had a fit. He said: ``Mr. Speaker, that is 
absolutely outrageous''. I heard him on television. He was simply 
beside himself that this was happening and yet let us watch the 
clock today.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know you are prepared to stay here until 11 p.m. 
and so am I. I am really looking forward to hearing speeches from 
members of the Reform Party until late into the night. If they say 
their rights are being trampled on and that their right to express 
their opinion on this matter is being cut off, I want to make sure 
that they take full advantage of the time that is available until 11 
p.m. to permit them to express their views.
<P>
	If they are not prepared to use it on this motion on which they 
claimed such outrage on March 4, I hate to think how little there 
will be today. In fact, I would be willing to wager that by about 6.40 
p.m. today they will stop. Do you know why? Because at 6.30 p.m. 
we cannot revert to the Government Orders that are called for 
today. As soon as we get past 6.30 p.m. they know they have used 
up the full government day and overtime after that is extra for a 
closure motion.
<P>
	I do not think they have enough members here to carry the 
debate anyway because guess what, their members do not think this 
is important and they have all gone home. That is what I think has 
happened. I am not saying they are not here in the House, I just 
think they have gone home. I do not blame them but some of us are 
going to stay and do our duty tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Hon. members opposite laugh but they do not 
realize that I will be here tomorrow for the day. It is a duty day for 
the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands and he will be here, 
Mr. Speaker, as I suspect you will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> I too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> My colleague, the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth will be spending the day here too. I expect 
there will be some members of the Reform Party here but the bulk 
of them do not give two hoots about this debate and they have gone 
home.
<P>
	I know western Canada is an attractive place to go but still if they 
thought this motion was so evil, why are they not here tonight 
staying until 11 p.m. debating this motion? Why are they not 
expressing their outrage and concern? I know why. They are not 
outraged or concerned. What we have here is a lot of crocodile 
tears.
<P>
	On Monday, March 4 let us look at the list of members from the 
Reform Party who expressed their great outrage at the fact that the 
government was using closure on that particular motion. We had 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre whom I have had the pleasure 
of quoting. The hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound made a 
wonderful speech. His speech consisted largely of quotes, I may 
say from me, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
and the hon. member for Halifax. He had a wonderful string of 
quotes. Indeed, we essentially wrote his speech for him.
<P>
	The hon. member for Edmonton Southwest was here and made a 
wonderful speech. The hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette spoke. 
The hon. member for Lethbridge charmed us with his utterances. 
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley went on at 
length, and then as I mentioned, the hon. member for Kootenay 
East closed the debate down four and a half hours before it was due 
to finish.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="736"> 736 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	There was a lot of time for them to speak. They had seven 
speakers. Each had a maximum of 20 minutes-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Seven out of 52. Not even 14 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> They all expressed their outrage. The hon. 
member for St. Boniface knows that when closure was used by the 
previous government and we found our time restricted, in almost 
every case we used up all the time available because we had so 
many members who were concerned and wanted to speak. But that 
does not seem to be the problem. They scream and howl that the 
government is doing something it should not but when it comes 
time to express their views at length, they seem to lose interest and 
the debate peters out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Fewer than 15 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> As my hon. colleague says, fewer than 15 per cent 
spoke. Hon. members opposite like to rant and fume and put on 
pious airs that somehow the government is doing something it 
should not. In fact, the government is doing this to help hon. 
members opposite out of a difficulty.
<P>
	If we did not use closure, Reform members would look as though 
they were not carrying the debate long enough if they let it go after 
four or five speeches, which is what they prefer to do. We used 
closure to give them a chance to say: ``The government is awful for 
doing this to us. Now we will just sit down and let things go and let 
the government have its way''. That is what they are really doing. 
We have seen it before and we see it today.
<P>
	We look forward to the events at 6.35 or 6.40 p.m., when I expect 
that members of the Reform Party will suddenly have had enough 
to say on this subject, the question will be put and the House will 
adjourn until tomorrow.
<P>
	I am sorry that hon. members opposite take such a cavalier view. 
I hope members of the Canadian public who will no doubt be 
watching their clocks at 6.30 p.m. will observe this behaviour on 
the part of the Reform Party and realize that all the drivel we have 
been listening to yesterday and today is so much crocodile tears 
and is completely phoney.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I seek the unanimous consent of the 
House, if it would be agreeable to the previous speaker, to have 
questions or comments of that particular member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from the Reform Party who spoke 
just before me asked: ``What are the motivations of the 
government?'' I would like to address  this issue. Given the current 
political situation, there is something quite strange about both the 
motion put forward by the Reform Party and the amendment 
proposed by the Liberal Party. You will remember that, after the 
referendum, Mr. Bouchard promised to stop, for a while, to focus 
on the referendum in order to put Quebec's fiscal house in order.
<P>
	But strangely enough, ever since Mr. Bouchard made that 
commitment, federalists have made a whole series of statements 
which all seem aimed at bringing the referendum issue back again 
for debate and at putting Quebec in its place. For two days now, we 
have been discussing a motion we did not put forward and which 
brings us back to the referendum issue. In fact, the motion before 
the House today is only the latest element in this long series of 
statements.
<P>
	Why do we see so many strange things in the strategy our 
colleagues have been developing in the last few months? 
Maybe-and this might enlighten the Reform Party-it is because 
they have a hard time swallowing the close outcome of the last 
referendum.
<P>
	The House will recall that, immediately after the referendum, the 
Prime Minister, in what was probably a last-minute strategy, tabled 
here at the end of the session a motion to recognize Quebec's 
distinct society and a bill on the veto power. The motion, of course, 
does not bind the current or future governments or the courts, and 
the veto power, as any bill, can be revoked any time. Both were 
obviously in line with the Prime Minister's thinking, which is, as 
he said himself in the House: ``Everybody knows that I am French 
when I speak English; I do not have to write that down in the 
Constitution.''
<P>
	Quebecers saw both of those things for what they really are, that 
is, smoke screens and meaningless attempts.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	This is why, in spite of strategies, the sovereignist option is still 
on the rise in the polls, and more and more people, in Quebec as 
well as in Canada, are now convinced that Quebec's sovereignty is 
inevitable.
<P>
	Why do sovereignists think that? Because they know Mr. 
Bourassa was right when he said that the status quo would be the 
worst answer for Quebec, and the status quo is what is offered to 
Quebec. Also because they remember Mr. Trudeau promising to 
put his government's seats at stake if there were no change, and 
they are fully aware that they cannot rely on that kind of promises.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister did not learn a lesson from the referendum, 
the Canadian people did, forcing the Liberal Party to hurriedly 
review its strategy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian people understood what was going on. Everybody 
now knows that the Prime Minister of Canada  and the chief of the 
Conservative Party do not speak for Quebec any more. They both 
lost the referendum in their ridings. How can a man promise

anything for Quebec when he is not able to give any guarantee at all 
concerning his own riding?
<P>
	Before the referendum, the Prime Minister was asking for 
support from his troops, his allies in Quebec, which is 
understandable, from his opponents in the House, the Conservative 
Party, and even from the Reform Party which he had made fun of 
for about two years. However, everyone knows that a man who 
needs to be supported is a man who is falling down.
<P>
	The weakness of the Prime Minister had to be concealed as much 
as possible. A scapegoat had to be found to explain the unexpected 
result of the referendum. Mr. Ouellet, the then Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, pointed his finger at Mr. Daniel Johnson in Quebec and 
said: ``We almost lost the referendum because this man was not 
passionate enough about Canada''. I just want to remind the people 
and especially my friends from the Reform Party that Mr. Ouellet 
never came to Quebec during the referendum and did not even vote. 
That is how passionate he was about Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Realizing that this strategy did not work, the Prime Minister 
announced a cabinet shuffle. To solve the problem, so it seems, 
because it is all part of a strategy, he appointed Stéphane Dion, the 
present Liberal candidate in Saint-Laurent-Cartierville, as the 
new Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Who is this man? A 
hard liner who always talks about plan B. He is the one who tells 
us, and I quote: ``I am coming to change the reality''-nothing 
less-``I will be the architect of the great national reconstruction''.
<P>
	He is the one who said, before the referendum, as we remember, 
that no promises should be made to Quebec because, according to 
an infallible mathematical model, it was impossible that 
sovereigntists would get more than 42 per cent of the vote. This 
man will be the government's strategist. It is easy to understand 
why their strategy is slightly flawd.
<P>
	He is the one who said, in Toronto, before the referendum 
debate, and Quebecers will not forget: ``The more we hurt 
Quebecers, the more support for sovereignty will drop''.
<P>
	If he is elected in Saint-Laurent-Cartierville, it will be the first 
time a member from Quebec, paid by Quebecers to defend their 
interests, will come to Ottawa to hurt Quebec.
<P>
	The fact that the Prime Minister has chosen such a man to be 
responsible for the great national reconciliation, a man who 
displays so much contempt for the people he would represent, 
shows just how much the Prime Minister was dreaming and how 
far reconciliation  is out of the picture, despite the fine words of the 
speech from the throne.
<P>
	Things like that can happen only in Quebec. We would never see 
an hon. member from British Columbia elected on the promise that 
he will have Western Canada suffer, but we see it in Quebec. We 
see it because members of Parliament who are elected to the House 
of Commons as members of the major political parties, when they 
have to choose between Ottawa's interests and Quebec's interests, 
will always choose Ottawa. We had the best example of that 
recently in the House, when our colleague from Sherbrooke tried to 
work out an alliance with the Reform Party. He is a member from 
Quebec, paid to defend Quebec's interests, but nonetheless, he tried 
to form an alliance with our friends from the Reform Party to 
deprive the Bloc Quebecois, the only party in this House that really 
defends Quebec's interests, of its status as official opposition. But 
there are many more examples of decisions and stands that go 
against Quebec. I would like to enumerate a few.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Before the motion we are debating today, we heard a series of 
utteerly absurd statements from followers of our Prime Minister. 
Of course, there were the infamous text by Mr. Trudeau, which 
begins ``I accuse'', and I remind you that people who have 
responded to it are not sovereignists, but federalists from Quebec. 
Mr. Bourassa responded to Mr. Trudeau by saying: ``If Mr. Trudeau 
was so vehemently opposed to Meech, it may be because he did not 
want to admit he was wrong in 1981 and in 1982''. Mr. Johnson 
also responded to Mr. Trudeau by saying: ``Mr. Trudeau has no 
doubt forgotten his opposition to Meech and to Charlottetown, and 
considering what he did in 1982, we should forget Mr. Trudeau''.
<P>
	The Indian affairs minister made some fairly inflammatory 
statements, which I will not repeat in this House. Who responded to 
him? The response did not come from sovereignists, but from the 
leader of the Assembly of First Nations himself, Mr. Mercredi, and 
I quote: ``The Indian affairs minister is not speaking on behalf of 
the aboriginal people, so when he raises the possibility of 
violence'', because that was the issue, ``and of retaliation, I 
disapprove of him. He should mind his own business, which means 
fulfilling his obligations to the aboriginal people. He should not 
consider himself as an aboriginal leader because he is not''.
<P>
	We also had statements by the Minister of Transport regarding 
Mirabel, because it is a hot issue these days. He said this, and I will 
simply quote these few words: ``The phasing out of Mirabel by the 
Montreal airports authority is a consequence of separatism, which 
has caused the economic downfall of the city''. In this case, it is our 
friend Mordecai Richler who responded to that  statement in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="738"> 738 </A></B>
<P>
passage from his book <I>Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!</I> Here is what 
Mordecai Richler said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Once the St. Lawrence seaway was in place, Montreal's slippage 
was inevitable''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
That is when Montreal's slippage started. Finally, we had some 
bizarre statements by Mr. Dion, who said that ``Quebec sovereignty 
could lead to a conflagration in Africa, a conflagration in Asia and 
could hurt Europe''. In this case, nobody responded. Such 
statement was not worth responding to.
<P>
	Finally, we get to the motion we have been debating for two and 
a half days and the amendment proposed by the Liberal Party. Of 
course, all my colleagues have examined this issue very carefully, 
they have looked at it from all sides. They have taken out their 
dictionaries, because of the seriousness of the words, they have 
considered all the facts, and I think now that they will be able to 
vote on this issue.
<P>
	I would just like to say in closing that before voting for or 
against this motion and this amendment, members should keep 
things in perspective. First, what we have in this text, this 
communiqué, is a sovereignist vision. We are, after all, a 
sovereignist party. Second, this is not a statement that was made 
just like that, without thinking. We gave it thought before issuing it 
and all of us in the Bloc Quebecois are behind our colleague from 
Charlesbourg.
<P>
	Third, our electoral platform was and is still very clear: it is first 
of all to defend the interests of Quebec, and second, just as clearly, 
to promote sovereignty. We firmly believe, even if this is not the 
opinion of everyone here in this House, that after 40 years of 
debate, sovereignty for Quebec is definitely the only solution for 
Quebec and for Canada.
<P>
	Fourth, I would like my colleagues to remember that we have 
been elected to this House, that we have been through an election, 
on this platform and that we have been elected to do what we said 
we would. I would also like my colleagues to remember that we 
have always respected all the rules of this House and all the rules 
imposed on us as citizens. I do not think that anyone in this House 
can deny this fact.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Finally, I would like people to be aware that the letter from my 
colleague from Charlesbourg tells Quebecers currently in the 
Canadian Armed Forces what they would be offered in a sovereign 
Quebec. Contrary to what certain members of the Reform Party 
think-not all, perhaps, but I have heard at least two references to a 
call to arms when there is no call to violence involved at all-this is 
well thought out information being transmitted to people who will 
be voting on our political  agenda. On the strength of that alone, 
there is nothing to generate discussion.
<P>
	I would like people to reflect upon the fact that dragging our 
colleague before a committee to examine the circumstances 
involved means putting his motives on trial, for there is nothing in 
this document to justify taking it to committee. If that decision is 
made, there will be a political price to pay. Quebecers, whether 
federalists or sovereignists, know full well that the decision to 
shape their own future, their own destiny, is theirs and theirs alone, 
and that aCommons committee has no say in the matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
start this evening by reflecting on a letter I received from my old 
office nurse. When I was a young physician in practice this nurse 
guided me in my early years. She was experienced. She was a good 
friend. She is a very moderate woman, a woman whose advice and 
ideas I admire. I quote from a portion of her letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Grant, I am so fed up with allowing men and women free reign in Parliament 
to use any means to promote sovereignty. When they do wrong they should be 
charged with treason.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This from a woman who is so moderate, so kind, so gentle, so 
typically Canadian. Reformers have placed on the table that charge.
<P>
	I also quote a recent editorial by Peter Stockland of the Calgary 
<I>Sun</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whatever internal squabbling might be racking the Reform Party, we're 
comforted its MPs still know the real enemy when they see it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That was demonstrated yesterday when Reformers fought furiously to keep 
Bloc Quebecois MP Jean-Marc Jacob from taking a-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is the second occasion 
in the last hour on which we have had quotes read regarding the 
important subject matter with which the House is presently seized. 
With the greatest respect to all members participating in this 
important debate, I ask for your indulgence and your co-operation.
<P>
	The most brief and concise explanation I can give is that in the 
House we cannot do indirectly what we cannot do directly. I think 
we all understand, as we are all knowledgeable in the 35th 
Parliament, that we cannot name another member. We must always 
refer to his or her seat by the riding, or in the government's case 
possibly by portfolio if a ministry is involved.
<P>
	I seek the co-operation of all members in this debate so that we 
can maintain it in very respectful parliamentary fashion, which has 
been the case since we arrived here in this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for that reminder. 
My apologies.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="739"> 739 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That was demonstrated yesterday when Reformers fought furiously to keep-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-the hon. member for Charlesbourg-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-from taking a key post on the Commons defence committee. This member, 
of course, is the separatist jack-a-nape who sent out a letter out during last 
year's referendum urging francophone Canadian soldiers to switch to a 
Quebec army in the event of independence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Outrageously, the Bloc put him forward for the committee 
vice-chairmanship.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even worse, Liberals on the committee were prepared to go along with this 
gross insult to everyone who's ever served in this country's military.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Next is a rather unparliamentary comment and so I will change 
it: ``Only some very vigorous defence by Reformers forced the 
member to withdraw his name''. Indeed he did withdraw his name. 
``Even so, the post was eventually filled by another Bloc member, 
again with Liberal collaboration.
<P>
	``Having won at least half the battle, though, the B.C. Reformer 
for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt has shown he is determined 
to press on in the political war against such separatist infamies. 
That Reform member put forward a motion in the Commons to 
have the member for Charlesbourg investigated for behaviour that 
is seditious, offensive and contemptuous of Parliament.
<P>
	``More Liberal skulduggery kept that from being full debated, 
but Reformers would not let it drop. Good for him'', says the 
editorial, ``and good for the party that is supporting his initiative.''
<P>
	``It is difficult these days to sort out everything Reformers have 
to say on both economic and social issues, given the long 
simmering divisions that finally emerged this week between its 
right wing and centrist factions.''
<P>
	``But as even those most involved in that dispute acknowledge, 
resolution of their differences is a matter of the party's full blown 
policy convention in June. For the moment it is enough to know 
they are united where it counts, against the enemies of Canada''.
<P>
	That editorial sums up why were are here today and why I am 
speaking on the issue. I reflect on the way the sovereignty debate 
has gone on. The Bloc and its PQ cousins have said to their credit 
that this debate should be entirely democratic, that they would be 
forthright in their approach on sovereignty and would tell and 
express the facts exactly as they were.
<P>
	I draw the attention of the Canadian people to two huge flaws in 
those statements. The sovereignty referendum was designed to be 
and followed by a period of attempted reconciliation between 
sovereignists and the rest of Canada. The timeframe, 
approximately a year. If  there was no new relationship with 
Canada to be established, sovereignty would follow.
<P>
	I read and watched the sovereignty debate. That position was 
repeated over and over. I asked my Bloc colleagues specifically and 
directly to explain to me how then could diplomats in Canada be 
asked to immediately accept a sovereign Quebec if there had been a 
positive result in the referendum. What does that have to do with 
negotiation? What does that have to do with honesty in a question? 
There was no concept of such negotiation. There was no such 
concept of an honest question.
<P>
	On the issue of a call to Quebec armed forces members to change 
their allegiance, that was what the member for Charlesbourg said. I 
do not care who talks around the issue, that is what the letter said 
plainly, straightforward and specific. Au lendemain, the day after. 
What does that have to do with negotiation? What does that have to 
do with a year's process to see if Canada and Quebec could come 
up with a new relationship? Nothing, zero, zip.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Canada is a tolerant country. Canada virtually tolerates 
everything. I will go to another specific incident from the 
sovereignist camp that I consider to be dishonest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have here a chart that appeared in <I>L'Actualité</I> on May 15, 1991 
showing the winners and the losers in Confederation, the provinces 
that won and the ones that did not. According to it, and the Bloc 
members can have a look, we can see that three provinces paid: 
British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. The other provinces 
received money in Confederation. Quebec received $304 per 
capita. The chart is very very clear. It appeared in <I>L'Actualité</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
member once again. I realize he is quoting from an article. That is 
well and fine but I do not believe we would want to encourage the 
practice of presenting it in such a way that it becomes a prop. I ask 
the member to simply refer to the text in the normal fashion of 
quoting from it as we would any other source.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is fine. The three 
provinces paying money are clearly red, the others are a different 
colour. The amount they paid is in brackets. It is very clear. I have a 
Quebec school book, it contains the same chart found in the May 
15, 1991 edition of <I>L'Actualité</I>.
<P>
	A different text with this chart indicates simply the amount of 
the per capita equalization payment in 1990. The three provinces in 
the earlier chart which paid in Confederation are no longer colour
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="740"> 740 </A></B>
<P>
coded. The chart has been changed. Why? So that young people in 
Quebec  believe that their province is the least favoured in 
Confederation. It is not true. Debate is not possible if the 
information is inaccurate.
<P>
	An honest debate is required with each Bloc member, but there is 
no honesty if the information is inaccurate. I called the Quebec 
minister of education to say the information was wrong-it can 
happen. The answer? Zip. I got the same answer from the editors of 
the school book. The young people are short circuited. It is not true.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If we are to have a debate on sovereignty, the information we 
debate must be accurate and honest. I cannot allow a debate to be 
dishonest in the House.
<P>
	Where do the Liberals stand on the issue of sedition? Why was 
there not rapid action on the issue? Could it be the Liberals would 
rather not have the issue debated plainly? I certainly hope not. 
Have there been examples of colleagues from the government 
favouring the Bloc over Reform? Let me cite a few.
<P>
	We asked to sing the national anthem in these halls. Too hot. We 
asked for the opportunity to have committee vice-chairs, as it states 
in the rules that an opposition member and not an official 
opposition member should have that opportunity. Too hot.
<P>
	Turning to truth on social programs, the other day in the House 
the finance minister said that Reform would cut $11 billion from 
medicare. That statement was wrong and inaccurate. I challenge 
any Canadian to look at our taxpayers' budget to see a specific 
reduction in the highest priority Reform program of $800 million. 
How could the finance minister manufacture $11 billion from that?
<P>
	My Liberal colleagues will take $4.3 billion from the Canada 
health and social transfer payments to the provinces. If the Reform 
were to take all the same transfers it would take $1.5 billion, and 
we are criticized as being the slash and burn party. It is sad but the 
Canadian public will eventually learn these facts.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois are in the House democratically. The 
democratic processes in Canada placed them here. I am able to say 
I like the individual members of the Bloc. I have conversations 
with them. They are fine men and women. I believe their ideas are 
completely wrong and I will debate this vigorously with them. 
However individually I have no problem with any of them.
<P>
	The same democratic processes that brought them to the House 
will also take them from the House. I challenge them to be honest 
in their debates, to say exactly what they mean, and when the 
Canadian people vote they will be taken from these halls as 
separatists. I hope some of them will stay in these halls as 
committed Canadians.
<P>
	I close by asking the Liberals not to soften the motion. I ask back 
bench Liberal MPs to stand up for Canada. If inciting soldiers to 
change their allegiance is not sedition, what is?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to ask 
unanimous consent of the House to delete Standing Orders 78 and 
57.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
request of the hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke. Is 
there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I was elected to the House of Commons, I never 
thought I would have to speak to a motion like this one. They 
taught me in school what sedition means and the seriousness of that 
word.
<P>
	The Reform Party presented a motion which is unfounded and 
not supported by facts, but which has dangerous negative effects 
because it challenges the right to democratic debate.
<P>
	One could say that the motion may have been presented because 
the Reform Party does not know Quebec well enough, because in 
the end it is a very bad political move for a party to attack the 
democratic value of decisions made in Quebec. This is certainly 
not the right way to obtain support in Quebec. All Quebecers know 
that the referendum debate, held in the fall of 1995, was democratic 
and quite proper. The opponents may have been serious, they may 
have been rough, but the debate was clear.
<P>
	I believe Quebecers made a choice with full knowledge of all the 
different issues at stake. There were questions on the future of 
federal public servants. What would their future be? The yes 
committee answered the questions and indicated what guarantees it 
could give them, what their situation would be like in the future. 
Members of the armed forces asked similar questions. The 
committee for the yes answered their questions. The committee for 
the no answered their questions. This is no sedition material.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, in Quebec, nobody was offended by this 
statement. It did not stir up any passionate debate. Nobody said the 
Canadian government was being overthrown. A clear choice was 
made in Quebec many years ago with the emergence of the 
sovereignist movement, which has been in existence for at least 25, 
30 or 35 years. Democracy would prevail.
<P>
	In 1980, we accepted and lived with the results. Forty per cent of 
the people had voted yes. Mr. Lévesque, who was the sovereignist 
leader, said only: ``À la  prochaine''. We took note of the results. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="741"> 741 </A></B>
<P>
We tried to make changes in the federal system. We supported the 
Conservative Party in Quebec and took ``le beau risque'' in the 
hope of amending the Constitution, but it did not work. Quebecers 
sent sovereignists to Ottawa as the official opposition, and they 
elected a sovereignist government in Quebec City.
<P>
	Our traditions are democratic, which makes us trust the position 
of people, and we will continue to trust people in the future.
<P>
	I have nothing against the Reformers. In a sense, we see there is 
a blatant lack of knowledge of Quebec in this motion. I could just 
tell them that this should be a lesson to them, because if they repeat 
this once or twice, well-We wonder what their objectives are. Do 
they need a bigger following? Why have they moved this motion 
when there is no substance to the issue itself?
<P>
	What I do have a problem with, however, is this government, the 
Liberal Party of Canada, supporting the merits of the question, the 
merits of the motion before us, by proposing a purely cosmetic 
change, an amendment that will in no way prevent the member in 
question-who, as far as I am concerned, cannot be accused of 
sedition in any way, shape or form-from being hauled up in front 
of the committee. Nowhere does the Liberal Party say that it does 
not want the matter to be referred to committee. The only thing this 
amendment does is to delete the part of the motion that has no real 
impact.
<P>
	In that sense, in light of Liberal tradition and given the fact that it 
has ruled the country for many years since Confederation, the 
Liberal Party of Canada is acting very reprehensibly in making 
such a decision.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It should have clearly rejected right off the bat this hare-brained, 
unacceptable proposal with no basis in reality. I am sure that the 
Liberal Party of Canada will have to pay the political price for this 
in the future.
<P>
	There is also what I would call perhaps the subliminal or 
somewhat perverse impact of this proposal. We as Bloc members 
might think that this is a way to influence the future. They are 
going to give a hard time to anyone making statements, however 
appropriate, so that, during the next debate on the national issue, 
they will all be afraid to speak out for fear of being accused of 
fomenting sedition.
<P>
	You can be sure that this will not fly in Quebec. No Bloc member 
will leave this House with a guilt complex or feel that he or she 
should not say certain things regarding Quebec's future. For 25, 30 
or 35 years-5 or 10 years in the case of younger members-we 
have fought to make sure that we will always be free to decide our 
future with full knowledge of the facts. We have turned Quebec 
voters into intelligent voters, voters with an extensive knowledge 
of politics who make choices  accordingly. And you can rest 
assured that we will continue to do so. When over 90 per cent of the 
population votes in a referendum, one cannot say that unacceptable 
threats were made.
<P>
	Given what Reformers are implying, and what Liberals are 
supporting, could it be that, in six months, if a Bloc member says 
something about submarines it might viewed as a seditious 
statement? Will that statement be viewed as an attempt to have the 
army or the navy turn against Canada? This makes no sense at all. 
If we try to recover tax points, is that going to be interpreted as a 
measure to break up the country? Tax points have existed for 30 or 
35 years. Mr. Duplessis got them through the democratic process.
<P>
	As regards the Canada Health Act, if Quebec makes choices that 
differ from the national standards that the federal government 
wants to impose, would that be seditious, since it would not comply 
with the will of Ottawa? There is no end to that. It is imperative that 
this motion be soundly defeated. Otherwise, parties supporting it 
will have contributed to a lowering of the quality of democratic 
debate in Canada. This is unacceptable, and it is not what 
Quebecers and Canadians want. The resilience of a political system 
depends on the quality of its democracy. When democracy is 
respected, the decisions and the outcome of the political process 
are accepted.
<P>
	In the 1995 referendum, the yes side got 49.4 per cent of the 
vote. Had our democratic system not been very strong, there could 
have been a temptation, like what happened when other countries 
became independent, to say that the results were not credible and 
that all voters were not informed. It did not happen in Quebec. We 
all accepted the outcome, and I think Quebecers have demonstrated 
the quality of their democracy and their determination to have an 
interesting democratic life.
<P>
	Speaking from my personal experience, I cannot help but notice 
a striking difference between this motion and the contacts I have 
had with Canadians.
<P>
	Last year, for example, I spoke to the Rotary Club in Edmonton. 
We had a discussion with federalists who are Canadians with strong 
convictions and who believe in the future of this country. We had a 
very straightforward discussion on our vision and theirs. We 
probably even talked about the army. But none of the Canadians 
who were there said I was being seditious for saying that, once 
independent, Quebec would respect international agreements, 
would have a small army and ensure that people with some military 
expertise could continue to work in that field within the Quebec 
military if they wanted to do so. We never asked that the army rise 
up against the Canadian government. That is pure fabrication.
<P>

<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	A word of caution is in order here. This must happen again. 
Basically, blowing situations like these out of all proportion 
amounts to manipulating information. Indeed, there is an old 
saying that goes something like this: people will believe that an 
untruth, if repeated often enough, is the truth. Parliament, and all 
the members of this House who are looking at this situation and 
have actually read the communiqué, should send a clear message.
<P>
	We can speak in legal terms. Under the law, to be blamed with 
something, that something must have had an impact somewhere. 
Have you seen even one French speaking soldier from Quebec 
stand up and decide that he would support the Government of 
Quebec? I do not know why he would have done something like 
that, because the government accepted the outcome of the 
referendum. So, the motion before us is unwarranted. This is quite 
amazing.
<P>
	In a court, as we have seen in civil court already, I do not think a 
judge would have found that there were grounds for prosecution. I 
think the House should come to the same conclusion. We are like a 
grand jury here. We will be accused of not doing our job properly, 
if we go through with this. This is why I say the Liberal amendment 
seems quite bland. We do need to use parliamentary expressions, 
but this makes for a wishy-washy position.

	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I said bland.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I can understand that 
everybody wants to take part at a certain point in the debate, but I 
hope that this will be done in accordance with parliamentary rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite aware that your comment 
does not necessarily apply to me, and I will continue to speak in the 
most appropriate way possible.
<P>
	Moreover, we are setting a precedent here, a highly inappropriate 
one. Once you cry wolf, the next time you cry wolf, the rule may no 
longer apply, even if the situation warrants it. In view of the 
significance of the Standing Order referred to, we recognize that 
the charge is serious, but that the crown's case is terribly weak. 
Besides, Reform's argument did not deal with that, or only very 
little. They discussed all kinds of other things connected with how 
they perceive Quebec, but they do not have a real case here.
<P>
	Therefore, it is important, I think, that we get out of this debate, 
that is once all speakers have been heard, that we come back to 
issues of real concern to Quebecers and Canadians, so that people 
feel that we are really doing our jobs as politicians. Moreover, this 
will give us a chance to increase the level of trust in politicians. 
You can be sure that it is not a proposition like the Reform  Party's 
motion that will increase Canadians' level of trust in their 
politicians, which now stands at 4 per cent. We have to demonstrate 
how responsible we are.
<P>
	As you know, Tuesday was supposed to be an allotted day on 
unemployment insurance reform. I was looking forward to it. No 
matter what we decide on this subject, at least we were talking 
about something everybody was aware of, about which everybody 
is talking to us on the street in our towns. It is a constant concern 
for them.
<P>
	Is anyone in Canada, apart from the Reform Party, concerned 
about attempted sedition by a member of Parliament? I have not 
heard of anybody who has. Nobody had that impression. Nobody 
warned of a possible uprising. It existed only in the minds of 
certain people, and I believe it is high time we called an end to this 
debate.
<P>
	It is also important to realize that we are dealing with age-old 
behaviours, also described in a book called <I>Portrait du colonisé</I>, 
whereby the colonizer often attempts to make the colonized 
peoples feel guilty, to penalize them.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	This is what happened in Africa during colonial times; Africans 
were told it was their fault if development was not working, it was 
up to them to find out was why it was not working. That was how 
people behaved then.
<P>
	A Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, once said that he 
was not sure whether Quebecers would be able to take on their 
responsibilities as a democracy because they needed a big brother, 
another government, another Parliament to guarantee their future 
well-being. Those are old tricks and one of them is being used here. 
The motion comes from an opposition party ,but is also supported 
by the government when it says that it only wants to amend it and 
wishes it to be referred to a committee.
<P>
	We must not forget that in the end what is in question is the 
reputation of a member of Parliament, someone who did his job in 
full cognizance, in good faith, and with the intent to inform his 
fellow citizens of the facts. Each member must realize that. Let us 
try to see if there is something in what he said to inform the people, 
to convince them of an idea, that could have been maliciously 
twisted around and presented as an illegal and unacceptable act.
<P>
	If the House adopts this motion in its present form, if it adopts 
the amendment of the Liberals and the motion of the Reform Party, 
it will not have shown sufficient respect for the member concerned, 
because the seriousness of the situation is such that no one should 
be submitted to this type of accusation unless it is clearly the case, 
unless the facts warrant it. For now, no one has convinced us in any 
way that there is a case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="743"> 743 </A></B>
<P>
	To conclude, I would say that this whole situation resulted from 
a certain feeling of uneasiness, because many people in Canada 
realize that Quebec is on its way, and they are trying to find a 
way to stop it. It is somewhat comparable to the case of a teenager 
who becomes an adult. He wants to leave home and be 
independent but his parents are a little worried. At first they try 
to control his or her behaviour with arguments, then with threats 
such as ``we will no longer help you'', etc.
<P>
	Now, Canada realizes that Quebec is determined to achieve its 
sovereignty and that it is going to do so over the next few years. 
Therefore, we now have the aggressive reaction which aims at 
penalizing. We always come back to the old notion of the colonized 
and the colonizer: to penalize is another trick, but it will not work, 
because the people of Quebec have reached a level of political 
maturity which is beyond that. We are above such things.
<P>
	At the present time, Quebec is working hard on a reconciliation 
between anglophones, francophones and allophones, to make sure 
that the plan that could not be brought to fruition the last time will 
get a sufficient majority the next time. It will take two, three or four 
years more, but we will have the bases to do so. We will have 
convinced people with real arguments, which is what we really 
want.
<P>
	In my opinion, if hon. members really want to do their part as 
supporters of Canadian federalism, they should avoid measures 
like this one, which will have an opposite result in Quebec. Let 
them show us that Canada can develop. Let them show us that there 
could be another way to proceed in Canada. Let them show us that 
Quebecers could control their development and be recognized as a 
people, and then the hon. members who support Canadian 
federalism will really have made their point, and might convince 
Quebecers that they have the best answer. That would be so much 
more convincing than negative measures like this motion.
<P>
	So, even if this motion will not determine Quebec's future, it 
will still be another argument Quebecers will be able to invoke. Let 
us not forget conscription.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Let us remember the night of the long knives in 1982. We can 
add this to the list. If the House condemns one of its members who 
acted in good faith, we will add that to Canada's liabilities. It will 
be one more reason for Quebecers to choose to be sovereign, to 
come to terms with themselves as a nation. They will choose to 
have a democratic state where actions such as the tabling of this 
motion, as we have seen in this House, will not exist.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish there were questions and comments. Instead of 
making a speech I would love to respond to  some of the comments 
made by the various people who have spoken today.
<P>
	The previous speaker mentioned that we are trying to prevent 
Quebec's future; that the people of Quebec have reached a level of 
maturity where they almost did the right thing. In other words, he is 
saying that the separatists keep asking the people of Quebec if they 
are ready for separation and they keep giving the wrong answer. 
But the separatists are going to keep asking the question until they 
finally get it right.
<P>
	He talks about the people of Quebec almost reaching a level of 
maturity where they can make the right decision. That is the first 
time I have heard somebody who claims to represent Quebec stand 
up to call the people of Quebec-the voters of Quebec who, 
whatever their wisdom, sent the Bloc Quebecois here-immature. 
Basically the hon. member is putting them on notice to get it right 
the next time. That is really interesting.
<P>
	What is at question here is not whether the Bloc Quebecois dealt 
with some vague question about the future of public servants in an 
independent Quebec, should such a thing ever come into existence. 
Bloc members were not saying: ``If after a yes vote in the 
referendum and if after we negotiate with Canada, as we said we 
would do for a period of a year, we cannot come to terms and if 
ultimately we go through the necessary steps toward independence 
and achieve it, at that time this is what we anticipate doing in terms 
of the military. These are the opportunities that we expect to offer 
to the people of Quebec who have a military background and who 
wish to be part of the military in the new Quebec. This is the way 
we will deal with it''.
<P>
	That is not what the letter stated. That was stated very clearly by 
my hon. colleague from Macleod earlier today. This is not about 
after separation. This is not about after negotiation. This is about 
the next day, the day after the vote.
<P>
	The separatists have gone to the people of Quebec and have said: 
``We want your permission to negotiate with Canada for a year on 
new terms for Quebec. If we cannot resolve anything with Canada, 
then we will ultimately look at sovereignty''. That is not what that 
letter indicated.
<P>
	We have not heard from the author of that letter. He has not said: 
``You have mistaken my intention'' or ``I have not properly written 
this letter. This is what I really meant''. The letter was clear and 
unequivocal. It said: ``The next day we want you to renounce your 
relationship with Canada and swear allegiance to Quebec''. The 
implication was scary.
<P>
	Many times Bloc Quebecois members have said: ``We are going 
to unilaterally make certain decisions. If you do not do what we 
want you to do, we are not going to pick up our share of the debt''. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="744"> 744 </A></B>
<P>
That was one of the  many real threats which was issued by the 
members of that party.
<P>
	I hope the people of Quebec will reconsider who they have sent 
to Ottawa to represent them. Bloc Quebecois members say they are 
here to represent the people who sent them here; the majority of 
people in Quebec. They state that their sole purpose is to represent 
Quebec's dreams of separation and sovereignty. If that is the case 
and its members have two-thirds of the seats in Quebec, when only 
49 per cent of the people in Quebec support them, maybe we have 
to question that we have too many people from the Bloc here. I 
hope the people of Quebec will take notice of this debate and I hope 
those in the ridings where there is a byelection will take notice and 
maybe reconsider who should be representing their real interests in 
Quebec; the people who want to take them from Canada with a lot 
of false promises and how they will still have all the benefits of 
being Canadian while being an independent country, versus the 
people who come here and refer to those who did not get it right in 
the referendum yet as being immature. I guess they are referring to 
those immature people who sent them here to Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Members talk about how this is an overblown motion, how it has 
been taken way out of proportion and that there has been nothing 
done that would call for the censure of a member. Has this 
happened before or even recently? Has there been any question of 
contempt of Parliament brought before the House?
<P>
	It happened in February of this new session. The hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the chief government whip, 
thought there were things in this Parliament that called for 
contempt of Parliament charges. The hon. member from the Bloc 
Quebecois wrote to members of the military and stated that the day 
after the referendum they wanted them to swear allegiance to 
Quebec, to support Quebec, to protect Quebec.
<P>
	Let us compare that to what the government claims it thinks are 
reasonable grounds for contempt of the House. The Liberals said 
the Reform member for Lethbridge had the audacity to ask the 
voters of Canada to express their opinion with regard to a decision 
being made in the House and to convey those opinions to the 
Speaker of the House. How dare they ask anybody to be 
democratically open in voicing their opinions in the House. What a 
contemptible thing. That is the Liberal's point of view. They say it 
is absolutely disgusting that the Reform party would ask Canadians 
for their opinions. How bad did they think this was? They thought it 
was pretty bad.
<P>
	In our motion we have asked that this be presented to committee 
for study. We have asked specifically that it be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for 
examination to see if the committee  would agree there is a problem 
and some action should be taken. Someone is suggesting members 
of the Canadian military should swear allegiance to a new group 
even before they have separated from Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Liberal Party suggested what the 
Reform Party did was so reprehensible it should not even go to 
committee, that the member should be called before the bar of the 
House. With no hearings whatsoever call him before the bar and 
admonish him from the Chair. I can see the Liberals have very 
strange priorities.
<P>
	A colleague mentioned at length today some things the Liberals 
have done to show how they have sided with the Bloc Quebecois. 
Why should we be surprised they feel it is worse that we ask 
Canadians for their opinion than the Bloc Quebecois asking some 
members of the Canadian military to swear allegiance to someone 
other than the Canadian government?
<P>
	We heard an interesting little Mutt and Jeff routine a little earlier 
today when the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands did his 
little routine with one of his colleagues. He spoke about closure and 
about why we railed so much because they had brought in closure.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that his party did the exact same thing 
when the Conservatives did it while on that side of the House. They 
have already done it three times more than the Conservatives and 
we are only half way through this questionable Liberal mandate. I 
will not even get into why I say questionable. They know what 
promises they made and they know what the realities are.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> I see Jeff is back already. I do not know where Mutt 
is but Jeff is back carrying on with his routine without his partner.
<P>
	A short time ago I asked for unanimous consent to delete 
Standing Orders 78 and 57. There was a great scurrying of little 
furry feet and other types too, I suppose. They came scurrying out 
from points beyond shouting: ``No, no, no. We cannot have that''.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	For those Canadians watching the debate what I was asking for 
in the request for unanimous consent to delete Standing Orders 78 
and 57 should have pleased the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands. I was asking for them to cancel the motion to invoke 
closure. The Liberals say the Reform Party is getting wound up 
about nothing, that we are not even prepared to raise enough 
speakers to carry this on anyway. Then why did they object to our 
asking for them to withdraw closure? Because they know that part 
of what we were talking about was the democracy of this House.
<P>
	It seems kind of silly for us to stand up and be railed on by these 
people about the fact that we are concerned about the democratic 
process in this House. The  democratic process in this House 
suggested the hon. member can take time along with everyone else. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="745"> 745 </A></B>
<P>
Of course now the Liberals have put their feet in it. The hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands has stated that the debate will 
collapse, that we will not keep it going. Of course now he has 
backed himself into a corner. He cannot stand up and talk because 
he himself would be carrying the debate beyond the point which the 
Liberals predicted it would fall.
<P>
	There is no point in carrying on debate when the Liberals do not 
listen, when they try to turn our words. We feel we are making our 
point and our point is very clear. The Liberals turn each piece of 
information that comes to this House. They twist it and try to 
present it to the public in a very questionable manner. That was 
done when they started suggesting it is a worse offence to ask 
Canadians for their opinion than it is to ask our soldiers to swear 
allegiance to someone other than the government they serve.
<P>
	Why did we table this motion? We tabled this motion because 
Canadians all across the country asked for this type of action. Long 
before this issue came up I found myself in the unenviable position 
of responding to constituents who asked: ``Why has the Bloc not 
been charged with treason? How can we possibly have a Parliament 
where we use our tax dollars to bring people into this Canadian 
house of democracy to preach and rail against the country that is 
paying their way? Their former leader has taken his Canadian 
pension and gone back to promote separation from within''. How 
can I explain to these people that because we are democratic we 
allow people-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Talk about pensions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Oh, the hon. member wants to talk about pensions. I 
know he is going to sally up to the trough. Fifty-one or 52 of us 
over here will not, but he certainly will. If he wants to talk about 
pensions, I would love to go on for a long time on that one.
<P>
	I found myself saying to my constituents that as long as this is a 
democratic House, we will allow them to bring forward their points 
of view. We have never tried to bring forward any motion even 
remotely like this concerning the Bloc for simply stating their 
opinion in this House. This particular action went way beyond the 
stating of opinion.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning, if the Bloc had simply said that in an 
independent Quebec these are the opportunities that will be 
available in the military, we would not be bringing this motion 
forward. But what the Bloc has done is it has essentially advocated 
desertion from the Canadian military swearing allegiance to 
someone other than the crown to whom they originally swore their 
allegiance. The facts of this are very clear. We have the letter. It is 
not some comment someone said a member of the Bloc made. It 
was a letter sent out from this House.
<P>
	It does need an investigation. Unlike the Liberal Party we are not 
saying to bypass the investigation, hang him from the yard arm 
before anybody reviews this and call him before the bar, like they 
wanted to do because we asked Canadians for their opinion. We 
simply want this investigated. We want it investigated openly. We 
believe there are a great deal of problems with what the member for 
Charlesbourg has done.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	We think it should be viewed as seditious but nowhere did we 
say it is an act of sedition. We said we believe it should be viewed 
as sedition and we certainly believe it is an offence to the House.
<P>
	As such we believe it constitutes a contempt of Parliament. 
Consequently we ask for it to be examined by a standing committee 
of the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> We hear all kinds of people going on on the other 
side. It will be interesting to see if they rise to deal with this 
question themselves or if they simply, as I have said before, want to 
continue to use other members' times. Again that is a queer notion 
of Liberal democracy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Maybe it is because of the 
distance of the Chair but I see more than one member standing, 
more than one member speaking. So there is no confusion I 
recognize the hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought the Mutt and Jeff act was 
going into a trio or a quartet. They had not given me my lines. They 
seem to know theirs so well.
<P>
	I do not feel I need to go on further with this. I am sure the hon. 
members will now stand and start expressing their opinions when 
the Canadian public can actually listen to them, instead of small 
shots coming from the other side. I am sure if they have a real 
opinion they will share it with us. Otherwise I guess they will 
continue to talk when other members are up.
<P>
	This is an important motion because it represents what we are 
hearing from the Canadian public right across the country. When I 
talked to these people defending the right of Bloc members to 
express opinions in the House, I said they had the right. However, 
with this letter that was sent out they have crossed the line.
<P>
	There are some people who thought it should have happened 
long ago. It was a grey area at best. We gave them the benefit of the 
doubt. However, with this letter to the military they have crossed 
the line. Action needs to be taken. The Canadian public demands 
this and the Liberals should support examining this and following 
through.
<P>
	Do not take it into committee and simply put it to sleep, as many 
of the members across do when debate is going on in the House. 
Deal with it in committee. Bring it back to the House and follow 
through with it. Do not  simply shove it into committee and leave it 
<P>

<B><A NAME="746"> 746 </A></B>
<P>
there forevermore, never dealing with the question. It needs to be 
dealt with, it needs to be dealt with properly.
<P>
	If the hon. members across the way who are being quiet for a 
moment-I do not know how that ever happened-have a point to 
make I wish they would rise and make it. If they have something 
sensible to say I would hate to miss it the one time that might 
happen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, based on the remarks made in this House by many of the 
members of the third party, I have the honour of informing you that 
you have before you an enemy of Canada. Except, there is 
something I would like to know, and perhaps you are asking 
yourself the same thing. Who are the real enemies of Canada? 
Would they by chance be those who dare to believe in Quebec's 
sovereignty and who abide by the rules of democracy or would they 
be those who have no qualms aout trampling on democracy? 
Because it is indeed democracy we are talking about.
<P>
	The motion introduced by the Reform Party with respect to the 
communiqué by my colleague for Charlesbourg is, in fact, a denial 
of freedom of expression, the first step to trashing democracy.
<P>
	This motion goes far beyond the words in the communiqué at 
issue. The debate on the alleged seditious intent of this 
communiqué cannot reasonably be based on the articles of law 
defining sedition and even less so on the principles of democracy 
known to all of us and respected by most of us, I hope.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Section 59 of the Criminal Code defines seditious intention as 
follows: ``-every one shall be presumed to have a seditious 
intention who teaches or advocates, or publishes or circulates any 
writing that advocates, the use, without the authority of law, of 
force as a means of accomplishing a governmental change within 
Canada.'' Quite an undertaking, that.
<P>
	In addition, section 62 of that same Criminal Code discusses 
sedition in relation to military forces, indicating that anyone 
encouraging members of a force to insubordination, disloyalty, 
mutiny or refusal of duty is guilty of an act of sedition.
<P>
	The communiqué as such, you will agree, contains nothing of the 
sort. No passage in this communiqué can justify this matter's 
becoming a topic of debate, and still less it's being referred to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	The communiqué from the hon. member for Charlesbourg had 
only one purpose: to inform Armed Forces personnel of what 
would happen in the aftermath of the referendum if there were a yes 
victory, just as  several other communiqués were issued during the 
referendum campaign concerning federal public servants.
<P>
	In addition, the creation of a Quebec army after Quebec attained 
sovereignty was part of the program of the Bloc Quebecois and of 
the Parti Quebecois, and has even been addressed by specialists in 
military affairs in major dailies, Charles-Philippe David in <I>La 
Presse</I> in particular.
<P>
	Moreover, the attempts by a Montreal lawyer, Mr. Tyler, to go 
before the courts of Quebec and Ontario with the matter lead to 
failure. According to the courts, there is nothing in this 
communiqué to give rise to a charge of sedition.
<P>
	We are therefore entitled to wonder what the Reform Party's true 
intentions are in tabling this motion. Is it really motivated by 
respect for the law? I doubt it.
<P>
	In light of what we have heard from the various Reformers in 
recent days on this question, it is increasingly clear that, in the eyes 
of sensible Quebecers and sensible Canadians, this court room 
farce is aimed at the Bloc Quebecois and their plans for 
sovereignty. Proof of this lies in what the hon. member for 
Kootenay East said yesterday: ``This seditious activity of the 
member of the Bloc Quebecois cannot stand. This is the line in the 
sand. We go no further. There are people in Canada who see those 
who would take Quebec out of Canada as being the enemies of 
Canada.'' There are many such people, Mr. Speaker, if we are to 
judge by this speech. The member went on to say: ``I will tell you 
that I am one of them and I am speaking for those people''.
<P>
	At the very heart of this debate is freedom of expression. To the 
members of the Reform Party, the very words of Quebec 
sovereignists are seditious, and I would go so far as to say that the 
very existence of sovereignists is seditious, hence the present 
motion. Rather than participate democratically in Quebec 
sovereignty, they prefer to take issue with the basic right of 
freedom of speech.
<P>
	The referendum debate in October 1995 took place in an 
unparalleled climate of democracy. At no time did either the yes or 
the no side in Quebec attempt to deny the other's right to debate its 
option, and each side informed people of its position.
<P>
	Thus, in introducing this motion, the Reformers want to punish 
the member for Charlesbourg for speaking on the option he 
defends. His only crime was that of not sharing the vision of the 
Liberals and the Reformers on Canada's future. The motion 
therefore denies the right to freedom of speech of Bloc members 
and thus of Quebecers who support sovereignty in Quebec.
<P>
	It is therefore of some concern that, in this House, which is a part 
of the highly democratic institution of the Parliament of Canada, 
freedom of speech and the right to defend one's position in a 
democratic context recognized by all citizens are being called into 
question.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="747"> 747 </A></B>
<P>
	With their amendment, the Liberals are choosing to hide their 
heads in the sand and refer the question to the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs, rather than defend the democratic 
principles guiding debate in society.
<P>
	Would this strategy be part of plan D, E or F? Otherwise, why 
threaten to bring those who exercise their freedom of speech to 
promote sovereignty before a committee in order to judge them on 
the legality of their remarks? Despite the threats of partitioning and 
other inflammatory remarks made by Stéphane Dion, which were, 
moreover, never condemned by the federal Liberal Party, and even 
less so by the Reform Party, we hope that this Parliament will 
refuse to approve a motion which is such an incredible breach of 
democracy.
<P>
	It seems to me that this unprecedented attack against freedom of 
speech would have justified Liberals putting aside party politics 
and their alphabetical plans and vigorously defending-as we 
do-the very foundations of our democratic rules.
<P>
	The attitude of the Liberal government is disquieting in a society 
that boasts it advocates respect for human rights. As a matter of 
fact, according to the Reform Party's logic, everybody who, during 
the referendum campaign, discussed the creation of an army in a 
sovereign Quebec deserves to be accused of sedition. This would 
include not only all the members of the Bloc, but also all the 
reporters who discussed the topic or wrote about it-and why not 
also those who dared to read them or watch them on television?
<P>
	The interpretation made by the Reform Party of the notion of 
freedom of speech threatens the rights not only of the sovereignists 
but also of all the Canadians who oppose in one way or another 
some public policies or some of the Reform Party's positions.
<P>
	The Reform Party's motion is in fact a throw back to some of 
history's dark moments when democracy was trashed-Chile 
under Pinochet, Greece under the colonels or Spain under Franco.
<P>
	That is why I will vote against the Reform Party's motion, 
against the Liberals' amendment and against the amendment to the 
amendment presented by the Reform Party.
<P>
