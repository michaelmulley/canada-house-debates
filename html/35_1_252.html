	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Monday's events in Quebec showed us that in fact the 
glass is half full.
<P>
	During the past few weeks we have witnessed an outpouring of 
emotion from Canadians across the country who went from passive 
observation to active participation in the affairs of their country.
<P>
	We should all be struck by the depth of their feelings and their 
willingness and openness to change. This will is generous and the 
challenge for Parliament is to facilitate the development of this 
expression of commitment to Canada. As parliamentarians we 
must strive to nurture and encourage Canadians who want to be 
involved in the process of reshaping Canada.
<P>
	Canadians need to be thanked for their willingness and openness 
to change. They must be valued and implicated in the process of 
redefining their country.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the past 
two years we have sat in this House with members of the Bloc 
Quebecois who have made no secret of their agenda. While we 
profoundly disagreed with it, I treated these members with respect, 
and I must add, they treated me with respect. Such is the nature of 
democracy.
<P>
	I was absolutely shocked by Mr. Parizeau's comments on 
referendum night and those of Mr. Bouchard a few weeks ago. The 
leaders of the separatist movement should be more concerned with 
equality within and outside Quebec and not the ethnic origin of the 
voting public.
<P>
	That Mr. Parizeau has now resigned does not alter what he said. 
Nowhere has he apologized for his remarks. He has resigned and 
that is good, but even his resignation is clouded in duplicity.
<P>
	In the days ahead one hopes the vast majority of Quebecers will 
distance themselves from Parizeau's and Bouchard's narrow view 
of Quebec's position and-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would remind all hon. members that while we 
are members in this House we should address each other by our 
ridings and not by our names.

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great sadness that I bring to the attention of the House the 
passing of a notable Canadian journalist and author, Dave 
McIntosh.
<P>
	Mr. McIntosh served valiantly in World War II as a bomber 
navigator, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1946 he 
joined Canadian Press where, for the next quarter century, he 
earned a reputation as a remorselessly inquiring and rigorously 
honest journalist. He was a well-respected authority on defence 
matters and a delightfully mischievous reporter of Ottawa's and

<P>
	This attitude must be vigorously denounced, for Quebec, like 
Canada, offers a warm welcome to all of the world's citizens. The 
Premier of Quebec's words are a serious matter, having been 
spoken after careful consideration by a first minister, but I wish to 
reassure my colleagues in this House and the people of Canada that 
they are far from representing reality. Quebecers of all origins are

recent referendum the Quebec electorate set off an alarm. People in 
Quebec and indeed all of Canada demand change to the Canadian 
federation that does not involve constitutional wrangling.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's outdated, outmoded, traditional political 
practices of stuffing the Senate with patronage appointments is 
unacceptable. He must begin a transition to a new Senate which 
would be effective, elected and equal. And the first 
non-constitutional step to validate that place is to elect members to 
the upper house.
<P>
	The Reform Party demands changes based on the model of the 
1989 Alberta senatorial selection act which allowed the election of 
the late Senator Stan Waters.
<P>
	The referendum has issued a wake-up call to the federal 
government. The Reform Party stands as the only federal party 
with answers to that wake-up call. Canadians note that while the 
alarm has gone off, the Prime Minister continues to hit the snooze 
button.

only think, for instance, of the charter of the French language and

<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16063"> 16063 </A></B>
<P>
	Obviously, in public life we cannot always agree with everyone, 
and sometimes this leads to difficult situations.
<P>
	I know Mr. Parizeau well. I have known him since 1968 and I 
have had the opportunity to work with him. Despite our significant 
political differences, I can say he is a man who has given his life to 
politics. He is a man of considerable talent, who has worked with 
governments for many years. He was even an adviser to the 
Government of Canada, to the Department of Finance, when I was 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	One day, our paths separated, and he became a sovereignist, a 
separatist. I respect his opinion and always have, even if I do not 
completely agree. Now he has decided to retire. I would have 
hoped it could happen under circumstances less controversial for 
him and for everyone, but I have no control over circumstances.
<P>
	I would like to point out that, here, in Canada, we have one of the 
finest democracies in the world. It is an example. Few countries in 
the world would tolerate the raising of passions as deep as those 
involved in wanting to break up a country and use part of it to make 
a new one.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	It is an example for the world that this sort of passionate 
discourse cannot be permitted without a surprising amount of 
control. I have travelled with Mr. Parizeau. We have been 
travelling companions. He could be a most pleasant companion, at 
times, when we were not talking politics. Obviously, when we 
started talking politics, breakfasts or dinners were rather 
tumultuous, but interesting, I must say.
<P>
	Today, he has decided to retire after serving the public for many 
years, and we must thank him for serving the public as he did. 
Unfortunately for me, he did not remain an ardent federalist. He 
decided not to remain one, and I did. I am very persistent. He 
became persistent after that and he remained the most persistent 
sovereignist or separatist of the group. He did not hide his opinion.
<P>
	At one point, he even left Mr. Lévesque, because he did not agree 
with the ``beau risque''. He is retiring, and the people of Quebec 
should thank him for his contribution to the public debate, even if 
we did not agree. That is what is so great about Canada: we can 
disagree and yet serve the public to the best of our knowledge and 
abilities.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think both Mr. Parizeau and we in the Bloc are grateful 
to the Prime Minister for his fine gesture in speaking these words. I 
thank him for it. With the permission of the House, I would like to 
table the preliminary report of the count of Monday's voting.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is a bit different today. Perhaps the hon. Leader 
of the Opposition could table it at the end of question period. We 
return to question period again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, we, the people of Quebec, 
whatever our political stripe, are delighted at how democratically 
the recent referendum debate was carried out. In fact, the only hitch 
in the democratic proceedings we might criticize came about 
because of Ottawa and very high up in Ottawa, namely the number 
one guardian of Canadian democracy, the Prime Minister of 
Canada. We will recall that he said in this House he reserved the 
right not to honour a narrow yes majority in favour of sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Knowing now that the no 
majority is only six tenths of 1 per cent above 50 and in view of the 
fact that the sovereignists have set an example by bowing to a very 
narrow majority, does he not think he should withdraw his remarks 
and apologize in the name of Canadian democracy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Absolutely 
not, Mr. Speaker. Absolutely not. I should say first that, indeed, 
49.4 per cent of Quebecers voted yes. However, probably between 
30 and 40 per cent of them voted yes thinking they were going to 
stay in Canada. They did not all vote for Quebec's separation.
<P>
	I was in the car a few minutes ago, and people were calling an 
open line show saying they did not know, they did not suspect the 
mandate was to separate.
<P>
	The word ``separation'' was never again heard from the lips of 
the Leader of the Opposition after he was obliged to use it in front 
of the Americans to make himself understood.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister of Canada, as part of his duties in the

<HR>
<B><A NAME="16064"> 16064 </A></B>
<P>
House of Commons, is permitted to  distinguish between votes, if I 
understand properly, when the votes were for the yes side.
<P>
	What would the Prime Minister of Canada say if, as Leader of 
the Opposition, I did not recognize the very slim no majority? 
What would he say? He would be right in accusing me of not being 
democratic.
<P>
	Nearly 2.3 million Quebecers opted for a sovereign Quebec on 
Monday. For a Prime Minister who promised us we were going to 
take a beating, it is quite a comeuppance.
<P>
	The Quebec reality continues to escape him, however, because 
he now thinks he can meet Quebec's expectations with an 
unimportant resolution in the House paying lip service to Quebec's 
distinctive nature.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister be so ignorant of the reality in Quebec 
that he imagines he can halt the irresistible sovereignist advance 
with such a horrible mockery?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, Quebecers have spoken. I hope the Leader of the 
Opposition will accept the verdict of Quebecers, who have decided 
to remain in Canada. On the night of the verdict, he was saying he 
was going to start again right away, whereas the people had spoken. 
He is the one who lost and should have accepted the verdict.
<P>
	As for me, my job in this country is to ensure observance of the 
Canadian constitution, only I did not have to use all the powers 
vested in the government, because the people of Quebec spoke and 
chose to remain in Canada. I hope the Leader of the Opposition will 
understand that Quebecers want all elected officials, both here and 
in Quebec City, to serve the people and look after economic growth 
and job creation; they are sick and tired of all the talk about 
constitutional problems. They want the governments to get back to 
the real problems: the dignity of workers in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for people who are fed up, a 94 per cent turnout in a 
popular vote is not bad.
<P>
	After Monday's vote, the Canadian federal system is enjoying a 
respite, the result of a few tenths of points of popular vote. In this 
context, does the Prime Minister not see that the only realistic 
solution for Quebec and Canada is a new partnership negotiated 
between equals following the next Quebec referendum, which will 
follow inexorably?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people have spoken. Democracy has spoken. 
Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition does not agree with 
democracy. DidMr. Johnson, who lost the election last year with four tenths of 1 
per cent-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Was Mr. Parizeau's government 
illegitimate because they won by only four tenths of 1 per cent?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	The people have spoken and they have decided to remain in 
Canada, despite all the unbelievable propaganda, in which people 
were told that, if they voted no, there would be no more 
unemployment insurance and their pensions would be cut, without 
it ever being proven. These were absolutely gratuitous statements. 
Despite this, despite all these lies, they failed to win.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it did not 
take more than 24 hours after a No win based on a fraction of a 
percentage for the Prime Minister to consider tabling a resolution 
in the House of Commons recognizing the fact that Quebec is a 
distinct society. And all this while hastening to add that such 
recognition confers no special powers or status on Quebec. He 
seems to agree with the Premier of Ontario who said that now was 
not the time to react hastily and promise things one might not be 
able to deliver.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he agree 
with the Premier of Ontario that any changes that would be 
significant in the eyes of Quebec would not be acceptable to the 
rest of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to me, the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society is 
important. It is something that the Parliament of Canada has 
already accepted, it was voted on in a referendum, and we voted in 
favour of a distinct society-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> While the Leader of the 
Opposition-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Everyone knows it is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> -and the House leader of the

Quebec blaming us for not delivering on Charlottetown when they

that his positions are identical to those of the Premier of British 
Columbia, and are we to understand that this Prime Minister has no 
trouble recognizing Quebec as a distinct society but only in so far 
as this does not really mean anything and does not change the status 
quo?

of Canada has already spoken. And the Parliament of Canada could 
speak again, but as far as we are concerned, we have always been in 
favour of a distinct society. And now very shortly, Quebecers will 
again see the members of the Bloc Quebecois, like the separatists 
they are, vote against distinct society in this House of Commons.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, almost two days have passed since the Quebec 
referendum and as yet no one has accepted responsibility for the 
mismanagement of the federalist strategy which brought the 
country to the very brink of disaster, mismanagement which simply 
cannot be repeated in the future.
<P>
	Seventeen months ago the Prime Minister was strongly urged to 
clearly define the costs of separation by answering 20 questions on 
the negative meaning of a yes vote. The Prime Minister dismissed 
those questions as hypothetical and did nothing. As a result he 
almost lost the country to Quebec voters who thought they could 
vote yes and still be Canadian.
<P>
	Canadians want to know who is responsible for those 
miscalculations in that campaign. Was it the Prime Minister's 
advisers, was it the no side strategists, or was it the Prime Minister 
himself?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the only person more disappointed than the Leader of the 
Opposition that the no side won is the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	During the whole campaign, every day and every week, he was 
trying to bring in some new twist to create a problem for those who 
were fighting to keep Canada together. The leader of the third party 
was always there saying we should do this and we should do that, 
while the leader of the Conservative Party, the leader of the Liberal 
Party of Quebec and I were working out our differences to keep 
Canada together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister can question the loyalty of millions of 
Canadians who disagree with his-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Nothing will change the fact that it was his lame 
brain strategy that brought the country-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> The Prime Minister did not wake up to Quebec's 
profound demands for change until the last week of the campaign. 
For months and months in the House and outside the House, he 
insisted the status quo was good enough, plus a little administrative 
tinkering. It was not until the last days of the campaign that he 
belatedly recognized the need for change and began to talk about it.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister, given the obvious desire in the country 
for change, who was the genius who decided that status quo plus 
administrative tinkering was good enough? Was it the Prime 
Minister's advisers? Was it some fossilized senators, or was it the 
Prime Minister himself?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the Reform Party again is trying to do the 
same thing. He is just trying to build himself a position from 
extremely difficult circumstances which we were fighting for.
<P>
	When it was very important, the leader of the Conservative Party 
was there, I was there and a lot of members of Parliament from this 
side were there, but the leader of the Reform Party was not in 
Montreal last Friday. He was just criticizing us like he has done 
during the whole campaign. We have won. Canada has won despite 
him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to compound the errors of the no side campaign, we now 
have the crowning miscalculation. Apparently the federal 
government is responding to the demands for change in Quebec by 
falling back on the tired old cliches of distinct society and a 
constitutional veto for Quebec, asking Canadians to wallow once 
again in the stagnant waters of Meech Lake.
<P>
	This Liberal-Tory approach to national unity with its top down 
process, constitutional mumbo-jumbo and hollow symbolism has 
not worked for 30 years, and Canadians know it. They ask the 
Prime Minister, who in  their right mind is responsible for this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16066"> 16066 </A></B>

misguided strategy? Is it the same people who devised the no 
strategy? Is it his new constitutional adviser from Sherbrooke, or is 
it the Prime Minister himself?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when there was an amending formula accepted by all the 
provinces at the time of Victoria, the party of the father of the 
leader of the Reform Party, the Socreds, was in power in Alberta. It 
accepted the amending formula at that time.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after a crushing repudiation by his own constituents in 
Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister has lost all credibility to 
propose any constitutional change whatsoever, because it is 
obvious that he is out of touch with the Quebec reality.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that his inability to understand the 
Quebec reality renders him unfit to properly translate the needs of 
Quebec to the rest of Canada, and as long as Canadians and 
Quebecers speak to each other through him instead of as equal to

Speaker, the Parliament of Canada will speak on behalf of all 
Canadians when it is presented with a resolution concerning this 
problem. This I have promised and this I will do. Then the 
pretences will be over. The separatists have always been saying that

Quebecers wanted?

very well we are going to act. But this time they will be forced to 
vote. There will be no fine words. They will vote against the 
distinct society, and the truth will out. They are separatists who do

<P>
	It seems that the Prime Minister is preparing to offer Quebec a 
special deal that consists of the old traditional federal chestnuts of a 
distinct society and a constitutional veto. For 20 years the 
separatists have been saying that because Quebec is a distinct 
society and people it should therefore become a sovereign state.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister think that by conceding the first 
part of that proposition he can prevent the second? I think the 
Prime Minister would like me to repeat that question.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at that time the member for Lethbridge was a member of 
the cabinet in Alberta, which accepted a veto for Quebec. Mr. 
Strom was the premier and the member for Lethbridge was a 
minister at that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, rather than comment on the non-answer, let me go on to 
the most unbelievable aspect of the federal strategy, this makeshift 
strategy for unity.
<P>
	The government seems to be seriously considering giving a 
constitutional veto to the Government of Quebec, a separatist 
government committed to breaking up the country. Perhaps the 
Prime Minister intends this as a parting gift to the Leader of the 
Opposition if he goes to Quebec City.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

give the separatist Government of Quebec a veto over the

<P>
	If the hon. member does not think she is able to represent the

that the members of Parliament  who have been elected generally

	On October 26 the minister, in an attempt to confuse the Bloc 
Quebecois, said in this House, and I quote: ``In August I received 
a document from the Government of Quebec that pointed out the 
number of people on welfare had been reduced, not increased''. 
He forgot to mention that between August 1994 and August 1995, 
the number of welfare recipients increased by 20,000, and that at 
least half of this increase was due to cuts in unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Human Resources Development satisfied that 
thanks to his cuts in unemployment insurance, Quebec has at least 
10,000 people more on welfare?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
</B><B>Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have with me the actual 
detailed statistics from the Government of Quebec which show for 
example, that between the month of June and July there was a net 
decrease of 4,000 people on the welfare rolls. It continued to go 
down to the point where there was a reduction of 7,000 people on 
the welfare rolls over that four-month period.
<P>
	That was acknowledged as well by Premier Parizeau in the 
National Assembly where he again admitted that there had been a 
decline. He took some satisfaction from that figure. So did we.
<P>
	It puts into question the continued allegation by the Bloc 
Quebecois that these changes have resulted in increased welfare 
rolls. How can we have an increase when the numbers are going 
down?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is time 
the minister understood the basis for these statistics. The increase 
in the number of people on welfare is calculated from year to year. 
And from year to year, we see 20,000 people more on welfare. I 
would like to table this report in the House after a while.
<P>
	Does the minister acknowledge that it is entirely unacceptable 
that, during a period of so-called prosperity, the number of people 
on welfare in Quebec increases by 20,000 in a single year, as the 
minister prepares to introduce new reforms that will increase this 
number considerably?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the past year 
specifically in the province of Quebec-and I do not want to 
exclude actions we have taken in other provinces-with the 
changes we introduced last year to the unemployment insurance 
system, we brought in a special family benefit that enabled over 
130,000  Quebecers, primarily women, to receive an additional 
$1,000 per year over and above their normal payment.
<P>
	In addition we signed an agreement with the Government of 
Quebec because we believe in co-operating to help those on low 
income, especially those with families. It was an $81 million 
special agreement this summer with the Government of Quebec 
that would provide an income top up for 27,000 families on low 
income. This once again demonstrates that when we work together 
we can finally do something as a government to help people who 
really have needs.

finances under control in a balanced fashion while building 
economic growth and jobs in Canada.

<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance tell my Carleton-Charlotte 
constituents and the House if we are still on target for next year 
and still to reach our interim deficit reduction goal of 3 per cent 
of GDP in 1997?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I assure the hon. 
member that we are on target. Deficit reduction is an essential 
component of our job creation plan because deficit reduction 
means lower interest rates and lower interest rates mean more jobs 
for Canadians.
<P>
	I assure him that we will hit our interim target of 3 per cent. I 
assure him that we will hit this year's target of $32.7 billion. I am 
delighted to say to him that not only did we hit our target for 
1994-95, we in fact beat it by $2.2 billion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is also for the Minister of Finance and concerns the 
Conference Board of Canada report of a week or so ago, which 
indicated that productivity and profits are up but that wages are 
standing still.
<P>
	Given that this is exactly the kind of economy critics of 
globalization and free trade predicted would be the case with this 
new kind of economy, what does the Minister of Finance intend to 
do about it? Is this the desired state for the Canadian economy? Or, 
does the government have some plan to make sure that at some 
point not just profits and not just productivity but wages and the 
standard of living go up for ordinary Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure there was a 
bit of a slip when the hon. member asked his question. I am sure he 
realizes that productivity is an essential element to increasing our 
real incomes in the country.
<P>
	From 1973 on, for about 20 years, we had declining productivity 
throughout the western world and that is why real incomes went 
down.
<P>
	Nonetheless the hon. member's question is to the point. That is 
why there is so much effort on this side of the House to increase 
Canadian skills, to increase Canada's involvement in the newer 
economy, to make sure that Canada is not only toiling in those 
industries where other countries are more competitive because of 
lower standards of living but that we are the most modern economy 
possible to create.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order under citation 487(1) of Beauchesne's which states 
that threatening language is unparliamentary. I bring to Your 
Honour's attention comments of the hon. member for York 
South-Weston who said very clearly in the House in earlier 
debate: ``You should be tried for treason, Preston''.
<P>
	Those remarks are absolutely threatening and unacceptable. I 
ask that they be withdrawn from the record of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member who is mentioned is not in the 
House now. Your Speaker did not hear the remarks.
<P>
	We will take the point of order under advisement. We will see if 
it appears in <I>Hansard</I> and we will deal with it at the earliest 
possible time.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DIVISIONS">DIVISIONS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last evening during the taking of various divisions the chief 
government whip proposed during the division on Bill C-103 that 
the vote on Motion No. 19 of Bill C-61 be applied to the motion 
that was then before the House.
<P>
	This is verified by a review of the video from last night's 
proceedings. However this reality is not reflected in <I>Hansard</I>, as 
recorded on page 16056 where it shows the government whip 
applying the vote in reverse.
<P>
	The video also shows that it was you, Mr. Speaker, who 
following the House's decision later sought clarification from the 
chief government whip, although this fact is also missing from 
<I>Hansard</I>.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16071"> 16071 </A></B>
<P>
	My first concern is that <I>Hansard</I>, the official report of the 
proceedings of the House of Commons, does not reflect the 
realities of last night's proceedings. While it is true that members 
are permitted to make slight corrections to <I>Hansard</I> such as 
grammatical corrections, this type of alteration completely 
reverses the intent of what the chief government whip clearly 
stated, which has been verified by a review of the video.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	My second point is that unanimous consent was sought to apply 
the result of report stage Motion No. 19 to the concurrence motion 
at report stage of Bill C-103. This was, in fact, agreed to by the 
House as verified on the video.
<P>
	It was only later that you, Mr. Speaker, noticed the government 
had applied a vote which resulted in the defeat of Bill C-103 and 
then asked the government whip if he had meant to apply the vote 
in reverse. You asked him yes or no.
<P>
	It is my contention that the House had clearly given its 
unanimous consent to apply the vote as first specified by the chief 
government whip. If this was to be changed, it was incumbent upon 
the Speaker to ask the entire House for its unanimous consent, and 
not simply engage in a personal dialogue with the chief 
government whip. If you review the video, Mr. Speaker, you will 
find the evidence to support my submission.
<P>
	In summation, I would first like to say how disturbing it is to see 
that the official record of Parliament does not reflect the reality of 
last night's proceedings. Second, the video clearly shows that the 
House gave its unanimous consent to apply a vote which resulted in 
the defeat of a government bill. If it was a mistake on the part of the 
chief government whip and he wanted to reverse the decision of 
this House, then he ought to have sought its consent and not simply 
told you, Mr. Speaker, what he meant to have said, if it was only 
that easy.
<P>
	It is not that easy and it is dangerous to engage in such practices. 
My reason for raising this point of order is that the most important 
protection that we as members of the opposition have in this House 
is you, Mr. Speaker, and the rules of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has raised a point of order that on its face sounds 
reasonable.
<P>
	I urge him first of all to have regard to the practice of this House 
in relation to the words spoken in <I>Hansard</I>. If I am making a speech 
and I say words that I do not mean to say, that are incorrect, such as 
when I say a not when I did not mean to say a not, and then repeat 
the sentence correctly, <I>Hansard</I> does not print two sentences, one 
with a not in it and one without. They print it the way I intended it; 
it is corrected and printed as one sentence.
<P>
	Similarly, if I repeat words for emphasis I get reported in 
<I>Hansard</I>, but if I repeat them because of interruptions that might 
come from hon. members elsewhere in the House, those additional 
words are not printed in <I>Hansard</I>. The editor takes those words out.
<P>
	I submit in the case that the hon. member has raised there is 
clearly a misunderstanding as to what happened, as to what the 
chief government whip said. When it was corrected by a 
subsequent intervention by Your Honour in asking the chief 
government whip whether he intended it to be in reverse and he 
confirmed that he had intended it to be in reverse, there was simply 
a correction made by the editors to make it appear that there had 
not been that misunderstanding. The question was not replaced in 
<I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	First, <I>Hansard</I> has never followed the exact words spoken in the 
Chamber word for word on every occasion. That has been a 
practice in this House for as long as I have read <I>Hansard</I>, which is 
over 30 years. I think the hon. member will recognize that fact.
<P>
	Second, last evening after the vote was applied in accordance 
with the request by the chief government whip, there was a 
misunderstanding on the part of the Chair, which I submit was the 
correct understanding. If the hon. whip is correct in his submission, 
the thing that should have happened is that the bill should have 
been defeated because there were more nays than yeas on the 
division cited. I know that is his point.
<P>
	My recollection is very distinct. I have not looked at the video to 
check it but after the vote was applied, Your Honour said: ``I 
declare the motion carried''. My recollection is that on Bill C-103 
we were dealing with concurrence at the report stage. Your Honour 
then put the question: ``When shall the bill be read the third time?'' 
The answer was, at the next sitting of the House.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	The Chair understood the way the chief government whip 
intended to have the division applied, which was to carry the vote. 
Everyone in the House understood that the government was going 
to win the vote and that it was intended to be applied that way.
<P>
	All the <I>Hansard</I> editor has done in this case, in my view quite 
correctly, is excised the questions that resulted in the clarification 
and made it appear that the chief government whip did it right the 
first time. He apparently did make that slip. The Chair, in my 
submission, understood what he meant and the correct procedure 
was followed, the bill was concurred in at report stage and third 
reading was ordered at the next sitting of the House.
<P>
	Had the Chair correctly heard the chief government whip and 
applied it the way the hon. Reform whip is now suggesting, that 
would not have been the result and we would have had a clarifica-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16072"> 16072 </A></B>
<P>
tion in an awful hurry because I was listening to the proceedings 
and I heard it go. I was satisfied that third reading had been ordered 
at the next sitting, otherwise I would have been on my feet.
<P>
	While I sympathize with the Reform whip in his submission, I 
submit that the <I>Hansard</I> editors have acted very correctly in this 
case. The hon. member really has nothing to complain about 
because everything was clarified last night. Nothing was done in 
secret between the Chair and the chief government whip. It was 
done on the floor of the House where everyone could see. If there 
were objections to the procedure the hon. member should have 
raised them then.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am going to come back to the whip of the 
Reform Party. I am now going to go to the whip of the government 
party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Chair and all hon. members will know, some time 
ago informal discussions were held among whips-I know it was a 
different whip for the Reform Party then-toward arriving at an 
informal system of accelerating the voting procedure, thereby 
saving considerable overtime and taxpayers' dollars for votes that 
would have traditionally taken sometimes seven or eight hours in 
the evening. They can now be collapsed into a few minutes.
<P>
	I hate to interrupt this private conversation, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would appeal to all hon. members, because this 
point of order affects all of us and is a serious one, that if they have 
discussions to please have them behind the curtain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> As I was saying, this system was established 
informally with the previous whip.
<P>
	May I suggest there have been a number of occasions in the past 
when whips have sometimes indicated that they were voting yea as 
opposed to nay. Whips across the floor of the House would heckle 
informally or indicate informally: ``No, that is not what you want 
to do'', in an effort to assist each other because this informal 
understanding has been established with the stated purpose of 
condensing a process which formerly took several hours.
<P>
	In order to make the system work even better, an informal 
document is exchanged among the various whips and given to the 
Table so if there is an occasional slip-up in the process, it is 
corrected.
<P>
	Again, the then whip for the Reform Party would recognize how 
this was established co-operatively among all whips. I am referring 
here to the member for Calgary Centre.
<P>
	The point I am making is that this is an informal system which 
was established among the whips. Whips have traditionally 
assisted each other in order to accurately reflect the intention of 
each respective party in the House and it was done that way.
<P>
	We could revert to the system which existed before. The system 
which was in place before costs approximately $25,000 an hour. I 
believe it costs approximately $17,000 an hour to work regular 
overtime and $25,000 an hour for extended time. Even the process 
we used last night could have cost perhaps $100,000 to $150,000 
and instead cost nothing to the taxpayers of Canada because we had 
developed this informal system with all the goodwill that had, up 
until now, been there. I only wish that the goodwill we have had 
may prevail after today as it has over the last year since 
establishing the system.
<P>
	We had an extremely effective working relationship in the past 
with the previous whip. I hope it will remain identical with the 
present occupant of that position on that side of the House. It is my 
considered belief that when members cease to be able to function 
with each other, where there are disagreements-and there have 
been some of those today-that the whips can quickly rally behind 
the curtain, find out what the disagreement is among members and 
then hopefully assist each other in making the House work better 
and assisting Mr. Speaker in his job of serving all of us. That is the 
system under which we have all operated individually and 
collegially as a group of whips in the past.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I hope we can continue to assist each other in order to reflect the 
intention of the House and not try as whips to trip each other up at 
every possible opportunity.
<P>
	There is the cut and thrust of debate in the House. That is fair 
game. I appreciate that. Heaven knows I was a member of that 
group for longer than many. However, in our role as whips there is 
also the very close working relationship we have had with each 
other. I hope and pray that will continue, not for my good, but for 
the good of this institution and for our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I am 
the one whip previous to whom everybody is referring, I thought I 
should make a quick intervention.
<P>
	The point our party whip is making, and I checked it with our 
assistant, is that there was an intervention made by you in the Chair 
with a member of the House. It is that intervention which is not 
included in <I>Hansard</I>. That is the point. We respect, and I certainly 
do, everything that has been said here, including the intervention 
by the member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	It is okay to correct words and that is what the member for 
Kingston and the Islands was pointing out. But when an entire 
intervention is left out, it is a serious omission. I do not believe we 
are trying to trip up the government; we are just saying that an 
intervention is missing. That is the concern because what if at some 
time in the future it is an important intervention? That is the point.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16073"> 16073 </A></B>
<P>
	We do intend, hope and will always try to make sure that we 
continue in the same spirit of co-operation that we have 
established over the course of time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are several points I hope to 
clarify. First, I endorse what my colleague has just said to the chief 
government whip. By all means we should continue the system we 
have for getting on with business. There is no other way to do it.
<P>
	I would like to clarify too that there is no allegation here 
whatsoever of secrecy going on. That is not part of it.
<P>
	I would also like to address one point made by the member for 
Kingston and the Islands, which is that the correction in <I>Hansard</I> 
was not a result of member's statements but was the result of 
another vote being taken. So there is quite a difference between the 
two.
<P>
	Finally, I must maintain my point of order because my principal 
point is that we in opposition rely totally on you, Mr. Speaker, and 
on the rules of the House. Without that we are nowhere.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I have heard both sides and I think 
your Speaker has to accept some responsibility here, of course. As I 
recall and if I might just explain, I believe the hon. whip of the 
Reform Party asked me for a clarification. Upon hearing the whip 
of the Reform Party I asked the whip of the government party for a 
clarification. When he gave me the clarification, I looked over at 
the Reform whip. That cannot be seen in <I>Hansard</I> but can be seen 
on the video. The whip nodded to me, yes he was in agreement, so 
we went on.
<P>
	The point that the Reform whip makes is, of course, very valid. 
The rules should be adhered to. I believe that by and large we have 
adhered to the rules in this particular circumstance.
<P>
	Would members permit their Speaker to perhaps make an 
observation? I have been here for decades and it seems to me that 
the system the whips of the three parties have worked out, with the 
independents as well, makes the House work much better in terms 
of time and understanding. Usually these things are all ironed out 
before these votes take place.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	From my perspective as a long time member of Parliament and 
also as the Speaker, I think it is good for the institution that we can 
work together in this way.
<P>
	If by some oversight your Speaker has failed to ensure this was 
in <I>Hansard</I> I assure the House now that should something like this 
occur again, I will take it upon myself to see that exactly what is in 
accordance with the rules is done. I encourage my colleagues to 
persevere in a system which is new but which does work.
<P>
	I salute the whips from all parties for what they have done for 
this institution to make these votes proceed a little more quickly 
but fairly, which is the important thing here.
<P>
	I thank you for your comments. I agree with the Reform whip 
that of course the rules will be adhered to. As your Speaker, I assure 
you this will be done.

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have tabled the 
immigration levels for 1996. This package is a legislative 
requirement. It is something we have to do by or on November 1 
each year. These packages, and this year's is no exception, are 
always much more than a legislative requirement, much more than 
something we simply have to do. Simply put, this is a map to the 
future, a chart which will hopefully guide us into our tomorrows.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	One year ago today I stood in the Chamber and unveiled the 
government's 10-year immigration plan. This plan was the result of 
an unprecedented and extensive consultation with Canadians from 
all backgrounds, from all walks of life, in every region of our 
country. It laid out a clear path which we are following and 
honouring today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16074"> 16074 </A></B>
<P>
	The levels before the House also demonstrate our commitment 
to a partnership with both provinces and territories as well as our 
continued covenant with the people of Canada and those who 
would call Canada home. They also underline the government's 
commitment to economic growth but not at the expense of our 
humanitarian mission.
<P>
	In 1995 the level range was set at between 190,000 and 215,000. 
The projection for the end of this calendar year is about 198,000 to 
200,000. For 1996 the government has set the level range at 
between 195,000 to 220,000. The levels are slightly up from last 
year. This is as we expected and predicted.
<P>
	Last year we took stock of our immigration program. We made 
some decisions and made some serious changes. We have 
reinforced the foundation and now we can begin to grow that 
program. The levels also show we have achieved what I believe is a 
healthy balance. We have a large influx of economic immigrants 
because this is where we said we would increasingly focus our 
attention through promotion and recruitment around the globe.
<P>
	We also have preserved a strong family class component. The 
rebalancing of the economic and family immigrant components 
introduced in last year's plan is on track. Economic migrants and 
their families will account for 50 per cent of the overall total of 
immigrants in 1996. The family class component will make up 46 
per cent. The remaining 4 per cent will be accounted for by 
humanitarian and compassionate landings in Canada.
<P>
	Canada needs immigrants.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our country needs workers and investors to maintain and 
improve our standard of living. We need them to help us keep 
sparking our economy and to create jobs.
<P>
	As I have said many times in this House, and even more times in 
communities across this country, maintaining and improving the 
standard of living of every Canadian relies, in part, on keeping a 
vibrant and dynamic immigration system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian experience shows that immigrants as well as 
refugees become some of the best, brightest, most self-motivated 
and hard working Canadians. These are the people who will work 
with us to build a stronger, more economically dynamic country, 
which is why we are actively promoting Canada as a place in which 
to settle. We are back in the business of promotion and recruitment 
internationally, something we have lacked for a number of years. 
We are getting the message out that Canada was, is and will 
continue to be a land of opportunity.
<P>
	In 1996 economic immigrants will include three categories: 
skilled workers; business immigrants; and a new category called 
the provincial-territorial nominee class, which is individuals 
sponsored exclusively by provinces and territories.
<P>
	We are aware that for people to succeed in today's rapidly 
changing labour market they have to be adaptable. For this reason 
we will also be introducing changes very soon to the criteria for the 
selection of skilled workers. A revamped point system will 
emphasize the skills needed for long term success in this nation: 
experience, linguistic skills, education and adaptability to the ever 
changing global economy.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Business immigrants represent another classification of the 
economic category. In this regard we expect that between 18,000 
and 20,500 business immigrants will come to Canada next year. 
Over the past year we have worked with our various provincial and 
private sector partners to examine the two components of our 
business immigration movement, our investor and entrepreneur 
classes.
<P>
	Since it started in 1986, the immigrant investor program has 
attracted more than 13,000 business people who have invested over 
$2.5 billion in approved businesses and funds and who in the 
process created 17,000 jobs for Canadians. The government wants 
to build on these successes. I want to ensure an even stronger 
source of risk capital to support growth and job creation, 
particularly in the small and medium size sector.
<P>
	Last year the Minister of Industry and I appointed a private 
sector panel to examine the program and make recommendations 
for improvement. The report was recently made public and we are 
considering the responses, advice and comments submitted by 
Canadians across the country. A new program will be in place by 
Canada Day of next year.
<P>
	Like the immigrant investors, the entrepreneur program has one 
overriding goal: to create jobs and stimulate growth. We want to 
attract additional business people who can contribute to the 
Canadian economy through their hands on management of a 
business entity in our country. In 1996 we will also be introducing 
changes to enhance the overall economic benefit of the 
entrepreneur program.
<P>
	As I mentioned, a new provincial-territorial nominee category 
will recognize the simple truth about our country, that the 
employment needs of one province may not be the same as another.
<P>
	It also acknowledges that Canada is a big country. Not only does 
it have six time zones, but the kinds of jobs needed in the 
sub-Arctic will not necessarily be the same in a seaboard 
community, on the prairies or in downtown metropolitan Toronto. 
Consequently the nominee category would allow each province or 
territory to identify a limited number of economic immigrants each  
year, which will be negotiated and flexible, to meet these special 
provincial and regional economic needs.

	This category is built on the premise that both federal and 
provincial governments must work closer together, more than ever, 
if we are to keep pace with an economy changing with lightning 
speed.
<P>
	The economic component of our immigration program, however, 
is only one piece of an intricate tapestry. Woven throughout is our 
continued commitment to the family and to those in need of 
Canada's protection.
<P>
	With respect to immigration policy, the Liberal government has 
long recognized the importance of the family. We fully and simply 
appreciate the importance which family plays in the life of an 
immigrant and in the very life of our country. Let me assure the 
House that family reunification is and will continue to be a vital 
component of Canada's immigration program. The concept of 
family runs through every single category I have spoken of in the 
last few minutes.
<P>
	In the 1996 levels plan, the arrival of 78,000 to approximately 
86,000 family class immigrants will take place. The majority of 
these individuals are immediate family members: spouses, fiancés 
and dependant children of Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to think our commitment to keeping families 
together is a good indication of what kind of country we truly are, a 
country that cares, a country that values compassion and 
humanitarian values. It is those same virtues which shine through 
in the refugee policies of not only our government but historically 
of our country.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	When confronted with suffering and atrocities, Canadians do not 
want us to turn away.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Again this year, refugee levels are highlighted separately from 
the immigration figures, reflecting our belief and practice that the 
refugee program is best managed in partnership with other 
interested stakeholders and separately from the immigrant 
program.
<P>
	The changes we envision will require greater cooperation 
between ourselves and members of the private sector. We want to 
continue to revitalize private sponsorship of refugees and 
encourage more people to get involved and make a difference.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am happy to say that we are already making progress on this 
front. Recently the government and a number of non-governmental 
organizations formed a partnership to respond to the appeal by the 
United Nations High Commission for Refugees for the resettlement 
of some 5,000 refugees internationally from the former  
Yugoslavia. Canada has agreed to take 10 per cent of that number. 
We have agreed to share the cost of settling a minimum of 500 
people in Canada. The government will cover the crucial first three 
months of financial assistance for refugees and private sponsors 
will then take responsibility for the remaining nine months or until 
the refugees are self-sufficient, whichever comes first.
<P>
	At this point I would like to thank organizations and Canadian 
families across the country as well as members of Parliament from 
all sides who have inquired about the program. I give a particularly 
warm thanks to those individuals and organizations who have 
acted. A church in New Brunswick is prepared to sponsor a family 
of four from Yugoslavia before Christmas. On top of the 500 
Canada has committed to, the province of Quebec is prepared to 
take an additional 100 refugees from the former republic of 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Those are examples of what people of goodwill, compassion, 
and courage can do when they put their minds and their hearts 
together. Thanks to this Parliament and to a number of government 
initiatives, we have made a good number of accomplishments in 
the world of immigration.
<P>
	We have strengthened the integrity of our immigration system 
through the passage of Bill C-44 and ushered in changes to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. We have been able to obtain 
agreements with various countries with respect to travel documents 
for the purposes of removal.
<P>
	We have worked with communities throughout Canada to help 
refugees from around the globe. We have co-operated with other 
departments and Canadians to make sure that Canada's voice at the 
world population conference in Cairo and at the Beijing conference 
was both forceful and eloquent.
<P>
	We have initiated improvements in application processing 
domestically and around the globe. We are improving our 
structures continually, as well as looking at how we do settlement 
and integration of newcomers, not only for their advantage but for 
the advantage of Canada.
<P>
	Of course there is always more to do. There are still other items 
on our agenda that need to be realized, and they will be. As I said at 
the outset, we have a plan and we are staying the course.
<P>
	I am an optimist. I believe in immigration. Canada's cherished 
position in the world today is testimony to the undeniable fact that 
immigration has served our nation well. There is no reason to 
question, no reason to have doubts about whether immigration 
cannot continue to give Canada that strength and that dynamism.
<P>
	In mapping out our immigration levels for 1996, our destination 
is very simple. It is a tomorrow that tempers economic growth with 
care and compassion, a tomorrow that is welcoming and 
accommo-
<P>
<HR>

dating for our  newcomers, a tomorrow that builds a stronger 
country, in essence a tomorrow that belongs rightfully to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to make a few comments on the immigration levels that the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has just tabled before the 
House under the Immigration Act.
<P>
	The minister has announced to us that Canada will take in next 
year a total of 195,000 to 220,000 immigrants and refugees, that is, 
between 171,000 and 187,000 immigrants and between 24,000 and 
32,000 refugees.
<P>
	He has just mentioned the efforts that Canada is making in 
favour of refugees. I have taken note of the fact that we have made 
some efforts regarding nationals from the former Yugoslavia. I 
would also like the minister to make additional efforts in the case 
of other countries and other continents, particularly in assisting 
women and children in distress. I think that we should put an 
emphasis on women and children in distress, who represent the 
majority of refugees in the world. Quebec will accept 27,000 
immigrants and refugees next year, a quota that was established by 
the province in accordance with the Canada-Quebec agreement.
<P>
	We generally agree with the number determined by the minister 
and his government. In fact, it is almost the same plan as the one he 
submitted to us last year, except for slight changes. The first 
change is a small increase of 5,000 new immigrants; the second one 
is that 3,500 immigrants who are subject to a removal order that is 
not yet in effect will be admitted for humanitarian reasons; the 
third change is that a new category has been established, that is, 
candidates sponsored by a province or a territory. A thousand new 
immigrants are expected in this category.
<P>
	The minister has just shown his willingness to work in 
partnership with the provinces and the territories, but he only 
foresees 1,000 immigrants for the nine provinces and the two 
territories. That is not much. That is not a serious effort of 
decentralization and co-operation with the provinces. We know that 
the provinces, except Quebec, which already has very definite 
powers in that field, are also asking for powers concerning 
immigration. Manitoba and Saskatchewan come to mind, in this 
regard.
<P>
	The Minister's 1994 figures indicated Canada would receive 
between 190,000 and 215,000 immigrants in 1995. In fact, for the 
first eight months of this year, Canada has had only 132,000 new 
immigrants. I estimate that the total will not exceed 200,000 by the 
end of this year.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that potential immigrants are less attracted 
to Canada, particularly those from many Asian countries. Many 
naturally prefer to go to the U.S.  or Australia, or other countries 
with a high rate of economic growth. This is the case despite the 
considerable Canadian government investments in advertising, 
promotion and the recruiting of new immigrants in many countries.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The greatest obstacle, however, without a doubt for new 
immigrants is the $975 entry tax on top of the $500 up front 
processing fee. This tax represents an enormous barrier to people 
from poor countries.
<P>
	In addition to setting immigration quotas, the minister ought to 
have announced measures to reduce delays in processing 
immigration files. Despite some efforts by the minister, which I am 
prepared to acknowledge, an application for permanent residence 
in Canada sometimes takes 18 months or more. So refugees who 
have been here a year or two awaiting refugee status have to wait 
another year or more to gain resident status, when they can bring in 
their spouse and children. It is inhumane to keep families apart for 
such long periods of time. The minister will have to take the 
appropriate steps on this.
<P>
	I would also like to denounce the abusive use of DNA testing to 
prove parent-child relationships. Many members of the Haitian 
community in my riding of Bourassa, in Montreal North and in all 
of Montreal complain that departmental employees, particularly in 
the Canadian embassy in Port-au-Prince, require tests which they 
feel are discriminatory.
<P>
	I should add that a DNA test costs $1,000 and, naturally, they 
often cannot afford it. It should be enough to present a birth 
certificate to prove kinship.
<P>
	I would like the minister to tell us what justification there can be 
for this to be made a practice of in the case of Haitians. Why are 
European immigrants not subject to the same requirement, except 
in rare instances? These measures often work against the family 
reunification program just mentioned by the minister as being a 
priority for this government.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the immigration tax in particular. Since 
its implementation in the last federal budget, the Bloc Quebecois 
has repeatedly expressed its opposition to this tax, and has opposed 
this $975 fee immigrants and refugees have to pay to become 
landed immigrants.
<P>
	Numerous organizations in Quebec and in Canada have 
condemned this discriminatory measure and have campaigned 
against it. Last October 28, which was the national day against the 
head tax, the Montreal refugee services organisations round table 
reiterated its opposition to the settlement fees for refugees, 
immigrants and their families. This very respectable organization 
said this tax imposed an intolerable and discriminatory burden on 
these people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16077"> 16077 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada is the only country in the world which has decided to 
impose such fees on refugees recognized as such under the Geneva 
Convention. It should be pointed out that the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees has voiced very serious concerns 
about this dangerous precedent.
<P>
	Bob White, the president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said 
that the head tax is basically contrary to Canadian values of equity, 
equality and progress.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	He added that rich immigrants are able to pay this tax, but that 
most African, Asian or Latin-American people who want to 
immigrate to Canada or come as refugees cannot afford to do so. I 
seize this opportunity to ask the Minister why the number of 
immigrants and refugees from Latin America keeps on getting 
smaller year after year. For a number of years now, it has been 
almost impossible to come to Canada from Latin America.
<P>
	The loans system established to help those who have to pay this 
tax did not work. A moment ago, an official told us they have no 
way to assess the impact of this tax abroad. A lot of loan requests 
are rejected because the candidate will not have the money to repay 
the loan.
<P>
	Once again, I ask the minister to put an end to this tax, at least 
for refugees. I remind him that even some of his Liberal colleagues 
made such a request regarding refugees. My wife, my two children 
and I came from Chile in 1974. If we had had over $4,000 to pay in 
landing fees in order to have our application examined by 
immigration authorities, we would never have been able to come.
<P>
	Worse still, all the money collected, estimated at $146 million 
for 1995, goes into general revenue instead of being used for 
settlement services for immigrants. Of course, despite the 
immigration tax which, as I just said, will bring in $146 million in 
1995, the transfer of responsibilities to NGOs for immigration and 
integration of new arrivals will mean a drastic reduction in funds 
and services.
<P>
	Already, hundreds of civil servants have lost their jobs with the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration. In 1996 alone, the 
government will cut the number of civil servants by 20 per cent at 
headquarters and in the regions. Once again, I denounce these 
massive cuts of civil servants.
<P>
	In short, I am asking the minister to pay more attention to the 
reports issued by the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration. It has issued several reports which were tabled in this 
House, but we never had any feedback from the minister. Although 
many witnesses have come before the committee and much effort 
was spent on this, the minister has not bothered to respond to these 
reports.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that the minister should take additional 
measures to launch an education and awareness campaign, directed 
at the Canadian people, on the contributions and other positive 
influence of immigrants in our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I stand today to respond to the minister's 
statement on immigration levels for the coming year, I am not 
particularly reassured by the minister's glowing picture of the state 
of Canada's immigration policy.
<P>
	The minor increase in actual immigration numbers is somewhat 
irrelevant, as the actual number of immigrants who will be arriving 
this year is closer to the lower levels of projections for this year and 
will probably be the same next year. However, by announcing a 
modest increase of 5 per cent, the government can say it is moving 
closer to its red book promise.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal red book states: ``We would continue to target 
immigration levels of approximately 1 per cent of the population 
each year''. That works out to approximately 300,000 immigrants a 
year, and we are only at two-thirds of that total. I would suggest 
this is a much more reasonable number than the red book promise, 
but a number that is still likely to cause difficulty.
<P>
	Part of the problem with these numbers is that the minister's own 
department is having difficulty handling and processing the 
applications. Last month one of the managers from the Vegreville 
office spoke to MPs' staff in the Vancouver area. At that time he 
announced that the Vegreville office had a backlog of over 15,000 
files, with 7,000 of those files being over a year old. If we have that 
type of backlog now, what is going to happen if the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration proceeds with its proposed cutbacks 
of up to 25 per cent of its staff?
<P>
	Another interesting aspect of this announcement on new levels is 
the new category of provincial-territorial nominees. This new 
category will give the provinces and territories, with the exception 
of Quebec, the ability to share a grand total of 1,000 immigrants. 
As I said, with the exception of Quebec. Under the Canada-Quebec 
accord, Quebec already has sole responsibility for the selection of 
immigrants destined to that province. This applies only to 
economic immigrants. Nevertheless, last year Quebec had the 
ability to choose more than 11,000 economic immigrants who 
came to that province. In a sense of fairness, the federal 
government has decided to permit the rest of the provinces and 
territories to have a say in selecting a total of 1,000.
<P>
	The numbers show another interesting aspect of the 
Canada-Quebec accord. Under this arrangement Quebec  received 
$90 million to spend on settlement in that province. The federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16078"> 16078 </A></B>
<P>
government in turn spent about $270 million in the rest of Canada. 
Thus, Quebec's share was about one-quarter of the total allotment, 
which was fairly consistent with Quebec's one-quarter of the 
population in Canada and was fairly consistent with Quebec's 
intent to settle 47,000 of the immigrants to the country, or 
one-quarter. However, a funny thing happened on the way to the 
forum. Quebec settled only 26,000 immigrants last year, which is 
only 13 per cent of the total. Yet it still received $90 million, or 
approximately one-quarter of all settlement dollars.
<P>
	Next year Quebec will settle only 27,000 immigrants and 
refugees, or approximately 12 to 13 per cent of the total. Yet it will 
still receive $90 million, or 25 per cent of the funding.
<P>
	Given Premier Parizeau's comments about the ethnic vote in 
Quebec, I can understand why immigrants are reluctant to move to 
that province. However, the reality is that the federal government is 
now funding the settlement of immigrants in Quebec at a rate twice 
that of the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Levels, numbers, and dollars are only one part of the equation. 
Canadians are just as concerned about the quality of the immigrants 
we are receiving as we are about the number of immigrants we are 
receiving. Polls show there is not a great deal of public support for 
Canada's current immigration in this nation. The government likes 
to say it is because of the Reform Party that such support is down. 
While I appreciate the government's acknowledging our influence, 
I must inform its members that our party is just reflecting the 
concerns of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	Ordinary Canadians get upset when they hear that 14 per cent of 
sponsorship obligations are in default, to the tune of $700 million 
in 1993. They get upset when they read in the September 30 edition 
of the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> that 19 per cent of welfare recipients in the 
Ottawa-Carleton region are immigrants and refugees. They want 
this government to get tough on sponsors who default on their 
obligations. Instead, they hear about cases like Mohammed Assaf.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	In 1989 Mohammed Assaf sponsored his brother and family to 
settle in Alberta. Within two years his brother's family went on 
welfare. The Alberta taxpayers have had to shell out $40,000 in 
welfare payments. Despite attempts by the Alberta social services 
to collect the money from Mohammed, the sponsor, he ignored 
them. He then wanted to sponsor his second wife to come to 
Canada. In their wisdom, the immigration department officials said 
no, he could not sponsor her because he had an outstanding 
sponsorship obligation already.
<P>
	Mohammed Assaf paid back $8,000 of his $40,000 obligation 
and then came up with a better idea: He would  appeal to the IRB. 
Guess what happened? The IRB members said: ``Do not worry 
about your debt to the Canadian taxpayer, we will let you sponsor 
your second wife here anyway''.
<P>
	What kind of message does this send, not only to the immigrant 
community but to the Canadian public at large? Outrageous IRB 
decisions like this one undermine everything the minister says he is 
trying to do to rectify the problem of defaulted sponsorship.
<P>
	It is not good enough to blame the IRB. The members of the 
board are patronage appointees the minister installed. It is 
somewhat ironic that everything the minister is trying to 
accomplish through his department is being undone by the political 
hacks he appointed to the IRB.
<P>
	While the percentage of immigrants who arrive in this country 
via the family reunification aspect of immigration is being reduced, 
it is still a major problem area. Most Canadians will acknowledge 
that the reunification of family members is a valid goal. However, 
this reunification must be limited to immediate family.
<P>
	As reported in one of the studies incorporated in the book 
<I>Diminishing Returns</I>, over recent years each individual who has 
immigrated to Canada under the family class has had a multiplier 
effect of an additional seven immigrants. Unfortunately, many of 
these are solely done for money, be they arranged marriages for a 
large dowry or outright sham marriages. I have been informed of 
one case in which a woman was upset because she was having 
difficulty sponsoring her fourth husband in four years. Shams like 
these contribute to bringing the whole system in disrepute.
<P>
	On the plus side, we have those immigrants who do make a 
positive contribution to Canada's economy. Studies consistently 
show that these people make more money than native-born 
Canadians.
<P>
	Last year the minister proudly announced that the percentage of 
economic immigrants will rise from 43 per cent to 55 per cent of all 
immigration. While this may sound good, it is somewhat 
deceptive. In fact the majority of immigrants who come under the 
economic class are not those high income earners but the 
dependants of high income earners. In reality, only 17 per cent of 
those in the immigrant class are these high income individuals. 
When we add refugees to the equation, only 14 per cent of all 
newcomers to the country are economic immigrants.
<P>
	Unfortunately, many of these individuals are becoming 
disillusioned with what they find here. Media reports from 
Vancouver recently indicated that many of these immigrants who 
arrived from Hong Kong are returning to Hong Kong. They cite the 
high and numerous taxes in Canada as well as endless government 
regulations that tend to discourage the creation of wealth as the 
main reasons they are leaving. Is it not ironic that these  individuals 
believe they will be better off from a business perspective under the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16079"> 16079 </A></B>
<P>
communist regime of the People's Republic of China in a couple of 
years than they are under the Liberal government today.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to discuss Canada's acceptance of refugees. 
We have always been generous in accepting legitimate convention 
refugees, and we should continue to receive our share of those 
fleeing persecution from conflicts in Africa, Asia, and the former 
Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, convention refugees are not necessarily 
what we are getting.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	One of my staffers recently met with a young Somali refugee 
currently attending Ottawa University. The only problem is that 
this individual is neither a refugee nor a Somali. Rather he was 
born in neighbouring Djibouti and while a resident of France he 
came to Ottawa to go to university. When he started to run low on 
funds he went to a local Canada immigration office, claimed to be a 
Somali refugee and now the Canadian taxpayers are funding the 
rest of his education.
<P>
	How about Tejinder Pal Singh, a convicted airline hijacker? He 
arrived in Canada, claimed refugee status under an alias and is now 
free on bail in Vancouver while the IRB hears his case.
<P>
	If the government wants Canadians to openly accept refugees, 
then it had better make sure we are opening our doors to legitimate 
convention refugees and not murderers, hijackers or scam artists.
<P>
	If the government wants all Canadians to support its 
immigration policy, then it had best make sure that it is bringing in 
people who want to make a positive contribution to our country, 
and not in the minister's own words the ``wretched refuse'' from 
``teeming shores''.

happening. I believe that prevention is a major concern and a major 
goal of all parties of the House.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-61, an act to establish a system 
of administrative monetary penalties for the enforcement of the 
Canadian Agricultural Products Act, the Feeds Act, the Meat 
Inspection Act, the Pest Control Products Act, the Plant Protection 
Act and the Seeds Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
speak for a very few minutes this afternoon at the final stage of 
consideration given to Bill C-61, the agriculture and agri-food 
administrative monetary penalties act.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I am very pleased to be able to report to the House, as has been 
noted earlier in our debates, that this legislation enjoys the solid 
support of key Canadian agri-food industry associations. Members 
of the House have already had ample opportunity to consider the 
bill in detail. Members are well aware of the benefits of Bill C-61 
and there is very broad support in the House for the principle of 
what we are trying to accomplish. Therefore, my comments today 
will be brief and to the point as I reiterate just a few of the 
highlights of Bill C-61.
<P>
	First, this bill will provide my department's officials with a 
broader range of measures to effectively enforce food safety and 
quality regulations. For example, they will have the authority and 
the power to impose monetary penalties and to negotiate solutions 
to violation situations rather than over-reliance, which has been the 
case in the past, on the only tool available to them, criminal 
prosecution.
<P>
	The bill allows the government to meet industry demands for a 
system that applies equal and consistent enforcement practices 
against both importers and domestic companies that market 
products which do not meet Canadian health, safety or quality 
standards. This will help to create a level playing field for the 
domestic food industry.
<P>
	Bill C-61 will strengthen our enforcement at border points. It 
will do so by allowing us to issue monetary penalties at ports of 
entry for violations committed by the travelling public who attempt 
illegally to bring meat and plant products into Canada that could 
introduce animal or plant diseases that do not naturally occur in our 
country.
<P>
	Bill C-61 is fair and it is expedient. It allows for negotiated 
solutions for non-compliance. Administrative monetary penalties 
can be reduced to zero if a violator takes immediate corrective 
action to come into compliance. After all, that is the objective, to 
achieve compliance. This results in a better product and more 
effective enforcement. In this way the system emphasizes 
compliance and not punishment.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-61 will improve the competitiveness of Canadian 
industry while helping to maintain Canada's well-established 
international reputation for high quality health and safety 
standards.
<P>
	The use of monetary penalties is not a new concept in the federal 
regulatory system. It is consistent with initiatives that are being 
undertaken by other departments. Similar systems to the one we are 
proposing in Bill C-61 are in use by the Department of Transport 
and by the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	One point was raised in the committee discussion of Bill C-61, 
and was raised at the report stage here in the House, which I should 
deal with for just a moment is the erroneous suggestion that my 
parliamentary secretary might have in some way misled members 
of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food with 
respect to the letters of support my department received from 
industry associations during the consultation process related to this 
bill.
<P>
	Industry stakeholders have been kept fully informed of the 
progress of Bill C-61 right from day one. They will continue to be 
informed until the legislation is ultimately enacted.
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada started the consultation 
process on the bill in early 1992. That was during a regulatory 
review process. The regulatory review confirmed that there was 
very broad industry support for the concept of an administrative 
monetary penalty system.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16082"> 16082 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Later in October 1992 a letter was sent by Dr. Art Olson, the 
assistant deputy minister in my department for the food production 
and inspection branch. That letter went to all affected industry 
associations, including those referred to in the list of industry 
associations which was provided to the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food during its consideration of Bill C-61.
<P>
	The letter from Dr. Olson informed all of those industry 
organizations of the department's intention to introduce a system of 
administrative monetary penalties. The department also during that 
period engaged in face to face negotiations with a number of 
relevant groups. After that initial contact and consultation with 
industry, my department received a number of letters of support 
from industry organizations.
<P>
	On the day Bill C-61 was tabled in the House for the first time in 
December 1994 another letter was sent by my department, this time 
to 132 industry associations to inform them specifically that the 
process had moved beyond the consultation stage, beyond the 
drafting stage to the point at which there was now a formal bill 
printed and ready to go. It was important to inform the industry of 
that progress.
<P>
	In addition to the letter to the 132 industry associations, included 
in the package was a four-page background document outlining all 
the important provisions of Bill C-61. The letter in December 1994 
specifically invited representatives of the industry to follow up 
with the department if they had any questions or concerns. A few 
inquiries came in for further detail.
<P>
	It is important to note that during that process not one of those 
organizations, the 132 industry associations consulted, indicated it 
had changed its position of support for Bill C-61. At the same time 
the second letter went out a news release was sent to more than 
1,000 media and industry contacts to make sure they were informed 
as well.
<P>
	Since December 1994 until now the process has moved along 
through the various parliamentary stages. In recent weeks 
departmental officials have contacted 10 of the industry 
associations that had originally indicated support for the 
legislation. These are the associations referred to by the member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster when he raised questions as to 
whether these organizations were still supportive of Bill C-61.
<P>
	Those organizations have been contacted once again to 
reconfirm their position. Of those 10 organizations mentioned by 
the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster only three said they had 
ever been contacted by the Reform Party. Nine said they fully 
continue to support this legislation. The tenth involved a person 
who had just come on to the job in the last number of weeks and 
was not yet in a position to express an opinion.
<P>
	The department is making arrangements to ensure the individual 
in that important position will be fully briefed by the department on 
all the details of Bill C-61.
<P>
	It is quite obvious the consultative effort here has been lengthy 
and thorough. The information provided to the committee and to 
the House by the government and representatives of the 
government with respect to this consultative process has been 
complete and accurate.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The process of bringing Bill C-61 now to its final stage in the 
House has been a good process. There has been ample time for 
good discussion. Many ideas have been brought forward in that 
process, either informally in the drafting stage or formally in the 
form of amendments in committee and in the House which have 
been very useful. The government has demonstrated openness and 
flexibility in dealing with all of these ideas. A number of those 
proposed amendments were accepted by the government and have 
been incorporated into what is now the final draft of Bill C-61.
<P>
	The bill will provide for a system which will deal with violations 
and potential violations of health and safety rules and regulations. 
It will be faster, fairer, more cost effective and more flexible in 
order to increase compliance with all of our health and safety 
regulations pertaining to agriculture and agri-food and also to assist 
Canadian agri-food businesses in winning and maintaining a 
competitive edge.
<P>
	With the thorough discussion we have had with respect to this 
legislation and all of the proposed amendments, I urge my fellow 
members of the House on both sides to support Bill C-61 and to 
give it speedy passage on its way to the other place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was not present during last week's debate on Bill C-61. It is my 
friend and colleague, the member for the riding of Lotbinière next 
to mine, who participated in the debate in this House on the official 
opposition's amendments to Bill C-61.
<P>
	As you know full well, I had to work hard in my riding of 
Frontenac to campaign against my colleague who sits on the 
opposition benches in the National Assembly in order to obtain a 
yes majority in that riding. I take this opportunity to thank my 
constituents for supporting the option of sovereignty with 
partnership.
<P>
	I, however, read these proceedings carefully and I must say I am 
surprised by the government members' frivolous comments on our 
amendments. Nevertheless, the Bloc Quebecois feels that Bill C-61 
will allow the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food to meet 
several of its objectives, in particular relieving pressure on the 
courts and the resulting savings for taxpayers. In  this regard, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16083"> 16083 </A></B>
<P>
Bloc Quebecois agrees with the principle of administrative 
monetary penalties.
<P>
	We, however, cannot support the bill as tabled by the 
government for a very simple reason, namely that the federal 
Department of Transport implemented a system of monetary 
penalties without allowing offenders to negotiate these penalties 
with the department. We in the official opposition see this 
opportunity to negotiate penalties as the Achilles heel of the bill. 
Yet, the federal department of agriculture did not consider the 
amendments put forward by the Bloc Quebecois and continues to 
support the principle of penalty negotiation.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois thinks that this bill could have a 
major impact on the way justice is served.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The judicial power differs from the legislative one. Here, in the 
House of Commons, we can discuss, improve, analyze and review 
bills, but when it comes to implementing them, the judicial system 
takes over. In a self-respecting society, the judicial system must 
never have a close and direct link with the legislative power. 
Otherwise, what kind of society would we be living in? Does the 
government seek to have a totalitarian society in which our fellow 
citizens would be accountable to their elected representatives, and 
in which the judicial system would lose its authority? I certainly 
hope that we will not live in a totalitarian regime.
<P>
	Consequently, it is very unfortunate that the federal government 
flatly rejected the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. 
These amendments sought to eliminate the risk of arbitrary 
decisions in the administration of penalties.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture should recognize that the 
compliance agreements and negotiations which he will allow to 
reduce the penalty imposed to an offender are not indispensable to 
reach his objective, which is to reduce the workload of the courts.
<P>
	As his colleague, the Minister of Transport, knows from 
experience, it is much more beneficial for an offender to 
immediately pay a fine than to go to the courts, particularly if he 
knows that his is a lost cause. The monetary penalty system is, in 
itself, a good enough incentive to encourage the offender to settle 
the issue outside the courts. Any compliance agreement to reduce 
the penalty does not do anything more, except create a major risk of 
unfairness in the administration of penalties.
<P>
	The amendments tabled by the Bloc Quebecois, through the hon. 
member for Lotbinière, sought to abolish any form of compliance 
agreement or negotiation between the department and the offender. 
The Minister of Agriculture has not convinced us, far from it, that 
there is no risk of arbitrary decision in this monetary penalty 
system. We still feel that the negotiation process allowing a 
departmental officer to reduce the penalty of  an offender is unfair 
and, more importantly, dangerous for a democracy.
<P>
	The member for Brandon-Souris justified the quick rejection of 
the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois by saying, and I 
quote: ``The important thing in these matters is that compliance is 
achieved. Whether or not there is a reduced or an increased penalty 
is secondary in most cases to bringing about the change by the 
perpetrator of the infraction''.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food fully agreed with 
that earlier when he said that compliance is more important than 
enforcement.
<P>
	I was talking with the chief of police of a small community in 
my riding who had to go to Sherbrooke to testify. To show how 
ridiculous the fines and penalties have become, he told me that 
people indicted on seven or eight charges for offences at their 
summer cottages passed him on his way back to his community, 
such was the speed with which they had been able to settle the 
fines. Despite the jail sentences provided for in the case of such 
offences, they were dealt with so fast that they passed the chief of 
police at high speed, and made gestures I would not dare make in 
the House.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Our police forces are so dispirited that often they wonder 
whether they should do their job or close their eyes and pretend not 
to see, because our justice system is going downhill and bankrupt.
<P>
	In other words, the hon. member for Brandon-Souris feels what 
matters is compliance, not whether the law is enforced fairly or not. 
He cannot answer that question. I am sorry, but in Quebec we do 
not buy that kind of justice.
<P>
	Make no mistake, the amendments put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois were not to abolish the monetary penalty system. As I 
said earlier, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with this principle which 
will help to reduce the caseload of the courts.
<P>
	However, this is a new and intelligent approach, especially in 
times of financial crisis. Having said that, the caseload of the courts 
should not be reduced and a parallel justice system should not be 
created if it means the implementation of an arbitrary justice 
system. The possibility of negotiating the penalty with civil 
servants introduces an unacceptable bias in the penalty process.
<P>
	More specifically, after noticing an offence, officials of the 
Production and Inspection Branch will recommend to their director 
the appropriate penalty to impose. We therefore have a centralized 
decision process and the department maintains that the regulations 
eliminate the risk of arbitrary decisions. But that is not true. It is 
not true and indeed the government has not even seen fit to 
introduce the regulations, even though they are very  important in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16084"> 16084 </A></B>
<P>
this case, to assess the relevancy of a negotiation system to reduce 
the penalties.
<P>
	A departmental official is authorized to reach an agreement with 
the offender to reduce the penalty by $1 for every $2 the company 
will invest to improve its procedures, buy new equipment or train 
its employees. We are against such a principle. In our justice 
system, penalties are not negotiable. I repeat: in our justice system, 
penalties are not negotiable.
<P>
	I look at my colleague, the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi, who once was the president of the bar in his 
district. He knows full well that someone who has been found 
guilty of an offence does not have the opportunity to negotiate his 
or her penalty or sentence, far from it.
<P>
	Imagine, Madam Speaker, that you are on highway 401 going to 
Montreal and that an OPP officer stops you for speeding, for 
example. You start to negotiate with him. You are guilty, you were 
doing 140 kilometres an hour and you negotiate with the OPP 
officer: ``Look, I was doing 140, I was going down a hill, the car 
started to go faster, so be indulgent with me. I am the Deputy 
Speaker of the House of Commons. Write down on the ticket that I 
was doing 121 kilometres or just let me go.''
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Would that kind of double-standard justice be acceptable? No. I 
do not think, Madam Speaker, that Quebecers would accept that 
you negotiate your speeding ticket with an OPP officer, let alone 
with an officer of the Sûreté du Québec, because it would not be 
appropriate for a member of Parliament, especially for the Deputy 
Speaker of the House of Commons, to do so. And it is possible with 
this legislation that agricultural producers and people in related 
industries could negotiate, by mutual agreement, an unprecedented 
reduction of their penalty.
<P>
	This could have an adverse effect on the viability and also on the 
reliability of our agricultural products here, in Canada. I heard that 
it was possible to negotiate a speeding ticket, but you certainly 
understand as well as I do that it is not an ideal situation. In this 
case, an offender who is better off financially and who would be in 
a position to invest in order to correct a particular situation would 
be rewarded for that through a reduction of his or her penalty. For 
each $2 invested, the penalty would be reduced by $1. This way, 
the person who has enough money could have the penalty reduced 
to zero, whereas the person who does not have that much money 
could not settle the matter in the same way. Therefore, this 
proposal would put some inequity in our justice system.
<P>
	People or businesses would not be treated equally; they would be 
treated according to their spending power. Moreover, who would 
assess the cost of the efforts made by a person or a business to 
correct a particular  situation? For instance, training may cost more 
in a particular region, and the same applies to equipment, which 
means some individuals and companies will be penalized.
<P>
	Will they be informed of all the approaches available to them to 
correct the situation? What happens in the case of padded invoices 
involving collusion by suppliers? If we are looking for incentives 
to step up training and investment in a company, we should 
improve on methods that already exist, such as fiscal or other 
incentives, but these should not be used to negotiate a penalty.
<P>
	The bill also calls for a 50 per cent reduction in the penalty if the 
person who commits the violation pays the fine without 
challenging the decision or requesting a review by a tribunal. I 
repeat, we are opposed to this concept. Under our legal system, the 
presumption of innocence is a fundamental right. Madam Speaker, 
I would like to go back to the example I mentioned earlier. You are 
clocked at 140 kilometres per hour, and your fine is $225. You get 
your ticket, you pay on the spot or within seven to ten days, but 
under this particular system, if you pay without challenging your 
ticket, the fine is halved.
<P>
	So $225 divided by two is $112.50. To avoid clogging the courts, 
the fine will be reduced by 50 per cent. This is ridiculous. Unless of 
course the government has a brilliant idea and decides to double the 
fines while at the same time introducing incentives. In that case, it 
is misrepresenting the enforcement of this legislation.
<P>
	Under our legal system, the presumption of innocence is a 
fundamental right. For instance, in a situation that could go either 
way, the company or individual is given to understand that they are 
better off paying the fine without further ado.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The individual is entitled to a review but is told: ``Listen, you 
have a gun at your head''. He will be told he has already been found 
guilty and that if he wants to reduce his penalty, the best thing is to 
pay up without a fuss. And what about the right to representation?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois proposed amendments to ensure that the 
president and members of the tribunal who are responsible for 
reviewing decisions made by departmental officials are able to do 
so. The person who committed a violation could, if he so desires, 
have a hearing before the tribunal in order to request a review of his 
penalty. However, the tribunal-listen to this, Madam Speaker, this 
is very important-is appointed by the minister and the mandate of 
its members is renewable. Members are to assess decisions made 
by departmental employees who obviously are answerable to the 
minister. Is there not a conflict of interest here?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16085"> 16085 </A></B>
<P>
	People sitting on this tribunal who would like to see their 
mandate renewed for a second term would be more inclined to 
do the department's bidding, while someone who refuses to do so 
would not see his mandate renewed.
<P>
	In any case, I was looking at the procedure used to appoint the 
president of the UI Board of Referees in Thetford, in my riding. 
The person appointed to chair this board and rule on UI disputes 
was probably a good choice politically speaking, because she is 
connected with the Quebec Liberal Party and the Liberal Party of 
Canada, but she has never seen a worker or an unemployed worker 
up close. Why not take someone who knows about unemployment 
insurance, other than in books, someone who has had experience 
with it? This is patronage. In any case, it would appear to be a 
recommendation from the Frontenac riding Liberal association, 
which was accepted.
<P>
	I hope that we are not going to go the same route here in 
appointing people, that the appointees will already have had a close 
look at the system they are being asked to work on-in short, 
competent individuals. Maybe competence will mean having 
campaigned in the Liberal Party at both levels, in Quebec City and 
in Ottawa-this is what make competent people.
<P>
	To ensure greater transparency in the appointment of the 
chairperson and the members of the tribunal, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois have suggested that they be appointed by the minister 
with the approval of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-food. However, the members of this government represent the 
majority on the agriculture and agri-food committee, as elsewhere; 
they control it and always get their way.
<P>
	We in the opposition, with our colleagues from the third party, 
simply ask questions. We propose resolutions, obviously, motions 
that are usually relegated to the shelves, because the government 
party makes use of its majority. They could have circulated their 
list of chairperson and tribunal members, and have the committee 
validate it at least. They refused. And they say their party is 
democratic.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	You all know that the world of agriculture is a very small one. 
However, once again, our amendments have been quickly 
dismissed with a wave of the hand. The government also showed it 
paid little attention to the proposals put forward by the official 
opposition. As the Bloc Quebecois agriculture critic in this House, 
I note that the government has never taken amendments proposed 
by the Bloc Quebecois into account in this area. Although we 
support the basic principle of a system of administrative monetary 
penalties, we are well aware that there was no need for the 
government to add a penalty bargaining system.
<P>
	In fact, this is what officials from the department confirmed 
during their appearance before the Standing  Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-food. On its own, the monetary penalty 
system is enough of an incentive to freeing the courts.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois therefore vigorously opposes Bill C-61, 
because it establishes a system for penalty bargaining between 
officials and those who have committed violations. This new form 
of justice is not currently practiced in Quebec. It seems to me to be 
contrary to Quebec traditions and to our system of justice. I suspect 
that this sort of consideration was not taken into account when the 
bill was drafted. I would be curious to see whether the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food would be prepared to revise this 
legislation if, on implementation, it proves to be in conflict with 
the traditions and values of Quebec society.
<P>
	In short, this bill on monetary penalties has an interesting 
purpose: to relieve pressure on the courts.
<P>
	What we in the opposition disagree with is the opportunity to 
negotiate penalties. This will, I am sure, lead to abuse, to 
negotiations under the table, to questionable negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> No, no, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Yes, questionable. This bill may 
hurt agriculture instead of helping it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> That will not happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> My colleague from Beauséjour 
knows full well that when a fisherman is caught red-handed in 
violation of federal legislation, we do not negotiate on the size of 
the fish he caught on the sly, or on anything else. The individual 
guilty of fishing off his riding will be caught and prosecuted.
<P>
	As I said, the judicial and legislative branches of government 
must not sleep in the same bed. Never. Yet, there are many lawyers 
in this party. They should be the first ones to denounce Bill C-61 
because it is flawed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> No. Jean-Guy, you just said that you would 
support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> No, we will not support it. I find it 
disturbing, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Its purpose is commendable. To take your own example, Madam 
Speaker, you get a $225 speeding ticket for driving 140 kilometres 
an hour and you pay it. If you pay it, will your fine be cut in half? 
No. And that is a good thing.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	As my colleague who was president of the Bar in his region, the 
hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi, knows full well, the 
substance of the bill is valid. However, the possibility of 
negotiating fines-not up, of course, but down-raises serious 
questions regarding the viability of administering Bill C-61.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise in the House to talk about Bill C-61, the 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act.
<P>
	Plans for administrative monetary penalties have been on the 
books in the department of agriculture for at least a couple of years. 
Under a system of administrative monetary penalties, or AMPS, an 
inspector who determines that a violation of an agri-food act has 
been committed can impose a fine on the offender rather than go 
through the judicial system. The main goal of AMPS according to 
the department is to obtain compliance rather than to punish. The 
United States and some countries in Europe have been using an 
administrative monetary penalty system for some time.
<P>
	The Reform Party is not opposed to the concept of 
administrative monetary penalties. We like the idea of a penalty 
system that is more efficient and cost effective, a system that helps 
individuals and companies to comply with regulations. In addition, 
most of the organizations I have talked to support the concept of 
administrative monetary penalties. However there is a difference 
between supporting the concept of AMPS and supporting an AMPS 
program as proposed in a piece of legislation.
<P>
	Before I discuss the problems associated with the legislation, I 
believe it would be helpful to the House to give a short account of 
the history of Bill C-61 since it started some time ago. On 
December 5, 1994, Bill C-61 was given first reading in the House. 
Second reading of the bill was given on February 10 and 13 of this 
year. It was then referred to the Standing Committee on Agriculture 
and Agri-Food for consideration, and the standing committee 
reviewed the legislation on March 15, 23, 30 and April 4 of this 
year.
<P>
	On March 15 departmental officials explained the bill's 
provisions and answered questions. On March 23 Transport Canada 
officials explained the administrative monetary penalty system 
introduced in 1985 under the Aeronautics Act and answered 
questions. On March 30 Ghislaine Richard, former vice-president 
of the Civil Aviation Tribunal, provided evidence to the committee 
on the function of the tribunal particularly as it related to the 
implementation of Transport Canada's administrative monetary 
penalty system, and she answered questions.
<P>
	On April 4, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada officials returned 
to respond to concerns expressed by the  members about 
disincentives to contest charges, the burden of proof criteria for 
adjusting the penalty amount and other issues raised during 
discussion of the bill. The bill was then put to bed and because of 
the criticism of the bill we thought it may never come to 
prominence in the House again.
<P>
	I raised a point in committee and in the House which the minister 
of agriculture commented on a few minutes ago. In committee the 
parliamentary secretary for agriculture handed out a list of industry 
associations that he claimed had personally endorsed Bill C-61. He 
also suggested there were letters available that would verify this 
endorsement and that we were welcome to request copies of the 
letter if we chose to do so.
<P>
	We requested the letters of endorsement and found that a 
majority of the letters had been written two to three years before 
the bill was tabled in the House last December. We acknowledge 
the fact that the department of agriculture consulted with the 
industry associations. However we have some qualms about the 
way the parliamentary secretary for agriculture presented the facts 
or lack of facts to me and my colleagues with regard to the 
endorsement of the legislation.
<P>
	Most of the letters to the department endorsed the concept of an 
AMPS but not necessarily the bill as it exists before the House 
today.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	The minister of agriculture suggested that we had only contacted 
three on the list of organizations that we were given indication had 
endorsed Bill C-61. The minister is wrong. Since the list was 
submitted by the parliamentary secretary to the committee, we 
have contacted directly presidents or government relations people 
from eight of the eleven organizations on the list.
<P>
	In several cases the signatories of the letters were no longer with 
the organization. This presented a problem in tracking down the 
appropriate spokesperson. The eight organizations that we directly 
contacted included those on the list of the parliamentary secretary 
that he distributed to the committee. We were unable to speak with 
some of the people because they were no longer in the 
organizations they used to represent.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary indicated that these were the letters 
of endorsement he had on file for Bill C-61, and that was not true. 
Bill C-61 was not in existence when the letters were written. 
Perhaps, as the minister suggested, there was some other 
correspondence with these organizations. He certainly has not 
given us copies of any further endorsements of Bill C-61 and what 
date the endorsements came about. He told us he issued press 
releases and had communications with 100-odd organizations but 
he has never given us any hard copies that would validate his 
claims.
<P>
	When we contacted the people whose names had been given by 
the parliamentary secretary, they were quite  surprised to find out 
there was a Bill C-61. On a few occasions they asked for a copy of 
the bill and said that if they are supposed to have endorsed the bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16087"> 16087 </A></B>
<P>
they should at least see what it is, what it is all about and what are 
the details of the bill. They were rather shocked.
<P>
	The minister did not clearly respond to our concerns. Specific 
letters were given to us that were alleged to have been support for 
Bill C-61. That was not true. They were not letters of support for 
Bill C-61. They were letters written before the Liberal government 
was even elected to the House of Commons.
<P>
	The information we were given was wrong. If that is any 
indication of how the department of agriculture runs or any 
reflection on the capabilities of the minister of agriculture and his 
parliamentary secretary, those of us who are farmers certainly have 
a great deal to be concerned about.
<P>
	As I have already mentioned, the Reform Party endorses the 
AMPS, but we want to know if the department of agriculture 
consulted the industry associations one time and then did whatever 
it pleased, or if it actually took the time to address some of the 
industry's concerns. The industry had some concerns that it put 
forward in letters that were not letters of support for Bill C-61 but 
were letters that said they supported an AMP concept.
<P>
	Only after we raised a stink in the House did the minister's office 
call industry associations for approval. As the minister readily 
admitted in his speech, he had to go back and contact the 
organizations. I think we hit a raw nerve or created a bit of a stir. 
We actually followed up the leads and caused some problems for 
the minister because he had not done his homework and he did not 
know what was going on.
<P>
	In talking to some industry associations about Bill C-61 there 
was substantial concern regarding its implementation. 
Associations, producers and processors want assurances the system 
will be applied fairly, uniformly and consistently across all 
programs and regions.
<P>
	When department of agriculture officials appeared before the 
committee they repeatedly made reference to the importance of a 
safe food supply for Canadians and the impact AMPS would have 
in ensuring that it was possible.
<P>
	While some of the violations will undoubtedly touch the issue of 
food safety, many of the other violations will be of a technical 
variety. For example, the printing on a label may be a centimetre 
too small or there may be problems importing a certain type of 
herbicide that has been used in the United States for a number of 
years without complications.
<P>
	One of the national industry agencies we consulted had 
reservations about the application of penalties due to technical 
violations of regulations such as the examples  listed above. There 
were concerns and these organizations felt their concerns had not 
been properly addressed by the minister.
<P>
	It would be good if the minister would clarify the situation and 
give us proof of recent communications with these organizations. 
He should give us some letters dated 1995, not 1992 or 1993.
<P>
	On March 23 and March 30, 1995 meetings of the committee 
raised some serious concerns for members on this side of the House 
as well as on the other side. At that time I was not part of the 
agriculture committee but I have had the opportunity to review the 
minutes from the proceedings in question. One of the main 
concerns raised by committee members was the issue of due 
diligence.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Under the original legislation as it appeared before the 
committee the clause in question, clause 18, read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person named in a notice of a violation does not have a defence by reason 
that the person</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) exercised due diligence to prevent the violation; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) reasonably and honestly believed in the existence of facts that, if true,would exonerate the person.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This clause explicitly left out due diligence as a defence for 
individuals served a notice of violation. This provoked questions 
delving into whether the system of AMP should operate on a strict 
liability regime or an absolute liability regime. Strict liability 
means it has to be proven someone committed the violation with 
intent. Absolute liability does not consider the intent with which 
the person committed the violation and therefore does not allow for 
defence under due diligence.
<P>
	Mr. Mazowita, director of legislation and compliance for 
Transport Canada, who appeared as a witness before the 
committee, commented on this question with respect to the 
aviation environment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the aviation environment we find it appropriate to provide for the defence 
of due diligence-there can be all kinds of circumstances in which a pilot or a 
commercial operator or manufacturer has done everything reasonable that a 
pilot or air carrier manufacturer could be expected to do, and in our program we 
don't believe it is necessary to punish individuals or companies who act in good 
faith in such a manner.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The question was then raised of why would a defence of due 
diligence be workable under the Aeronautics Act but not under the 
agriculture administrative penalty?
<P>
	This is not the first time concerns about due diligence were 
raised. In a memorandum dated February 16, 1995 from the general 
counsel to the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of 
Regulations, these concerns were outlined. Edgar H. Schmidt, in a 
memo quoted the following principle which was made by the 
Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Reference re Section 94(2) 
of the Motor Vehicle Act. It stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16088"> 16088 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has from time immemorial been part of our system of laws that the innocent 
not be punished. This principle has long been recognized as an essential element of 
a system for the administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in the 
dignity and worth of the human person and on the rule of law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In my view it is because absolute liability offends the principles of 
fundamental justice that this Court created presumptions against legislatures 
having intended to enact offences of a regulatory nature falling within that 
category.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Indeed, as I said, in penal law, absolute liability always offends the principles 
of fundamental justice irrespective of the nature of the offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Schmidt, in commenting further on the question of absolute 
liability, said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since the advent of the Charter, certain principles take precedence even over 
the enactment of the legislatures. With respect to offences of absolute liability, 
the Supreme Court of Canada has held that section 7 of the Charter-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, the security 
of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof, except in 
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-prohibits the creation of absolute liability offences that may be punished by 
imprisonment. In essence the Court held that while all absolute liability 
offences offend the principles of fundamental justice, only when such offences 
interfere with the right to life, liberty or security of the person do they offend 
section 7 of the Charter. Since the violations contemplated by Bill C-61 cannot 
result in imprisonment, it is not likely that they offend the particular interests 
protected by section 7. However, that does not change the fact that in making 
violations matters of absolute liability, the bill offends the principles of 
fundamental justice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clause 18(a) of Bill C-61 effectively places violations in that 
category which the Supreme Court of Canada characterized as 
absolute liability offences. It is worth noting that violations under 
the bill would for the most part be a contravention of the act or 
regulations that would also constitute either summary conviction 
offences or indictable offences.
<P>
	The effect of the bill is to permit the minister to transform any of 
the matters which are presently solely strict liability offences into 
matters which are also absolute liability violations by simply 
designating them under clause 4 of the bill. These are not my 
observations, but the observations of Mr. Schmidt who certainly 
knows what he is talking about.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The office of the minister of agriculture responded toMr. Schmidt's concerns by suggesting that an absolute liability 
standard was ``to ensure high standards of care for regulatees, in 
light of the risk that non-compliance may have on human health 
and safety''.
<P>
	The Reform Party is also in favour of ensuring high standards 
and protecting human health. If there are concerns that human 
health is at risk, I would classify  that as an offence. If an individual 
is to be charged with an offence, that person would have the option 
of using the defence of due diligence, a right that is not available to 
individuals served a notice of violation. If someone commits a very 
serious offence, there is the right of due diligence as a defence. If a 
lesser violation is committed under Bill C-61 there is no right of 
due diligence as a tool of defence.
<P>
	I should make it clear that not all violations under agriculture 
and agri-food acts can be classified even as a threat to human 
health and safety. The Liberals and the department of agriculture 
have repeatedly said that absolute liability is the only way this 
system can work properly. I am sure the government across the 
floor is saying that there are provisions within the legislation to 
take account of the intent of the individual served the notice of 
violation.
<P>
	In committee a week and a half ago we raised the point with 
regard to this issue. Both Mr. Phil Amudsen, director general of 
mid-west region food production and inspection branch and Mr. 
Reg Gatenby, chief, legislation, food production and inspection 
branch addressed the point rather haphazardly. I quote Mr. 
Amudsen:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the penalty matrix, intent is part of the evaluation of what the penalty will 
be-.So it is part of the penalty process, but it is not a defence for getting out of 
the whole violation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	For example, in the penalty matrix, intention falls under the 
gravity of misconduct and there are four levels of intention. The 
first level says: ``Unknowingly or inadvertently committed a 
violation or voluntarily disclosed and took steps to prevent 
reoccurrence''. There are zero points charged for this category.
<P>
	The second category is: ``Degree of negligence (assess degree of 
control in place of precautions, feasibility, knowledge of hazards, 
degree of expertise)''. For this type of violation three points are 
docked.
<P>
	The third category is: ``Intention unknown''. It is a violation 
resulting from negligence and is docked three points for that 
category.
<P>
	The fourth and final category is: ``Knowingly committed a 
violation'', for which five points are received.
<P>
	A penalty matrix including intent is not a defence under due 
diligence. For example, an individual who exercised due diligence, 
depending on the gravity of the misconduct, will pay slightly less 
than the individual who knowingly committed a violation. This is 
not a fair system. There should be some sort of recourse for 
individuals to take that exercise due diligence. I am in favour of 
coming down hard on those individuals that intentionally and 
knowingly committed a violation, but we should be more lenient 
with those individuals who have exercised due diligence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16089"> 16089 </A></B>
<P>
	I will give an example. Under the Pest Control Products Act 
it states that farmers are to compensate for drift when they spray 
herbicides or pesticides. Every farmer knows that when the wind 
comes up they have very little control over the spray. Wind 
velocities and directions change in a matter of seconds. Under this 
legislation farmers could be charged even if they exercised due 
diligence in spraying. Later I will discuss a motion that we put 
forward regarding due diligence at report stage.
<P>
	I also want to talk briefly about the time line of Bill C-61. When 
committee members reviewed the bill during the early part of this 
year, there were some serious concerns. I have only in the past few 
minutes addressed one of the many concerns that all parties had 
with the bill.
<P>
	After April 24, 1995 this bill went into hiding. Why did the 
legislation go into hiding for over half a year? Were the Liberals 
waiting for the smoke to blow over? The committee had some 
serious concerns with the legislation. They put forward a number of 
amendments in committee that were to be considered. Instead, 
when the committee resumed this fall with a number of new 
members on the committee, the amendments were from the 
department of agriculture. Although the department adopted a 
couple of what I would call token amendments, the major concerns 
were not addressed adequately, including an amendment dealing 
with due diligence.
<P>
	What is the purpose of the committees if any well thought out 
amendments are tossed to the side in favour of departmental 
amendments only?
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	The red book on page 22 states: ``In the House of Commons a 
Liberal government will give MPs a greater role in drafting 
legislation through House of Commons committees''. That is what 
it said but it is certainly not what it is doing.
<P>
	Last week when Bill C-61 was at report stage, the Liberals 
accepted three amendments from the Reform Party. We brought 
amendments forward at report stage simply because we knew there 
was no way these amendments would have passed through 
committee.
<P>
	It was quite funny to watch the clause by clause debate at 
committee a couple of weeks ago. A number of new members 
appeared at the committee. They were imported especially for 
clause by clause study. The meeting was set up for a Monday 
evening, which is very strange for clause by clause. Actually only a 
couple of committee members really knew what was in the bill. 
One of them, to his credit, was the member for Malpeque on Prince 
Edward Island and the other was the parliamentary secretary, the 
one who had given us the information that turned out to be 
incorrect.
<P>
	However, the rest of them were simply voting machines. In fact, 
the member for Dauphin-Swan River  had the list of amendments 
from the department of agriculture that it had approved and at the 
appropriate time she would insert a duly approved amendment 
from the department. It was obvious that any other amendments 
that would have been put forward would have been summarily 
dismissed without due consideration.
<P>
	That does not speak very well for the committee process in this 
House. It tells us the attitude of the Liberal government. It tells us 
that committee work for the most part is a baby-sitting service for 
Liberal backbenchers and not a place to deal with meaningful 
legislation.
<P>
	Although the amendments that were accepted at report stage 
provided some well-needed clarification to the legislation, the 
government failed to accept the amendments that would not only 
make the AMP system better but more palatable to the industry, 
producers and those responsible for enforcement.
<P>
	The Liberals, and in particular the member for 
Regina-Wascana, the minister of agriculture, patted themselves 
on the back suggesting they had exhibited a spirit of co-operation 
in accepting three Reform amendments. This government 
constructs the facade of democracy but inevitably disregards the 
constructive aspects of the consultative process.
<P>
	I would now like to address the amendments I put forward at 
report stage. As I just mentioned, the Liberal government is 
unwilling to consider amendments that would have had a 
substantive bearing on the implementation of the act. The 
amendments were an attempt to quantify and qualify the powers of 
the minister, the powers of the tribunal to which the violators can 
appeal and to clarify certain parts of the acts and the rights and 
responsibilities of both the violator and the minister in enforcing 
and administering the monetary penalties and forming compliance 
agreements.
<P>
	The first amendment that the Reform Party put forward at report 
stage under Motion No. 1 was to set out some guidelines with 
regard to the minister's powers. As it now stands, there is nothing 
in the legislation that determines the differences between violations 
which the AMP system addresses and an offence which the judicial 
system addresses.
<P>
	This amendment would have required the minister to put 
forward some criteria. In committee, witnesses from the 
department of agriculture suggested that an extremely serious 
violation would be considered an offence and prosecution would 
fall under the court or justice system, whereas a very serious 
offence would fall under the AMP system.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask is at what point does a violation 
cross the threshold and become an offence? There should be some 
sort of consistency across the  board. To arbitrarily determine on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16090"> 16090 </A></B>
<P>
the basis of each case whether the infraction is a violation or an 
offence is not fair and not reasonable.
<P>
	Individuals and companies should be given a clear indication 
what procedure the department is following in the implementation 
of the AMP program. It is a disappointment when members 
opposite disregard an amendment that would provide greater 
clarification.
<P>
	The way the act now reads the minister can use his power to 
prevent his friends from receiving the justice they deserve while 
throwing the book at political opponents. He can also go soft on 
violations in his own riding but be overly aggressive on alleged 
violations from an NDP or Reform riding. This can digress to the 
politics played at lower levels in the administration. There are no 
checks and balances, no criteria and no parameters to restrict this 
type of biased administration of the AMP program.
<P>
	The second amendment put forward by the Reform Party under 
Motion No. 3 set out to lower the fines by half for first time 
violations with subsequent violations being subject to the original 
fines set out in the legislation.
<P>
	While the hon. member for Malpeque suggested at report stage 
that the Reform Party, in dealing with the violations of law or 
quasi-law, wants to go all out and go for the jugular, I would beg to 
differ.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that some leniency should be shown 
to small business producers and processors for first time violations. 
Most of the violations that fall under the agriculture and agri-food 
act do not require that substantial fines be levied. Remember, we 
are not talking about serious indictable offences. We are talking 
about a small business, a producer or a processor. Given the 
economic situation they face today, they could easily be put out of 
business with the levels of fines proposed under the legislation.
<P>
	If the parties offend for the second time it is then that we throw 
the book at them. It is only reasonable that this amendment should 
have been given consideration.
<P>
	It is ironic that when we deal with violent offenders, serious 
criminals, the members on the Liberal side are so compassionate. 
They want to be so careful and protect the rights of those people, 
some of them vicious and malicious and repeat offenders. When it 
comes to small business, when it comes to people who make their 
living in agriculture or the processing industry, the Liberals want to 
be so strict. They want to come down with harsh monetary 
penalties, even on a first offence, and not even allow those people 
the right of due diligence in offering a defence.
<P>
	You wonder about the priorities of this government. Sometimes 
it just makes you sick.
<P>
	The third amendment we proposed at report stage, under Motion 
No. 4, was another one of common sense. It set out to identify the 
designated person serving notice of the violation. As I stated last 
Thursday, this is a common procedure that is useful, valuable, and 
will also protect the person who is alleged to have made the 
violation. I want to stress once again that this amendment was a 
common sense one and I thought the Liberals had enough common 
sense. Unfortunately, they did not even have that minute amount to 
accept the amendment we proposed.
<P>
	The fourth amendment we put forward, under Motion No. 5, was 
to improve the legislation by giving the person served the notice of 
violation at least 45 days to pay or ask for a review by the minister 
or the tribunal. The legislation outlines that the minister can 
prescribe any regulations in the act that require prescribing, in 
other words, a blank cheque. The minister can do whatever he 
wants.
<P>
	I believe that some of these regulations can be put within the act. 
The Liberal members keep repeating that including time frames in 
the legislation is impractical because it is very difficult to make 
future changes. The amendment put forth requires only a minimum 
time period to pay or ask for a review by the minister. The intent is 
to prevent the minister from arbitrarily and unreasonably setting 
the time period in which the individual served notice of violation 
has to pay.
<P>
	This and similar amendments are necessary parameters to allow 
for industry confidence in the AMP system.
<P>
	The minister under this act in two days can say either pay or ask 
for a review by the department or by the tribunal. Two days is 
unreasonable. There are no parameters. It is just a wide open field. 
It is hunting season year round in Bill C-61.
<P>
	The fifth amendment that we proposed was put forward under 
Motion No. 11, setting out to prevent the minister from taking 
security above and beyond the gravity of the violation. This 
amendment provides clarification as to what is reasonable security. 
It parallels the acceptance of the Reform amendment to clause 10 
which reads: ``include a provision for the giving of reasonable 
security''-and that was an amendment accepted by the 
minister-``in a form and in an amount satisfactory to the minister 
as a guarantee that the person will comply with the compliance 
agreement''.
<P>
	This amendment is an incentive for the individual to comply 
with the agreement while at the same time it prevents abuse of the 
system by the minister.
<P>
	I would also like to comment on the sixth amendment we 
proposed. This amendment would have required the review 
tribunal to complete the review within six months of receiving the 
person's request for a review. This would have prevented reviews 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16091"> 16091 </A></B>
<P>
from taking longer than six months to complete. For the sake of 
expediency of the review process we put forward this amendment.
<P>
	As I stated at report stage, cases could drag on for quite some 
time. This is certainly not fair to the accused, to the individual who 
is waiting for a review of his or her case. Most of all it is not fair to 
taxpayers to bear the cost of an ongoing review that could never 
end because there is no restriction as to how long it can continue.
<P>
	All individuals who are affected by this legislation want a 
system that is expedient and cost effective. It is in the best interests 
of this House to make legislation that way and it disappoints me 
when the government refuses to accept constructive amendments.
<P>
	The seventh amendment, proposed under Motion No. 19, was the 
most important amendment we put forward. This amendment 
sought to allow for the defence under due diligence and an 
individual should be exonerated if the person reasonably and 
honestly believed in the existence of fact that if true would 
exonerate the person.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	I talked about this earlier in my speech and it was raised in 
committee. If our amendment had been accepted by the 
government, the concerns raised in committee by the general 
counsel and by industry officials would have been put to bed. 
However, they are still out there. Excluding due diligence from this 
legislation makes the bill flawed and not supportable for me and 
my colleagues. This is one of the main reasons we cannot accept 
Bill C-61.
<P>
	The final amendment I will mention was Motion No. 23, which 
was proposed in the House at report stage. It deals with conflict of 
interest and appointments of the review tribunal. That amendment 
went one step further than the conflict of interest clause in 
stipulating that no government lobbyist or a person who has 
contracts with the federal government may be appointed to the 
tribunal.
<P>
	When the governing party was the official opposition, when the 
Liberals sat over on this side of the House, there was an outcry 
from Liberal members almost on a daily basis about the Tory 
appointments to boards and tribunals. Guess what? Now that the 
Liberals have moved from this side to that side of the House, the 
Tory status quo seems to be okay.
<P>
	We have been going through a time of crisis in our country with 
the threat of Quebec separation. It is time to start putting solutions 
on the table. One of the solutions to our problems, which is gaining 
some momentum and acceptance right across the country, is to 
move toward a more decentralized government.
<P>
	One of the ways this federal government could put its money 
where its mouth is would be by not becoming so involved in 
appointments of every position it could possibly control from 
within the privy council. This government has not chosen to do 
that. It has chosen to have a hands on approach to every 
appointment on every board and quasi-judicial whatever.
<P>
	That is offensive to Canadians right across the country. It has 
created incompetence. It could have a great negative impact upon 
the carrying out of administrative monetary penalties. It could have 
been corrected in this bill if strict conflict of interest guidelines had 
been placed in it. However, the Liberals chose the status quo. They 
chose to have their hand in the bag handing out the goodies to their 
friends. They wanted that option. They refused to shut the door on 
patronage and on being directly involved with patronage 
appointments.
<P>
	We want this legislation to be clear and concise with regard to 
appointment practices. Convoluted legislation opens the door to 
abuses and downright confusion, as with the Income Tax Act. The 
Income Tax Act has become so complicated it has become a 
vehicle for loopholes, abuse, and tax avoidance. The more 
government tinkers with it, the worse it seems to get.
<P>
	That is why the member for Calgary Centre, the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound, and other of my colleagues are pushing 
this country to accept the flat tax. They are talking with Canadians 
from coast to coast about tax reform that will take away the 
confusion, take away the complexity, and reduce the cost and the 
bureaucratic red tape. That is the way the department of agriculture 
should be moving as well.
<P>
	If we could clean out some of the garbage in the bureaucracy and 
clean out the hands on approach to appointments, we would 
simplify the administration of monetary penalties, just as we would 
clean up the Income Tax Act if we implemented the flat tax.
<P>
	The last two amendments I would like to speak about come from 
the less than loyal official opposition. It may seem strange, but it is 
true that we supported amendments put forward by the hon. 
member for Lotbinière. We were considering the same 
amendments, but the hon. member was able to table his 
amendments prior to ours.
<P>
	One amendment requires that any governor in council 
appointment to the review tribunal be approved by the agriculture 
committee. The Reform Party fully supports this type of process. In 
fact the Liberal government supported it as well. The government 
supported it on paper. The Liberals supported it before the election. 
On page 92 of ``Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for 
Canada'' it was stated: ``We will establish mechanisms to permit 
parliamentary review of some senior order in council 
appointments''.
<P>
	Where are they? Where are those reviews? Where are the 
parliamentary committees involved in reviewing these 
appointments? We were told that the minister and the privy council 
had appointed somebody to be the chair of the CBC. It never came 
before the House of Commons. We turned on the news and found 
out that Perrin Beatty,  former Tory MP, former member of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16092"> 16092 </A></B>
<P>
previous government that helped run up a debt of some $500 
billion, was the president of the CBC. There was no input from us.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	This piece of legislation allows for the formation of a tribunal, 
with no input from parliamentarians. We are sidelined. We are 
spectators. We are not participants in pulling the levers of 
government. We are just supposed to sit back and watch the action. 
If you are on the government side you have to politely applaud. If 
you are on the opposition side, the Liberal strategy is to ignore you 
and barge on and hope they can buy the next election. Of course we 
know the dollars are gone and they cannot buy things any more. 
The chickens will come home to roost, just as they did for the 
Tories.
<P>
	The Liberals are going to have big problems ahead justifying all 
these order in council appointments with no review whatsoever 
outside of the privy council, outside of the ministers and their 
deputy ministers.
<P>
	I would like to ask the members opposite if anything has been 
accomplished lately with respect to parliamentary reviews of 
appointments. I would suggest that having the agriculture 
committee approve any appointments to the review tribunal would 
have been an excellent starting point.
<P>
	I want to conclude by making one last point. The intent of the 
AMP program was not only to ensure compliance but to have a 
program that was consistent with those of the United States. It does 
not do much good if there is a harmonized AMP program with the 
U.S. while having two countries that lack harmonization or 
equivalency in requirements.
<P>
	It is time for this government to pursue harmonization standards 
with countries it trades with. A number of farmers and biotech 
companies are expressing discontent with this government for 
disallowing or slowing the registration process for certain seed 
varieties or for certain herbicides.
<P>
	One biotech company came to me and suggested that it was 
thinking of pulling out of Canada and taking the jobs it provided in 
Canada back to the United States if there were no changes 
forthcoming in the current process.
<P>
	Millions upon millions of dollars are at stake here, not to 
mention the employment opportunities. If Canada is not willing to 
co-operate, companies will set up shop where the environment is 
more friendly.
<P>
	The department of agriculture should have good reason when it 
refuses to authorize the use of a product or harmonize regulations 
with any of our major trading partners. At the present time it is 
extremely slow. It is bogged down and does not seem to come up 
with the goods very often.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I already stated, incorporating the amendments 
put forward by the Reform Party in this piece of legislation would 
have made the bill better for all stakeholders. The Reform Party 
believes that an AMP system could be an effective way to increase 
compliance and be a much fairer way of addressing 
non-compliance than through the prosecution route. However, 
without the changes the Reform Party proposed we cannot support 
this legislation.
<P>
	We are being heckled on the other side.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No, no, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> They are saying: ``No, no, no. We do not want 
your reasonable approach; we do not want to be accountable''. 
They are saying they just want to be left alone to go on their merry 
way and try to keep as much information from the public as 
possible.
<P>
	I want to assure this House that we on this side will not let that 
happen. That is why we are exposing the flaws of Bill C-61. That is 
why we cannot support Bill C-61. It is time to start building a 
country that is ready to operate in the 21st century. This bill could 
have helped us do that, but it did not finish the job. I would ask that 
in future when members opposite start drafting legislation that they 
think a little more clearly than they did when they drew up Bill 
C-61.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was not going to rise on debate until I heard the hon. 
member from the Reform Party talk about Bill C-61 and try to 
suggest that somehow colleagues on this side of the House, because 
they are governing members, decided to finally pass this legislation 
after almost a year.
<P>
	I know the hon. member came onto the standing committee on 
agriculture a little late. I still do not remember his taking part in 
any of the committee meetings dealing with Bill C-61, even though 
he was on that committee. The hon. member should know-and if 
he does not know he could talk to his colleagues who would tell 
him-that when the bill came in it was thoroughly debated by the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. Committee 
members from the government side were the ones who put forward 
problems they had with the bill. The bill is a good example of how 
the committee system around this place has worked. It goes to 
show how government backbench members on a committee can 
have some sort of say and input into the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	When the bill came forward to the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food government members on the committee 
had many concerns. We had concerns with the bill and we informed 
the minister of those concerns. We outlined to the minister a 
number of different amendments that we wanted to the bill before 
we were prepared to proceed with it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16093"> 16093 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister, in his wisdom, took that back to his departmental 
officials. If we go through Bill C-61 we see a number of 
amendments proposed by government members, not opposition 
members who chose not to show up for most of the meetings. 
Subclause 4(d) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>respecting the circumstances under which, the criteria by which and the 
manner in which a penalty may be increased or reduced, including the 
reduction of a penalty pursuant to a compliance agreement-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was not in there before. Government members felt it was 
important enough to put in there. Subclause 4(3) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Without restricting the generality of the paragraph-in making regulations-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again it talks about the degree of intention or negligence on the 
part of the person. That was put in there by government members 
on that committee.
<P>
	Clause 7 deals with the issuance of a notice of violation and 
states that there have to be reasonable grounds to believe. That was 
not in there before. Government backbenchers felt it was 
important. We went through the legislation for months and months 
and months, and the Reform Party was not there to help us.
<P>
	The hon. member also has the audacity to say that the 
government would not even look at reasonable amendments. The 
Reform Party's Motion No. 20 to clarify the burden of proof is the 
hon. member's amendment. Motion No. 28 to clarify expenses is 
the hon. member's amendment. Motion No. 10 is to provide 
assurance that a security requested by the minister in respect of 
compliance be reasonable. He uses the word reasonable, but the 
government accepted opposition amendments on this point. We 
have gone a long way in trying to allay the fears of members on the 
other side that we were not listening to their concerns on the issue.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about orders in council and Standing 
Order 110 which he should read. It states that committees have a 
right to review orders in council. It is a very important right for 
individual members of Parliament who can review orders in 
council. All of us in our role of checking the executive should have 
the power to review. The hon. member knows that.
<P>
	In terms of the legislation I had concerns, as I said. However I 
sat down as a chairman of a committee with the minister and with 
the department. They went further than I expected them to go in 
terms of putting forward proposals to alleviate some of my 
concerns and the concerns of members on the committee and 
members outside the committee in terms of the House committee 
on procedure.
<P>
	We sat down with government officials at a number of different 
meetings and came forward with amendments that we thought were 
reasonable. I thank the minister of agriculture for accepting the 
amendments. It goes to  show how well this place can work when 
all hon. members work together.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is always interesting to hear the Liberals get excited and 
give us some recognition.
<P>
	As I pointed out a number of months ago, I used to have a red 
combine. It was the colour of the Liberal Party and it always 
seemed to give me grief. That seems to be the way the Liberal 
government is going with its bills. It seems as if its red combine has 
run out of cash and it has found another bill to get some extra cash. 
The combine might be beyond repair so I do not know how the cash 
will do it by itself. The Liberals do not have much to trade off. I do 
not think the money raised through the bill will buy them another 
election.
<P>
	It seems queer to me. I have been trying to get the Liberal 
government to put some teeth into some of the investigative powers 
of the grain commission and the wheat board. When farmers 
complained that somehow one of the organizations had dumped 1.5 
million bushels into the U.S. at half price, that there was an 
anti-dumping violation, it seemed strange the minister of 
agriculture would not even respond. That is Liberal justice.
<P>
	The bill worries me. The Liberals want to increase fines from 
roughly $1,000 to $250,000. As far as I am concerned that is 
designed for big multinationals or some of the bigger corporations 
because they can negotiate and persuade the government to say that 
they will draw a lot of votes in the next election and it better go 
easy on them or it could backfire. That is not the type of justice we 
need.
<P>
	It is important to start realizing that small players need some 
protection. Due diligence is not included. There is no recourse but 
to pay the fine or negotiate. If people have any money left over they 
might be able to go the courts, but that is usually not the way small 
players work.
<P>
	It is interesting to note the bill is designed so that the minister 
has the power over eight acts and not just one. I remind the House 
that when I started the investigation into the irregularities and 
illegalities of some of the acts the first thing I looked at was the 
smuggling of Grandin wheat into Canada. Snowflake is well known 
for that trade. If it does not happen to be wheat, it can be done with 
alcohol or cigarettes and it seems to be very successful.
<P>
	When I insisted that an investigation be done on the smuggling 
of Grandin wheat, it was interesting to see that customs officers 
were willing to testify, willing to come before the courts. However 
for some reason the agriculture department claimed no wrong was 
being done. Suddenly I hear the government is very interested in 
protecting the quality of wheat and the quality of our meat through 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16094"> 16094 </A></B>
<P>
monetary funds. The court system could  not prevail because it was 
told simply, more or less, to take a side glance and not prosecute.
<P>
	I will read a statement I received through an information officer 
on the issue:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1993 when the issue became public through an article in the newspaper, at 
the same time agriculture made a statement that Canada Customs erred in not 
stopping the wheat from entering Canada. As a result, Canada Customs no 
longer allows the importation of wheat into Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There was proof that it was smuggled and the government 
allowed Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada to avoid the law.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	How will the AMPS fix that problem? All it will do is put more 
money into a cash strapped Liberal government when its red 
combine is dilapidated and ready to fall apart. The Liberals are 
trying to get more funds to buy another election. I do not think it 
will work. To do that they should probably make it legal to smuggle 
liquor too, because there is more money in that than there is in 
Grandin wheat. Why avoid the small funds? They should go for the 
big cash because they will need a good combine to win the next 
election. I do not think it will be done with the faded old red 
machine I saw in the last election.
<P>
	The big problem with the AMPS is that it will not deter any of 
the violations or minor infractions. The big players will use Bill 
C-61. They do not really care about the money they pay because 
they usually make more by violating or trespassing the law.
<P>
	When the last <I>Farm and Country</I> paper came into my office I 
was very interested in watching what was going on as far as 
chemical harmonization with the United States was concerned. It is 
amazing that $10 million worth of chemicals are being smuggled 
illegally into Canada to be used by farmers. What did the Liberals 
do about it? The parliamentary secretary said that they just did not 
have the manpower to stop it. If they do not have the manpower to 
stop this type of violation, how do they think the AMPS will stop 
it?
<P>
	They tried to stop the smuggling of cigarettes by opening the 
borders 24 hours a day. The customs officers were there lighting 
candles and making sure the roads were clear. I have news for 
them. At least in the Snowflake area these violators do not usually 
use customs offices. They usually find a little road through the 
bush. That is where they seem to do their best business. How will 
the AMPS provide protection against those fellows? I do not know 
how we will enforce it.
<P>
	When we have a bill like this one which tries more or less to 
make monetary funds do the trick instead of the justice system, 
usually it backfires. That is why I am leery of the bill. It will take 
some pressure off the courts, but it will probably increase the 
violations and the violators  who are able to afford it will become 
richer instead of poorer.
<P>
	I will not continue too long on the subject. My colleague from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster touched on pretty well everything. We 
need a justice system that is equal for all, a justice system that 
imposes a certain fine for a certain violation or infraction.
<P>
	The Bloc member pointed out very vividly that there is a set 
price for a speeding ticket for going 20 miles an hour over the limit. 
That is the way the program should work. There should be some 
guidelines that stipulate the fines to be paid by violators and they 
should be enforced.
<P>
	Maybe someday there will be a different combine. Maybe when 
we get green machinery on the other side we will also have 
violations and infractions decrease because we will have a system 
of legal authority that will look after violators and transgressors in 
a fair and equitable way and the little guy will be protected the 
same way as the others.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I appreciate these few minutes and I hope that 
some of the amendments that Reform has proposed will be 
supported.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is too late.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> It is too late for amendments now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> He has been doing some good field work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> It is too late for that. I was under the impression 
that we should do a little bit of ploughing before we start harvesting 
because the crop would be better.
<P>
	The Liberals do not realize that we have to put in a crop before 
we can harvest it. They like to pluck the plums from the tree after 
they are ripe. We will continue to allow them to do that and hope 
that maybe in the next election we can change things around.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGREEMENTONINTERNALTRADEIMPLEMENTATIONACT">AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed, from June 19, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-88, an act to implement the Agreement on 
Internal Trade, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-88 
deals with internal trade in Canada. The bill frequently refers to the 
Agreement on Internal Trade, which includes several hundreds, and 
even thousands of articles. Since Bill C-88 expressly refers to the 
agreement, it makes sense to give an overview of the bill and of the 
agreement itself.
<P>
	The agreement includes six major parts: a general section on the 
major application principles; a section reaffirming constitutional 
rights; a section dealing with the definition of rules and general 
obligations; a section on the specific rules for the eleven sectors 
affected by the agreement; a section dealing with dispute 
settlement procedures; and, lastly, a section on exceptions.
<P>
	The agreement is based on three general principles. The first one 
provides for similar treatment of persons, goods and services, 
regardless of their origin in Canada. The second principle concerns 
the harmonization of standards and regulations, so as to eliminate 
certain practices which could impede internal trade in our country. 
The third general principle provides that we must ensure the free 
movement of persons, goods and capital.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The articles of the agreement to which Bill C-88 refers are 
essentially those relating to the dispute settlement process. Articles 
1601, 1602, 1603 and 1604 deal with the establishment, mandate 
and membership of the Committee on internal trade and its 
secretariat. The committee must, among other things, supervise the 
implementation of the agreement and facilitate the settlement of 
disputes.
<P>
	Article 1705 is of particular interest. It concerns the appointment 
of a panel when disputes arise. The parties to a dispute may, after a 
period of mediation and conciliation, ask that a panel be 
established. This five-member panel must rule on the validity of 
the dispute and on the retaliation measures the aggrieved party is 
entitled to take. This article defines the phrase ``one of the parties''. 
According to the agreement, ``a party'' is a province or territory, or 
the federal government itself. The parties may act on behalf of 
natural or artificial persons, provided there is a direct and 
substantial link with them.
<P>
	In the case of the provinces, it is said that a link exists with a 
person if this person resides in the province and if the losses 
suffered have economic consequences for the province. In the case 
of the federal government, a link is supposed to exist with a person 
if this person is federally incorporated or if it does business in an 
area of activity under federal jurisdiction. In this regard, we feel 
that the bill is very, even excessively, generous because, as we 
know, the federal government has a tendency to get involved in all 
areas of activity, and even to encroach on areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Since, in this case, the federal government may be regarded as 
one of the parties and may even represent a person doing business 
in an area of activity under federal jurisdiction, we must proceed 
with caution. Otherwise, the federal government could become 
involved in all spheres of society, according to the proposed 
definition of its own role.
<P>
	It must be clearly understood that the decisions of the special 
group are not binding, of course, but it does determine whether the 
measures in dispute are indeed contrary to the wording of the 
agreement and if they have caused prejudice.
<P>
	In addition, the Committee must make recommendations to 
facilitate settlement of the dispute. And if the party concerned by 
the complaint does not comply with the recommendations of the 
special group, then Article 1710 applies, which sets out the 
sanctions which may be imposed upon the party affected by the 
complaint.
<P>
	But the true scope of the bill is as follows: the primary objective 
of the bill is to implement the Agreement on Internal Trade. The 
Bloc has always been in favour of the liberalization of trade. The 
proof of this is that the Bloc and all other Quebec politicians, in 
particular the members of the Parti Québécois, had defended 
NAFTA. However, even if we agree in principle and support the 
principle behind this bill, we cannot accept the wording of clause 9 
which permits a far broader interpretation, which might allow the 
government in Ottawa to intervene and impose retaliatory 
measures even when not a party to the dispute.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="16096"> 16096 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The federal government could interfere because it is said that 
each time a third party has some connection with the federal 
government or with an activity under federal jurisdiction-and as I 
was just saying, we are familiar with the federal propensity to horn 
in in all areas-then the federal level could be all-pervasive. This 
clause is far too broad for us to support.
<P>
	According to the terms of the agreement, still in reference to this 
clause, the federal government shall equip itself with the 
possibility of imposing retaliatory measures where it might be the 
injured party. The wording of clause 9 of the bill, however, leads us 
to voice two serious objections.
<P>
	The first is to the text, which reads in the first sentence of clause 
9 as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of suspending benefits, or imposing retaliatory measures of 
equivalent effect against a province pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement, 
the Governor in Council may, by order, do any one or more of the following-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So here clause 9 of the bill allows the Governor in Council to 
``suspend rights and privileges granted to the province, modify or 
suspend the application of any federal law with respect to the 
province, extend the application of any federal law to the province 
or take any other measure that the Governor in Council considers 
necessary''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member, who will have 11 minutes remaining when we 
resume debate on this bill.
<P>
	It now being 6.13 p.m., the House will proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed in today's 
Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERVENORFUNDINGACT">INTERVENOR FUNDING ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-339, an act 
to provide for funding for intervenors in hearings before certain 
boards and agencies, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am honoured to stand here today and 
speak in support of my private member's bill, C-339, an act to 
provide for funding for intervenors in hearings before certain 
boards and agencies.
<P>
	Intervenor funding, also known as participant funding in the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, seeks to fund those that 
speak in the public interest at hearings held before government 
agencies or appointed boards.
<P>
	As politicians we often wax eloquent about the need to consult 
our constituents. We encourage citizens to stand up and be counted 
to make sure their voices are heard. I  ask this House as I have 
asked myself: What have we done to make sure Canadians are 
heard by their legislators and by those who govern them?
<P>
	As the Minister of the Environment said during debate on the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, it is one thing to say that 
people have a say, it is another thing to give them the tools to 
exercise their right. I believe the bill before us today will give the 
average citizen, regardless of his or her financial assets, the tools 
needed for them to be heard in the decision-making process.
<P>
	Intervenor funding has been known to me for years because of 
my interest in conservation and he environment. However, it 
became particularly relevant after a number of my constituents 
who are members of the Ontario Pipeline Landowners Association, 
the OPLA, told me of their difficulties in wanting to appear before 
the National Energy Board.
<P>
	These landowners were faced with the prospect of having to 
raise a large amount of money in order to hire experts to oppose a 
change in the lease agreement of the pipeline crossing their land. 
Faced with evidence that the pipeline could contaminate the soil, 
could pose a safety risk, and could saddle them with clean-up costs 
if the line were ever abandoned, they wanted to make sure the NEB 
heard their concerns.
<P>
	To make a convincing case, the landowners needed the 
assistance of lawyers and experts to appear as witnesses on their 
behalf before the National Energy Board. Such qualified 
professionals must be paid. The executives of the OPLA appeared 
on their own time, but they had to mortgage their future returns to 
pay the lawyers and engineers who appeared on their behalf and on 
behalf of the other signatories to the leases.
<P>
	What would have happened if they were not able to raise the 
money to make an adequate representation? The National Energy 
Board would have had to make a decision without the input of those 
who faced the most risk, in this case the landowners.
<P>
	It is my contention that the Ontario Pipeline Landowners 
Association was speaking out in the public interest. If the pipeline 
posed an environmental or health risk it would be to the public as a 
whole, and they would be the ones who suffered.
<P>
	In a recent article sent to me by Mr. Stuart O'Neil, president of 
the OPLA, a pipeline explosion is documented in the rural 
community near Williamstown, Ontario. Is it not in the public 
interest for these concerns to be heard by the National Energy 
Board?
<P>
	As can be seen by looking at the National Energy Board's 
finding in this case, the Ontario Pipeline Landowners Association 
presented valid concerns. I have that finding here, and I would seek 
unanimous consent to table this document during the hours of this 
debate.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent to table the document?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Intervenor funding will assure the public that those 
with a valid interest will be heard at future hearings. For many 
years the public has been saying that they want to have an input in 
government decision making. Intervenor funding guarantees their 
access.
<P>
	I am not introducing a new concept to this Parliament. 
Intervenor funding was granted to environmental and native groups 
and municipal councils during the Mackenzie River pipeline 
inquiry, also know as the Berger commission, in the mid-1970s. 
Mr. Justice Thomas Berger determined that funding would be 
necessary to ensure that the many diverse interests would be 
represented at the hearings.
<P>
	Justice Berger said in announcing the funding: ``These groups 
are sometimes called public interest groups. They represent 
identifiable interests that should not be ignored. Indeed, it is 
essential that they should be considered. They do not represent the 
public interest, but it is in the public interest that they should be 
heard''.
<P>
	The Ontario government proclaimed the intervenor funding 
project act in 1989 as a three-year pilot project. This program has 
been extended through to the spring of 1996. In introducing this 
legislation to the Ontario legislature the then attorney general Ian 
Scott, who had served as counsel on the Berger commission, stated 
that a regularized system for intervenor funding is an essential 
component of an accessible justice system. My Bill C-339 is 
modelled after the Ontario act.
<P>
	It is interesting that members of the Ontario Pipeline 
Landowners Association, who have discussed their situation with 
landowners who had appeared before the Ontario energy board, 
found that process to be fairer and more inclusive for both the 
landowner and the proponent. The success of this act in Ontario 
augurs well for the success of this legislation I am introducing 
today.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Further to experience with the Berger commission and the 
Ontario legislation, the federal government has had experience 
with intervenor funding through the CRTC and the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, as well as the Krever inquiry into 
Canada's blood supply, which is currently funding a number of 
intervenors.
<P>
	The federal Liberal Party made a very clear commitment in the 
red book to provide for intervenor funding within the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act. This commitment was honoured 
when Bill C-56 was passed last December. At that time the 
Minister of the Environment and Deputy Prime Minister, the 
Reform member for Comox-Alberni, and the New Democratic 
member for the Battlefords-Meadow Lake spoke in  favour of this 
type of funding. Today I seek the same consensus of all colleagues 
in this House to move this legislation forward so that it can be put 
before the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for further 
study.
<P>
	I would like to share with the House a statement made by the 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake during the debate on 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act: ``Without adequate 
intervenor funding there cannot be adequate assessment, quite 
simply because those who wish to challenge the proponent do not 
have the same access to capital as the proponent does''. In effect, 
what the hon. member is saying is that we have to level the playing 
field so that both the proponent and the intervenor have the same 
ability to put forward evidence that will allow the best decision to 
be made.
<P>
	In 1992 the province of Ontario conducted a review of the 
intervenor funding project act. This review, entitled ``Access and 
Impact: An Evaluation of the Intervenor Funding Project Act, 
1988'', states this on the need for intervenor funding: 
``Participation is necessary for reasons of fairness. It also makes 
for better decisions, as broader information, values, and opinions 
are canvassed by those required to make decisions in the public 
interest. But those purposes cannot be achieved if the resources of 
participants are severely limited in relation to the case they are 
required to meet''.
<P>
	There are those who feel that people who would like to intervene 
before federal boards and agencies should raise the funds 
themselves in order to make a representation. Some feel that even 
if the intervenor is clearly representing the public interest, they 
should pay all costs. Are we then to tell our constituents that only 
the wealthy have a right to be heard? We cannot tell Canadians to 
mortgage their homes and their futures in order to make a 
representation in the public interest.
<P>
	Am I to say with a straight face that governments make the best 
decisions after hearing only from those wealthy enough to afford 
the best lawyers and technical experts? As the member of 
Parliament for all the people of Oxford, it is my duty to ensure that 
they have an opportunity to influence government decision 
making. This bill not only provides that opportunity, but also will 
result in better decisions being made.
<P>
	At this point I would like to discuss a number of key sections of 
this bill. Clause 2 says that the purpose of the act is to require any 
person proposing a project that would affect the public interest or 
the environment and that is required by law to be reviewed by a 
public process before being approved by government or an agency 
of government to provide funding to assist organizations that 
represent a relevant public interest and that wish to intervene in the 
review process to represent that interest.
<P>
	I have been asked why the proponent should fund the intervenor. 
The Ontario government review, ``Access  and Impact'', states that 
more effective monitoring of the costs and benefits of the process 
will be achieved if those who are the focus of these decisions, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16098"> 16098 </A></B>
<P>
proponents, are made to bear the cost. It is they who are the 
centrepiece of the regulated activity.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	It should be noted that paragraph 4(3)(f) in my bill calls upon a 
funding panel to consider any representation the funding 
proponents make concerning the application of an intervenor. This 
paragraph allows the proponent to make a presentation about the 
public interest the intervenor purports to represent and about the 
proponent's own ability to fund the intervention.
<P>
	In drafting the funding criteria for intervenors, I have used the 
criteria set out in the Ontario legislation. The Ontario legislation 
was in turn developed using the criteria set forth by Justice Berger, 
which has been the model for intervenor funding at both the federal 
and provincial government levels.
<P>
	The member for Comox-Alberni stated during third reading 
debate on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act: 
``Guidelines for participation should consider whether the 
applicant represents a clearly ascertainable interest that should be 
heard at the hearing and whether separate representation of the 
interest would assist the panel and contribute to the hearing''. I 
believe that the funding criteria within Bill C-339 clearly live up to 
the standards my hon. colleague set out during the CEAA debate.
<P>
	Subclause 4(4) of the bill states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A funding panel shall not order funding to be provided to an intervenor 
unless it is satisfied that the issues the intervenor intends to present are entirely 
or mainly issues respecting public interests rather than private interests and that</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the intervenor represents a clearly ascertainable interest that is relevant to 
the issue before the review authority and that should be represented at the 
hearing;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the intervenor does not have sufficient financial resources to make the 
representation without funding;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) the intervenor has made reasonable efforts to obtain funding from other 
sources;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) the intervenor has an established record of concern for and commitment to 
the interest;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(e) the intervenor has made reasonable efforts to cooperate with other 
intervenors that represent similar interests;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(f) the absence of funding would adversely affect the representation of the 
interest; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(g) the intervenor has a proposal that specifies the use to which funding would 
be put, has the ability to record the expenditure of the funding, and has agreed to 
submit an accounting to the panel for the expenditure and allow the panel to 
examine its records to verify the accounting.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It should be stated that paragraph 4(5)(b) of the bill allows the 
project proponent to appeal a funding order to the review authority.
<P>
	I strongly believe that the bill will improve the way government 
works and makes decisions. The Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources may feel that some amendments are in order. I and other 
witnesses who may be called would be happy to work with the 
committee to improve and then pass this important piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me say that it is time to tell the people of 
Canada at this important time in our history that they can have a 
say and that this federal government believes that their 
interventions will improve the quality of decisions that must be 
made.
<P>
	I ask all members of the House to support the bill and thus give 
all Canadians a means by which to participate responsibly in our 
future.
<P>
	It was some 18 months ago that I stood at the last seat of the 
fourth row, the farthest I could get from the Chair, to give my 
maiden speech as a backbencher and as a member of the class of 
'93. One thing that concerned me the most when I came to Ottawa 
and to Parliament was how does the backbencher, the individual 
member of whatever party, influence government policy? How do 
we have some effect? How do we go back to our constituents and 
say we did this or we did that or we were able to modify, mediate, 
change, suggest something that became law because you told me 
that was what you wanted. I do not pretend to know all the answers. 
I do suggest and I do feel very proud to be able to present this bill 
today because it is one way in which the individual MP can 
influence government decision making.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I suggest to all hon. members that committee work is another 
way. I appreciate that work. It allows me to work with and learn 
from my colleagues on all sides of the House on important issues.
<P>
	Bill C-339 is a votable item and I look forward to further debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, I would 
first like to say that I am pleased to participate in this second 
reading debate on Bill C-339 proposed by the hon. member for 
Oxford. I must congratulate him for his goodwill, for trying to 
enhance democracy here in Canada, so that some groups can give 
their opinion on environmental matters concerning natural 
resources.
<P>
	This Bill C-339 is quite simple. It has virtually only two pages, if 
we take out the ones containing the terminology and the definitions 
used in the bill. It establishes the principle that the proponent of a 
project that requires review and approval under federal legislation, 
for example, Bill C-56, the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act, and that affects the public interest or the environment, should 
fund intervenors in public hearings on that project.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16099"> 16099 </A></B>
<P>
	On the face of it, we could be in favour of the principle of 
funding groups who want to participate in public hearings, because 
often, groups that represent less advantaged people in our society 
do not have sufficient financial resources to pay for scientific 
studies, transportation, research studies or efforts needed to prove 
their good faith. I am thinking here of studies needed, for example, 
in my region, Abitibi, or in Northern Canada or the Arctic circle, 
where intervenors certainly do not have sufficient financial 
resources to pay for their travel and their stay when defending the 
interests of people they represent.
<P>
	We have seen in the past citizens who were penalized in their 
rights because, unlike large businesses or developers, they did not 
have the financial resources to defend their view on a project. So 
we are in favour of the principle that proponents pay for 
administrative costs related to the reviews.
<P>
	But after examining this bill more thoroughly, we realize that it 
has a much greater scope than it purports. There are a number of 
questions. First of all, whether this bill was drafted to complete the 
program that already exists at the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Agency created under Bill C-56, an act to amend the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	It is clear that the government, by using the procedure suggested 
in Bill C-339, can save on the funding it now has to provide to 
groups that are interested in taking part in public environmental 
hearings. If that is the case, why not simply amend the legislation 
instead of drafting a whole new bill? It is difficult to determine 
which agencies will benefit under this program and how 
proponents will react. And besides, this bill would institutionalize 
duplication, because provincial governments often already have 
their own structures for evaluating the projects of proponents.
<P>
	So why add to the duplication in procedures for analysing the 
impact of natural resource development on the environment? This 
bill would create one more commission that would propose further 
administrative constraints, in addition to the far too numerous 
existing ones which the industry has criticized as jeopardizing 
project development and hence employment.
<P>
	For instance, on October 18, when the mining industry, through 
its national organization, held its open house, one of its principal 
demands was that the government streamline the many unwieldy 
administrative structures restricting the development of this 
industry.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-339 would merely create one more administrative level 
instead of making intervenor funding the responsibility of a 
decision making level that already exists.
<P>
	If we look at the two pages in the bill that provide a list of 
definitions, it is not quite clear what is meant by  the term ``public 
interest''. In fact, a large number of frivolous interventions could 
be made claiming a ``public interest'', which would cause delay 
and add to the cost to the proponent of studies or the actual project.
<P>
	The bill would also assist intervenors with a record of 
responsible representation of a facet of the public interest to put 
their arguments respecting the project before the approving 
authority. In this situation, doubt could be cast on the objectivity of 
the funding panel, which determines the groups to be funded by the 
proponent.
<P>
	Clearly, in no case, should the fact of forcing the proponent to 
provide financial assistance threaten the feasibility of a project. 
However, it could happen that the proponent is the government 
itself. This is the case with the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	Thus the SVP group opposed to refloating the <I>Irving Whale</I>, as 
proposed by the government, receives no assurance from this bill 
of being considered an organization the federal government does 
not want to recognize as an intervenor with a record of responsible 
representation, because the panel is appointed by the government 
itself.
<P>
	A question arises: Who benefits from representing these public 
interest organizations? There is cause for concern that some may 
find personal interest in the process and will not hesitate to 
specialize in defending public interest organizations.
<P>
	The question could arise, for example, during a study on the 
opening of a new mine, if the representative of a local group, with 
no expertise, but wishing to protect the environment, and having an 
opportunity to develop their region through new jobs, ran up 
against a group like Greenpeace, which could defeat the local 
group through its expertise and international reputation.
<P>
	In clause (7)(<I>b</I>), contrary to what the bill proposes, funding 
should not be available to cover lawyers' services. The aim of 
public hearings is to help the government make a public and not a 
legal decision.
<P>
	It has generally been observed that, when lawyers represent 
certain groups, the other witnesses are intimidated and refuse to 
express their viewpoint. The hearings then take on legal overtones. 
This opinion is what officials who are used to this sort of hearing 
have to say.
<P>
	In clauses 3 and 4, the funding panel should also ensure that 
studies witnesses want funded have not already been undertaken. 
For example, the panels set up by the federal environmental 
assessment review office, if we refer to Bill C-56, which has this 
instrument already, have many scientific studies done, in addition 
to having witnesses testify at public hearings.
<P>
	The witnesses must not be funded for doing the same studies as 
the panel. Bill C-339 contains no provision for such an eventuality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16100"> 16100 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, we feel this bill has good ideas and that it is 
innovative, but it also contains a number of serious failings.
<P>
	It should therefore be amended before submission to the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources so that its objective of 
enabling groups of intervenors to defend their point of view with 
funding may be possible.
<P>
	Furthermore, given how open Bill C-339 is in its present form to 
encroachment on provincial jurisdictions, such as natural resources 
and the environment, we must vote against it in its present form.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Finlay:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. During my speech 
I asked for unanimous consent to table the document of the hearing 
held at London, Ontario, on Monday, January 10, 1994, in the 
matter of applications by Intercoastal Pipe Line Incorporated and 
Interprovincial Pipe Line Incorporated, pursuant to sections 52 and 
58 of the National Energy Board Act.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I seek your advice. I thought that received 
unanimous consent. Perhaps it did not. I am asking again.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent to table the report?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You have unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today the member has brought forward Bill C-339 dealing with 
intervenor funding.
<P>
	In this country we have established independent quasi-judicial 
panels and agencies to make decisions about land use. This bill 
deals with intervenor funding in that land use process. For instance, 
if a large oil company wants to work on a pipeline that runs through 
miles and miles of farmland, the company must first make an 
application to the National Energy Board. The board will consider 
the effects of the pipeline on other people and on the environment 
before allowing the company to do the work.
<P>
	This bill attempts to deal with a problem that occurs when a 
project has the capacity to hurt people or their assets. A large 
company can afford to hire all sorts of lawyers to make its case and 
minimize the effects of its agenda so the full truth may not come 
out at the hearings. The board members may make a decision based 
on incomplete information at the board hearings which is certainly 
detrimental to the public interest.
<P>
	There is a policy interest here. I acknowledge this problem 
exists. Bill C-339 seeks to correct this imbalance by requiring a 
large company, such as an oil company, that brings an application 
before a quasi-judicial agency  to pay for certain other groups to 
oppose its own application. This is one way to provide intervenor 
funding.
<P>
	Provincial acts exist in several provincial jurisdictions, two of 
which are Ontario and Alberta. Ontario's act requires the company 
making the application to fund its opponent. The member 
mentioned this is the act that he modelled his private member's bill 
on.
<P>
	I want to applaud the intentions of the member for Oxford in 
putting together this bill because the proposal arises out of a 
difficult experience of a number of his constituents. The bill speaks 
to a situation in the member's riding in May 1994 in which 130 
farm families had to get together to oppose an application to the 
National Energy Board made by Interprovincial Pipe Line Inc. to 
convert pipelines running through their properties.
<P>
	The farmers were able to fight the action but not before it had 
cost them $365,000 plus interest. To oppose the pipeline they had 
to form a coalition across a wide geographic area and put up a lot of 
personal cash to get the job done. In strict economic terms, without 
dealing with the human side of the equation, no intervenor funding 
was necessary in this case. The company that brought forward the 
application and another body, in this case a group of farmers, had 
the resources and were able to marshal them together to oppose the 
application.
<P>
	In other words, because the farmers were able to put together the 
money and win the case, it proved no intervenor funding was 
required. However, strict economic theory would say that the 
greater the number of people the decision might affect, the greater 
the pool of money that would be available to oppose it. The number 
of people increases as more and more people realize the decision 
will negatively affect their interests. This would be the case if we 
were talking strict economic theory.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the pure world of the economist is not the real 
world we must live in. Many of these applications do not get a lot 
of coverage in the news so the people that should be concerned do 
not hear about it until the problems confront them personally, 
sometimes years later.
<P>
	A large company like an oil company also has the advantage of 
superior information. It has been around for a long time. It has had 
time to develop a lot of expertise and information to present to the 
panel. Most big companies also have a lot of money to finance 
research, pay a slew of lawyers to do their work and make slick 
presentations before boards. They can afford to drag out the 
hearings over a long period of time. All the advantages are in their 
ball park.
<P>
	This subject is very appropriate but I also have questions about 
this bill. For instance, I question whether  it is fair for a private 
company to be required to finance the very group that may kill its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16101"> 16101 </A></B>
<P>
application. This part of the bill would almost certainly be 
challenged in court by the companies that stand to suffer from it.
<P>
	There is also an unfortunate, perhaps inadvertent, assumption 
made by the bill that all companies that appear before boards and 
agencies are large ones which can afford to fund their opponents. 
The bill makes no provision for the small business that has to get 
federal approval for some small development and would therefore 
find itself subject to all provisions of the bill.
<P>
	For example, in my riding a very small outfit wanted to put 
together a silicate sand mine. It was called a mine but it was really 
a travel pit. It was a mine because it involved silicate sand. The 
company jumped through all the hoops and did all the things it 
could think of to receive provincial approvals, but then it was told 
that it had to go through the federal approvals because it was a 
mine. The people finally gave up. They said: ``This will cost us 
another $100,000 and we cannot afford it''.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Imagine if a neighbour was worried about sand blowing off the 
silicate sand pit and wanted intervenor funding. There would be 
only a couple of people involved but there was no way they could 
ever afford to pay for the intervenor status.
<P>
	Clause 4(7) of the bill states that the level of intervenor funding 
would not be set according to the company's ability to pay, it would 
be set according to the going rates of the lawyers. That would be 
enough to kill some companies in a matter of hours.
<P>
	My second major concern is the scope of the bill, which is very 
broad. It applies to any project on any land, public or private, that 
needs approval by any federal authority, including a board or 
agency, or even a civil servant, where the approval process requires 
or even permits public input. Can you think of any project of any 
size at all which is started today without a raft of federal 
government approvals? I cannot. If intervenor funding was 
available for all government approvals the program might quickly 
become unmanageable.
<P>
	Finally, the bill tends to invite litigation from all manners of 
groups which would demand funding through the courts if rejected 
by the funding panel created by the bill. Indeed, the bill tends to 
create groups which might not otherwise exist because of the 
promise of either federal funding through court challenges or 
funding through the intervenor act. We know that the federal 
bureaucracy has in this way created a demand for its own services 
for decades and I am sure that some government departments 
would love the extra work.
<P>
	These are difficult problems. While I agree with the member's 
intentions, I have not been able to think of a way to change the bill 
to minimize the abuses about which I have spoken. I fear that if the 
proponent funding  measures did not fly, that is, if private 
companies successfully challenged the fairness of having to fund 
their own opponents, or if they were unable to provide the funding 
in some way, that government, as usual, would have to take up the 
slack. It would become a typical government cash cow, milked by 
many different interest groups with varying degrees of 
responsibility and various political agendas. As we know, this 
particular cow at the federal level is a dry cow and there will not be 
any milk in it for a long time to come.
<P>
	As I said before, if the panel did not like the group's agenda and 
refused to support it, perhaps the courts, which have become very 
sympathetic with intervenor groups in recent years, might force 
them to do so.
<P>
	I wonder if the problem could be addressed, at least in part, by 
having intervenor groups respond to the concerns of their particular 
constituencies by the government allowing them to have the 
equivalency of charitable status with Revenue Canada. Therefore, 
they could receive partial assistance from the federal government. 
This would require a measure of financial commitment and 
responsibility by the intervenors and it would not require any 
panels or acts of Parliament to make those decisions.
<P>
	I am concerned that the intervenor funding act, if it develops as I 
fear, may make it very difficult for companies to push forward with 
new projects in Canada.
<P>
	Recently we met with the mining companies during the ``Keep 
Mining in Canada'' week. They told us that it takes up to three 
years to get all the approvals from the provincial governments and 
then the federal government to do the initial environmental 
assessments and so on to start up a mine.
<P>
	The industry minister has also mentioned the problems of 
overlapping of jurisdictions, provincial and federal, that make it 
very difficult for mines to open. The industry minister is 
attempting to bring together some co-ordination to reduce the red 
tape for companies. I fear that the intervenor act may add another 
level of problems for companies which are trying to create jobs, 
wealth and opportunity within Canada. Something which we do not 
need at this time is another layer of problems.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to talk about the basic principle of the bill. We have 
recently put forward a 20-point proposal on how we can realign 
federal-provincial obligations in this country. The very first point 
in our 20-point proposal is that natural resources and the care of 
natural resources is constitutionally a provincial jurisdiction and 
whenever possible should be left in the provincial realm.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that two provinces already have addressed 
the problem in their own realm by allowing intervenor funding 
through provincial legislation. I believe it may be best to leave that 
natural resource issue with the provinces and allow the other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16102"> 16102 </A></B>
<P>
provinces to bring  forward similar legislation to address it at the 
provincial level.
<P>
	I recognize that the member for Oxford has brought to light an 
existing imbalance in the system. However, I am not convinced that 
the bill he has proposed would deal with the problem without 
creating new problems in itself. I would be pleased, however, to 
suggest to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, on which 
I sit as a member, that the committee invite the member who has 
brought this bill forward and other witnesses and try to suggest 
ways of either altering, improving or finding ways to accomplish 
the purpose behind the bill.
<P>
	While I would like to thank the member for his effort, I am 
hesitant to give my support for this bill for the reasons I have 
stated. I will be listening to the other speeches to see if I can 
approve it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to second Bill C-339, a 
private member's bill dealing with the subject of intervenor 
funding. This is certainly a subject that deserves the attention of 
members of this House and of the government. I thank the member 
for Oxford for bringing it forward.
<P>
	Intervenor funding is, as he has indicated, not a new concept for 
governments or for this House. It was last dealt with seriously 
when we debated the merits of including an intervenor funding 
program within the Environmental Assessment Act legislation in 
the previous Parliament. At that time, members will remember that 
I was a strong advocate of a comprehensive intervenor funding 
program.
<P>
	Today, Bill C-339 asks us to approve the principle that a 
proponent of a project that requires approval by a federal board or 
agency should financially assist those who are intervening in the 
public interest before the board and it sets out a few guidelines 
about how this funding program would work.
<P>
	Specifically, Bill C-339 states that before receiving funding, 
intervenors need to meet a number of very specific criteria: that the 
intervenor represents a clearly ascertainable interest that is relevant 
to the issue; that the intervenor does not have sufficient financial 
resources; that the intervenor has made reasonable efforts to obtain 
funding from other sources; that the intervenor has established a 
record of concern; that the intervenor has made reasonable efforts 
to co-operate with other intervenors; and that the absence of 
funding would adversely affect the representation of the interest.
<P>
	The criteria also requires the intervenor to have a proposal that 
specifies the use to which funding would be put, has the ability to 
record the expenditure of the funding, and has agreed to submit an 
accounting to the panel for the expenditure and follow and allow 
that panel to examine its records and verify its accounting.
<P>
	According to the mover of the motion, the primary objective of 
the legislation is to give all those who speak in the public interest 
the opportunity to be heard before federal boards and agencies. The 
goal is admirable and the criteria is strict, perhaps too restrictive, 
but there are a few things that I think should be said in the debate 
before us today.
<P>
	First, I want to ensure that there is no misunderstanding. I and 
my New Democrat colleagues are strong believers in the principle 
of intervenor funding. We are well aware that when the proponent 
of a project wants to obtain a permit or a licence to construct 
something that proponent generally has the funding in place to 
make the necessary application which may require the inclusion of 
an environmental assessment.
<P>
	Obviously the proponent wants that project approved and the 
information they bring forward will undoubtedly portray that 
project in a positive light.
<P>
	On the other hand, there may be others acting in the public 
interest who want other information considered prior to the 
proponent's application being approved by the respective board or 
agency. These others may not have the resources to adequately 
research, prepare, or deliver this alternative presentation. 
Therefore, without an adequate intervenor funding program there is 
no guarantee that the alternative view will ever make it in front of 
the group considering the licence or the permit that would finally 
approve the proponent's project.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	When Parliament was examining the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act a few years ago, the Canadian Bar Association 
supported the inclusion of intervenor funding. I quote from the 
Canadian Bar Association presentation: ``Interim funding should 
be provided to groups or individuals who wish to participate in 
public hearings and who have demonstrated a sufficient interest in 
the process and the ability to make a contribution to it. It is a fair 
and efficient mechanism to level the playing field between 
parties.''
<P>
	The Canadian Bar Association also said that intervenor costs 
should be paid. They suggested that a process be established to 
review and possibly order one party at a hearing to pay the costs of 
any other party to the same hearing.
<P>
	Another witness at the same time, the law firm of McJannet 
Rich, a well-known environmental law firm, argued firmly for an 
intervenor funding process and set out some rules they thought 
were important. In their presentation to the parliamentary 
committee the law firm said: ``Intervenor funding is extremely 
important and should be made available for participants in public 
reviews in accordance with the following principles: (1) the 
government has the responsibility for assuring the availability of 
funding and for its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16103"> 16103 </A></B>
<P>
allocation; (2) whatever the source of funds, the proponent must 
not exercise any  control over the allocation; (3) eligibility criteria 
for intervenor funding must be developed and made known early; 
(4) a funding allocation committee independent of the panel should 
be established; and (5) funding should be made early enough to 
allow receiving groups sufficient time to organize themselves, 
prepare submissions, and where appropriate to undertake necessary 
investigations.''
<P>
	Presentations by two environmental lawyers, Mr. Steven Hazell 
and Mr. Brian Pannell, also stressed the need for intervenor 
funding. Again I quote from their presentation to the parliamentary 
committee: ``Public participation in environmental 
decision-making is essential. A community has a right to 
participate in decisions affecting its interests. Public involvement 
is the best way to introduce into the process relevant information 
and values that would otherwise be excluded. Moreover, the public 
can provide independent scrutiny of the basis for a proponent's 
actions. This allows for a full exploration of all alternatives and 
makes the decision and process better and more credible and 
ensures greater accountability of decision-makers.''
<P>
	Pannell and Hazell go on to say that the effective participation by 
the public requires funding. They say: ``The disproportion of 
resources between proponents and the public necessitates the 
establishment of an independent funding body to provide adequate 
amounts of funding to allow full and meaningful participation at all 
steps to committed members of the public.'' They say intervenor 
funding should be levied from the proponent and allocated and 
administered by an independent body.
<P>
	I cannot stress enough that an adequately funded clear and 
agreeable participant funding or intervenor funding program must 
be put in place as soon as possible. With an ever-increasing 
emphasis being put on resource development, with an 
ever-increasing number of projects being proposed, and with an 
ever-increasing lack of public confidence in government programs 
dealing with environmental issues, this has never been more 
important. We must be very careful though in what we do.
<P>
	I do not think we should let the government off too easily. There 
is a need to establish an adequately funded program that has some 
certainty to it. Although Bill C-339 requires virtually nothing from 
the federal government and puts too much onus on the proponents, 
we should be looking at a program that has a little more onus on the 
federal government.
<P>
	Second, we have to be careful that the specific rules about 
funding the program not totally focus on the proponent. I am 
concerned, as the previous speaker was, that community and 
co-operative proponents of smaller more locally based projects 
may be unable to complete their project applications and otherwise 
community friendly proposals may never become a reality if in fact 
the bill goes through as is.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	There will be times when the proposal put forward today by my 
friend from Oxford will actually threaten to increase proponent 
costs in cases like this one to such a degree that community 
proponents, especially in rural and northern Canada and perhaps on 
First Nations communities, will simply give up. I would hate to see 
that happen.
<P>
	However I stress to the House that I will support the bill before 
us today. The member for Oxford has done us a great service in 
bringing the issue forward and bringing it to the attention of the 
government. We need a clearer and more defined intervenor 
funding process that perhaps has more independence to it. I look 
forward to the opportunity to address the issue more fully in 
committee.
<P>
	I commend the member for Oxford for his initiative in this 
regard. If he is successful in achieving full parliamentary review of 
the legislation, I urge him to look more carefully at the process and 
perhaps conclude that the next step would be an amendment to 
establish an independent funding agency rather than leave the 
decisions to the boards and agencies that actually have to hear the 
applications.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak on private member's 
Bill C-339, the intervenor funding act, sponsored by my hon. 
colleague, the member for Oxford.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to require any person proposing a 
project that would affect the public interest or the environment, and 
that is required by law to be reviewed by a public process before 
being approved by government or an agency of the government, to 
provide funding to assist organizations that represent a relevant 
public interest and that wish to intervene in the review process to 
represent that interest.
<P>
	Intervenor funding is certainly not a new concept in our country. 
The province of Ontario currently has the intervenor funding 
project act and serves as a model for Bill C-339. The Ontario act 
was in turn modelled upon the funding provided for intervenors 
before the Mackenzie Valley pipeline inquiry known as the Berger 
commission in the mid-1970s.
<P>
	The commission charged with the duty of investigating the 
appropriateness of a pipeline through the Mackenzie Valley in the 
Northwest Territories determined that the many diverse interests in 
the region should be represented in the hearings. In order to level 
the playing field to compete with the finances available to the 
proponents of the pipeline, it was deemed necessary to provide 
money for citizens' groups so that they could properly research 
their intervention.
<P>
	While funding for the Berger commission was provided by the 
federal government, Bill C-339 does not call upon the Canadian 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16104"> 16104 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayer to provide funding for  intervenors. Instead the proponent 
of the project would have to provide the funding.
<P>
	This is an interesting and unique proposal. It is based upon the 
contention that if the proponent is required to bear the cost of 
intervention, it would motivate the sponsor of the project to work 
with the potential intervenors in finding solutions before 
submitting the proposal before the relevant board or agency. The 
Ontario experience has already shown the effectiveness of the 
funding.
<P>
	After witnessing the recent proceedings of the National Energy 
Board hearing that involved a bid to convert an unused oil pipeline 
running from Sarnia through my riding of Lambton-Middlesex to 
Milton, Ontario, I am more convinced than ever that a system of 
intervenor funding should also be available when federal boards or 
agencies are involved.
<P>
	Since this converted pipeline would have run through prime 
agricultural land in southwestern Ontario the landowners of the 
region were understandably concerned with the proposal. After 
several months of hearings the National Energy Board sided with 
the landowners, clearly taking the interest of the public safety to 
heart. While happy with the decision, the landowners also spent 
over $300,000 of their own money participating in the hearings 
process which had come under the jurisdiction of the National 
Energy Board.
<P>
	Had the companies involved in the proposal been registered as 
Ontario businesses, the hearings would have fallen under the 
provincial jurisdiction of the Ontario Energy Board and the legal 
costs associated with participating in the hearings would have been 
covered by the applicant company. Unfortunately for the 
intervening land owners the applicant company was from Alberta. 
Therefore the intervenors did not qualify under the Ontario act.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	I certainly agree with the landowners' spokesman who correctly 
stated that the state of affairs was prohibitive for landowners or 
anyone else to defend their rights and interests in an application 
that falls under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	On a number of occasions over the past year my southwestern 
Ontario colleagues and I have been in touch with the particular 
landowners association. Collectively we have searched for 
solutions and we have all come to the same conclusion, that there 
must be changes to the National Energy Board Act whereby 
landowners or other parties intervening in NEB hearings and acting 
in the public interest should be granted intervenor funding prior to 
NEB hearings.
<P>
	We have also concluded that the granting by the proponents of 
intervenor funding at the federal level would yield at least three 
favourable results. Intervenor funding would, first, allow for equal 
treatment of all  interested parties; second, ensure greater public 
safety by opening up the process to the public; and, third, save 
public money in the long run.
<P>
	The more than $300,000 spent by the landowners' association 
would be minimal compared to the current practice of maintaining 
a much larger government agency to scrutinize pipeline proposals.
<P>
	While the National Energy Board Act presently allows for 
limited intervenor funding for detailed route hearings, certain 
technicalities in the act preclude intervenors from receiving 
funding for natural gas pipeline matters. Unfortunately for the 
landowners in southwestern Ontario, the Alberta company had 
proposed a conversion of the unused oil pipeline to natural gas. 
Therefore the landowners were out of luck under the terms of the 
NEB act.
<P>
	In communications with the Minister of Natural Resources I 
have been informed that the department is currently engaged in an 
exercise with the NEB to review a variety of NEB functions and to 
address a number of deficiencies in the NEB act. I have been 
assured by the minister that the issue of intervenor funding has 
been included in the exercise. At the same time I have been 
informed by the Minister of Natural Resources that the 
government's fiscal situation strongly suggests that any intervenor 
funding would likely be on a proponent pay system.
<P>
	This is precisely where Bill C-330 could fill a void in federal 
policy. It would dovetail nicely with the current review of the 
National Energy Board.
<P>
	The bill is designed to assist those with bona fide concerns. It is 
certainly not meant to provide funding for special interest groups. 
The bottom line is that it would improve the way in which the 
federal government and its agencies and boards make decisions 
that affect all of us. Perhaps best of all, by calling for the proponent 
of a particular project to provide funding for the intervenor it would 
take the onus off the government to empty its pockets every time 
there is a hearing. Instead the government board or agency would 
devote 100 per cent of its efforts into judging the soundness of the 
proposal at hand.
<P>
	Bill C-339 calls for the relevant authority to appoint a funding 
panel to determine who will benefit from the project. It would hear 
applications for funding from intervenors and the panel would 
determine who should be funded. Before receiving funding the 
intervenor would have to satisfy a number of important criteria.
<P>
	The intervenor would have to represent a clearly ascertainable 
interest that is relevant to the issue before the review authority and 
that should be represented at the hearing. It would have to be 
established that the intervenor does not have sufficient financial 
resources to make the representation without funding. There would 
have to be reasonable efforts to obtain funding from  other sources. 
The intervenor would have an established record of concern for and 
commitment to the interest in question. Reasonable efforts would 
have to be made to co-operate with other intervenors that represent 
similar interests. It would be incumbent upon the intervenor to 
demonstrate the existence of a proposal that specifies the use to 
which funding would be put and to submit to an examination of all 
records by the panel to verify the intervenor's accounting.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16105"> 16105 </A></B>
<P>
	These are more than ample safeguards to ensure that no 
application for intervenor status would be made on frivolous 
grounds.
<P>
	I am deeply impressed with the bill. Not only would it allow for 
a responsible means by which intervenors could put forward their 
perspective in a way that would allow the board or agency to make 
a decision with the best information available, but it would do so 
without making onerous financial claims on the government.
<P>
	I can certainly understand why the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs decided to make this private 
member's bill a votable item. It is because it fills a void in federal 
government policy and offers a unique means to address a pressing 
public interest issue without extending a hand for more government 
dollars.
<P>
	I urge all members of this House to give this bill the support it 
deserves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to rise and 
speak on Bill C-339, as introduced by my colleague representing 
the riding of Oxford.
<P>
	I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank my 
colleague from the great riding of Oxford for the impressive 
amount of work and research he has put into this bill.
<P>
	The primary objective of this legislation is to give all of those 
people who speak in the public interest the opportunity to be heard 
before federal boards and agencies. With this bill, federal boards 
and agencies will make better decisions with a higher level of 
public input, consultation and participation.
<P>
	Bill C-339 is designed to assist those with bona fide concerns. It 
is not meant to provide funding for special interest groups. It is in 
the interest of each of us for the public interest to be heard. This bill 
will ensure that the public interest is heard.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. The hon. 
member will be able to resume his remarks the next time the matter 
is debated.
<P>
	It being 7.13 p.m., the time provided for consideration of private 
members' business has now expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 
93, the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on 
the Order Paper.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant 
to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.13 p.m.)
