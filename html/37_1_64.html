<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to present another petition to the 
House calling for the release of historic census records to the 
public.  The petition is signed by more than 5,500 Canadians. 
Combined with the signatures of the previous petitions that I 
have presented on this subject in this session of parliament, the 
total number is now over 9,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition points out that an estimated 7.5 million Canadians 
are engaged in the pursuit of their family history and that 
census records are a valuable tool for such research.  The 
records have been used in historical research, for tracing 
genetic diseases and in settling wills and estates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are calling upon parliament to take whatever 
steps are necessary to retroactively amend confidentiality 
clauses of the Statistics Act since 1906 to allow the release to 
the public, after a reasonable period of time, the post 1901 
census records.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a special committee of the 
House be appointed to consider the factors underlying or 
relating to the non-medical use of drugs in Canada and make 
recommendations with respect to the ways or means by which 
the government can act, alone or in its relations with 
governments at other levels, in the reduction of the 
dimensions of the problem involved in such use; 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the membership of the committee be established by the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee report the membership of the 
special committee to the House within five sitting days 
after the adoption of this motion; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That substitutions may be made from time to time, if

114(2);

Standing Committees in Standing Order 108; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the committee shall present its final report no later 
that June 1, 2002. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak today to the 
motion and to get it to the floor of the House of Commons.  It 
has been about eight years, since 1993, that I have been very 
close to this issue and have wanted to get it to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look back at the record of the House of Commons I find 
there actually has not been a debate in the House on drugs for 
decades.  That concerns me, particularly because of the advance 
stage of concern from parents and virtually everyone in the 
country about drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are asking for a special committee is that it is 
time the House of Commons, on a non-partisan basis, organized 
itself to go across the country to the small towns, villages and 
cities and to hold hearings here in the House of Commons to get 
people together and assess how difficult the situation is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure members that I will let them know just how 
difficult it is from my perspective.  As I say, I have been 
involved with this for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said that there is a Senate committee looking at this 
issue, but it is actually only looking at the issue of cannabis. 
What I am talking about here is assessing the non-medical use of 
drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and LSD, the kinds of 
drugs that are addicting our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing I want to emphasize is this committee and 
its make-up.  The committee should be made up of members of all 
parties of the House.  They should be members who want to 
consistently be involved in the committee on a longer term basis 
with other members who have an avid interest in the issue. They 
should be individuals who are somewhat compatible, regardless of 
philosophical beliefs or politics.  They should be compatible on 
the issues and the understanding of drugs themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt that this will take a lot of time and work but we 
have to deal with the issue, and I will show the House why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relate how drug use is growing in our country.  The 
results were astonishing in a particular study I was recently 
looking at, the Ontario student drug use survey that has been 
done biannually since 1977.  It indicated that between 1997 and 
1999 the use of some drugs almost tripled.  The percentage of 
students who said they could not stop using drugs soared from 
2.9% to 6.5%.  That was in Ontario schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With cannabis the percentage peaked at 31.7% in 1979 and then 
fell for the next six surveys to 11% in 1991.  Since then usage 
has soared, reaching 24.9% in 1997.  We can see that is 
increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cocaine use has been tracked since 1977 and crack cocaine has 
been tracked since 1987.  While cocaine peaked in 1979 at 5.1% 
and then fell, only to rise again, crack cocaine usage has 
increased steadily.  Cocaine usage rose sharply in 1999 to 3.7% 
in Ontario schools.  That is concerning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that 36% of students in 1999 said that 
someone had tried to sell them drugs in the last year and 32% 
said they observed someone selling drugs.  That is in our 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in a school not too long ago where three students in one 
behavioural class admitted to being heroin users.  That is 
concerning.  It is such an addictive drug that these young people 
will end up stealing, robbing, prostituting or doing whatever 
they can to get the drug.  Those are our children.  That is why 
the motion is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here Canada's drug strategy.  It was produced by the 
current government.  I looked at the particular strategy and I 
compared it with the strategy done by the previous Progressive 
Conservative government.  I think both governments, in all 
fairness, tried their very best to assess the drug situation at 
the time and perhaps had the bureaucracy write the strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I actually took this strategy to the streets, to people working 
with drug addicts and to drug addicts themselves.  I asked them 
about the strategy.  They had no idea what I was talking about 
and quite frankly told me that it did not affect their daily 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we compare the strategies it is really interesting.  I ask 
all colleagues who are interested in this subject to compare the 
strategy produced in 1987 by the Progressive Conservative 
government with the strategy produced by the Liberal government. 
I am not trying in any way to discredit either government.  I am 
just relating that perhaps the bureaucracy has this idea about 
drug strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 the goal or the overall objective of the drug strategy 
of the government of the day was to reduce harm to individuals. 
In 1998 this strategy by a different government but by the same 
bureaucracy said that the long term goal of Canada's drug 
strategy was to reduce the harm associated with alcohol and 
drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1987 and 1998 a whole bunch of things happened regarding 
drug use.  It became worse and there were more manufactured drugs 
in the country, but virtually the same document has been produced 
by the same bureaucracy but by different governments.  I do not 
think this is getting to the bottom of the issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the comprehensive framework.  In 1987 the 
bureaucracy of the day said this was a multifaceted response to a 
complex issue.  It said that the most important things were 
education and prevention.  In 1998 the government and its 
bureaucracy said that it was a comprehensive framework and that 
the most important things were prevention and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 they said we needed enforcement and control.  In 1998 
they said we needed legislation, enforcement and control.  In 
1987 they said we needed treatment and rehabilitation.  In 1998 
they said we needed treatment and rehabilitation, and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an overlay, an absolute overlay from 1987 to 1998.  Yet 
the problem is probably three to four times worse.  What I am 
getting at is that I do not see improvement.  We have to put 
together a committee in the House and we to get on the streets 
where the problem is.  We have to come back here on a 
non-partisan basis and say that we have to take the following 
action.  It is not to write a drug strategy like the one that has 
been the same for 10 years with a poor outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been many places in my day.  One of the worst times in my 
life since I have been a member of parliament is when I was on 
the streets watching a young 13 or 14 year old shooting heroin 
between her toes because there was no other place on her arms or 
elsewhere to put the needle.  That kid is likely dead today. That 
child was somebody's child.  We forgot her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other children like her out there.  Today we are 
arresting prostitutes one after another, treating them like 
criminals rather than victims of a very harsh drug trade where 
the profiteers at the top are making a lot at the expense of the 
young kids at the bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One night I was on shift with a police force when we arrested 
four prostitutes.  The oldest was 16.  They were arrested, booked 
and let back out on the streets.  Before I finished my shift one 
of them was back out on the street, on the corner.  She stayed 
there because there was no consequence to just being arrested. 
These kids need a shot of heroin.  This cannot continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of police reports.  The police give me a lot of 
reports on things that go on.  I want to give a few examples of 
efforts to smuggle drugs into Canada.  These are from 
intelligence bulletins and, no, I will not tell anybody where I 
got them.  Ecstasy was seized from a female body packer at 
Vancouver international airport.  Inspectors seized 10,212 
ecstasy tablets from a young woman arriving from Amsterdam.  That 
was on Friday, December 3, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 30, 1999, 23,057 tablets of ecstasy were hidden in 
socks at Vancouver international airport.  On November 4, 1999, 
104,000 tablets of ecstasy were seized at Vancouver international 
airport from two Israeli nationals arriving on KLM flight 681 
from Amsterdam.  On August 18, 1999, 33 kilos of cocaine were 
seized on the Pacific coast highway commercial corridor from 
people from California. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pages and books of this stuff.  Surely everybody 
listening gets the point.  It is out of control.  I am not 
talking about catching everybody involved in drugs, locking them 
up, throwing away the key and starting a war on drugs.  To some 
extent the Americans are on the wrong track by doing this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about assessing the state of drug use in the 
nation, the state of our children in schools, the state of 
prostitution on the streets, and the state of parents from whom I 
receive calls practically on a daily basis.  They ask if I can 
help them get their child out of a crack house or out of a 
province and into another province, into a facility for drug 
rehabilitation and detox. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not even have enough detox facilities to look after a 
small percentage of the addicts in our country.  For goodness' 
sake, there are almost 8,000 heroin addicts in Vancouver alone 
who shoot up every day at $20 a cap.  Every one of them has to 
earn the money to get heroin five to eight times a day.  They are 
stealing and robbing from people.  They are prostituting 
themselves.  That is only one city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been 147 deaths from overdoses this year in Vancouver 
alone.  These were someone's children or someone's parents.  If 
they were raped and murdered there would be a sex offender 
registry in two seconds.  If they were shot with a gun or driven 
over by a drunk driver this place would be erupting with new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleading for all parties to look at the issue on a 
non-partisan basis now and not over the next five years.  Let us 
give it a year but study it thoroughly and come back to the House 
to take some concrete action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the drug strategies appear to be a failure. 
There is no point coming here and ragging on any government about 
drug strategies.  The people who really need help are not 
interested in reading a drug strategy that does not go to the 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in a needle exchange that gives out needles 
to some addicts, not all of them.  It gave out 1.5 million 
needles last year to drug addicts in one facility.  I have seen 
the needle exchange in Sydney, Nova Scotia.  Who would have ever 
thought this could happen in a small place such as Sydney? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now my community of Abbotsford is debating the issue of 
whether there should be a needle exchange.  We can reserve 
opinion on the effectiveness of a needle exchange and safe shoot 
up sites.  They were talking about that in Vancouver yesterday. 
We do not have to get into whether it is right or wrong right 
now, but we have to get into how Sydney, Nova Scotia, and small 
towns in the country are into these exchanges.  Why is it?  How 
big will it get? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague tells me there are about 4,000 to 5,000 people in 
Stellarton, Nova Scotia.  Recent information highlighting a 
growing drug problem among Stellarton's youth is prompting the 
town's police commission to seek government funding to help pay 
for a new drug enforcement officer.  The town's drug problems 
came to the fore following a recent news report highlighting an 
incident involving an 11 year old Stellarton girl who was 
discovered by police to be carrying 140 tablets of a street drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is happening with an 11 year old kid, and we sit in the 
House debating some legislation that the average person on the 
street does not give two hoots about.  It is not just Stellarton. 
It is all over the country and we are closing our eyes to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things this committee has to look at.  I 
believe we will get, if not unanimous consent, majority consent 
to establish this committee.  I am begging the House to have the 
committee, on a non-partisan basis, get down to looking at the 
issue on the streets.  We should forget the bureaucrats who sit 
in high buildings.  Let us get down on the streets and figure out 
how to fix this thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a litany of problems here with regard to the judicial 
system.  I have here case upon case of individuals trafficking in 
$300,000 to $400,000 worth of drugs who get caught and get 
suspended sentences or conditional sentences.  There are 
individuals with better than 60 convictions.  They go into our 
courts and they come out of our courts.  They sell drugs, they 
buy drugs, they trade drugs, they make money and they go into our 
courts and come out of our courts.  Meanwhile our children become 
addicted and these individuals get rich.  The justice system just 
drags along real slowly and the police say “What do you want us 
to do?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have stood by with police and talked to people who are in this 
country illegally.  One was smoking a marijuana joint while he 
was talking to us because he knew nothing would happen to him.  I 
am not here to debate whether marijuana is a good thing or a bad 
thing.  I am here to try to establish some action.  I sincerely 
hope that if we establish the committee we will have people on 
the committee who truly care about the issue and will truly do 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to thank all of those people listening and 
watching who have some concern for this matter.  I hope that they 
too will write to members of parliament in the House of Commons 
and say that we have to take some action in this country.  I say 
please, on behalf of our children, on behalf of the tens of 
thousands who are addicted in this country, let us take some 
action and do something positive for a change.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to inform my colleague that, as a party, we are going to support 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share his feeling that it is high time parliamentarians 
addressed the issue of drug use and its connection with other 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I wish to ask my colleague is this: Has he heard of 
the harm reduction model?  This is an intervention framework in 
place in Vancouver and in Quebec, which provides needle exchange 
sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach is based on the principle that, before people can 
get clean, they need a support process and that this must 
involve providing the safest possible conditions for drug use. 
That is why there are needle exchanges.  Earlier, our colleague 
gave some figures that I took note of: 1.5 million needles in 
his region.  The same situation exists in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparation for our future endeavours, I wish to indicate 
immediately to him my interest in a committee of this type, an 
interest I know is shared by the hon. member for 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that the first stage needs to be 
based on the premise of harm reduction?  Is he familiar with 
this? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very familiar with the 
concept of harm reduction.  I do not want to limit the committee 
by suggesting that it would proceed on the basis of a harm 
reduction model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of questions about the harm reduction model.  In 
talking to hundreds of people about it, I have learned that there 
are different understandings of what harm reduction is.  That is 
why we have to look at it.  What does harm reduction mean? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To some, harm reduction means not doing too much on the 
enforcement side.  It means that if people get involved in drugs 
we reduce the harm by getting them into methadone treatments and 
safe shooting up sites.  There are many people who disagree with 
safe shooting up sites, for instance, which Vancouver is 
considering.  When we talk about harm reduction, I do not think 
there is a person here or anywhere else who can be consistent in 
saying exactly what it means and how far we should go.  To me 
harm reduction is something whereby we ask how we can best deal 
with an addict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am equally concerned about keeping people from becoming 
addicted.  I am equally concerned about individuals who are 
trafficking in this and making profits on it.  It is a complex 
issue, but I will reserve opinions as to whether or not harm 
reduction is, first, defined and, second, acceptable, until I get 
into this personally and see what this committee will do with 
itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to commence by congratulating the hon. 
member for Langley—Abbotsford.  This is an issue that he has 
long pursued and I know that his participation in the justice 
committee reiterated his interest and his passion for seeking 
solutions in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke of a place very near and dear to my heart, 
Stellarton, Nova Scotia.  I know that the chief of police there, 
Ambrose Heighton, and others, including principal Jeff Green and 
community members, have tried to aggressively attack this issue 
of possession of very serious drugs in our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young girl the hon. member mentioned in his remarks was in 
possession of tablets of dilaudid, I think, which is a highly 
addictive morphine-like drug that has become very prevalent and 
is very available in communities in Pictou county and the nearby 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main concern, like his, is how we address this in a broad 
fashion.  It will take the police, the education system and the 
health professionals to address it.  However, perhaps I am 
looking for a more specific direction from him for this committee 
and for any parameters he might suggest that we put in place.  He 
mentioned having a time limit of a year to report.  Would this 
include calling witnesses?  Would it include bringing forward 
some of these studies he has already alluded to as the basis for 
this committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows full 
well I have a great deal of respect for him.  I think he is one 
of the individuals the House needs on that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the terms and conditions of the committee, a budget 
would have to be established because there would have to be a 
great deal of travel.  I am not a big one to be travelling, but 
the committee has to travel, and not only to the big cities.  We 
have to go to Stellarton and find out what the problem is, how it 
is occurring and how to stop it.  We must have the right people 
on the committee, not too many but the right ones who are all of 
the same frame of mind, and that is, how do we fix this?  We have 
to set out objectives.  We must have a commitment from the House 
that when the committee has its report it comes in here at least 
for debate.  The committee has to set other parameters as well, 
which I do not think I have time to discuss here.  I am willing 
to discuss all of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member is 
extremely interested in this subject.  It is very important for 
all Canadians, or should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many residents of Vancouver are dying every day or every 
week?  Is the hon. member able to tell us anything about that? 
Does he have some country or some place in mind where there is an 
effective strategy against drug abuse which he would like to 
mention beyond what he has already said in his comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, drug overdoses in Vancouver 
alone average 147 yearly.  Together in Toronto and Vancouver last 
year there were over 400 deaths from drug overdose.  This is 
acute; that is just two cities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would venture a guess that there are well over a thousand 
overdoses a year in this country.  Then again, that is what the 
committee has to determine.  How serious is this thing?  Often in 
little towns like mine there is a death from overdose but it is 
not recorded that way.  Some are and some are not.  Perhaps 
somebody on drugs was driving a car and killed himself.  It is 
very loosely defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to other countries, I have read a lot about the 
experiment in Holland.  Some say it failed.  Some say it was the 
only way to deal with it.  Some say it created a greater drug 
trade in Europe.  Other countries promote the drug trade.  In 
some of the southern countries, one of the main national incomes 
is from drug exportation.  In British Columbia, B.C. bud is 
traded in large quantities to the south in return for money or 
cocaine coming north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly have not read about a completely satisfactory 
solution in any country.  At least this committee should be able 
to come back here and say whether the world has a problem or that 
several countries seem to be addressing it better and we should 
be focusing in that direction.  However right now this country is 
all over the map on the issue.  Provinces and even cities are 
tackling it in different ways.  We have to do something better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
the hon. member to know that I did a research paper with regard 
to marijuana and exactly what it does to young people and people 
of all ages.  The research I did was out of Berkeley university. 
I want the hon. member to know that the first marijuana cigarette 
that anyone smokes goes into their brain cells, unlike an 
ordinary cigarette, and remains there for nine days.  We are all 
aware that young people who get into the alleyways and start 
smoking up do it more often than every nine days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so the members know, about three or four years ago on 
Christmas Eve a young man came to my door to tell me that his 
mother and father wanted him to thank me for getting him out of 
the alleyway and off cocaine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told that the hon. member and his party are in 
favour of decriminalizing marijuana and making it available.  I 
want to know if that is true.  Is that part of what this 
committee is looking at?  Is that part of what is being put on 
the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is categorically not 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should start looking at this not on a partisan basis 
but in a way that would help our young people.  I too was a 
resident of Saint John, New Brunswick.  I know the city fairly 
well.  They have drug problems there too.  This problem has to be 
curtailed all over the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to that question is that it is categorically not 
true.  There is no hidden agenda here.  The agenda is to try to 
protect our children from drugs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
very much appreciate the opportunity to address this issue this 
morning.  I acknowledge the conviction and passion of the member 
for Langley—Abbotsford in proposing this motion and speaking on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister of Health this morning. 
I would like to thank the hon. member opposite for bringing 
forward this motion.  I certainly applaud his concern over the 
issue of non-medical drug use in Canada because it is a subject 
that merits the attention of all members of parliament and all 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing the magnitude of the drug use problem is a priority for 
the government, throughout Canada, especially in our urban 
centres and in some of our aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I want to echo the comments of the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT9"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT9"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug use is one of the most complex and vexing challenges before 
us today.  It is not simply a question of controlling the supply 
of illicit drug products but of curbing demand and dealing with 
the health impacts, the crime and the myriad of other 
consequences of non-medical drug use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is such a complex problem that it demands a comprehensive 
range of solutions.  It requires the co-operation of numerous 
departments and agencies within the Government of Canada as well 
as meaningful partnerships among and between governments, 
institutions, voluntary organizations, community groups and 
advocacy organizations.  That is the essence of Canada's drug 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a comprehensive approach aimed at reducing harm associated 
with alcohol and other drugs, harm caused to the person who lives 
in the grip of these addictive substances and harm to their 
families and to their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy reflects a balanced approach to reducing both the 
supply and the demand for drugs.  It is a measured approach that 
focuses on our capacity to prevent drug use, to enhance treatment 
and rehabilitation and to support an expanded range of 
enforcement and control responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time we have integrated other elements into the strategy 
which address the global nature of the drug problem, for example, 
an increase in our support for research and evaluation here at 
home.  I want to underline that the reason for the ongoing 
acceptance and success of this strategy is its emphasis on 
partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's drug strategy involves a variety of partners, including 
14 federal departments, provincial and territorial governments, 
addiction agencies, non-government organizations, professional 
associations, law enforcement agencies, the private sector and 
community groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was stated in the most recent red book and in the Speech from 
the Throne, our role and commitment to addressing substance abuse 
issues remains a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of injection drug use, Health Canada co-chairs with 
British Columbia a federal-provincial-territorial committee 
comprised of representatives from health, justice, the aboriginal 
community as well as other stakeholders.  The committee's task is 
to recommend what kind of co-ordinated action governments and 
their partners could take to reduce the harm associated with 
injection drug use in Canada.  The committee has already engaged 
in extensive consultations on safe injection sites but any 
concrete proposals to curb injection drugs can only proceed with 
the full engagement of the communities concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is also a partner in the innovative Vancouver 
agreement.  The five year agreement takes the position that the 
drug problems of the downtown east side demand a comprehensive 
range of solutions.  These include everything from treatment and 
health promotion to increased housing, public safety and economic 
revitalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I had the opportunity to visit east Vancouver with 
the subcommittee on organized crime.  I witnessed the very sad 
commentary on our society.  I observed individuals in the shadows 
shooting up.  I observed an individual who died almost before our 
very eyes on the street from a drug overdose.  I saw the flop 
houses where these people live almost like creatures.  This had a 
tremendous impact on those of us who walked through this area 
with a member of the Vancouver drug squad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw youth who had so much potential.  I could see in their 
eyes that they were just wasting away.  I saw other youth who 
were down there for a joyride so to speak, just for a walk on the 
wild side.  I told them to get out of the area before they were 
caught.  I found it incomprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came across a young woman who obviously knew the police 
officer as they were on very good terms.  Instead of being penal 
officers they are guardians who monitor these individuals.  This 
young woman advised the officer that there was an individual 
preying on women in the area and had raped several of them that 
week.  She had been raped a couple of days earlier.  She was also 
HIV positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could see the downward cycle of all the people who were 
involved in that area.  Our committee was looking at how drugs 
came into the area, which was mainly by way of airports and 
seaports.  We saw the end result of those activities.  It was an 
incredible experience.  It would have had an impact on any member 
of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that the four pillars on which the Vancouver 
agreement is founded, prevention, treatment, enforcement and harm 
reduction, are consistent with the goals of Canada's drug 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like other Canadians, some first nations and Inuit struggle with 
addiction to various substances.  Health Canada is committed to 
working in partnership with the aboriginal communities to address 
alcohol and other drug abuse problems.  This past winter we saw 
young children sniffing gasoline and being taken from their 
community in order to be rehabilitated and to be put on the right 
track.  We see that all over Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way we are tackling the problem together is through the 
national native alcohol and drug abuse program.  We aim to 
confront the cultural, social and personal aspects of addiction. 
In addition to a network of 53 treatment centres, the program 
encompasses more than 500 community based initiatives geared 
toward providing first nations and Inuit people with culturally 
relevant education and prevention programs, crisis counselling, 
treatment referrals and follow up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within that context, solvent abuse among aboriginal youth is of 
particular concern.  That is why we have been working with 
aboriginal communities to establish a network of 10 residential 
sites to treat young people with solvent addictions in a 
culturally appropriate environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth solvent abuse program also includes an outreach 
component.  Treatment centre staff work with communities to offer 
education on abusive solvents, such as gasoline and aerosol 
sprays, and to provide follow up care for youth who have 
completed treatment.  The follow up care is almost as important 
as the treatment itself so that they do not fall back into the 
lifestyle that they had been experiencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, as long as drugs remain a problem for Canadians, we 
need to understand a great deal more about why people become 
addicted to drugs and to help them conquer their addictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institutes for Health Research currently funds more 
than 300 researchers in the realm of drug research and 
pharmaceutical science for a total of some $20 million.  The 
investment supports a vast range of work, including 
investigations on the puzzle of drug addiction.  As with all 
Canadian health research initiatives, this work is collaborative 
involving teams of researchers across a range of disciplines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that our efforts to reduce drug abuse 
are carried out in an international context.  The United Nations 
international drug control program and the Inter-American Drug 
Abuse Control Commission have both urged governments to develop 
national frameworks to address the global drug problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supply and trafficking of illicit drugs, which feed our 
domestic demand, are very much international problems that demand 
co-ordinated action.  In addition to fulfilling our international 
commitments, we also work closely with other nations to see if we 
can apply their lessons learned to our own situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Langley—Abbotsford mentioned the drug trade 
between British Columbia and the United States.  The trade goes 
both ways across the border and it has to be stopped.  There is a 
co-ordinated border approach by police and revenue and customs. 
They are working together as teams to fight the problem on both 
sides of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health has taken the lead on Canada's drug 
strategy which is only fitting since drug use is, first and 
foremost, an issue of human health.  However it is also many 
other things, with economic, social, legal, judicial and public 
security dimensions included.  That is why he is grateful for the 
contributions of the many other partners who make the strategy 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Customs and Revenue Agency aims to stop the flow of 
illegal drugs across the border.  All of us have witnessed the 
drug dogs that are extremely competent at finding illicit 
contraband.  The solicitor general and the RCMP, who work so hard 
to get drugs off the streets, and the provinces and territories 
are all vital partners in all aspects of the strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many others too numerous to list, such as individuals, 
community groups, volunteers, government officials, researchers 
and countless others, who are doing their part to reduce the 
dangers of drug use in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context and on behalf of the Minister of Health I 
welcome the concerns of the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
As a government we have committed to continue the battle against 
illegal drug use.  Our efforts can only benefit renewed interest 
by a committee of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should hon. members vote to establish such a committee, I give 
my assurance that we will look forward to the committee's 
recommendations on new ways for the Government of Canada to help 
further reduce the dimensions of Canada's drug problem. 
At this point I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy that the government has agreed to go 
along with the motion and to establish the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution the government on some comments that were just made. 
It is probably necessary in the debate to say how much the 
government is doing and how well it is doing on this issue. 
However I can sincerely say that no one thinks we are doing 
enough.  The country has a serious drug problem in schools, 
homes, the workplace and recreation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might say that the government is working on comprehensive 
programs.  It has written documents and has a strategy, but not 
many people think it is working because it is not working.  That 
is why the parliamentary committee is so necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member opposite for his co-operation on the motion. 
Does the member have any statistical data that would tell us just 
how many people in Canada have died in the last two to three 
years from drug overdoses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure he knows the situation is escalating and that many 
individuals are in anguish today because someone in their family 
may be on drugs.  Does he believe the problem is escalating? Have 
any of these programs really done their job to date? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not personally aware 
of the actual number of people who may have succumbed to 
overdoses of drugs over the last two or three years.  I can 
simply say that one is too many.  I also agree that we have a 
problem.  That is why we are trying to address the problem with a 
multifaceted and co-ordinated approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 is before the House.  It would give our police forces 
the tools to fight organized crime.  All of us here would agree 
that organized criminal activity is behind much of the drug 
activity.  It requires a two pronged approach.  We have to 
approach the issue from a health perspective and the law 
enforcement perspective.  We will fight the war on drugs by 
working together and working with our international partners.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member mentioned illicit drugs coming into the country.  I was at 
a meeting not too long ago in my riding at which a representative 
of the provincial police force spoke.  When the meeting was 
opened up to questions, I asked the police officer if more drugs 
were coming into the country since the elimination of the port 
police.  As we know the government decided to eliminate all port 
police across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He thanked me for the question and said that I was the first 
person to ask that question.  He said they were having a terrible 
time at every port because there were no port police.  He said 
that with the removal of the port police the situation of illicit 
drugs entering the country should be looked at very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member that when the committee meets that it take 
a look at that situation.   I think we can make very positive 
changes if we bring back the port police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting 
factor which the committee should look at.  The elimination of 
the port police was a cost saving measure with the understanding 
that the existing municipal forces, the provincial police, as 
well as the RCMP could handle the situation in a co-ordinated 
approach.  If it is not working, then it is incumbent upon this 
committee to explore that avenue and bring recommendations back 
to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, since he is the 
parliamentary secretary for justice, I would like to ask him a 
question that relates to drugs in prison.  I know a fair bit 
about this and have watched it over the years.  Even today there 
are drug cartels in prisons, which is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that has always perplexed me is there are people going 
into prisons who are not addicted to drugs and coming out 
addicted.  There are a lot of drugs in prisons.  If we cannot 
stop that kind of drug activity in a prison where there are bars, 
razor wire and big walls to keep people out, how on earth will it 
be possible to stop the proliferation of drugs on the outside? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raises a very 
interesting concept which the man on the street finds hard to 
believe, that behind these custodial facilities there is a drug 
problem.  It is another area that the committee should look into. 
It is a question that might better be put to the solicitor 
general or the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general 
who have carriage of that aspect of our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fighting drugs in prisons.  Prisons have ion machines and 
searches are conducted.  There are some very unique ways in 
which contraband is brought into prisons.  One method is by 
placing contraband in human orifices.  It is a question of how 
far we go with our searches.  We will have to go further.  We 
will have to be militant and vigilant with the individuals who 
deal with these offenders, whether they are on day parole or 
something of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drugs are getting in somehow and we have to stop that flow.  We 
have to combat the whole situation within prisons, including 
diseases that can be communicated through drug use with needles. 
We have to fight it.  This is what the committee needs to look at 
to make proper recommendations to the government, and I am 
extremely positive that the government would move on these 
recommendations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
meaning of the amendment tabled by the government is not 
immediately clear.  Could you read the amendment tabled by the 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> The amendment says quite 
simply that instead of June 1, 2002, the date be November 1, 
2002. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
first like to congratulate the member for Langley—Abbotsford, 
myself.  I repeat, the Bloc Quebecois will support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would however, since we now have a French translation of the 
amendment, read the first part if I may for the people joining 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion tabled by the Canadian Alliance provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a special committee of the House be appointed to consider 
the factors underlying or relating to the non-medical use of 
drugs in Canada and make recommendations with respect to the 
ways or means by which the government can act, alone or in its 
relations with governments at other levels, in the reduction of 
the dimensions of the problem involved in such use; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make three comments on the wording proposed by 
our Canadian Alliance colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to sit on the committee.  I am the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in Montreal east, and drug use and traffic 
and shooting galleries are a reality there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not want the philosophy and work of the committee 
to be considered from a “law and order” perspective.  There are 
certain circumstances in which drug use is a problem.  There are 
others where it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened earlier to our colleague from Saint John.  She was 
getting in a bit of a state even before the work had begun.  I 
think we should issue a call for calm. 
She says that she herself did a study—picture it—on cannabis, and 
that smoking it automatically kills nine cells a second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that she will be so good as to table these studies, 
because this week the Canadian Medical Association—and with all 
due respect for the member for Saint John, I would be more 
inclined to go along with the Canadian Medical Association than 
her on these matters—asked that possession of marijuana for 
personal use be decriminalized because no studies had shown that 
it had any harmful effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, when it comes to heroin or other hard drugs, I think 
that a different attitude is in order. 
But I hope that in the committee's work—and I know that the 
member for Rosemont—Petit-Patrie also has an interest in these 
matters—there will be some leeway and that a “law and order” 
mentality will not prevail.  That is my first comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second comment is this.  In June of last year, the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois asked me to work in a group with the member 
for Longueuil and the member for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert on the 
whole issue of street prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited Vancouver.  I went to that part of the city where 
prostitution and drug use are rampant—I think it is called the 
middle east—and where there have been many problems.  I saw 
horrific scenes. 
I must admit, I never thought such a situation could exist in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, there are links between street prostitution and drug 
addiction.  Of course, the problem cannot be reduced to solely 
an effect of drug addiction, but there is a connection between 
the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I also hope that the parliamentary committee our 
colleague wishes to strike will have the necessary resources to 
carry out investigations.  Often, in my opinion, we rely on 
hearsay, on statements that often feed prejudice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we will have the full co-operation of the departments 
of justice and of health and that of Correctional Service 
Canada, so that we will have access to all available data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I recall that a certain amount of work has already been 
done.  Today is not the first time Canada and the provinces have 
addressed the consequences of drug use.  As long ago as 1969, we 
had the Le Dain Commission.  We need, I believe, to start with 
what has already been done.  There are other basic premises as 
well, of course, but I do believe we need to start with what has 
already been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our hon. colleague, the sponsor of the motion, has just 
made the statement that the Senate committee had restricted 
itself to cannabis.  I have looked into this, and the Senate 
committee did not limit itself to the cannabis issue.  It is 
engaged in an overview of the entire drug use situation in 
Canada.  This Senate committee, chaired by Senator Nolin, has a 
two-year mandate.  This is not something that can be done in a 
couple of days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if my political party, and that of the hon. member who 
sponsored the motion, would like to see the Senate abolished, we 
ought I think to take inspiration from its resources and the 
work its people are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to keep in mind that assessing the consequences of drug 
use cannot divorce this problem from the social considerations. 
We will also have to make a connection with poverty and with the 
meaning of life. It is interesting to see that there is often a 
connection between the use of drugs and an environment where 
poverty is prevalent. I hope that we will keep this in mind when 
the time comes to make recommendations and deal with these 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that the committee will have to examine is how 
effective the repressive approach has been so far. The motion 
reflects a degree of conservatism, in my opinion. It refers to 
drug use as if it were a phenomenon or a problem. However, its 
mover was very eloquent in concluding that, so far, the 
repressive approach has not been effective at all. 
It cannot be said that using this repressive approach, 
prohibiting drug use and making it a criminal offence have 
had much impact on the balance that we as parliamentarians are 
trying to establish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to deal with another important issue. Earlier, I 
wondered whether we should start from the framework proposed 
under the harm reduction strategy. This framework, with which 
Health Canada officials are familiar, is rather well defined. Of 
course, it is not a magical solution that automatically makes 
people stop using drugs, but it is a model for action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harm reduction strategy is based on three elements. There is 
recognition of the fact that there are people who have drug 
dependency problems. No moral judgment is made. No one says that 
it is good or bad. 
Rather, there is simply recognition of the fact that there are 
people who use drugs and that this makes them dysfunctional and 
can even adversely affect the communities in which they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, three, four or five years can elapse between the time when 
this is recognized and the time when these people actually stop 
using drugs, particularly soft drugs.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be done to ensure that drugs are used under the safest 
conditions possible for the user and his surroundings?  The 
safest possible surroundings means that dirty needles are not 
used or shared among users, that there are places to inject 
safely and to exchange needles and that the needles are 
recovered and cannot be used in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the model proposed under the harm reduction strategy. 
This model is known to the various interveners, especially 
people in the regional boards and those in the health field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another statistic we should bear in mind in doing our 
work.  According to police data, data available from the various 
police forces, the RCMP, the SPCUM and the Sûreté du Québec, 
barely 1% of drugs on the market are intercepted.  This means of 
course that there is a whole element of drug use and of drug 
trafficking that is totally beyond police control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to various police data, somewhere between 1% and 10% 
of narcotics are intercepted by the police.  Should we not 
conclude there is some link between the prohibitionist strategy 
that has been followed now for several decades and the fact that 
the police have been unable to stop drug traffickers?  The 
committee should look at this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to remind the House that, in our consideration of 
drug use, we should make a distinction between cannabis and 
heroin or other hard drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, a Canadian Alliance member introduced a bill. I know 
that we may not name members but, since I do not know the name 
of his riding, allow me to disregard the standing orders for 30 
seconds.  I am referring to the member who is a doctor, who ran 
for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance, and who is a friend 
of the leader of that party.  On April 26, 1999, he introduced 
Bill C-503 to decriminalize simple possession of marijuana.  I 
would ask the member who moved the motion today whether he 
supports the bill introduced by his colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my party, the member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie also moved a 
motion, which was voted on, in which he urged parliamentarians 
to decriminalize the use of cannabis for medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that today's motion is about the use of drugs for 
non-medical purposes; that is very clear in the motion.  Should 
we admit from the outset that cannabis should be treated 
differently than other drugs?  In all likelihood, there is no 
harm associated with moderate consumption.  The Canadian Medical 
Association reminded us that there is scientific evidence to 
support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is so much for the premise.  I am grateful to the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford for moving this motion. 
As parliamentarians, we are capable of taking an objective look 
at this issue. Obviously, when I talk about an objective look, I 
realize that we all have our own moral values regarding drugs. 
However, as parliamentarians, we cannot impose those morals on 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we will be guided in our work by two main concerns: 
the safety of communities and the issue of crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, questions have to be asked about the current 
repressive approach, which has been in effect for 50 years, has 
created a sizeable black market and has led to clashes within 
the world of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995, there have been at least 147 victims of motorcycle 
gang turf wars.  Battles over territory are most certainly 
connected with establishing areas in which they can sell drugs. 
These are all matters we need to bear in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure our Alliance colleague that the Bloc Quebecois will 
make a very serious contribution to this committee.  I do not 
know whether the Canadian Alliance agrees with the amendment 
presented by the government on the reporting date of November, 
but we will have an opportunity to discuss that.  I am also 
going to look at this with the leader of my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do, however, believe that there is considerable consensus in 
this House on the striking of this committee.  I trust that it 
will have all possible means available to it in order to do 
quality work and, therefore, draft informed recommendations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleague, yes, we agree with the 
date change.  It is a friendly amendment because it would allow 
us over the summer of 2002 to look at that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in response to my colleague, yes, there are probably 
members of this party and every party in the House who think 
marijuana should be looked at in terms of legalization or 
decriminalization.  That is one of the reasons politicians in 
Canada are so reluctant to talk about drugs, as we are doing here 
today for the first time in decades.  It is because they do not 
want to answer the question of whether marijuana should be 
legalized.  That is one of the things that should be within the 
scope of the committee.  A lot of people out there and in the 
House have yet to form an opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member brought up the issue of prostitution and 
suggested that it was correlated to drugs.  He said that 
prostitution and drugs were cause and effect.  I have accompanied 
the Vancouver police and have looked through facilities where 
drug addicts and prostitutes live.  I can tell hon. members that 
the average person would not put a dog in those kinds of places. 
They are rat infested, terrible, dilapidated places with used 
needles and condoms lying around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague think prostitutes are criminals or victims of 
the drug trade? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have had an interest in 
prostitution for the past five years.  The answer will be more 
nuanced than the question.  Could I have calm please.  Those who 
want to take part in the debate should do so responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In certain cases, prostitutes, also known as sex workers, are 
definitely victims, because they did not choose this work, 
because they are under the control of a pimp, because they are 
beaten and because society is prejudiced.  The state of the law 
prevents prostitution from being considered real work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all members in this House that, when prostitutes are 
assaulted, they cannot call in the police; since they operate 
clandestinely and the whole context of prostitution is 
criminal—there is a legislative framework—prostitutes are often 
victims.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example that comes from personal experience. In 
1995, a meeting took place in my office to discuss the issue of 
prostitution. Among the sex trade workers who were present, 
there was a former page of the House of Commons, a person who 
had worked here as a page in 1993-94. At the time, I was a young 
member of parliament; I remember her well. So, this was a few 
years later. She had gone to university. She came from a well to 
do traditional family, but she had chosen the sex trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about prostitution, we must not have preconceived 
ideas or be biased. 
The reality of prostitution is not black and white. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, it is true that there is a very real connection 
between drug dependency and prostitution. I hope that, as 
parliamentarians, we will have a debate on prostitution. We 
should clearly recognize that prostitutes are people, like 
everybody else. However, prostitutes must, on their part, 
recognize that they cannot operate anywhere, any time and any 
way they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may remember that in June 2000, in south central 
Montreal, and more specifically in the riding of the Bloc 
Quebecois leader, there was a confrontation between local 
residents and sex trade workers. The public too is entitled to a 
certain quality of life. People should not have to put up with 
disgraceful scenes in front of their homes.  We will have to 
provide a legislative framework for prostitution, something that 
is sorely lacking right now. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, prostitution is a serious 
issue in Canada.  The many prostitutes I have talked to were all 
drug addicted and were all very young children.  It is sad to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does my colleague think about the effectiveness of our 
court system?  I will give one of the hundreds of examples of 
which I know.  A fellow was caught with drugs worth a street 
value of $366,000.  He was on social assistance as many such 
people are.  He was given one day in jail.  His track record goes 
back to 1972 and includes dozens of convictions for things such 
as possession of a restricted drug, possession of narcotics, 
trafficking, importing narcotics, cultivation of narcotics and on 
and on it goes.  After all these convictions the fellow received 
just one day in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member:  What is wrong with our justice system 
today?  Why do sentences not escalate according to the number of 
convictions?  It seems very erratic.  Criminal records for some 
individuals go back years and years and yet they have been given 
five days, ten days, nothing, suspended sentences and so on.  It 
is an erratic approach in our court system.  Does that not aid 
and abet the drug problem? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the only comment that comes to mind 
is a wish.  When an adolescent is sentenced, I do not think that 
incarceration alone is the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is of course familiar with our views on young 
offenders.  I do not think that our views on street prostitution 
are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to many prostitutes, and I have done so often in 
recent months.  When someone is 16 years old and walking the 
streets, this should be of concern to us socially.  Naturally, 
there is an element of personal responsibility. 
I do not think we should exclude individual responsibility, but 
I am not convinced that repression, incarceration and heavier 
sentences are the automatic solutions certain members of this 
House may think.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, when the member gives examples of repeat 
offenders for whom rehabilitation has obviously not worked, I 
think there are certain circumstances where we must face the 
facts and that some people must be put behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not automatically maintain that 
rehabilitation is always the answer, but we do not wish to 
conceal our view that there should be a very serious attempt, 
particularly for those who are 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 years of 
age, to rehabilitate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not talking necessarily 
about putting these people behind bars, but I wonder if my 
colleague could talk about what could be done to break the cycle 
of addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people have no qualms about stealing or robbing because 
they must have a fix, in particular of heroin and other addictive 
drugs, is there not a point where we must get these people into 
detox and rehabilitation and out of that cycle? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes.  We must 
consider the background and all the variables, but the member is 
right.  In certain cases, we must get these people out of this 
cycle and put them behind bars.  There are cases were a sentence 
is indicated, where it is the approach to consider.

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased, as always when I get an opportunity to speak in the 
Chamber, to take part in the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are voting on whether to strike a special committee of the 
House to investigate factors underlying or relating to the 
non-medicinal use of drugs in Canada and to make recommendations 
regarding ways the government can act, alone or in relation with 
governments at other levels, to reduce the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is timely in the sense that we see in the newspapers 
and on television an increasing interest in it.  There was an 
article yesterday in one of the Ottawa newspapers outlining the 
pros and cons of decriminalization.  Last night counterSpin on 
CBC television devoted its hour to vigorous debate, as it usually 
does, on the pros and cons of decriminalizing some of the softer 
drugs, particularly marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with a synopsis of what Dr. John Hoey, the editor 
of the <I>Canadian Medical Association Journal</I>, had to say on 
the subject.  He said recreational use had proven fairly harmless 
over the years but that he was increasingly concerned, as are 
many folks in the Canadian Medical Association, about simple 
possession and personal use leading to a criminal offence being 
left on a person's record throughout his or her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the CMA take the position that possession for 
personal use should by decriminalized.  According to Dr. Hoey 
there are minimal negative effects to the estimated 1.5 million 
Canadians who use marijuana in a recreational way.  He says the 
real harm is the legal and social fallout from charges of 
possession for personal use.  He adds that 50% of all drug 
arrests are for simple possession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting that members of parliament recently received 
a little pocketbook from Statistics Canada, “Canada at a 
Glance”.  It was sent out in connection with the May 15 census 
day. 
According to the section on law enforcement, we are at a 20 year 
low in terms of criminal code offences.  In virtually every 
category but two, and there are roughly 12, there are decreases, 
many substantial.  For example, property crimes went down by 
14.7% between 1994 and 1999.  Sexual assault was off by almost a 
quarter in the same period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are two exceptions.  There was a slight increase 
in motor vehicle theft between 1994 and 1999.  It went up 1.2%. 
Drug charges went up a whopping 32.8%, almost a one-third per 
cent increase, from just over 60,000 charges in 1994 to just 
under 80,000 charges in 1999, the last year for which statistics 
are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly Dr. Hoey and others are saying that there is a problem. 
If it is true that 50% of charges, which would be some 40,000, 
are for possession for personal use, then there is a clear 
problem and a clear mandate for parliament to look at the issue 
in a serious way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not a member of parliament in 1996 but it is unfortunate 
that an opportunity at that point to strike a special committee 
in both Houses to examine the issue was turned down.  It was 
voted down and rejected for whatever reason.  I have not yet had 
time to investigate why but it was turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, a Senate special committee on illegal drugs is well 
underway.  It is scheduled to report next August.  That would be 
several months before the amended date that has been proposed, 
which is November 2002.  It is unfortunate that we will be 
duplicating what the other place is doing if we agree to support 
this.  As far as I understand, all parties in the House are 
supportive of the motion of the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect we will be attracting the same experts to come and 
testify and will be meeting many of the same people.  It is 
unfortunate, when people are concerned about spending money 
wisely, that we did not seize the initiative in 1996 and have one 
committee rather than two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special committee on illegal drugs being run by the other 
place has quite a comprehensive series of references.  It refers 
to the Le Dain commission which began its work in 1969 and 
finished in 1972.  Virtually 30 years later we are still debating 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Le Dain commission, we may recall, held serious 
consultations on the negative impact of Canadian drug policy in 
the late 1960s and early 1970s.  It focused mainly on the 
non-medical use of drugs.  It concluded that hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians found guilty of prohibited drug possession 
saw their personal freedom restrained for the rest of their lives 
because of a criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission also concluded that the huge police resources 
used to fight prohibited drug trafficking and consumption were 
aimed mainly at young people.  Under the circumstances, the Le 
Dain commission recommended that sanctions against drug users be 
gradually eliminated, that the use of marijuana be decriminalized 
and that control methods other than criminal justice sanctions be 
used. 
That was the essence of what Le Dain had to say 30 years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, the U.S. national academy of sciences' institute 
of medicine published the results of a study commissioned by the 
white house director of drug control policy.  The study dealt 
with the medical use of marijuana, which I appreciate is not part 
of the debate today.  It is interesting that despite this 
academic finding the U.S. supreme court recently voted 8 to 0 
against allowing the medical use of marijuana.  I am pleased that 
is not the position of the government opposite and that we are 
proceeding along.  The government's position is commendable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about decriminalizing marijuana.  To refer to 
the member for Langley—Abbotsford, we are not saying that there 
should be no offences for use but that we should take it out of 
the criminal code.  Even the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police acknowledges that it makes sense to decriminalize 
possession of small quantities of drugs, including heroin, 
without actually legalizing them.  That is one side of the issue 
but there are at least two sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half the editorial page in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> dealt with 
the current city of Ottawa police chief who says that the 
decriminalization of marijuana or soft drugs for personal use is 
not a road he wants to go down.  He sees the effects of drug 
abuse each and every day and says that it attacks the fabric of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He argues that marijuana and other cannabis products have much 
higher levels of THC than they did in the 1960s and 1970s.  I do 
not know whether that is the case.  Someone on counterSpin 
last night argued very vigorously that it was not.  It is 
something the special committee could look at if the resolution 
passes.  I suspect it is something the Senate committee will look 
at or may already have looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of other points are worth making.  I wonder, given that 
we are going down a slightly different path than the United 
States, how much flexibility Canada will be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the last year stories have come out of British Columbia 
about police departments looking the other way with regard to 
small amounts of drug use.  However we have also heard and read 
stories about American law enforcement officials prepared to 
chase suspected drug users beyond the Washington border into 
British Columbia and try to force the Canadian government to take 
a stronger position against drug use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the relationship between Canada and the United States, the 
front page of today's Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> features an 
interesting story about how high tech military spies in Ottawa 
have joined the United States' war on drugs by eavesdropping on 
South American drug lords.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With globalization and the intertwinement of our two countries, 
one wonders how much freedom Canada will actually have in areas 
like this.  We obviously know that the current U.S. president and 
most of his predecessors have been very hawkish on trying to 
eliminate the importation of drugs into the United States.  One 
could hardly imagine that they would take a softer policy north 
of the 49th than they would take south in Mexico, the Caribbean 
and Central and South America. That would be something which 
would merit attention by any special subcommittee that is 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to make reference to my colleague, the member 
for Vancouver East, who has spoken out on the subject of drugs 
and the particular plight of people in her constituency in the 
downtown Vancouver area.  She has been pressing the government on 
its response to the health crisis that results from drug use, its 
over use and the safety of citizens.  In fact the member has 
raised this issue ever since she arrived in the House in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She reported that there are experts out there, including from 
the city of Vancouver, but the leadership and action on this 
issue over a long period of time has been so slow.  She has 
called on the Minister of Health to adopt multi-centre heroin 
prescription trials, safe injection sites and better housing and 
social support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the things the member for Langley—Abbotsford 
asked the colleague from the Bloc about when he referred to the 
places where users lived.  They were places in which we would not 
want to put a dog.  I am sure that that is absolutely true and 
something that needs to be looked at.  Perhaps if we were to take 
some progressive steps here we could get beyond some of those 
deplorable conditions that exist now and make not only the users 
safer but the non-users and the people who are on the streets 
safer.  We think, and my colleague from Vancouver East believes, 
it would reduce crime.  We have seen examples of that in places 
like Europe and Australia, which have been a little more 
avant-garde than Canadian politicians have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the New Democratic Party welcomes the opportunity 
to debate this issue.  We will support it.  We regret that a 
special committee of both Houses of parliament was not struck in 
1996 when this matter came up.  It seems that the Senate is 
already well down this investigative road on the illegal or legal 
use of drugs or the decriminalization thereof.  We are just 
starting down this road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we cannot go back to 1996.  It is unfortunate 
we did not have one committee.  We will now have two, but we will 
be supportive of this policy and this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am encouraged by the very productive and non-partisan 
approach that members in the House are taking.  I would like to 
commend the former speaker for his comments.  I noted he brought 
forward again the Le Dain report, which many of us recall, and 
the recommendation in that very significant but overlooked 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of gradually reducing the penalties on illicit drug 
use is of course a contentious matter, but would the member have 
any initial views on the non-criminalization and the elimination 
of penalties for the use of these drugs? 
I ask the question based on comments that I think many of us have 
received from constituents.  Certainly these are comments that I 
have received from constituents when I served in the Manitoba 
provincial legislature where I represented an urban riding. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments go along very generally like this.  If all 
presently illegal drugs were legalized and the distribution 
properly controlled, there would be no incentive to rob and 
otherwise injure law-abiding citizens.  Then we could divert 
resources from law enforcement to more intensive social services 
to get to the root of the problem. Has the member any further 
comments to add on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there were a couple of 
parts to that question.  Let me deal with some additional 
thoughts on the Le Dain Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gerald Le Dain, who headed the commission, held serious 
consultations on the negative impacts of the Canadian drug policy 
back in the late 1960s, which focused mainly on the non-medical 
use of drugs.  As the member would know, he was the former dean 
of the Osgoode Hall Law School of the University of Toronto and 
former justice of the supreme court.  He took the view that 
politicians were the ones to blame over the years for not seizing 
the initiatives on this issue at the beginning of the 1970s.  In 
fact in an interview about three years ago Mr. Le Dain stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a hot potato for all the parties and they didn't want to 
run any risk.  The position adopted by the politicians was to do 
nothing.  We saw at the hearings the public was worried about 
their kids.  The public saw those current laws as a tremendous 
injustice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all parties and all governments stand accused of not 
doing this.  It is unfortunate that time has elapsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the decriminalization of all drugs, I am not an 
expert.  I would hope and think that would be part of this study.  I 
tend to agree that we should decriminalize marijuana.  That 
happens to be our party's policy. I really do not have a view on 
whether we should decriminalize ecstasy, or heroin or cocaine. I 
suspect we are dealing with more addictive drugs, at least that 
is what I am given to understand.  That would be something a 
special committee of the House would look at, and I rather 
suspect the other place is looking at that as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member from Fraser Valley 
spoke about the drug problem primarily in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Palliser tell us about the various types of 
drug problems in his province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I can 
pull them out, but I have seen some statistics that would suggest 
drug use in Saskatchewan is just a little under the national 
average and quite a bit lower than it would be in British 
Columbia, Quebec and perhaps one or two other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all jurisdictions, I think people who tend to be more 
vulnerable, the young and the poor, would use these drugs.  We 
probably would see a greater percentage of use by native people 
and perhaps newcomers to Canada.  Regardless of the percentage of 
use in a province or jurisdiction, there would probably be an 
overarching group of people who would be most vulnerable and 
likely to use these drugs more than others.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us not kid ourselves.  This is not an issue 
about a certain type of individual.  I know children from fairly 
wealthy families who are addicted.  I know men and women who have 
children who are addicted.  This is not something where we will 
look for a certain type of individual, whether they are new to 
Canada or have been around Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about people from middle and upper income families. 
Their children are on the street right now selling themselves. As 
I said before, they are right now shooting between their toes 
because there is no other place in their arms to shoot up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just about the legalization of marijuana.  This is 
about cocaine, ecstasy, LSD and heroin.  It is about things that 
kill and addict people.  That is what the committee has to 
wrestle with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for the hon. member who just spoke is this. 
Could he explain in his own words the idea of rehabilitation and 
the types of facilities for that?  For instance, in British 
Columbia there are scant few detox facilities.  There are very 
few intermediate ones.  There may be one long term rehabilitation 
facility in all of British Columbia.  Considering there are over 
8,000 heroin addicts alone in Vancouver that is virtually 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of resources in terms of rehabilitation does he think 
this country needs?  I know it will have to be part of the study 
we will be involved in.  I do not know if there are many in his 
province, but I know they are ridiculously low and virtually 
non-existent in mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I answer the last 
question, I did not mean to suggest that there are not people in 
all strata of our society who do not have a problem with 
recreational drugs, abuse and addiction too.  Maybe there was 
some misunderstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said was it seemed to me to be more prevalent in people 
who were the more vulnerable in our society.  I agree with what 
he said.  Those of us who have seen the award winning movie 
<I>Traffic</I> would see that it strikes at all levels of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to detox centres, yes we do have some in 
Saskatchewan.  I doubt there are enough.  I imagine there is a 
paucity of these in all jurisdictions in the country.  However I 
would hope that part of any study done by the House would look 
into that in detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just on that point, the provinces deliver health care.  We must 
work with the provincial and territorial jurisdictions to find 
out what is currently available and what we think needs to be 
done collectively to address any shortage of detox centres. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the Chamber to take part in 
this very important debate.  I commend the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford again for his diligence and his perseverance 
in bringing this issue forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated, the motion calls upon the House to consider 
the factors underlying and relating to the non-medical use of 
drugs in Canada, to make recommendations, to put this matter into 
the hands of an all party committee and to report within a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we can all acknowledge this is a massive undertaking, 
it is perhaps one of the most fundamental things we can do in a 
positive fashion to look for solutions to a very complicated and 
multifaceted problem facing many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is one which is broad enough in its terms of 
reference, but I have some concerns with respect to a current 
motion and a current committee that is undertaking a similar 
exercise.  That committee of course is in the other place and is 
chaired by Senator Nolin.  The issue is receiving considerable 
study. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exercise being done in the other place is not limited to 
marijuana.  It is in fact quite broad in its scope.  The purpose 
of the study, similar to what the motion proposes, is to look at 
all the symptoms and causes.  It calls for broad consultations 
with stakeholders in order to delve into the indirect harms and 
costs of illicit drugs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs far outweigh the direct financial cost when we begin 
breaking it down.  It is symptomatic of some of the broader 
social ills and vices that exist.  Drugs and alcohol are in many 
instances escapism.  They are used in an attempt to get away from 
the toils, the mundane and the horrors that exist in people's 
lives or to escape from a past that may have included a sexual 
assault or a terrible incident of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug and alcohol abuse are like a cancer that eats away at 
productivity in Canada.  People who are addicted to drugs or 
alcohol cannot realistically reach their potential or make 
contributions to society.  It is almost trite to say that the 
impact is so broad that for many it becomes a question of where 
to start.  The type of study we would undertake would certainly 
be a step in the right direction to finding out where to go, what 
direction we should be taking and where we should be 
concentrating our efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many problems of this magnitude, simply putting 
resources into existing services or attempting to address the 
problem will not suffice.  We need to be focused in our direction 
when searching for a strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms of reference of the committee in the other place, 
which has been studying this issue since November 1998, say that 
the most direct harm occurs in high risk populations, such as 
injecting drug users, street youth, the inner city core and 
natives.  That is almost a penetrating statement of the obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indigenous Canadians are facing huge problems in their 
community.  Their reliance on or addiction to drugs and alcohol 
has had devastating effects.  Between 65% and 80% of aboriginal 
people have a drug problem.  This has been one of the leading 
causes of death among the Inuit and native peoples. Injury and 
poisoning, with patterns of violent death, are three to four 
times greater than the national average when one starts to look 
at the drug problems and their costs in terms of human lives. 
Many meet unnatural deaths while drinking.  Compared with 45% of 
non-natives, alcohol or drug involvement is the primary cause of 
death and is five times greater for natives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suicide rate for native children on reserves in Saskatchewan 
is 27 times higher than for other Canadian children.  Native 
youth have a two to six times greater risk of an alcohol related 
problem than their counterparts in the rest of the country.  We 
will not even get into the massive problem of fetal alcohol 
syndrome, which is also symptomatic of this greater challenge 
that we have in helping our native Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mention of street youth and adolescents who leave home to 
escape physical, emotional and sexual abuse or neglect is again 
very acute, not only in metropolitan big cities but is becoming a 
problem in rural small town communities. 
Sometimes it is a symptom of boredom and a symptom of youth who 
are looking for an outlet of sorts.  They are looking for 
something to pique their imagination or to give them some form of 
entertainment in a mundane life.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why many members and many Canadians are looking for more 
active attention and more acute focus on programs such as sports, 
recreation, music and arts as outlets for young people's energies 
and ingenuity, rather than in sad cases falling upon the use of 
drugs and alcohol as a form of recreational escape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with some encouragement that we in the House again delve 
into this issue and not try to skirt the thorny or hot potato 
political aspects of decriminalizing marijuana.  We are at a 
point where we can move beyond.  We want to start looking at the 
hard core addictive types of drugs and the effects they are 
having on our youth and all other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decriminalizing element and the medical use of marijuana are 
starting to become destigmatized.  Chiefs of police and police 
officers are generally acknowledging that too much effort is 
being put into soft drugs as opposed to hard drugs such as 
heroin, acid, LSD and cocaine.  In my home community in Pictou 
county there is a rash of availability of a highly addictive and 
destructive chemically manufactured drug called dilaudid.  This 
is where the real cost in human lives and health seems to be 
spiralling out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very much linked to another subject matter we have had 
before us in recent days and months, organized crime. Because of 
the demand and the profitability organized crime chooses to prey 
upon a person's vulnerabilities and addictions.  This is where 
much of our focal point should be in terms of law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to suggest in any way that it is a simple problem. 
It is a multifaceted problem.  It will not only require giving 
police the tools and the resources.  It will require a very 
concentrated and far reaching effort throughout health 
professionals, the courts, the education system and social 
services.  Young people need to be made aware of their 
alternatives, as opposed to being addicted to drugs and involved 
in that sordid lifestyle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate over the non-medical use of drugs is something that 
is long overdue.  Other members have commented on the fact that 
there have been various studies and attempts in the past to 
wrestle with this very thorny issue.  This is a wonderful 
non-partisan opportunity for us to wrap our arms around the 
motion and get the appropriate individuals and representatives to 
participate in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution again about the risk of duplication.  Much of the 
exercise has begun and is continuing in the other place.  It is 
unfortunate that there is not some way to combine our efforts and 
tap into the research and the work that have been done already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government is offering exemptions from prosecution to persons 
with serious illnesses who grow or use marijuana.  Approximately 
210 people have obtained these types of exemptions.  There is a 
case involving a gentleman by the name of James Wakeford who is 
now seeking to force the federal government to supply him with a 
safe and consistent supply of marijuana.  He believes it is safer 
to be able to buy a supply of marijuana from the government.  We 
know there have been steps taken in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Saskatchewan is at the forefront of this area. 
The Prairie Plant System in Saskatchewan has won a five year $5.7 
million contract from the government to supply marijuana for 
medical and research purposes by next year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one concern about the actual effect of marijuana use.  It 
appears there may be some research lacking in the health risks 
associated with that particular drug. Higher levels of THC and a 
higher risk of carcinogenesis can result from marijuana being 
taken into a person's system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of controversy on this issue south of the border. 
The efforts and the resources that the Americans have put into 
this issue are astronomical by comparison.  In terms of the money 
alone, the drug strategy and the efforts of law enforcement by 
our American neighbours as compared to what we are doing in 
Canada truly pales by comparison.  Arguably we may be moving in a 
different direction, one that is aimed more at the root of the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States supreme court ruled just this past week 
against the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes and 
struck down existing regimes in California, Arizona and a handful 
of other states that had held referendums on the subject matter 
of distribution.  This is in sharp contrast with what we have 
seen and the growing trend that exists in Canada where the 
government has taken steps toward legalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note that this week the <I>Canadian 
Medical Journal</I> called for the decriminalization of marijuana. 
It clearly stated on the record that this was its position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that policing has moved in more recent years toward 
focusing on the real criminals, those who distribute the drugs 
and those who exploit children who are prone to using all types 
of drugs, not just marijuana or hashish.  It is a complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Vancouver, where the mover of the motion has focused much of 
his commentary, the police themselves are deeply divided over a 
departmental policy of not recommending charges in connection 
with marijuana growing operations.  The focus is now on shutting 
down the operations while allowing the growers in some cases to 
go free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are large hydroponic operations on the west coast and we 
are seeing those cropping up in places around the country.  There 
is a huge market in the United States.  Statistics indicate that 
of the top three or four products being exported out of the 
province of British Columbia, marijuana is in the top three or 
four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2000, Growbusters, a team of Vancouver patrol officers set up 
specifically to deal with this problem, had not recommended 
charges against suspects even though it had raided over 100 
growing operations in that past year.  It simply seized the 
plants, the equipment and, in some cases, the home.  It had city 
engineers shut off power so it could shut down some of these 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regular drug squads continue to recommend charges.  This 
controversy of deciding how to deal with this growing problem 
under the current laws goes down to the police level.  It brings 
up the question of whether this is an effective or even legal 
problem as much as something that we should be looking at in 
broader terms, particularly in health terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the point that I know other members have 
contemplated as well.  Should we be focusing our efforts in terms 
of incarceration in clinics that are akin to prison where the 
individual cannot leave voluntarily?  It would be a treatment 
facility as opposed to warehousing drug users and drug addicts. 
In some cases the drug dealers themselves are hopelessly 
addicted. Selling drugs to feed their habit is what has fed their 
appetite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we be putting greater emphasis on rehabilitating and 
treating as an illness those who are hopelessly addicted rather 
than putting them, cold turkey in most instances, into prisons 
with other criminals?  That is another problem in terms of the 
availability of drugs in prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something many Canadians wrestle with.  The stigma of 
being an addict as opposed to being a criminal is sometimes 
inextricable.  However there is this health element and this 
addictive quality that exists around the use of marijuana and the 
use of many of these substances.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 in Vancouver only one in five growers who did wind up 
before the courts received jail sentences.  Most received fines. 
In approximately a third of the warrants executed, viable 
suspects were found at the scene and yet were released without 
charges.  That creates a certain friction in information sharing. 
Sometimes police forces take a different attitude toward how they 
deal with those involved in the illicit drug trade.  In defence 
of the Vancouver police, there are reportedly over 7,000 
marijuana growing operations in Vancouver alone.  There are 
simply not enough police or legal resources to deal with the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With inconsistencies occurring in police forces, though, it is 
obvious that we have to study this from all angles and come up 
with a very thoughtful, cohesive, national plan that creates a 
balance between law and order and health issues, a strategy that 
will be pragmatic and achievable.  Many experts in the field 
possess the know-how.  We should be trying to draw upon those 
experts who have specific knowledge of the addiction and health 
aspects of this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Conservative Party's position that the 
decriminalization of marijuana for medical purposes is a step in 
the right direction.  Reliance by many in society on drugs, both 
legal and illegal, is accompanied by these heavy social and 
economic costs.  Neither legalization nor increased criminal 
sanctions will fully address the complexities of drug abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that other parties have taken a similar approach.  The 
mover of this motion and the Canadian Alliance Party also support 
decriminalization of marijuana for medical purposes, although it 
is interesting that it was not in the party platform.  That 
election platform did include things such as zero tolerance for 
illegal drugs in federal prisons, which I think is also a part of 
this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In red book 3, the Liberal Party promised that a Liberal 
government would implement a national drug strategy to reduce 
both the supply of and demand for drugs.  Here is an opportunity 
to do that.  Here is the impetus, the stepping off point.  We 
hope that statement is an indication of some consistency, perhaps 
for a change, on this particular issue, that there will be 
support and that the support will be forthcoming in the form of 
support for this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These problems do require a variety of measures in seeking 
solutions.  They include education, treatment, health and 
rehabilitative efforts and government regulations.  There is no 
denying that the government does have a responsibility to make 
laws and to adjust laws in some instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with marijuana itself is that it has become more 
potent in recent years.  It is imperative that extensive studies 
be undertaken to ensure that any proposed use of drugs will not 
lead to an increase in health and social problems or even an 
increase in its availability to minors.  It is an area in which 
government regulation will be required.  The status quo simply 
will not suffice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Progressive Conservative Party can be 
summarized in a quotation from a former Progressive Conservative 
senator, Duncan Jessiman, who stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making the mere possession and use of drugs a criminal offence 
has not in any way reduced the use and abuse of drugs.  The 
present system breeds crime.  It is imperative that a new 
approach be found and it is my view that the use and abuse of 
drugs must be treated as a health problem. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless it is obvious that this issue of the medical use of 
marijuana cannot be addressed without discussion of the problems 
related to the use of other illicit drugs.  The area of bigger, 
more lethal and more highly addictive narcotics is, in my view, 
perhaps the area we should be concentrating on most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of drugs in the country is extremely widespread now.  I 
again commend the hon. member for bringing this forward so that 
we have the opportunity to push this matter on the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned, the senate committee is doing a widespread study, 
arguably in a perhaps less partisan atmosphere.  I feel that the 
commons committee might work with it or at least co-ordinate 
efforts in such a way that we all could work together for the 
solutions that we all seek.  It certainly merits greater 
attention.  It is certainly an opportunity which the Progressive 
Conservative Party very much hopes to be a part of.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I want to ask him to develop 
the theme he raised, which is that we may be going in a slightly 
different direction than the Americans are.  I agree with him 
very much on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our speeches we both raised the fact that the U.S. supreme 
court has taken a very different position on the use of marijuana 
for medical purposes.  Last week the justices voted 8 to 0 
against allowing it.  We have gone in a different direction in 
this country.  I think some 400,000 Canadians have been 
designated to use marijuana for medicinal purposes.  There does 
seem to be some science that goes with it to suggest that this is 
a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the broader idea of taking a direction that is 
different from the American direction, I do not want to bring up 
politics, but the member's party and our party have a different 
view of free trade.  It is my contention that globalization and 
NAFTA are placing greater impositions from the United States on 
Canadians and Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to go in a significantly different direction than the 
Americans would appear to be going—and there is nothing to 
indicate that they are about to decriminalize anything related to 
so-called soft drugs—I wonder how much latitude we would 
actually be given as a country.  I would be interested in the 
member's comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for 
the question.  It is something that I quite frankly had not 
contemplated because I do not see the drug trade as being 
directly related to free trade, although there are certainly 
implications whenever a country such as ours, which does so much 
trade with the United States, takes a radically different policy 
position.  There are inevitable implications of such a move. 
There are implications on all sorts of issues, including trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has very clearly stated by virtue of its 
supreme court decision and by virtue of the amount of time, 
resources and effort it puts into drug enforcement, that it will 
not change any time soon.   In fact, statistics show that in the 
United States the annual cost to the federal, state and municipal 
levels of government is over $30 billion.  This is absolutely 
staggering when we consider what we spend in this country.  Yet 
what levels of success are the Americans achieving compared to 
our own? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach is obviously important.  It is my belief, and I 
think it is shared by many, including the hon. member, that the 
focal point should be on the health aspect, not necessarily on 
going after the small users and those who are using perhaps 
softer elements of narcotics.  There should be a clear dividing 
line between the suppliers and those who are using these very 
addictive and very destructive types of drugs that alter a 
person's life completely and in some cases irretrievably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his question.  It is an important 
part of the debate to compare both what is happening in other 
countries and the implications for the approach we might take in 
the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate today on the 
Canadian Alliance supply motion brought forward by the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin my remarks by pointing out that there 
seems to be little doubt that Canada's approach to illicit drugs 
over the past few decades has been a dismal failure.  I sincerely 
believe we need to start looking objectively and openly at new 
approaches to combat this very serious and complex problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that there has been a failure in our drug policy, I 
do not point at any one particular agency or indeed any 
particular political party. 
I think we have all been a part of this failure.  Our reluctance 
to look at genuine efforts to improve and change the system is a 
very important part of that failure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the onset of my comments I would also like to commend to 
members a reading of the special report that the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> put out in September 2000.  It was a report by Dan 
Gardner entitled “Losing the War on Drugs”.  The first line 
indicates that for decades the United States led a global battle 
against illicit drugs.  The results have been catastrophic.  It 
is very important to read that report to get an understanding of 
some of the issues.  One may or may not agree with the 
conclusions the writer reaches, but certainly I commend the 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to state that we have to recall that drug addicts 
are human beings.  Whether they have brought this condition upon 
themselves or whether they are victims, they are human beings 
worthy of respect.  They come from all types of homes and 
economic backgrounds and from all parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own riding of Provencher is a conservative, primarily rural 
riding.  We do not have prostitutes in the streets of our 
communities.  The hard drug problem and indeed even the soft drug 
problem are by and large silent and hidden, but I think there are 
ominous threats that will affect even relatively serene rural 
parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point to the threat of methamphetamine, which is working 
its way through the United States and becoming more of a problem 
in Canada.  As the minister of justice in Manitoba, I had 
occasion to work with American law enforcement agencies that have 
dealt with the horrendous problem of methamphetamine.  In some of 
the seminars I attended and the discussions in which I took part, 
I was advised that in the state of California 90% of the child 
welfare apprehensions are related to methamphetamine abuse and 
many police officers and child care workers investigating these 
situations do not even realize that methamphetamine is at the 
root of some of these problems in terms of the immediate drug 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This very dangerous drug is finding its way not only across the 
United States but into Canada.  For those of us who think that 
heroin, cocaine and other drug problems are largely an urban, 
large city problem, methamphetamine should be a wake-up call for 
police forces in rural areas, because its use appears to be 
growing primarily in rural ridings and among blue collar, 
Caucasian individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we tend to see a drug problem as belonging to another 
economic or racial group.  There can certainly be very general 
categories when it comes to that, but I think it is important to 
remember that the problem of hard drugs ultimately affects 
everyone, no matter what racial background we are, no matter what 
economic background we are from and no matter where we live in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though a riding like Provencher does not have prostitutes 
in the streets and the drug problems are primarily hidden, the 
reality is that even children and young adults from the riding of 
Provencher can become prostitutes and drug addicts.  They drift 
to the streets of larger cities, where they die in anonymity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of the large core areas of our cities suffer from 
the presence of drug addicts and prostitutes.  Their streets are 
congested with johns, with organized crime and with other 
contributing factors to the problems raised by drugs.  We see 
this more visibly in cities like Vancouver, Toronto and Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also commend those workers who are involved in this 
very difficult struggle on a day to day basis:  the police 
officers, the social workers and the volunteer community 
organizations.  They truly are angels in a very dark night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the debate today, I hope we can get beyond our 
apprehensions about this issue and have a productive and 
non-partisan dialogue.  I appreciate that the Senate is also 
conducting hearings and studies in respect of this matter. 
However I think we as elected representatives need to participate 
in a very active way in the discussion.  Because we are elected 
and because we are responsible to our constituents, we need to be 
involved in this process in a substantive way.  This is not about 
duplication.  This is about participation.  We need to start 
thinking beyond our current policies and start asking ourselves 
the tougher questions about what is working and what is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion is passed and implemented, parliament will have a 
new special committee examining the way in which the federal 
parliament can address the wide ranging problems that result from 
the non-medical use of drugs.  The need for such a committee can 
hardly be in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual worldwide revenue generated by the illicit drug 
industry is approximately $400 billion American, which amounts to 
about an 8% share of total international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course Canada does not exist in a vacuum, and In Canada alone 
each year the total economic costs attributed to illicit drug use 
is estimated at $1.4 billion, with billions more fuelling 
organized crime.  According to the RCMP's 1999 report on drugs in 
Canada, the illicit drug trade is a principal source of revenue 
for most organized crime groups.  This is a serious situation 
with no easy answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, I would like to bring to members' attention a 
letter that called into question traditional methods of dealing 
with illicit drug use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost three years ago, the secretary general of the United 
Nations, Kofi Annan, received a letter signed by a variety of 
both academic and public figures, including a former UN secretary 
general, a former U.S. secretary of state, a former U.S. surgeon 
general, Nobel laureates, former presidents and cabinet ministers 
of Latin American countries and, indeed, in among that list was a 
number of prominent Canadians.  What was so remarkable was not so 
much who signed the letter but the content of it.  The letter 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the global war on drugs is now causing more harm 
than drug abuse itself. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extraordinary statement.  The main thrust of this 
statement of course was that the consequences of social 
deterioration from illicit drugs resulted not so much from drug 
use per se but from failed drug policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns articulated in this letter focus on the idea that 
international trends reflecting primarily punitive drug control 
measures have empowered criminals, corrupted governments, eroded 
security and impeded efforts to prevent the spread of infectious 
diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter also claims that significant resources are being 
depleted on ineffective and increasingly more expensive 
interdiction efforts, and that not enough is being expended on 
reducing drug related crime, disease and death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine that anyone here today would dispute the kind 
of substantial and permanent harm that results from the use of 
illicit drugs by members of our society.  However, this letter 
and many other briefs and documents currently in circulation 
indicate that there is significant and widespread disagreement as 
to how best to solve the issue in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that effect, we are proposing today to create a committee to 
analyze these issues carefully and as objectively as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current strategy in Canada is almost identical to the 
strategy introduced by the Conservative government almost 15 
years ago.  Therefore, I do not think finger pointing is 
productive in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both policies, the former and the current of the Conservative 
government, clearly articulate the overall long term goal of 
harm, reduction and rehabilitation, in addition to the principles 
of criminal prosecution and education measures intended to combat 
and prevent the abuse of such substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that these strategies appear to have failed 
almost completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Addiction Research Foundation has been conducting the 
Ontario student drug use survey since 1977.  I would like to 
mention some of its findings today in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The percentage of students using cannabis in the last 12 months 
peaked at 31.7% in 1979 and then fell for the next six surveys to 
11.7% in 1991.  In 1993 it increased slightly to 12.7%.  Since 
1993 usage has climbed back up to 25% in 1997.  The percentage of 
users is now highest in grade 11 at 42%.  That is an astounding 
figure when one considers this is an illicit drug and that 42% of 
grade 11 students in Ontario utilize this drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peak usage of glue and solvents was in 1979 and then there was a 
sharp decrease until 1991.  Numbers rose again after reaching 
1.8% for glue and 2.6% for solvents in 1997.  The 1999 survey 
gives a sharply higher figure for glue at 3.6% and solvents at 
7.1%.  The issue of glue and solvents is a horrendous problem in 
the core area of the city of Winnipeg and some other rural 
prairie cities and does significant damage to children and 
adults.  We have been powerless to do anything about the spread 
of this horrible addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The peak for LSD was in 1981.  The trough was in 1991 at 5.2%. 
However it has risen back up to about 7%.  Overall, LSD usage has 
risen over the past decade.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Cocaine has been tracked since 1977 while crack cocaine, which 
is usually associated with urban ghettos primarily in the 
American cities, has been tracked since 1987.  Cocaine peaked in 
1979 at 5.1% and then fell only to rise again.  Crack cocaine 
usage has increased sharply.  Cocaine usage rose sharply in 1999 
to 3.7%.  The usage of crack increased in 1999 to 2.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-six percent of students in 1999 said that in the last 
year someone had tried to sell them drugs.  Thirty-two percent 
said that they had observed someone selling drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the statistics are clear, whether we look to Ontario, 
Manitoba, British Columbia, the maritimes or Quebec, illicit drug 
use, particularly by adolescents, our future here in Canada, has 
been increasing steadily over the past decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, the Vancouver drug scene has seen a huge increase 
in the purity of heroin and the introduction of cheap cocaine and 
crack to the city in the early 1990s.  I always have to remark 
about the conjunction of the words pure and heroin.  It almost 
has a very chilling effect on one when something that devilish 
and that horrible can be considered pure, but of course I 
understand it in the chemical sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of illicit drug overdose deaths have averaged 147 per 
year over the past seven years.  Many of those who die from drug 
overdoses are not even the heavy drug users.  Casual users do not 
know the strength of street heroin and mixing alcohol with heroin 
dramatically increases the risk for overdose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experimentation with marijuana in Vancouver has risen by 50% in 
the last five years to 58% of the 17 year olds interviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other areas of concern are HIV and hepatitis C infection, 
increased drug misuse among youth, inadequate treatment services 
and the relationship between crime and substance abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the economic costs, we need to look far beyond the 
simple cost of enforcing drug laws themselves. Illicit and 
illegal drug use is a significant contributing factor in a wide 
range of crimes, such as property offences, violent crimes, 
robbery and prostitution.  That does not even take into account 
the organized crime rings that thrive on the commerce and the 
money generated by this trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected representatives, we need to participate in an active, 
substantive way.  Burying our heads in the sand and saying that 
this will not affect our particular riding because it is a quiet 
rural riding and we have other things to concern ourselves with 
will simply delay the problem. One day the problem will even be 
in those ridings that we consider safe and secure from the 
problems of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague for bringing the motion forward and I 
commend the motion to others in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
I cannot speak to the details of the concern of the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford about the particular expenditure of funds. In

important to ensure that money is being used effectively.  I do 
not know whether the concern was that the money was not being 
used effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to the member who introduced the motion.  I know 
this matter concerns him very deeply.  He has spent a lot of time 
on the street with police forces looking into the situations and

think he brought the matter forward in a frivolous way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our policy is in some way inadequate, I as a member of the 
Canadian Alliance would like to hear from Canadians.  We need to 
be responsive to them on this issue.  If we need to spend money 
in certain areas in an effective way to break the cycle of drug 
addiction and the downward spiral of some of our core areas, I am 
prepared to re-examine policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this issue with an open mind, in recognition that past 
drug policies of Conservative and Liberal governments have 
failed.  I prefaced my remarks by saying that I am not pointing 
fingers.  I want the contribution of all members to this very 
important debate, not just in the Senate but in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Madam Speaker, as the member opposite 
is probably aware, we have a rather innovative project called the 
Toronto drug treatment court.  It is a special court designed to 
supervise cases of drug dependency of offenders who have agreed 
to accept treatment of their substance abuse.  Another project of 
a similar nature will be starting in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that some representatives of the Alliance Party have 
visited the drug treatment court in Toronto.  I would very much 
appreciate the comments of the member opposite on whether he is 
aware of the program and, if so, what he feels about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  Madam Speaker, one colleague from Regina 
who will be speaking to the motion had occasion to attend at the 
Toronto drug court.  Generally speaking I know he received some 
favourable impressions and will be speaking about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend that member for taking the initiative to look beyond 
the box, the way we have traditionally approached the particular 
problem.  I trust his comments and the experience he gained will 
not only assist us in our deliberations today but perhaps help 
guide the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of drug policy I recognize that there will be a lot 
of controversy.  We have to be very hesitant to condemn those who 
speak about new innovative ways.  We have to seriously analyze 
and evaluate these programs.  We cannot just let them go on and 
pretend that by simply creating new programs we are making 
changes.  There is a responsibility on us if as a House we fund 
some of these programs. 
We have a responsibility to evaluate but I will not condemn those 
who, having looked at the wreckage of the drug policy over the 
past three decades, now say we have to do something else.

professions, but all these individuals are trying to help the 
very unfortunate people who are addicted to illicit drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to encourage innovation that does not absolve us from 
the responsibility of evaluating what has gone on.  Part of the 
problem is that we have not been evaluating what has gone on, but 
my colleague from Regina will be giving a little more detail in 
that respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend the member for Provencher on his comments and 
refer to his previous office in another life when he was minister 
of justice of the province of Manitoba.  He is only too well 
aware of the difficulties in administering justice and making 
sure that our justice system works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made the observation that the drug policy had not worked. 
That is a very serious allegation.  The questions then become: Is 
it that the policy was wrong?  Is it that the people charged with 
enforcement or implementation of the policy were wrong?  Or, was 
it the attitude of society which says it wants the policy but 
really does not care about the problem or is not so sure that it 
is a real problem and in fact says that there is nothing like 
having real good coke after dinner with friends in the 
neighbourhood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents tell their kids they are not supposed to take coke, but 
they go to the living room, open a little drawer, take out the 
coke, put it on the table and consume it.  What is the problem as 
the member sees it?  I am sure he knows only too well from his 
past life what it is doing to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews:</B>  Madam Speaker, as a politician and justice 
minister in Manitoba I saw the top of the problem.  I did not get 
to see what was happening on the street and why things were 
breaking down, but I think that there has been a reluctance on 
the part of politicians to address the issue and a reluctance in 
society generally to deal with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak outside the context of the urban riding in Winnipeg that 
I represented where the reality of the drug problem was much more 
evident.  I look now at the wonderful riding of Provencher that I 
represent and see a reluctance sometimes to deal head on with the 
issue because it does not appear to affect the riding.  Drug and 
alcohol problems arise in some rural areas.  People move into 
urban ridings where drugs are more accessible and anonymity 
protects them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply push the problem off but it grows.  The most telling 
issue is when we speak to parents who previously may not have had 
any concern about the drug problem and suddenly one day realize 
that their child is addicted, that their brother is addicted or 
that another member of their family is addicted. Then the reality 
and the horror of drug addiction come home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this trend in the nation.  Whether we brought on 
the problem ourselves or whether we are victims, we need to deal 
with it.  The legal framework, the enforcement policies and the 
social policies do not seem to be curtailing the problem.  The 
problem is being fuelled and we need to address it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I begin by saying that the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford who presented the motion this morning takes a 
position on most political issues with which I thoroughly 
disagree.  In fact the policy differences between me and the 
member for Langley—Abbotsford are too numerous to mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in connection with the subject we are discussing today, 
I believe that member and I have a lot of common ground.  He has 
suggested and I agree that it is time for the House to look 
broadly at the question of the factors underlying the non-medical 
use of drugs in Canada.  He has suggested and I agree that it is 
time for the House to look at ways in which the Government of 
Canada can act either alone or in combination with other 
governments to address the underlying causes of the use of 
non-medical drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that this examination be undertaken in a 
very non-partisan way.  That is certainly the spirit in which the 
motion is presented and it is in that spirit that I intend to 
vote in favour of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence the member is proposing that a committee of the House 
examine what should be our national strategy in relation to the 
non-medical use of drugs.  He is proposing that we look at an 
integrated and coherent approach to the use of illegal drugs in 
Canada.  May I say the motion is entirely consistent with the 
policy and with the process the government supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had an opportunity to look at this issue both as a former 
minister of justice and attorney general and now as the Minister 
of Health.  I can recall when I was minister of justice that I 
asked for the opportunity to spend time with the police forces 
around the country.  In each of nine Canadian cities I road with 
police officers during the night shift as they contended with the 
issue of crime and safety on urban streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have vivid memories of spending just such an evening with the 
Vancouver police department.  We parked the car and we walked 
through the downtown east side.  I can recall going through the 
alleys behind the facade of stores and hotels in downtown east 
side Vancouver and stepping over people who were lying prone in 
the alleys with needles stuck in their thighs.  They were giving 
themselves injections of illegal drugs.  They were lying helpless 
in the alleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember discussing with the police officers the role of the 
criminal justice system in relation to these people, as pathetic 
as they were, as heart wrenching as they were.  The conclusion to 
which we all came was that this was a problem, at least when 
presented in that form, that was not best addressed by the 
criminal justice system because in truth it was a health issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now as Canada's Minister of Health it is terribly important that 
I use the opportunity the member opposite has provided to marshal 
support of all members in looking critically at how we deal with 
the issue, how we can best use the resources available to all 
levels of government to deal with this difficult issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does little good for those persons to be arrested, brought 
before a criminal court or imprisoned.  Surely the better answer 
in the long run is to treat them, overcome the addiction and get 
them back into society.  Surely the better answer in the long run 
is to prevent people from becoming addicted.  I should like to 
speak to each of the elements of that approach in the few moments 
available to me today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of last fall's election campaign we as the Liberal 
Party at that time undertook to implement a national drug 
strategy to deal with both supply and demand and to crack down on 
organized crime to the extent to which it was involved in 
supplying the illegal drug market.  We spoke during the campaign 
of prevention.  We spoke of treatment.  We spoke of 
rehabilitation.  We spoke of enforcement and control.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also talked about this as being an international issue and 
the need for research to better understand the nature of the 
challenge, and an evaluation to make sure that the steps taken by 
government are effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came back last night from Geneva where I attended the annual 
assembly of the World Health Organization.  I had occasion during 
the last few days, in the company of four or five members from 
other parties, to speak with ministers of health from around the 
world.  On the list of items where we had a common interest, 
where we said we wanted to enlarge our collaboration, was the 
whole issue of the trafficking and the use of illegal drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found that all ministers of health from around the world, 
whether it was from Egypt or lsrael or from the United States, 
Wales or Mexico, talked about the need for international 
co-operation to share best practices and to work together toward 
finding more effective ways of dealing with addiction and the 
illegal use of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government forges a national drug strategy to respect our 
commitment during the election campaign, what better way to make 
sure we have the right balance among the intrinsic elements of 
that strategy than to put the matter before a committee of the 
House and get the best views of members from across the Chamber 
as to how we ought to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the election campaign we agreed also to devote 
some $420 million to support the national drug strategy.  What 
better way to make sure that money will be well spent than to 
solicit the views of members of the House of Commons and have 
them look at the alternatives available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the motion.  I welcome the opportunity it provides in 
a non-partisan, constructive way for all members of the House to 
make sure that we act in a way that is going to be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The urgency of the issue is obvious.  I have some numbers to 
underscore that fact.  The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse 
tells us that there are 804 deaths per year as a result of 
illicit drug use in Canada.  The city of Vancouver tells us that 
it is now at the point where, primarily because of the problems 
in the downtown east side, there are 147 overdose deaths per year 
in that city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in 1999 some 80,000 convictions were registered for 
drug offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.  We 
know this is an increasing problems among young people.  Studies 
of young Canadians in grades 7 to 13 show an increasing trend in 
the use of alcohol, cannabis, amphetamines, ecstasy and cocaine. 
This is a trend that cannot be ignored.  It must spur us to 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the cost.  Quite apart from the human cost and the 
tragedy of wasted lives or wasted opportunities, it is estimated 
that in 1992 alcohol abuse and illicit drugs cost the Canadian 
economy over $9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the face of that stark and troubling reality that we 
must put together a national strategy for dealing with the 
non-medical use of drugs which will make a difference.  The 
strategy we have had in place since 1997 has four pillars.  It 
deals with prevention, treatment, enforcement and harm reduction. 
It is intended to address both supply and demand and tackles the 
issue of substance abuse fundamentally from the perspective of 
health.  It involves 11 departments of government, from the 
solicitor general and justice to foreign affairs and revenue, to 
heritage and transport.  Each of those departments in their own 
way contributes to an overall effort.  It involves also the 
provincial governments and municipal governments.  Each level 
must contribute in some way to the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me touch briefly upon each of the four elements to give the 
House some idea of what we are doing at present and identify the 
action that I believe we have to build upon if we are to make a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in terms of prevention, this involves warning and 
educating young people, giving them the facts on which they can 
make sensible decisions about their own behaviour and their own 
conduct. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT37"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT37"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305
<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also involves research to try to better understand what lies 
beneath the use of illicit drugs and indeed the tendency toward 
addiction.  Are there health or social factors that we should 
know more about so that we can design strategies that are more 
effective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see the solicitor general just last year open 
up a centre for research into addiction in Montague, Prince 
Edward Island so that we can answer some of these questions.  Of 
course the Canadian Institute of Health Research and the 
Institute of Neuroscience, Mental Health and Addiction have been 
asked to look at exactly the same things, so that we can further 
understand the nature of the problem on an individual basis with 
which we are trying to deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second element is treatment.  I will draw the attention of 
the House to the fact that often these treatment options are best 
administered regionally or locally.  It is for that reason that 
every year my department transfers $14.5 million to the 
provincial governments for alcohol and drug treatment and 
rehabilitation services.  That money is combined with provincial 
funds to provide a service capacity on the ground that truly 
makes a difference.  Apart from that, Health Canada funds 
treatment centres for first nations and Inuit people across 
Canada who have difficulty with substance abuse and addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also funding local projects such as the million dollars 
that Health Canada provided for the downtown east side of 
Vancouver for the creation of a resource centre, a safe place for 
people to go to seek refuge from the street, to have access to 
social and health services and to take a time out from the 
threatening and very dangerous conditions that are sometimes 
found on the streets of that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Department of Justice, we have also innovated the 
justice system by creating drug courts.  In the city of Toronto 
special courts have been opened to deal with those who are 
charged with offences relating to non-medical drugs in 
circumstances where it is believed that intervention to encourage 
treatment and rehabilitation is more effective than simply 
processing individuals in the criminal system, resulting in a 
conviction and incarceration.  I can tell the House that based on 
what we have learned in Toronto, we are looking at the question 
of whether that approach can be broadened to other parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third element is enforcement.  The solicitor general and the 
Department of Justice have been developing strategies to focus on 
the traffickers of illegal drugs, working with foreign affairs to 
identify the sources of the illegal drugs and to find out whether 
there are ways working with other nations to choke off those 
sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last element is harm reduction where we deal with the human 
circumstances of the addict.  How can we cure the addiction as 
well as punishing the crime?  How can we tackle some of the 
underlying social and health issues that are related to the 
addiction?  Mayor Owen of Vancouver has shown particular 
leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confronted with the tragedy of the downtown east side, Mayor 
Owen last fall produced a very thoughtful and comprehensive paper 
identifying steps that could be taken in each of the areas of 
enforcement, prevention and harm reduction.  He identified some 
innovative ideas which I understand were just put into final form 
by his municipal council the other evening.  I intend to meet 
soon with Mayor Owen to talk about some of those ideas.  I would 
also like to have the views of the other parties in the House as 
to whether they think that some of the proposals made in Mayor 
Owen's report would be helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also mention some of the steps being taken by our 
solicitor general in prisons where injection drug use has been 
identified as an issue.  The solicitor general has been working 
with prison administration to try to put into practice some 
lessons learned from elsewhere about how to come to grips with 
that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the motion and the initiative that lies behind it. 
People speak often about the partisan nature of debate in the 
House, but what should be brought to the attention of Canadians 
is that there are issues such as this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the issue two weeks ago in relation to assisted human 
reproduction, cloning.  There are also issues such as the safety 
of women in fertility clinics, the framework of principles to 
govern research when it comes to embryos, organ donation, illicit 
drug use, where all members of the House come to common ground. 
We are all worried about our children and our communities.  We 
see the damage that can be done through the illicit trafficking 
in drugs and their use, and we are all focused on solutions that 
will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to the intervention this morning of the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough as he talked 
about the American approach.  I share his views that the American 
style war on drugs with an army-like approach is not proving to 
be as effective as it had hoped and that a somewhat more nuanced 
and broader approach is needed.  I think the elements of the drug 
strategy we have been talking about may provide that.  Again, let 
us get a committee of the House to look at how those elements 
could be put together to be as effective as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the recent events in the United States concerning 
medical marijuana illustrate in many ways the differences between 
us.  Members may have noted that just the other day the supreme 
court of the United States ruled that medical marijuana would not 
be permissible.  Two years ago we announced we would make it 
available for medicinal purposes.  With the assistance of the 
courts, we have come to understand better how that can be done 
lawfully.  We now have proposed regulations that would provide 
for that on a very formal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, that is the way to go.  I think it is supported by the 
Canadian public and perhaps illustrates some of the differences 
between our two countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also listened with interest to the speech by the hon. member 
for Palliser this morning.  He spoke about the useful work being 
done in the other place and regretted the duplication.  While the 
other place has been doing some work on this, I do not see that 
as a reason for us not to act.  We can take advantage of the 
Senate's work to date.  We can perhaps co-ordinate some of the 
efforts.  However the House has the perfect right as well, and 
the responsibility, to do its own work in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that I will support the motion.  I 
look forward to working constructively with members on all sides 
of the House to make sure that we put this issue squarely before 
a committee and that we get back from that committee 
recommendations that will put us in a position to do the job that 
must be done for the Canadian people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, while I agree with many things the health minister 
has said, I disagree with one thing he said.  He indicated that 
we were focused.  That we are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan:</B>  We are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Already I am getting an argument, which 
is silly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we have pilot projects going on all over the place. 
There are drug courts in Toronto.  There are other areas looking 
for drug courts.  There are programs of all sorts all over the 
place.  There are safe shoot up sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not unduly criticizing the government.  Hon. members should 
not take it wrong.  I am saying we are not focused.  That is why 
we need a special committee of the House of Commons that would 
try to focus on those things.  If they cannot even simply agree 
with that over there, then there is a problem with the 
understanding of what is wrong in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are safe shoot up sites.  There are needle exchanges in 
some places.  There are communities in the country that are 
looking for needle exchanges but do not know what to do.  They do 
not know whether needle exchanges are good or bad.  Our prisons 
are a good example.  There is a project in one prison but not in 
another prison.  Drug cartels are in some prisons but not in 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion the country needs a RITE commission, 
rehabilitation, intervention, treatment and enforcement, which 
the minister talked about.  There are some RITE commissions in 
some provinces. 
The federal government does not have one.  Other provinces do not 
have them.  Some say they work.  Some say they do not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exercise here is not to debate whether it works or whether 
it does not, it is just to do what the minister said, and that is 
to focus what is going on in this country so that we can look at 
all the ramifications and all the projects to see if we can get 
something conclusive and provide leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Mayor Owen's proposal said exactly that.  I have been 
familiar with this proposal for well over six to eight months.  I 
have been dealing with downtown east side businessmen in 
assessing various projects within that project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a comment from the minister to see if he agrees 
with me that it is a problem of focus, not so much a problem of 
certain things going astray or certain things not being done.  It 
is a problem of various communities all over the country really 
trying whatever they can to dislodge the problem and not being 
sure where they are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to have time to debate this one, but I would ask 
the minister to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not disagree with 
what the member has said, but what we have to overcome is the 
tendency in Canada, because of the division of responsibility 
between the federal and provincial governments, to have piecemeal 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can easily happen in Canada is that the Government of 
Canada can have some ideas in the area of health, the delivery 
being a provincial responsibility, but provincial governments 
take a different approach and we end up with a patchwork.  That 
is why we have pilot projects:  the Government of Canada cannot 
deliver health services.  Nor would we want to.  That is 
provincial.  We in the government sometimes fund pilot projects 
hoping that we can demonstrate whether something works.  If it 
does, we make that information available to provinces, which 
might adopt the practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the member is right in that there is a patchwork at the 
moment.  What we need is a co-ordinated national approach whereby 
we bring the provinces on board and come to some common ground as 
to how best to prevent, to treat, to deal with enforcement and to 
deal with harm reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the special committee the member has proposed 
today would develop a strategy for an effective, uniform and 
pan-Canadian approach so that we do not leave out some people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to compliment the 
Minister of Health for his non-partisan tone in terms of setting 
the base for what is to be surely a very important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little surprised, though, when listening to the member 
for Langley—Abbotsford.  I recall that in December 1999 when we 
tried and in fact went ahead with putting a research addiction 
facility in Charlottetown under correctional services, he opposed 
it.  He said it was an outrageous thing.  Yet in the party 
platform of the reformed Alliance people in 2000, they said 
“...we will also increase funding for rehabilitation and 
education, and treat addicts through immediate access to 
rehabilitation facilities”.  So again we see the kind of 
contradiction that those reformed Alliance people have on this 
very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Minister of Health is this.  He spoke about 
the Toronto experiment in terms of treatment and rehabilitation 
and how this might be a template, perhaps even a blueprint, for 
other centres.  I wonder if he could elaborate on that, because 
it seems to me that at some of these grassroots kinds of 
facilities where community people are involved at the very basis 
in a very meaningful way, we end up developing and building 
things that could be of national importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think the experiment in 
Toronto can help.  I have had correspondence from members of the 
criminal bar in Toronto who are very enthusiastic about what we 
are learning there.  They are asking us, first of all, to 
continue in Toronto and then to broaden the experiment beyond 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, what it is intended to do is bring 
together a number of responses to this problem.  I practised law 
for some 20 years, and while I did not do a lot of criminal work, 
in the early years of my practice I did.  I can recall appearing 
on behalf of people accused of drug offences who were themselves 
addicts.  I cannot imagine a less appropriate response to someone 
who is in the grip of an addiction than the criminal justice 
system.  It just does not work.  What that person needs is 
treatment.  What that person needs is support to overcome a 
health problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are trying to illustrate in the Toronto drug 
courts.  I believe that we will learn lessons we can apply in 
other parts of the country.  I know that the Minister of Justice 
is extremely interested in looking at what we are learning there 
and if possible broadening it to other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an example of what we can learn.  It is an example of 
where the Government of Canada has a role to play, because we do 
bring the prosecutions under the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
Act.  Whereas ordinarily prosecutions are a provincial matter, in 
drug matters they are federal.  It is a place where we can make a 
difference and we hope we will do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in keeping with the minister's comments on this 
issue of how we create greater synergy between our justice system 
and our health system, I would be very interested in hearing his 
comments in that regard with respect to current sentencing 
availability in our judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A rational extension of what the minister seems to be alluding 
to would be to have available to judges in this country the 
equivalent of mandatory treatment.  This would also include of 
course a significant investment in facilities, treatment 
facilities in particular, where attendance would be mandatory. 
Rather than having people languishing in the traditional penal 
system where in most instances no treatment is available and they 
are simply biding their time, mandatory treatment would be part 
of that sentence to be served.  In such instances an individual, 
I would submit, would be far better served, as would society, if 
that were to be encompassed as part of the actual sentence 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to follow the example of the member opposite with respect to 
the partisanship in this debate, because I think it does detract 
from this, why are we waiting?  What has been the holdup on the 
part of governments generally to address this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do know that there has been good work commenced in the other 
place, but this seems to be something of such pressing concern, 
something that is so broad, so absolutely systemic now in all 
regions of the country, is this not the area where we should be 
focusing our attention immediately?  This committee would be a 
good start, but what has been the delay, other than the thorny 
issues, I suppose, that tend to stem from this in Canadians' 
minds?  We have to start acting with real diligence and real 
haste on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Madam Speaker, very briefly, I have been 
working with justice, solicitor general and other departments 
trying to put some meat on the bones of the election campaign 
commitment for a drug strategy.  We expect to be coming forward 
with a strategy, at least a proposed strategy.  I think the 
committee that is being proposed today can help us in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the member talks about compulsory treatment.  I believe 
that in the drug court in Toronto that is the kind of approach 
they are taking.  Obviously having that available in every court 
in the appropriate cases would be ideal.  Often those social 
services are not in place.  Sometimes it is a question of money. 
Sometimes it is a question of organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say very briefly that he is right and that is the ideal 
we should work toward.  If we get all governments on the same 
page and we have the money necessary and the professional 
treatment available, I think that would be ideal.  I think it is 
the best way of responding to someone with an addiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak 
to this very important issue.  I want to thank my hon. colleague 
from Langley—Abbotsford for having the foresight to bring this 
motion forward to the Canadian Alliance caucus and I thank my 
colleagues there for understanding its importance and choosing it 
for today's supply day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak to this with sincerity and with the earnest concern that 
we move forward on this.  I am very pleased to hear the comments 
in support of the motion from the government side of the House. 
It makes me very happy to feel that we can work together on some 
things and move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I entered the political arena last fall in the election 
campaign.  One thing I addressed in my campaign was the idea of 
public safety in regard to crime, young offenders and those kinds 
of things, so I speak to this in an effort to respond to my 
constituents in Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share a couple of stories because when we talk 
about drugs and the use of illicit drugs we are talking about the 
impacts on lives.  I am thinking of a friend of my youngest son 
who played on the same sports teams.  They were both quite 
talented in their pursuit of sports.  That young lad became 
entangled in drug usage before completing high school.  It went 
on for a number of years.  Now in his early twenties, he is 
hopefully just beginning to come out of the problem he has had 
with illicit drugs.  I spent time talking with his parents. Their 
hearts ached when they saw their young son going through that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of other families in my town with whom I have spent 
time, families with children of high school age who would lie in 
bed for hours and hours on end refusing to get up because of the 
drugs they had been on.  I think of another friend who was a very 
special friend to me.  I had the pleasure of uniting him and his 
wife in marriage, working with his family and seeing it grow. 
However, as time went on I saw the drug habit he could not shake 
finally destroy the family.  He is one of those who ended up in 
prison because of his efforts to support his drug habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been almost 28 years since the Commission of Inquiry into 
Non-Medical Use of Drugs tabled the Le Dain report.  It addressed 
many good issues and contained many good recommendations, but we 
all know that times have changed drastically since 1973.  The 
proliferation of drugs in our society and the ease with which 
they can be obtained is not news to any of us.  We see it 
wherever we go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the United Nations' International Narcotics Control 
Board tabled its annual report.  The report found a disturbing 
increase in the production and abuse of synthetic drugs in 
Canada.  The report found that the illicit manufacturing of 
methamphetamine has increased in the past year.  Law enforcement 
agencies have uncovered a record number of production 
laboratories throughout our own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canada does need an updated, comprehensive 
strategy to deal with the significant problem we have in our 
country today.  Our supply day motion asks the government to deal 
comprehensively with this complex issue by establishing the 
committee.  I say again that I am thrilled to hear that the 
government agrees with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few things that make me angry and there are times when 
it is okay to be angry.  Members may have heard the story that it 
is okay to be angry if we are angry in the right way at the right 
or the wrong things.  I am angry because of the tragedies I have 
referred to that are being brought about in our families in 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me angry that there are people out there who make their 
living by selling drugs and destroying lives.  It also makes me 
angry to see people willingly or for some unknown reason become 
so involved in drug use that they are a burden to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me angry to have to spend the money we do on 
prevention.  It makes me angry that society must do so for a 
relatively few people.  It makes me angry to spend money to 
enforce regulations that are for these people's own good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs, manpower, time and facilities required for rehab and 
treatment attempts make me angry.  However getting angry about a 
situation means it is time to do all one can to remedy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year 1997-98, in Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, just under 
4,000 people were treated in the drug and alcohol treatment 
centres of Regina.  A recent report looked at alcohol and drug 
abuse in the Regina health district.  It found that the most 
commonly abused drugs in North American cities are readily 
obtained on the streets of little old Regina, in the middle of 
the prairies where it is supposed to be safe to live.  The drugs 
most often used are a combination of both Talwin and Ritalin, 
sometimes referred to as the poor man's heroin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report stated that injection drug usage is quite common, 
methadone is available on the streets and illicit drug use is a 
considerable factor in many violent and property crimes in 
Regina.  The figures would go higher but we cannot include those 
that relate to young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from an article that appeared in the Regina 
<I>Leader Post</I> in February.  It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, a United Nations agency has criticized Canada for its 
lax attitude toward illegal growers of cannabis and failure to 
control illicit production of drugs such as “ice” and 
“ecstasy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report finds a disturbing increase in the production and 
abuse of synthetic drugs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The illicit manufacture of methamphetamine—or ice—has 
increased, it says.  In the past year, law enforcement agencies 
have uncovered a record number of clandestine laboratories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some labs producing MDMA—or ecstasy—were found in middle-class 
suburban neighbourhoods, especially in central Canada.  The 
laboratories were run by people with no criminal records or 
connections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its annual report Herbert Schaepe, the board's secretary, 
said: “The board is not happy with the controls established in 
Canada; the Canadian government is not yet controlling, for 
example, one of the main precursors of methamphetamine—ice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Precursors are substances used in the processing or manufacture 
of narcotic drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board is calling on Canada to make greater efforts to comply 
with its obligations, under the 1988 UN convention against 
illicit drugs, to prevent “Canadian territory from being used to 
divert chemicals for the illicit manufacture of drugs in other 
countries”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN report says there has been an increase in the amount of 
cocaine and heroin smuggled into Canada from countries such as 
Mexico.  Last year, Canadian law enforcement agencies intercepted 
156 kilograms of heroin. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to stand and speak to the supply day motion brought 
forth by my Alliance colleagues.  The hon. parliamentary 
secretary some moments ago mentioned the Canadian Alliance policy 
on drugs and crime. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out a couple of things from our policy paper.  It 
mentions that one of every two federal inmates in Canada were 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs when they committed the 
crime for which they were incarcerated.  Fifty per cent were on 
drugs or alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a national strategy to reduce drug usage, one that works 
in partnership with provincial and municipal governments and 
incorporates strategies at the community level.  This proposal 
comes directly out of the Canadian Alliance policy paper.  The 
Alliance favours working with the provinces to develop and 
implement a national drug strategy that will work effectively at 
the street level.  The street level is where a lot of work needs 
to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I was privileged to hear a police chief from the United 
States of America outline what happens in the downward spiral of 
a community.  He pointed out that when a criminal or drug element 
goes into a community the community at first tolerates and lives 
with it, although not with pleasure or willingness, but after a 
period of tolerance it tends to become apathetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tolerance is one thing but apathy is another.  It is a downward 
step where the community stops caring about what is going on.  It 
begins to trust the criminal element as much as it does the law 
enforcement element.  It becomes apathetic to what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next downward step the community begins to defend the 
criminal activity.  We see that over and over again.  Communities 
begin to defend not only the criminal element but the use of 
drugs.  This needs to be addressed by the committee so that it 
can deal with community attitudes and help create a more 
unfriendly environment for those who do hard core drugs and 
traffic drugs to our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance policy paper points out our desire to work in 
partnership with the provinces to promote the use of drug courts. 
A number of members opposite have mentioned the Toronto drug 
court and I will say a little about that in a moment.  However, 
parliament needs to address these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Toronto drug court is the first of its kind in Canada.  I 
understand it is patterned after similar things in the United 
States.  It is a joint venture involving the Ontario court of 
justice, the Department of Justice, the Government of Canada's 
national strategy on community safety and crime prevention, the 
Centre For Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto based 
representatives of the criminal justice system, the Toronto 
police service, Toronto public health, and various city and 
community based services and agencies.  It is funded by the 
national strategy on community safety and crime prevention as a 
pilot project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not relate to the committee we are talking about 
establishing.  However, I have visited the drug court and it 
seems to have been very successful.  I hope the hon. Minister of 
Health is aware that funding for the project is nearing the end. 
If funding is not extended before the end of the trial period it 
will have to stop admitting patients. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the extension of the drug court because it 
seems a helpful and pleasant program.  The drug court brings 
together elements within the community.  I was amazed when the 
Toronto drug court told us the number of agencies and people that 
have worked together to assist it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to our job here as members of parliament.  We 
need to view the work of the committee as something very 
important.  I hope the committee will be given the freedom to 
look at all aspects of the issue and at legislation.  We are 
sometimes hesitant to move and do things differently but the 
committee needs that freedom.  It needs to look at strategy and 
determine if there are better approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned a moment ago that the war on drugs in the 
United States has not worked very well.  However the answer is 
not to simply throw it away and legalize everything.  The answer 
is somewhere in between.  It is my hope that the proposed 
committee will examine all possibilities and develop better 
approaches for enforcing or adjusting drug laws as needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penalties, treatments and all these things need to be worked 
through but they need to be worked through with a sense of 
responsibility, urgency and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I will say a bit more about the Toronto drug 
treatment court.  It is my hope, as I mentioned earlier, that 
this model will be extended to a broader range of things than 
simply drug treatment courts.  We could apply it to young 
offenders and some elements of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my privilege to sit in on a healing circle in Wilcox, 
Saskatchewan a few weeks ago which has taken this approach with 
young offenders.  Young offenders are brought into the presence 
of their peers, teachers and those in authority, and each person 
is given the opportunity to state how the crime affected them. It 
was very positive to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will skip a full description of the drug court but let me say 
that after being in the drug court a couple of weeks ago it was 
not like being in court.  It is like the difference between a 
funeral and a wedding.  This was more like a wedding.  There was 
celebration.  One young lady came in very excited because she had 
gotten through another week without succumbing to the temptation 
of drugs.  The judge commended her.  The other offenders who were 
sitting awaiting their turn all cheered and clapped.  It was a 
real joy to see them celebrate that victory with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then saw one who had failed.  He came before the judge and had 
to admit his failures.  The judge had to address his failures. 
There was no defiance or anger when the offender received his 
warning.  He went out of there determined to try again to do what 
he needed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for these kinds of projects.  This type 
of committee needs to look at these solutions and extend them as 
much as it can.  We put too many people in jail who simply come 
out madder.  I would love to pursue these kinds of things through 
this type of committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is refreshing and 
enlightening to hear the member opposite talk about the good work 
being done in Toronto by the drug court.  He made some very wise 
comments. 
Obviously he has studied the matter and understands it.  He is to 
be congratulated for bringing that enlightened view.  It is rare 
among the Alliance people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also congratulate him in terms of the recognition of alcohol 
and drugs and the role they play with respect to criminal 
activity.  It underscores the good work that Correctional Service 
Canada is doing in this all important area dealing with 
rehabilitation and working with inmates in a very meaningful way. 
It underscores the need to ensure that the right things are done 
with the programs that are in place so that the chances are there 
for people to reform, improve and do the kinds of things that are 
required.  I want to indicate to the member that those points 
were very well taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the hon. member.  First, does the hon. 
member personally support the medical use of marijuana in Canada 
as it has been proposed?   Second, does he support the city of 
Vancouver's proposal for safe injection sites?  Those are two 
fairly straightforward questions and I would be interested in the 
hon. member's views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer:</B>  Madam Speaker, those are two more 
things that make me angry because they put me in a position of 
having to choose between the lesser evil.  I have been slow to 
adjust my thinking.  I have come to the conclusion that a number 
of medically prescribed drugs are also addictive and if misused 
can be totally out of place in a person's life.  I am not an 
enthusiastic supporter of cannabis for medical purposes but I 
understand the wisdom of it and can live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry but I forgot the other question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, it was with respect to the 
city of Vancouver's safe injection sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer:</B>  Madam Speaker, that too is hard for me 
to live with.   Again it is one of the lesser evils for which I 
am trying to learn the advantages.  I ask the member to bear with 
me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I also commend the hon. member for his comments and his 
presentation this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize another point.  We heard the Minister of 
Health and other members this morning say that we have to study 
this problem.  We have had people explain in detail how serious 
the problem really is.  The hon. member who just spoke has a 
tremendous background in the business of dealing with people, 
particularly in a pastoral sense.  I believe that in another life 
he knew all about those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we dealing here with a situation where people are unwilling 
to face the reality of the situation?  We had a drug policy in 
1987 and 1996.  We have had laws changed and programs introduced. 
We have had all kinds of things happening, yet the use of illicit 
drugs in our society has increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the programs and policies are not working and the law 
is not working.  Could one of the reasons be that people do not 
want it to work?   We talk about and we lament the fact that 
families are being broken up and that people's lives are being 
destroyed.  However, are we really serious about dealing with the 
problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this kind of committee a way in which we can sensitize 
society to finally admit that we have a problem and that it is 
society's problem.  We have come to the point where we are saying 
that it is a problem but that it is not our problem. I wonder if 
what we need as parents, as leaders in the community, as pastors 
and as teachers is a shift in attitude.  Would the hon. member 
respond to that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer:</B>  Madam Speaker, that was exactly what I 
was referring to when I spoke about the decline of a community. 
It goes from tolerance to apathy to defence.  I believe we could 
demonstrate that it has happened in terms of drug usage, not in 
an overall total way but in a very spotted way. We have those who 
would now defend, who do not care and who tolerate, but I believe 
the committee would really need to take a strong look in order to 
give us the actual truth as to the dangers of these drugs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, a little while ago the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Solicitor General of Canada, who tends to be far to the 
partisan side in the House, which is bad for the debate, 
indicated that I was against the development of a drug research 
centre in Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for my opposition was that millions of dollars would 
be put into the wrong thing.  A building, which would last 40 
years, would be built in order to study something that could be 
studied in our universities, in the House of Commons or somewhere 
else.  We should be looking at education, rehabilitation, 
detoxification and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a report is tabled in the House of Commons by the 
committee, what would the member expect would happen to the 
report?  I sincerely hope the report would not come here to 
collect dust.  It is far too important for that.  I would like to 
get an indication from him as to the value of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer:</B>  Madam Speaker, one of the values I 
hope would come from such a report would be the opportunity for 
us to address some of the gaps in legislation.  During my speech 
I did not have enough time to give the list that I received from 
the Toronto drug court crown prosecutor.  He indicated a number 
of gaps in the legislation that needed to be amended in order to 
properly operate such an alternative court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be a willingness to make some adjustments in the 
legislation.  I hope that as the report comes out it would make 
adjustments at every level to what we are doing.  The report 
cannot sit on somebody's shelf to get stale after two or three 
years.  I hope it would be a report that would stir parliament to 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have dealt with many 
young kids in the country who need help today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One young lady, a 14 year old named Angel, came off the streets. 
She had been in 22 foster homes before she entered a particular 
facility in British Columbia.  The trouble is that she has to 
leave that facility after 14 weeks or so and, because there are 
no long term rehabilitation facilities, she will be put back into 
a foster home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does my colleague see as the answer for young people who 
are on the street and need treatment?  Where do they go?  What 
kind of resources are required?  Do we need to spend some money 
on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer:</B>  Madam Speaker, obviously we will have 
to spend some money.  I recently saw a lady in Wilcox, 
Saskatchewan, who was about to retire from the RCMP.  She sat as 
the facilitator for a community group.  They brought in the young 
offender and those around him.  They allowed community peer 
pressure to come to bear on the young person.  Those are the 
kinds of things that are needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, this is a very important 
debate and I want to start by saying that Canada's drug strategy 
reflects a very careful balance.  I will be splitting my time 
with the member for Vancouver Kingsway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This careful balance between reducing the supply of drugs and 
reducing the demand for illicit drugs is very important.  In 
Canada the abuse of drugs is recognized as primarily a health 
issue.  Nevertheless it includes a very important enforcement 
component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug enforcement continues to be recognized as an important 
aspect of our drug strategy because efforts to reduce the harm 
caused by drugs would be hampered by an environment of 
unrestricted supply.  For example, studies have shown that one of 
the major causes of drug abuse among youth is simple 
availability.  Enforcement activities then help to maintain a 
level of control over availability.  Supply reduction creates an 
environment in which drug prevention can succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard the nature and focus of drug enforcement should 
be emphasized.  Often we have heard references to a war on drugs. 
However law enforcement has not adopted this process.  The focus 
of enforcement efforts is instead on high level criminals that 
supply illicit drugs rather than on individual users. For 
individual users the focus is on prevention, treatment and 
rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enforcement component is seen as complementary to 
prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts.  Specific 
efforts have been made to bring these components together.  I 
refer in particular to the health and enforcement partnership 
network which was formed in 1994.  This network brings together 
representatives of the health and enforcement fields to encourage 
collaborative efforts in addressing substance abuse issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for a balanced approach toward drugs has been 
specifically recognized by police forces in Canada.  For example, 
I refer members to “Taking a balanced approach: Canada's Drug 
Policy from the National Police Perspective”, which is on the 
RCMP website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also refer members to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police drug policy resolution from 1999 in which the CACP, while 
standing firmly opposed to the legalization of illicit drugs, 
specifically endorsed a “balanced approach of prevention, 
education, enforcement, counselling, treatment, rehabilitation 
and diversion to counter Canada's drug problems”.  That is an 
enlightened view consistent with the values of Canadians and 
consistent with the values of the government in terms of how we 
want to see this very terrible problem tackled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, speaking of police services and forces, I should 
note that joint force operations involving various Canadian 
enforcement agencies and those of other countries are employed 
frequently during anti-drug operations.  Recently we have seen 
very successful operations take place.  We applaud all those 
involved, especially our police services that have done such a 
good job in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police are involved in drug prevention efforts.  I mention 
specifically the RCMP drug awareness service which provides 
education, training, programs and co-ordination on substance 
abuse issues in communities across Canada.  The focus of Canada's 
enforcement efforts is against high level drug suppliers rather 
than individual users.

Canadians were pleased to learn that Toronto, along with Paris

2008 Olympic games.  However it is regrettable that the decision 
to award the Olympic games appears unrelated to issues of 
human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this decision to come at a time when China is engaged in the 
most persistent and pervasive assault on human rights since 
Tiananmen Square sends the wrong message to those anywhere 
concerned with the protection of peace and human dignity, an 
objective of the Olympic charter itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, awarding the Olympic games to China turns the 
struggle for human rights on its head.  It not only does not hold 
China accountable for the most egregious human rights violations 
but it even confers retrospective legitimacy upon it.  It sends 
the disturbing signal that not only can human rights be violated 
with impunity but countries can even be rewarded for it.  Such a 
decision can only breed cynicism in a world that has too much 
indifference and not enough moral courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beijing might be a good place, but not now, not until it 
comports with the basic principles of the Olympic charter 
regarding the protection of human security.  For 2008, Toronto 
would be the better choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this morning the Minister of Finance 
released a five year target and forecast for the rate of 
inflation.  I do not mind saying that was the right thing to do, 
but he did not release a report showing a five year projection 
for taxing and spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the fact that some economists at least are saying we 
could be hitting a deficit within three years, will the Minister 
of Finance do the right thing and return to the good habit he was 
just getting into of tabling five year projections? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I made it very clear at the meeting this morning that we 
were not going into deficit.  There is an ample cushion to 
protect us against any kind of an eventuality.  However I would 
simply like to quote an eminent economist who said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much more weight should be placed on...forecasts, over the two 
year budget horizon than over the five year planning horizon. Not 
only is there more immediate accountability, the economic and 
fiscal forecasts are much more reliable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what he said.  Interestingly enough this is by WEFA. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the minister is reading our 
stuff.  It is good stuff.  It goes on to say that we encourage 
him to return to a precedent he was making, and that was five 
year forecasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers just released show that spending has increased by 
8%.  That is the same rate of increase in spending that we saw 
when the Prime Minister was finance minister under Mr. Trudeau, 
and we know where that took us.  What can the finance minister 
tell us about how he will curb this vicious increase in spending? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, the fact is that the hon. member's numbers are 
wrong.  Second, I would like to quote a couple of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was the treasurer of Alberta when program spending increased 
by 28.6% in a three year period?  Who was the treasurer of 
Alberta who presided over the largest one year increase in 
program spending of any Alberta finance minister since 1985-86? I 
have more, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It is very difficult to hear 
the question.  The hon. Leader of the Opposition has the floor 
and has another question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will simply ask the Minister of 
Finance, because we are looking at $15.5 billion of overspending 
in the last four years, who the treasurer in Alberta was when 
spending was increased at the same time as the net debt was 
brought to zero and a single rate of taxes brought in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin:</B>  I wonder, Mr. Speaker, if it was the 
same person who brought in $2.3 billion in unbudgeted program 
spending during his three years as Alberta's finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was the treasurer of Alberta who brought in the largest

1986? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is the finance minister who has presided over 
the incredible shrinking surplus from $20 billion to $15 billion 
because of $5 billion in over budget spending.  This finance 
minister has overspent by $15 billion in the past four years and 
will continue overspending if he does not take control of the 
demands around the cabinet table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he not admit that every additional dollar in new spending 
is a dollar taken away from working families for tax relief and 
from our economic future in terms of debt repayment?  Why will he 
not get his priorities right? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us take a look at where the bulk of the increases 
took place: in health care spending, following the largest 
transfer to the provinces; the largest increases in equalization 
transfers to the less well off provinces in Canada's history; and 
increases in old age pensions and servicing elderly Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply ask the finance critic which of those he would 
cut. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister does not understand that it is 
possible to control spending instead of going back to the levels 
of spending set by the Prime Minister when he was finance 
minister which drove the country into deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many senior economists have said that we are headed for a 
planning deficit within four years.  The finance minister has not 
given us an adequate response.  Will he guarantee to the House 
today that we will not end up with a planning deficit that eats 
into our emergency surpluses, our emergency reserves?  Will he 
give us a commitment now that we will not go back into deficit at 
any point by eating into the emergency reserves? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if we look at the projections that were made last year, 
if we look at the cushions and if we look at the protection of 
the contingency reserve, it is patently clear to anyone who wants 
to understand the numbers that the cushions are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply say the hon. member refers to the spending that 
has taken place under the Prime Minister.  When we took office in 
1993 our program spending was $120 billion. Today, eight years 
later, our program spending is $120 billion.

eliminate this distortion, without changing the existing 
situation of the anglophone community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

Mr. Speaker, since we are speaking about the rule of law, the 
supreme court ruled that it was legitimate to wish to promote 
and defend French in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is also legitimate to take into account the rights of 
anglophones in Quebec.  As Canadians, both Quebec's francophones 
and anglophones are entitled to the protection of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  It will be up to the judge to 
determine whether the arguments of the official languages 
commissioner are legally valid or not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us 
take a hard look at the situation.  If we were to keep the old 
criterion of language spoken at home, we would find ourselves in 
the ridiculous situation where a Quebecer who spoke Portuguese 
at home would be considered an anglophone for the purpose of 
determining the level of services to be provided to citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister prepared to admit that using the criterion of 
language spoken at home rather than mother tongue would mean 
that anyone whose mother tongue is neither French nor English 
would be considered an anglophone?  He is the minister 
responsible and he should give us an answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Once 
again, Mr. Speaker, when the Premier of Quebec intervened 
yesterday, it was not to say that he disagreed with the official 
languages commissioner, but to say that she did not have the 
right to interfere in Quebec's jurisdiction, supposedly because 
Quebec is a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that, if the concept of nation becomes a sort of wall 
separating us as Quebecers from other Canadians, that is to 
distort the meaning of the word nation in French and in English. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, rather 
than see walls where there are none, the minister should 
consider that the situation in Quebec is one of great mutual 
respect when it comes to the linguistic rights of anglophones 
and the status of French as a common language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs wrote that 
the best solution would be a unilateral devolution of powers 
with respect to language solely in the Quebec legislature and 
enforced solely in Quebec's territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he admit that Quebec's actions are entirely consistent with 
the proposal he himself made in 1992? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, except that since then, former Chief Justice 
Dickson, former Chief Justice Lamer, and the current Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada have said that Quebec was 
a distinct society and recognized as such in law in the court's 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, we know that what gives Quebec society its 
distinct nature is that everyone is a minority in that province. 
Anglophones are a minority in Quebec, but a majority elsewhere 
in Canada and in North America as a whole.  Francophones, 
although a majority in Quebec, are a minority in Canada and 
throughout North America, with the result that both communities 
are entitled to legal and linguistic protection, and this must 
be taken into account.

environmental debt and the income divides that are growing daily, 
he is making the wrong choices.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

will see very large spending on behalf of the Minister of the

terms of climate change and the environment.  This is not one

biggest failures of the Liberal government across the way is the 
complete lack of attention to the environment.  In fact the 
University of Victoria recently did a study that said Canada had 
one of the worst records in the industrial world and that on 25 
environmental indicators we now rank 28 out of 29 countries in 
the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister chose to put some $15 billion on the national debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt about the priority of the environment 
to Canadians and to the government.  That is why we have put $1.1 
billion toward climate change over the next five years.  That is 
why the government allocated in the $2 billion municipal 
infrastructure program a minimum of 50% of the total program to 
go to green municipal infrastructure, which is primarily 
dedicated to drinking water and to sewage treatment projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Announcements of these kinds of investments have already been

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, another major failure of the Liberal government across 
the way has been the growing gap between the rich and the poor. 
After eight long lean Liberal years, Statistics Canada says the 
rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, yet the 
minister did not even mention equality or poverty in his speech 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister not put some of the money he put on the 
debt toward narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor?  Why 
not put more money into the war against poverty instead of all 
$15 billion on the national debt? 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is exactly what the government did.  Perhaps the 
hon. member was not paying attention at that point, but $900 
million as of July 1 will go into the child tax benefit.  That is 
primarily to deal with low income families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a look at our tax cuts, overwhelmingly they were 
dedicated to middle and low income Canadians.  Let us look at the 
kind of money we put into health care and education to help low 
income Canadians.  If we look at the numbers, we see that while 
the gap between the rich and the poor before taxes, and nobody 
should be very proud of it, after taxes that gap narrows.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B>

changed our procedures to tighten up on that.

created the national crime prevention strategy.  The strategy has 
supported over 1,600 projects across the country so far.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of 
Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I noted prior to question 
period, the focus of the enforcement efforts of the Government of 
Canada is against high level drug suppliers and traffickers 
rather than individual users.  This is in accordance with the law 
enforcement priority of the government with respect to organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized criminal groups control a very large portion of the 
drug trade in Canada.  The drug trade in turn provides a prime 
source of profit for these groups.  Over the past number of years 
the government has taken action against organized crime.  I will 
outline some of the things we have done in this very important 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has provided significant RCMP budget increases in 
the year 2000-01 in order to bolster organized crime efforts and 
enforcement in this area.  We have also made available 13 
integrated proceeds of crime units which have been set up across 
the country to deprive criminal groups of their profits and 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also made amendments to the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act to ensure that people convicted of offences related 
to organized crime were no longer eligible for accelerated parole 
review.   Further, new money laundering legislation has created 
measures for reporting suspicious financial transactions and the 
cross-border movement of large amounts of currency.  Amendments 
were made to the criminal code in 1997 to specifically address 
criminal organization offences.  These criminal code measures 
against organized crime will be reinforced in Bill C-24 currently 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the steps the Government of Canada has taken 
in the past and will continue to do in measured efforts.  We know 
this is a very serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that despite these efforts it is likely to be 
impossible to completely prevent all drug trafficking in Canada. 
That would be ideal but it is highly unlikely and unrealistic. 
Nevertheless enforcement can help to ensure that efforts toward 
prevention, treatment and rehabilitation do not become undone in 
an environment of unrestricted access to illegal drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize that more can be done with respect to Canada's 
drug strategy.  Now is not the time for Canada to rest upon its 
achievements, many that they are.  Rather it is time for further 
action to build on what has been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries around the world struggle with the issues surrounding 
drug abuse and addiction.  Canada unfortunately is no exception. 
The government is clearly committed to the issue and to further 
action.  As part of that action I think it is very appropriate 
for parliament to be reviewing drug abuse issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore have no hesitation in supporting the motion.  It 
represents the kind of forward moving thinking we need as a 
government and on all sides of the House to prevent the kinds of 
things that are taking place in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the constituents of my riding and indeed all 
Canadians, we need to pull together in this very important area. 
It behoves all of us to move together to try to see if there are 
solutions.  In the process we must remember that treatment, 
prevention and rehabilitation are key words when it comes to 
these kinds of things, especially when it comes to our young 
people who I believe Canadians, wherever they live in this great 
country, want us to prevent going down this path because at the 
end of the day there is nothing but trouble there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say firsthand that all Canadians recognize the problem. 
Certainly we as a government recognize it.  We need to work 
efficiently and effectively to ensure that what we do in this 
important area produces results at the end of the day.  I believe 
that is in keeping with the great values of the country and of 
the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is timely.  I think it is one that we as a government 
can and will support.  It is something of great note to all 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I take this opportunity to support my hon. colleague in this 
important effort.  Keeping drugs off our streets and away from 
our children is one of the primary efforts of the Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency.  It is obvious that CCRA takes seriously the 
job of protecting Canada's borders.  I for one am very proud of 
the work it is doing.  Saving Canadians from the harmful effects 
of illicit drugs is an ongoing battle.  I believe CCRA has shown 
that it is up to the fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime knows no boundaries when it comes to smuggling drugs. As a 
Canadian I find it comforting and reassuring that there are 
dedicated men and women at our borders who work diligently to 
prevent harmful, illegal drugs from entering the country.  Day in 
and day out some 3,500 customs officials work tirelessly to stop 
illegal goods and inadmissible people from entering our country. 
Canada's customs officers are the frontline defence against the 
entry of illegal drugs into Canada, and they do an excellent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some statistics.  Last year customs officers seized 
almost $900 million worth of illegal drugs at the border.  Some 
$900 million worth of drugs were kept off our streets, out of our 
schools and away from our children.  Drugs have been found in 
some very interesting hiding places.  Customs officers have 
detected drugs hidden in shipments of fish, shoes, statues, 
machines, picture frames, toys and even pineapples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the CCRA seize almost $900 million worth of illegal 
drugs?  The CCRA uses a variety of tools to help stop the entry 
of illegal drugs into Canada.  The equipment can detect drugs 
hidden in various types of substances such as plastic, coffee and 
clothes.  The use of contraband detection equipment and detector 
dogs enables customs officers to conduct effective, non-intrusive 
inspections and allows the CCRA to focus on high risk individuals 
and their goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several years the CCRA has invested approximately 
$12 million in contraband detection technology which is deployed 
at ports of entry into Canada.  Equipment such as ion scans, 
contraband detection kits, laser range finders and night vision 
equipment help customs officers detect drugs in clothing, 
luggage, vehicles and marine containers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are detector dogs.  Forty dog teams strategically located 
across Canada were responsible for over 1,000 seizures of drugs 
and weapons last year.  For 22 years detector dogs have played an 
important role in stopping narcotics from entering the country 
and helping the CCRA to be more effective and efficient in its 
anti-smuggling initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCRA has forged important partnerships with other law 
enforcement agencies to stop the entrance of illegal goods into 
Canada.  Together the RCMP and the CCRA have intercepted many 
elaborate schemes to smuggle drugs.  Just this week, as a result 
of interdepartmental co-operation, 179 kilograms of cocaine with 
a street value of over $70 million was seized.  This is an 
excellent example of law enforcement agencies working together to 
fight crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These partnerships extend worldwide.  As part of the world 
customs organization, the Canada-U.S. shared border accord, the 
Caribbean customs law enforcement council and the Canada-U.S. 
cross border crime forum, the government is making a real 
difference in protecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCRA also works closely with the private sector to combat 
drug smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partners in protection program involves a two way 
partnership in which a shipping or trading company and the CCRA 
sign a memorandum of understanding outlining ways to work 
together to stop illegal activities.  The CCRA provides guidance 
on how to spot illegal activity and in turn the importer provides 
the CCRA with information it may have regarding illegal activity. 
I am very pleased that the CCRA has developed such proactive 
relationships with these companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stopping the entry of illegal drugs into Canada is one of many 
ways these joint efforts are working to make our communities more 
safe.  A safer community is a healthier, more prosperous 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partnerships like these help the CCRA fulfill its mandate of 
protecting the border.  They attest to the government's 
commitment to improve the quality of life of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, stopping the spread of drugs is critical to 
winning the battle for a healthy Canadian society.  As past 
experience has shown, the drug problem is one that the CCRA and 
the government take very seriously indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CCRA is dedicated to enforcing Canada's laws at the border, 
stopping the entry of illegal drugs into Canada and protecting 
Canadian citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many young and old people were injecting drugs in back alleys 
which were littered with needles and condoms.  Dirty hotels and 
dormitories looked extremely unhygienic and were full of drug 
addicts sitting or lying on the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So-called refugees around 20 years of age, mostly from Honduras, 
were selling cocaine and heroin.  Almost all of them had about 
$200 in their wallets in assorted denominations, were carrying 
refugee ID cards and had business cards for the same lawyer. They 
wore jewellery and designer clothing and had stereo Walkmans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they spotted the police in civilian clothes and cars 
approaching them they blew whistles to warn their colleagues.  As 
soon as the police stopped them they stuck out their tongues, 
spread their arms and hands, and made themselves ready for 
inspection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some attempted to swallow drugs they had wrapped in plastic. 
Many tried to hop on the skytrain to escape and sell drugs 
elsewhere.  Their suppliers were hiding in nearby restaurants. In 
the area where illicit drugs are sold there are pawn shops to 
make it convenient for drug addicts to sell stolen items such as 
TVs, stereos, computers, et cetera.  Restaurants, back alleys and 
other facilities in the area are like one stop shopping centres 
for drug addicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the community have completely neglected the 
issue.  What I saw in Vancouver was the rule of the jungle.  All 
three levels of government have talked and studied too much. They 
are all talk and no action.  They have no effective plans. The 
future for those people looks bleak, and that is a pity.  It is 
certainly not the Canada I dreamed of before immigrating here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also visited the port of Vancouver where there is no effective 
control of drug imports.  They are not even minimized, let alone 
stopped.  Less than 3% of cargo containers arriving at the port 
are examined.  Of those that are, many are found to contain 
drugs.  The government disbanded the Vancouver port police.  It 
should have strengthened and supported them by co-ordinating 
their activities with the coast guard and other law enforcement 
agencies.  Instead it abandoned them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder the lower mainland of B.C. has the highest 
needle exchange rate in North America.  Our law enforcement 
agencies are stripped of resources to fight crime and illicit 
drugs.  Our laws have no teeth.  The government has no vision, no 
plans, no priorities and no focus.  Illicit drugs are even 
available in government controlled prisons where criminals are 
supposed to be punished and not entertained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have visited schools in my riding.  The students tell me they 
can purchase drugs faster than they can have pizza delivered.  In 
a 1999 survey, 53% of students said cannabis was easily or very 
easily available.  That is almost double the 28% recorded in 
1981.  Some 36% of students in 1999 said someone had tried in the 
last year to sell them drugs, while 32% said they had observed 
someone selling drugs in school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder the Marijuana Party received 3.5% of the votes 
in last night's B.C. election.  About 100,000 people in B.C. 
supported the Marijuana Party.  That tells us a great deal. 
Marijuana growing operations can be found on every third block or 
so.  These grow-ops are a huge money making operation.  Marijuana 
is traded pound for pound with heroin south of the border.

things the ordinary taxpaying citizen finds it very difficult to

patient told me he had been on drugs 15 years and had never been 
home to see his family.  He said he was completely changed after 
receiving treatment and had met with his daughter for the first 
time in 15 years.  He had tears of regret and joy in his eyes 
when he told me the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another individual had been on drugs for many years and had 
stolen car stereos and women's purses to finance an expensive 
drug habit.  He also repented and was a completely changed 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my surprise, the city of Surrey was reluctant to renew the 
clinics' operating licences.  I noticed no support for the 
clinics from the community or from any level of government.  I 
understand that there may be problems.  However there must be a 
solution as well.  The seriousness of the issue should not be 
ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A head start program would help the early detection of children 
susceptible to drug and alcohol abuse and other anti-social 
behaviour patterns.  A head start program could offer more 
effective treatment.  Although a motion was unanimously passed in 
the House I have seen no action from the Liberal government.  It 
lacks vision and political will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More resources should be allocated to detect drugs which cause 
impaired driving.  A breathalyzer may show no alcohol but a 
driver may still be under the influence of illicit drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Illicit drugs are not only unregulated; they are in many cases 
lethal.  The increased purity of heroin and other drugs is 
causing deaths.  In Vancouver there are on average 147 deaths per 
year due to overdoses of illicit drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 Canada's long term drug strategy was to reduce the harm 
associated with alcohol and other drugs to individuals, families 
and communities.  The strategy accepts that eradication of the 
problem is impossible and that we must simply live with the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strategies always talk of damage control, harm reduction, cures, 
intervention, needle exchanges, et cetera, but not preventive 
measures.  The solution is to stop illicit drugs from being 
manufactured and imported into Canada.  We need to protect our 
borders.  We need regular inspections at our borders and ports. 
The coast guard, surveillance planes, port authorities, local 
police forces and others must work together and with the tools 
and resources they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national drug strategy in partnership with federal, provincial 
and municipal governments must work at the community level to 
reduce drug use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to infiltrate gangs and criminal organizations.  The 
RCMP and other law enforcement agencies have trouble getting 
permission to use wiretaps and other surveillance efforts.  It 
takes about 1,500 pages of petition to get such permission.  Even 
then the monitoring period is limited to 90 days.  The whole 
process must be restarted after the 90 days expires.  The 
investigation suffers in the meantime.

needs to be done to complete the investigations.  Our law 
enforcement agencies need the high tech tools.  However the 
criminals have money and state of the art technology while our 
police struggle to maintain 20 year old technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is the motivation for criminal activities.  Their money 
and assets should be confiscated and turned over to our law 
enforcement agencies to be used to fight crime.  We need tougher 
laws and we need to have them enforced.  We need the punishment 
to fit the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would establish tough deterrent measures and not encourage 
crime with the lax laws and lax sentences that the Liberals 
allow.  What we have here is a Liberal government that lacks a 
will and a vision to address these things.  It has been the cause 
of the problem for so many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time to set up a committee to look into all these 
things so that something effective can be done.  I appreciate 
speaking to the motion and I look forward to all members of the 
House supporting the Canadian Alliance motion to set up a 
committee on the non-medical use of drugs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to today's supply motion. I will 
begin by thanking my hon. colleague from Langley—Abbotsford for 
bringing this important matter before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today is very serious and addresses a very 
real problem in society.  One of the greatest problems facing our 
young people today is the non-medical use of drugs.  Over the 
past number of years the prevalence and availability of 
non-medical drugs have been overwhelming.  Today's youth face 
enormous pressures in the world.  Our young people face constant 
forms of peer pressure, one of which is to conform to the usage 
of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are entire industries based upon the non-medical use of 
drugs.  Internationally or nationally we can all point to 
situations where this is true.  My home province of British 
Columbia is well known within the drug world for so-called home 
grown marijuana, as well as other non-medical drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues have already mentioned several different 
statistics concerning non-medical drug use.  As the aboriginal 
affairs critic for the Canadian Alliance I am particularly 
concerned with the problem of substance abuse among our native 
people.  I would like to take a few minutes to review some of 
the statistics because they have not yet been entered into the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse in its 1999 profile tells 
us that indigenous Canadians are at particular risk for substance 
abuse.  The majority of aboriginal youth are at two to six times 
greater risk for alcohol problems than other Canadians. 
Indigenous Canadians have relatively high rates of illicit drug 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like members to consider some of the following rates. 
According to the <I>Canadian Journal of Public Health</I> over 73% 
of natives use marijuana, 37% sniff glue, 6% use solvents, 5.5% 
use heroin, almost 10% use speed, 14% use LSD, almost 5% use 
cocaine and 8% use crack.  Most disturbing about all these 
statistics is that the usage rates are higher than in the 
non-native population in some cases by as much as four times. 
This is completely unacceptable.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our native people are among the most susceptible to non-medical 
drug use and the statistics seem to bear it out.  I have been 
involved with native people as a counsellor and my wife and I 
have been foster parents for over 25 years.  I have seen the 
results of many of these problems, and they are heartbreaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To see individuals, families and in some cases entire 
communities devastated by the use and abuse of alcohol and 
non-medical drugs is startling.  The results of these actions 
should not exist but sadly they do.  As parliamentarians and as a 
nation it is time that we take real action against this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, my home province is well known in the 
drug world for illegal drugs.  Unfortunately along with the 
beauty and the splendour of a craggy remote coastline come 
thousands of miles of secluded coves and places to import illegal 
drugs from offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with hydroponic growth operations, the remoteness of the 
gulf isles and many parts of the B.C. interior provide ideal 
locations for marijuana fields.  The RCMP searches and finds 
some, but with its limited resources, the overwhelming scope of 
the territory and the sophistication of the growers only a small 
percentage of the drugs are actually found and destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nanaimo is the largest city in my riding.  Many tourists call it 
the hub city.  However it has also become known as the heroin 
capital of Canada.  What a sad title to bestow on such a 
beautiful city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have referred to the drug problems of Vancouver's 
downtown east side and they were absolutely right to do so. There 
are very serious problems there.  I remind the House that there 
are serious and equally devastating problems not only in a city 
like Nanaimo but throughout a thousand other cities and towns 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what the problem is.  It is important that we start 
doing something about it.  Our past actions have not been wrong. 
They were all well intentioned but for some reason do not seem to 
be working.  We have had an escalation, a growing epidemic of 
illicit drug use across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other consequences beyond simply the non-medical 
drugs.  Drugs are not free and profit is the motive for the drug 
dealers, be they at the local level or the major international 
players in the drug game.  Another consequence involves both petty 
and major crimes and prostitution, including the exceedingly 
young.  My heart breaks when I see young people 13 and 14 years 
of age trapped on the street.  These are children. They are our 
future and their lives are being squandered and wasted in a life 
of drug abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse estimated that 
the economic cost of illegal drugs was $1.37 billion or $48 per 
capita.  The largest cost, approximately $823 million, was as a 
result of lost productivity due to illness and premature death. A 
substantial portion of the costs, $400 million, was for law 
enforcement.  Direct health costs due to illicit drugs were 
estimated at $88 million.  There was also the social cost of lost 
families whether through death, illness or retreat from society 
as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many potentially great minds in the nation have been lost to 
the illegal use of non-medical drugs?  Can we afford, financially 
or otherwise, to continue down this sordid path of human sorrow? 
Can we in all good conscience stand idly by and allow these 
problems to continue?  I suggest not.

have a striving good enough to be called a failure. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not fail for a lack of trying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues arising out of today's debate is the medical 
use of marijuana.  We all recognize that this is a contentious 
issue.  When we refer to marijuana we often relate it to the 
criminal element and the role it often plays in leading to other 
drugs.  I personally do not dispute this but I do believe there 
is room in the debate for the medical use and research of 
marijuana, particularly in a non-smokable form, such as pills and 
inhalers.  In turn, it should be treated like any other drug that 
is approved and regulated in Canada.  The body of medical 
research appears to be showing that the medical use of marijuana 
can be most helpful for some diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should differentiate between the medical and the recreational 
or street use of marijuana.  If there is a possibility of bona 
fide medically proven results then we should not close the door 
to this kind of help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned that the motivating factor of profits is the 
drug world.  From a personal perspective, I think we need to 
rethink how we approach the drug problem.  The criminal element 
in our society is interested in only one thing and that is 
profits, not just small profits but obscene profits that have no 
regard for the waste of human lives and ongoing suffering.  In 
simplistic terms, if we can remove the profit element we can 
reduce or ideally even eliminate many forms of non-medical drug 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do that?  How do we remove the profits from the sales? 
I do not have the answer and that is why we need this kind of 
committee.  It may be able to come up with some kind of 
innovative way to take the profit motive out of the drug scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be part of the debate today.  I hope the motion 
receives non-partisan support from right across the House, and 
that it will eventually lead to something being done about the 
most pressing problem among our young people today, which is the 
use of illicit drugs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his intervention.  He mentioned 
the medical use of marijuana.  One of the debatable points on 
that is that youth may get the wrong signal.  They may think that 
if marijuana was fine for medical use, then maybe it would be 
fine in a more recreational form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would my hon. colleague prevent youth from getting the wrong 
signal from those who say that medical marijuana is just fine? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a distinction has to be made 
in our society, particularly when we are engaged in any kind of 
drug education with our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally I do not believe that the recreational use of 
marijuana should be a legal activity in Canada.  Studies show 
that the continued use of marijuana, particularly in a very heavy 
way, does lead to all kinds of physical consequences, such as a 
lack of concentration and brain damage of some kind that 
eventually leads to the person becoming a far less effective 
person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we also have to be able to say, and this is a basic 
philosophy, that all things created do have a good intention 
because that is the way the Creator meant it to be.  We need to 
see the benefits of marijuana for medicinal purposes.  We must 
also make it very clear to our young people that the continual 
recreational use of marijuana is very harmful to them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy that the hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Cowichan is actually entering the debate because he has 
firsthand experience from his past life of some of the results of 
the abuse of illicit drugs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One should appeal to people who have had that experience as to 
why they are so involved in this particular debate.  It is no 
accident that we are talking about setting up a special study 
committee for this particular subject.  The problem is all around 
us.  I wonder if the hon. member could explain perhaps in more 
detail just how in his family or in the families of his friends 
we could actually create a change in attitude toward the illicit 
use of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do thank my hon. colleague 
for the question.  It is true that in my former life I did have a 
great deal to do with people who were addicted to non-medical 
drugs.  It is a very involved process.  It means coming alongside 
people in critical situations and providing them with real 
reasons for, first of all, why they ought to live.  In many cases 
people just simply do not want to live.  We have to provide them 
with a reason for living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That goes not only to the physical, but to the spiritual, to the 
emotional, to the whole person.  I was very involved in helping 
people work those things through so that they did not have to 
become dependent upon a chemical substance to try to find the 
reason for living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as foster parents of aboriginal children, we are very well 
aware of the results, for instance, of fetal alcohol abuse and 
what happens in little lives when the mother drinks heavily 
during gestation.  That little life, who never asked for that, is 
scarred by it forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow we have to do something to help change the attitudes of 
people at a primary level so that they know life is worth living. 
Many times, I think, that is why people enter into this kind of 
thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening closely to the debate.  I congratulate the 
member for Nanaimo—Cowichan for his informed remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took note of the latter reference in the remarks to the 
medical use of marijuana, but I have to say that this is an 
infinitesimally small piece of whatever this problem is.  In the 
overall scheme of what we are dealing with today, marijuana has 
to be very low in priority.  In my own personal view I am not too 
sure why it even shows up on the Richter scale.  However, it is 
an illegal substance in our law now.  Let us focus on the big 
picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the costs of illegal drug use.  There are of course 
the huge costs of lost lives, the policing costs, costs of 
prosecution in the courts and sentencing in our institutions, 
incarceration costs, rehabilitation costs, medical treatment 
costs, the costs of theft of goods, break and enters in homes, 
thefts of automobiles, the VCR, and the jewellery.  How many 
grandmother's rings have been stolen in the last year by people 
stealing to pay for a drug habit?  It is an epidemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also corruption costs.  In some quarters our society 
is being undermined by the sheer corruption of the organized 
crime that drives the illegal drug trade.  If left unchecked it 
will undermine our society, as it has some other societies around 
the world.  It is insidious.  So far we have been lucky but we 
should not take our luck for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of needle sharing are huge.  One statistic I have here 
covers injection drug use, with all the harm it causes, such as 
overdosing, HIV, hepatitis and other communicable pathogens, 
suicides, abscesses, infections, poor nutrition and endocarditis. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT70"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT70"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An estimate for all the direct and indirect costs for only 
injection drug use is $8.7 billion over a six year period.  That 
is principally related to HIV-AIDS.  The costs related to 
hepatitis C that comes from injection drug use are anticipated to 
overtake even the costs of treating HIV-AIDS over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are huge costs which we as a society are now bearing or 
are about to bear.  I do not think anyone has truly added up the 
costs.  Is there one minister in the House whose responsibility 
it is to add up the costs of illegal drug use?  The Minister of 
Health will have a perspective.  The solicitor general will have 
a perspective.  The customs and revenue agency will have a 
perspective.  There are a lot of perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My taxpayer constituents do not have the total number, but it is 
huge.  I am sure most members in the House will agree with that. 
We do not even know what the total is.  What cost do we put on a 
young life snuffed out by illegal drug use? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that we have to radically change the way we look at 
illegal drug use.  We must radically change it because the 
methods we are using now are virtually the same methods we have 
used for the last 75 or 100 years.  Essentially they involve 
criminalizing the use of certain drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be some real restraints in changing the way we deal 
with this.  I know that and most members of the House know that. 
I am sure that by the end of this debate, maybe by the end of my 
own remarks, there may be some phone calls to my constituency 
office.  I do not know.  However, I am suggesting that we have to 
radically change the way we look at this if we are to make any 
progress as a society.  I think we are afraid to change.  Some of 
us are and some of us are not, but I think a lot of us are afraid 
to change the way we look at drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another constraint.  We as a country are bound into 
certain international treaties that oblige us to criminalize 
possession or use of certain drugs.  We as a country are a good 
boy scout.  We criminalize it, we prosecute it and we follow the 
other countries in these international conventions.  That does 
not give us much freedom.  We have to be bold and take the 
initiative.  We do not have to reject the treaties, but we have 
to find ways to find new approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our neighbour to the south, the U.S.A., is a constraint, believe 
it or not.  The way the U.S.A. treats this issue is the same way 
it has treated it for 75 or 100 years.  It is based on 
enforcement and interdiction.  That is not working.  It is not 
working there and it is not working here.  It is imported across 
our border just about the same way that a lot of other things are 
imported across our border.  I am not talking about the drugs.  I 
am talking about the policy, the method of enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult for us here to do things in a way that is 
radically different from the way policing and medical 
counterparts deal with it across the border, but we have to find 
a way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, we have to look at our own attitudes toward these drugs. 
Why do we criminalize certain drugs?  Is it that the drug removes 
some degree of sobriety?  Is it that individuals get a bit of a 
buzz with marijuana?  Is that the evil thing?  However, maybe 
that is the same thing that alcohol does.  We do not criminalize 
alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it that some drugs are addictive?  Is it evil because it is 
addictive?  Possibly, but cigarette tobacco is addictive.  It is 
just about as addictive as a drug can get. 
We do not criminalize tobacco, but we can identify the drug, it 
is addictive and we sell it in corner stores.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not intrinsically sobriety or addictedness that is the key 
to why we criminalize.  I do not think we know why we criminalize 
certain drugs, but it is in our law and we just cannot change. 
However we have to, we must, find a way to break out of that 
paradigm.  If we do not, we will not find any new solutions and 
we will stay on the same track we have been on since the years of 
prohibition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will suggest that we make a significant change.  We do not 
have to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  We will have to 
maintain strict laws and strict enforcement.  For those who 
distribute, for those who create the stuff, for those who break 
the laws, we will maintain strictness.  We cannot forget that we 
are dealing with organized crime as a business.  Organized crime 
is driving virtually the entire gamut of illegal drug use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep the dynamic in mind.  The dynamic is not that 
people intrinsically as individuals walk out and seek addictive 
drugs.  The problem is that a businessman, a criminal, is 
bringing in the drug and marketing it to the individual.  That is 
the most important part of this dynamic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I suggesting that we legalize drugs?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I notice that you have been indicating the passage 
of time.  It is not my intention to split my time.  I would like 
to continue and if there is some time left perhaps my colleague 
could use that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Now that the parliamentary secretary 
has raised the prospect of whether or not he will split his time, 
I am in a bit of a dilemma.  Either he will split, and there is 
very little time left, or he will not, the difference being that 
at that time I would recognize someone across the floor should 
someone wish to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will continue speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I will continue speaking is that this is an 
issue that I brought with me to the House when I was first 
elected in 1988.  I believe that this is the first occasion I as 
a member have ever had, as a result of the motion being moved 
today, to address the entire package of the issue of the illegal 
use of drugs.  It has been a long wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that when I first arrived here the 
political context was not right in the country to look at new 
approaches.  I found significant political impediments in 
suggesting new approaches.  People were well-meaning, but perhaps 
12 or 15 years ago we did not grasp the significance of all of 
the evil and the costs involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I think our Canadian society has changed and the country may 
be ready.  We are not sure.  Therefore I am not going to suggest 
that we legalize anything.  We do not have to legalize all 
illegal drug use.  I am not even suggesting decriminalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is much more serious than could be addressed by 
simple legalization or simple decriminalization.  The reason it 
is more complex is that we are dealing with the business of 
organized crime.  Whatever move society makes on the chessboard, 
organized crime will make a countermove.  If we legalize, it will 
work with that.  If we decriminalize, it will work with that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I look at this, it is my view that we should maintain our 
strict laws and enforcement of the illegal black marketing of 
drugs, the importation of them and the conspiracies to do that. I 
am not advocating any change in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I advocate is what I call medicalization, not legalization, 
not decriminalization but medicalization.  The principal aim is 
to remove the potential customer from organized crime.  Society 
will get its best bang for the buck by doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main way we can do that is to recognize when individuals 
have become addicted and dependant on illegal drugs and as soon 
as they interface with our justice system or any of our 
institutions, medical or otherwise, divert them into a medically 
supervised program.  I am not putting parameters on it or being 
specific about it.  What I am saying is when people have become 
addicted to a drug and are dependent on it, they should be given 
that drug under medical supervision.  At the same time they 
should also have access to whatever programming is available to 
get them off the drug and give them back their life.  However 
they must have access to the drug.  In some cases if they do get 
it they die or they do not make it very far.  Those are difficult 
times.  I will give a little comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian bears the costs of illegal drug use.  We 
have the costs associated with home break-ins, stolen cars, 
medical costs of needle sharing and the spread of HIV-AIDS and 
hepatitis.  There is also the heartbreak associated with 
individuals who have to steal and cheat to sustain an illegal 
drug habit.  We could give them the drug for $5, a drug that 
would cost them $1,000 or $2,000.  In other words, medicalize it 
and bring them into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall a friend of mine in the United States took a slightly 
more liberal view.  He said that we should give them a barrel of 
the drug, then the person would be satisfied.  We have to go 
further than that.  We have to realize that an addicted person is 
essentially a sick person.  A drug dependant person needs 
continuing medical care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essential part of this solution, and I hope it is a 
solution, is to divert the customer of the organized criminal 
into the medical system and make the drug easily available to the 
person through a medical doctor's supervision.  Maybe the medical 
doctor could switch the drug from A to B to C, but the doctor's 
goal would be to service the person's addiction, while at the 
same time moving that person off the drug dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the methadone treatment programs.  Some of 
these programs work and some do not.  However there are many 
other ways to approach the challenge of moving people away from 
addiction.  We are still experimenting. 
Federal tax dollars are supporting pilot projects now.  Huge 
dollars are being spent by provincial governments for the same 
thing.  I am not so sure we have added up all the money, as I 
said earlier, but that is now going on across Canadian society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take away the customer from organized crime.  We could 
ascribe a societal dollar cost to every person who is dependent 
on illegal drug use, let us say $10,000, $50,000 or $100,000 a 
year because the costs are huge.  We could medicalize the 
addiction which would stop them from purchasing drugs from 
organized crime.  We would then greatly reduce the direct or 
indirect costs.  I point out that in many cases the 
medicalization would be there anyway, but it would be done in a 
much more targeted way for the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reiterate the term that I used which is medicalization. 
It is absolutely essential for Canadians through their government 
to compete against the ugly, evil organized crime.  We have to 
take away its customers and profits.  That will reduce the cost 
to our society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member a couple of 
questions that have to do with the medicalization and the 
treatment of drug addicts.  There is some merit in the 
suggestions that he made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the assumption underlying the treatment of addicts and 
the medicalization of drugs starts somewhere.  If we help these 
people get off the addiction that is useful.  However what about 
creating a program that would help them not to get started in the 
first place.  It seems to me we are dealing with a symptom of a 
deeper problem.  Could he address that problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite 
right.  Prevention is a heck of a lot easier and a whole lot 
cheaper than the cure.  We have ongoing drug education programs 
in schools and various other fora across the country.  We spend 
taxpayer money now doing that.  However we are failing.  It is 
not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would not be far off if he is saying that we 
should spend more money on it and put more resources into it.  I 
would agree with him 100%.  More resources for drug education and 
a preventative initiative would help a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some drug education since I was a kid in grade 
school up to now, but we could do more.   However we are failing 
and I do not want to fail any more.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was glad to hear the remarks of the parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader.  I know this is an 
issue that he and all members of the House take very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for him though deals with the issue of priorities. 
He spoke of his own personal view of this issue as it being 
something that necessitates government attention, that 
necessitates the focus of all the stakeholders, such as health 
and justice officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to sound too partisan but why has it taken opposition 
motions to get the government to recognize some of these 
priorities? Whether it be issues of foot and mouth disease, 
agricultural, water safety or justice, why is it that it takes 
the opposition to motivate the government to take the initiative 
to address some of these issues that appear to be so apparent and 
so obvious? Welcome to the bandwagon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has his government not taken the initiative on something 
like this in the past?  It is going on in the other place, but 
the opposition appears to be the only one able to raise these 
issues in the House of Commons to the extent that the government 
is prepared to take notice and more important, take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member of 
the opposition who moved this motion.  I congratulate members of 
all parties for participating in the debate.  Government members 
will speak to this issue from various perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member on the government side, I have to acknowledge that 
governments tend to get stuck in the status quo.  I mentioned 
earlier the obstacles of changing attitudes in relation to 
fighting the problem of illegal drugs.  The government is locked 
into treaties and the current drug enforcement initiatives. 
Things are going on.  The government is working at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in the government or in the House has been charged with the 
challenge of finding a new way to deal with it?  Who is going to 
admit that we are failing?  That does not happen often.  We are 
unlikely to find a minister who will stand in the House or 
anywhere and say that the government is failing at something. Our 
marks are low and we can do more.  I am reasonably confident we 
will do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in the House for 12 years and this is the first time 
I have had an opportunity to address this issue head on and as 
comprehensively.  I sat in opposition for five of those twelve 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not one member of the House, not one opposition party nor not 
necessarily the governing party, but the whole House will have an 
opportunity to deal with this issue by way of a vote.  This may 
move the yardsticks in a way that we have not moved them before. 
I am grateful for that opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his remarks.  I know that this is 
something that is very dear to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a comment about the marijuana problem being 
infinitesimal, that it was a trivial part of this whole issue.  I 
am not sure if he was referring to the medicinal use of marijuana 
or the recreational use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he was to make a trip out to my part of the country on the 
west coast he could take a look at the grow ops.  We have one 
grow op pop up every day in my city of Surrey alone.  One pound 
of marijuana goes south across the border and comes back as a 
pound of cocaine.  Marijuana is a monstrous issue out there 
because of the involvement of organized crime.  The cash involved 
fuels organized crime.  It is anything but a trivial issue when 
it comes to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he care to clarify his comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not underestimate for a 
moment the amount of money involved in illegal marijuana growing 
and trafficking.  However we cannot convert marijuana to cocaine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the member's analogy about what goes out and what 
comes back.  However people who use marijuana do not inject the 
drug.  The basic marijuana usage we are thinking about in this 
issue does not involve addiction or injection drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wildly speculating, but if marijuana is for recreational 
use and not addictive then people are paying for it with their 
spare change and are paying for it on the black market.  However 
they are not stealing to support their recreational use of 
marijuana.  I am making assumptions that I cannot back up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about all of the costs of illegal drug use, I was 
talking about billions of dollars of direct and indirect costs. 
The marijuana component of growing and selling on the black 
market may be part of the big organized crime picture, but in 
terms of its actual total piece of the whole, in my view it is 
small.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We may learn more if this committee is put in place.  I may 
learn a great deal.  I respect the views that the hon. member has 
indicated, that the organized crime element of marijuana is big, 
because it is illegal, because it has been criminalized.  If we 
were to decriminalize it, if it had no addictive properties, if 
it were treated like tobacco, it would not even be criminalized. 
It would not show up on the Richter scale.  It would be a cash 
crop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave it there.  I may say too much.  The phone may be 
ringing, as I said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to enter this debate because I 
think this is a very significant subject.  The honour of it 
really is to have the support of the Minister of Health, to have 
the support of the hon. secretary and to recognize that virtually 
everyone in the House is on the same page on this one.  I find 
that very rewarding and very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, however, it seems to me to be a rather 
interesting phenomenon that this problem has been talked about 
since at least 1986, when a set of policies was created by the 
then Conservative government.  There was a further policy 
development by the Liberal government following that.  We have 
been talking about it for 15 or 20 years and nothing seems to 
have been done about it. It seems to me that we need to look at 
this a little differently and ask why not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Conservative Party just raised the 
question:  why is it that if the problem is so significant the 
only way it gets to see the light of day is through an opposition 
party raising it on a supply day motion?  If it is so important, 
why is that the case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me there are several reasons.  First, I think as a 
society we need to recognize that in order to really deal with 
the problem we have to analyze the dynamics of a social change, 
because what we are dealing with here is a social change, a 
lifestyle change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Surrey North mentioned this marijuana 
business and said that it is an infinitesimal part of the drug 
trade.  It is not.  It is very significant.  In British Columbia, 
of course, we grow very high quality marijuana.  In fact it is so 
good that a pound of marijuana goes south into the United States 
and there is exchanged pound for pound for cocaine.  Cocaine is 
far more addictive than marijuana, but the marijuana has that 
kind of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an advocate of drug use in one way or another.  In fact 
I despise tobacco.  I think it is a terrible addiction that we 
have, but we have it.  In order to change that, we have to change 
our society.  It used to be socially unacceptable to smoke.  It 
is not any more and we have accepted that.  It is not a criminal 
act.  However it is a criminal act to smoke marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that as a society we have to decide what shall be 
criminal and what shall not be criminal.  There are three parts 
to this that we need to recognize.  First we have to recognize 
what problem we are facing with this business of drug use.  What 
is the problem?  It seems to me we have had ample demonstration 
of what the problem is.  Our young people are using it.  Our 
adults are using it.  The incidence of the use of the drug is 
increasing.  That is the problem.  Why is it a problem? Obviously 
somebody does not want people to do this.  If all of us wanted 
them to take drugs, it would not be a problem.  We would not be 
talking about it.  Clearly we have recognized it as a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, if it is a problem, whose problem is it?  Is it your 
problem, Mr. Speaker?  Is it the Prime Minister's problem?  Is it 
the government's problem?  Is it our problem?  Is it the parents' 
problem?  Is it the kids' problem?  Is it the teachers' problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is sure.  If it is no one's problem no one is going to 
do anything about it.  If we are constantly pointing the finger 
at someone else and saying “That is your problem, so you go do 
something about that”, what happens?  We will not do anything 
about it.  If we point the finger elsewhere then nothing is going 
to happen either.  As long as there is an exercise like that 
going on, nothing will change.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that we first need to recognize what the problem 
is and then recognize whose problem it is.  Knowing that, we can 
then understand the situation and finally accept it.  Until we do 
those things we will do nothing.  We will talk about it forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition brought to the attention of the House a 
motion today which says that we should form a special committee 
to study the drug problem seriously with a view to examining the 
whole gamut of the issue.  It is not easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently I attended the Civitas conference here in Ottawa. 
It was a think tank conference, part of which involved a debate 
on whether we should keep the criminalization of drugs or 
decriminalize drugs.  There were excellent debates on both sides 
of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What came out of the debate was a recognition that all of us 
need to be far better informed as to what the real issues are. 
Certainly there is a criminal element to it.  Organized crime is 
involved.  Also, there is a predilection to seek pleasure versus 
anything else and to do whatever one can to invoke the hedonistic 
tendency that all human beings have.  We need to clearly 
understand the implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member mentioned in his remarks that there has 
been drug education in the schools.  Yes, there has been a very 
complete exposé of what drugs will do to these kids.  What has it 
done?  It has not resulted in a decrease in the use of drugs.  It 
has done the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being asked, as the principal of a school a long time 
ago, if I would become part of a pilot project on drug education. 
I quickly did some research in schools where this took place.  I 
compared the incidence of drug use in schools where the program 
had been implemented with that of schools where it had not been 
implemented.  Guess what?  The incidence was directly related to 
the degree to which the drug program had been implemented in that 
school.  There was a direct increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We told the kids more about drugs, so guess what they did?  They 
practised.  Their curiosity was stimulated and they said “Gee, 
if it is that much fun maybe we should try it”.  Little did they 
realize that these drugs are extremely addictive, particularly 
some of the harder drugs.  Then of course there are other abuses 
that take place.  For example they put some kind of drug in a 
bottle of Coke and drive each other nuts.  They do this.  They 
play tricks on each other, sometimes to the great chagrin and 
terror of the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly drug education, or education about drugs, which is 
really what it amounts to, is not the answer.  It does not do 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we have to do if we are really serious about 
making a change is know what we are dealing with.  What is this 
drug phenomenon that people are subjecting themselves to?  The 
second thing we have to do is understand what drugs do to people, 
how they are addictive and what can possibly be done to combat 
them.  Finally people have to say “I understand what it is, I 
accept that it is my problem, my issue, and I have to make a 
decision”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member recognizes it is probably more important 
to have preventive programs than it is to have rehabilitative and 
treatment programs.  No one becomes a drug addict without making 
a choice to take drugs.  That choice had to be made first.  It is 
a matter of choice and if it is a matter of choice, we also know 
that we are dealing with morals or morality.  Choice is 
determined by the value structure that one holds.  If we get into 
that kind of debate, can we imagine where it would take us?  I am 
not surprised that the Liberal government seems to first test 
which way the wind is blowing and then decides what the value is, 
rather than deciding what its principles are in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that it is essentially a moral choice in 
the first instance.  We then have to move from there. 
There are people who will argue that all we have to do is have 
good laws and everything will be fine.  I do not know of a single 
law that has made people good, but I know of a lot of good laws 
that have been made by good people.  There is a fundamental 
difference.  Let us not ever deceive ourselves by thinking that 
making good laws will make people good.  It will do nothing of 
the kind.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we do have laws, and we do, we had better make sure 
those laws are observed and that the people who break those laws 
are dealt with in an appropriate, fair and equitable way.  The 
consequences have to be strong enough that the rewards for 
breaking the law are not greater than the consequences.  That is 
what is happening now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I know RCMP officers who pick up these marijuana 
growers in Kelowna.  There are a lot of growers there.  These 
people who break the law and grow marijuana do all kinds of 
things besides that.  They produce a drug that is illegal in the 
first instance, but they also break the utilities law and a lot 
of other stuff.  They get fined $2,500 for doing it.  For an 
enterprise that generates something like $200,000 to $500,000 a 
year, $2,500 is just a good business licence.  They will not 
quit.  They will keep doing it.  There are no serious 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we do this kind of thing we really create an environment 
that says to criminals it is okay if they break the law because 
after all it is just the way things are and society really does 
not frown on it too much, so they can keep on doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that scares me more than anything else is that there 
seems to be a syndrome developing that if it is legal it is 
right.  It could be legal, but it could be extremely immoral and 
false.  An example is the Feeney case.  Members will probably 
remember it.  A man killed an individual and left a trail of 
blood.  The police followed the trail of blood to a mobile home. 
They went in and asked the individual if he killed the man.  He 
said yes and showed them the bar he did it with.  The police took 
him to headquarters and charged him with murder.  They took him 
to court.  The judge asked if the police had a warrant.  The 
police officer said no.  The judge said that then the individual 
did not commit the crime, that he could not be convicted on that 
basis.  What a miscarriage of justice, what a miscarriage of 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to one of the chief justices here in Canada, 
Justice L'Heureux-Dubé.  At the 26th Canadian criminal justice 
congress in Ottawa in 1997 she said that “the search for truth 
is the very purpose of criminal justice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the Feeney case, truth was completely subject to a 
legal process. It had nothing to do with justice.  That is the 
kind of thing that is happening in regard to the enforcement of 
drugs and it is happening in other cases as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another case that is extremely significant in 
connection with this.  It has to do with drugs.  In 1997 in 
Ontario a judge decided that a principal's authority extended to 
searches of students suspected of bringing drugs to school. 
However, giving his good sense some time off, the judge then 
added, but not if the principal enlists the aid of a police 
officer.  The good judge was pronouncing on a case in which a 
crime stopper tip alerted police to a student who had put drugs 
in the pocket of his red jacket to smuggle into his high school. 
An officer visited the principal and together they checked the 
student's locker.  There was no red jacket.  The pair proceeded 
to the gym where they saw the red jacket and spoke to the 
student.  Knowing the game was up, he said “You'll find it in 
that pocket in my jacket”.  They did.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the mere presence of a policeman stuck in the judge's 
craw.  Moreover no cautions were given.  There was no suggestion 
to the student of his right to counsel, et cetera.  The evidence 
of both words and drugs were suppressed and the student was 
acquitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the truth?  Where is the commitment to decency and 
justice?  The kids and the parents know it.  The teachers and 
principal know it.  These are the things we have to deal with. 
These are not matters of law.  These are matters of choice to go 
in a certain direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A high school principal can proceed on mere suspicion but a 
police officer cannot.  We pay officers to enforce the laws and 
then hobble them more than someone we pay to administer a place 
of learning.  As for drugs, not to mention knives in our schools, 
this is scary stuff and becoming pretty common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago, in fact it was 20 years exactly, at the Victoria 
Composite High School in Edmonton we had a student that walked 
down the hallway, lifted his pant leg, pulled out a knife and 
stabbed a fellow student.  What do we have coming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another case.  It involves two caring parents; their son 
George, aged 14; the accused John, a young 15 year old stray; and 
a judge who knew more than enough charter law.  John had left his 
home and was kindly allowed by George's mom and dad to stay in 
their home.  In 1996 George and John donned masks and armed with 
knives robbed a convenience store in Etobicoke, Ontario.  As they 
were fleeing, George dropped his wallet near the store. This 
brought officers to call on his parents.  George's mother made 
sure that George had a chat with the officers who produced the 
wallet.  He admitted to the robbery and implicated John as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John was questioned.  Knowing George had ratted on him, John 
told the officer that it was not a balaclava; they were wearing 
stockings.  Months later he was videotaped by police telling all. 
He also agreed to testify against George in a plea bargain and 
was subsequently let go with 18 months of probation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 George went to trial with two strikes against him but 
the judge excluded his confession saying that George had felt 
intimidated by the officers.  Next the judge rejected John's 
evidence against George, which he held to be a derivative of 
George's conscripted admission, that is John would not have 
tattled on his pal if George had not first got them both into 
trouble.  George went free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now back to George's mother who had ensured that her son 
co-operated with the officers.  Did she believe that it would 
have been better for her son to face the music, pay his social 
debt and get on with his life, or did she agree that the charter 
knew better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not write this book.  It was written by Alex MacDonald who 
used to be the attorney general of British Columbia.  He called 
his book <I>Outrage: Canada's Justice System on Trial</I>.  He 
says that we do not have a justice system in Canada, that we have 
a legal system.  He talks about the prodigal law and he says that 
the justice system, the legal system, expands to fill the time 
and money available.  Where is the truth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of things that terrify me.  It is one of the 
main reasons I am here.  We have to get to the point where we 
recognize that human beings make decisions.  We as human beings 
make decisions and choices.  I am so concerned that we 
concentrate on whether we are Liberal, Conservative, NDP or 
whatever rather than on getting to the point where we agree that 
the time has come for us to share a common set of values.  In 
that common set of values there should be things like character 
so that individuals will clearly distinguish between what is 
right and what is wrong, so that there will be a commitment to 
courage and duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times do we find in this place that we consider it a 
duty to serve on a committee or a duty to be present for a vote, 
or whatever the case might be?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost as if we are forced into doing it.  The whip has to 
whip us into place.  That should not be necessary.  Out of 30

walls of evil and to make sure there is a law that will allow 
people to feel protected and secure to walk down the streets 
safely without worry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians trust us to do that.  It is our duty to do that and we 
should have the courage to stand and say that some things are 
wrong.  There is something very seriously wrong when we reward 
the results of crime to a greater degree than the results of 
doing what is right.  That is what is happening.  We protect the 
criminal more than we do the victim.  It is backward and as long 
as we have that kind of process we will not resolve the drug 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My appeal to all members is that we set up the special committee 
and that we empower it to obtain all possible resources so that 
we can analyze this problem and then have the courage to deal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canada's drug strategy reflects a balance between 
reducing the supply of drugs and reducing the demand for drugs. 
Drugs affect every country in the world.  Problems associated 
with substance abuse, production of illicit drugs and drug 
trafficking cause harm to individuals, families and communities. 
Only through the co-ordinated action at the national and 
international levels can we reduce the demand, illicit supply and 
trafficking of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's drug strategy involves 11 federal departments, 
provincial and territorial governments, addiction agencies, 
non-governmental organizations, professional associations, law 
enforcement agencies, and community and private sector groups. It 
is a co-ordinated effort to reduce the harm associated with 
abusive drugs, alcohol and other substances.  The strategy is 
based on four pillars: prevention, enforcement and control, 
treatment and rehabilitation, and harm reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through prevention we seek to prevent individuals from falling 
prey to substance abuse.  Through enforcement and control we seek 
to prevent these substances from falling into the hands of the 
wrong people.  Through treatment and rehabilitation we seek to 
help those who have a substance abuse problem to overcome the 
problem.  Through harm reduction we seek to prevent the problems 
of disease, illness and community malaise that often go hand in 
hand with substance abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harm associated with substance abuse can be physical, 
psychological, societal and/or economic.  Substance abuse is 
primarily a health issue, not simply an enforcement issue. 
Reducing the harm is considered to be realistic, pragmatic and a 
humane approach as opposed to attempting solely to reduce the 
supply of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada believes that a reduction of the harm 
can be achieved by a number of initiatives: first, by increasing 
the understanding of the risks associated with illicit drug use, 
particularly among young people; second, by reducing high risk 
patterns of alcohol and other drug use; and, third, by 
identifying and promoting best practices in substance abuse 
prevention, education, treatment and rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aiming at the illegal importation of illicit drugs and 
reducing that importation.  We are hoping to reduce the 
availability of illicit drugs on the streets.  We are reducing 
the ability of persons involved in the supply and trafficking of 
drugs to make use of the profits from their illegal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a simple response and it involves 11 departments in 
Canada's drug strategy.  We are taking action on all those 
fronts.  Canada's legislative framework is the backbone of our 
approach to drug control.  Three international conventions guide 
domestic legislation, enforcement and control. 
They are:  the 1961 single convention on narcotic drugs and its 
1972 protocol; the 1971 convention on psychotropic substances; 
and the 1988 convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs 
and psychotropic substances.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's legislation controls the import, production, export, 
distribution, possession and use of psychoactive substances that 
can result in harm when distributed or used without controls. 
The law also provides mechanisms to ensure that the export, 
import, production, distribution, possession and use of 
internationally regulated substances are confined to medical, 
scientific and industrial purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 Canada proclaimed in force the Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act which modernized and consolidated the existing 
legislation and provided enforcement agencies with additional 
tools necessary to combat illicit drug related activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alcohol and drug treatment and rehabilitation program, ADTR, 
is another element that supports the Government of Canada's 
efforts to reduce the harm associated with alcohol and other 
drugs for individuals, families and their communities.  Through 
this program, provincial and territorial governments have access 
to funding so they can improve accessibility to effective alcohol 
and drug treatment and rehab programs and services.  Youth and 
women are major target groups for services funded under ADTR. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada places a high priority on international co-operation and 
recognizes the need for a co-ordinated international response in 
order to address the global problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International co-operation through the United Nations 
international drug control program, UNDCP, and the 
inter-American drug abuse control commission, CICAD, are the main 
elements of Canada's international drug control activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's annual contributions are $1.5 million to the UNDCP and 
$600,000 to CICAD. Our activities internationally mirror the 
balanced approach taken domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada took the lead in the development of a Multilateral 
Evaluation Mechanism, or the MEM, as it is commonly known, which 
was agreed to in September 1999 at a meeting of a working group 
chaired by Canada's former deputy solicitor general, Jean 
Fournier, in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first implementation round of the MEM began soon thereafter. 
The first reports from the MEM were submitted to leaders at the 
summit of the Americas in Quebec City, in 2001, and were well 
received. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The growth of drug abuse in many jurisdictions and the impact of 
trafficking and associated criminality have strained the 
resources of many countries in the hemisphere that are seeking 
technical assistance and training to develop the health, social 
and law enforcement infrastructure to deal with the problem. 
Canada provides assistance to countries in the region through 
bilateral programs of the RCMP, Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency, Health Canada, Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
and the Department of Justice.  Canada also monitors and reviews 
experiences and innovations in other countries to assess the 
potential for applying new approaches here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's drug strategy is continually evolving.  The types and 
nature of substance abuse problems change as does the national 
and international environment.  Responses to Canada's drug 
problems, and our efforts on both demand reduction and supply 
reduction, are reassessed on a regular basis to ensure continued 
relevance and appropriateness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, before I get into my speech I would like to say 
something about what is happening in my family at this moment. My 
daughter-in-law, Lainy and my son Dan are in the process of 
delivering a child.  This will be our fifth grandchild and 
somehow I have a feeling that Lainy is doing most of the work.  I 
am very excited and just waiting for the phone call to find out 
how things are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, the topic today is for my grandchildren and 
perhaps for other members' grandchildren.  This is about the 
future of the children of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to gently scold the government for half a second. 
I happened to note in an exchange a few moments ago between the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough of the Progressive 
Conservatives and the Liberal member for Scarborough—Rouge 
River.  The Conservative member was absolutely correct in 
pointing out that this is not a Liberal initiative.  It is a 
shame because this is a serious problem and perhaps the 
government does need to be prodded.  The government should be 
more focused on the future of our children.  I commend the member 
for Langley—Abbotsford who has been absolutely tireless on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is that a special committee of the House be appointed 
to consider the factors underlying or relating to the non-medical 
use of drugs in Canada and make recommendations with respect to 
the ways or means by which the government can act alone or in its 
relations with the governments at other levels in the reduction 
of the dimension of the problem involved in such use.  This is a 
scourge and is a tremendously serious problem for us within our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Illicit drug use contributes to crime and law enforcement costs 
in several ways.  It also breaks down much of the fabric of our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However with respect to the costs, first there are the costs of 
enforcing drug laws.  Second, chronic or dependent use of 
so-called hard drugs, like heroin, cocaine, crack, speed, LSD and 
other strong hallucinogens, is often implicated as a contributory 
cause of property crime particularly burglary and theft.  Third, 
drug use contributes to crimes of violence.  Assault, homicide 
and other crimes of violence have resulted from turf wars in the 
illicit drug market.  Illicit drug users are disproportionately 
involved in incidences of spousal and child abuse.  Even cannabis 
has been implicated as a contributory cause of crime with regard 
to impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal offenders have disproportionately high rates of illicit 
drug use.  Up to 80% of offenders report using illicit drugs 
during their lifetime.  That is an important number.  There is a 
connection there.  We cannot get away from it.  Fifty to 
seventy-five per cent show traces of drugs in their urine at the 
time of arrest and close to 30% were under the influence of drugs 
when they committed the crime for which they were accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug addicts committed to treatment often have criminal records. 
There is clearly a relationship between illicit drug use and 
crime but it is not always casual.  The fact that a crime is 
committed by someone using illicit drugs does not necessarily 
mean that the drug use caused the crime to be committed.  However 
there are several plausible casual connections between drugs and 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the pharmacological effects of the drugs.  Each 
drug has its own track, its own trace and its own way of 
impacting the drug user.  There is a relationship between drug 
consumption and violence for certain illicit drugs.  Cocaine, 
other stimulants and PCP could induce violence by the loss of ego 
control, deterioration of judgement, induction of irritability 
and impulsiveness or the production of paranoid thoughts.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is a need for addicts to commit crimes to support 
their drug use.  There is some argument that it is part of a drug 
culture, but when people become addicted to heroin and cocaine, 
they are unresponsive or their consumption of the drug is totally 
unresponsive to price.  They simply go out and do more break and 
enters, or do more property offences or perhaps even become 
involved violently with people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, addicts adopt a deviant way of life that accounts for 
both their drug use and their criminal behaviour.  As I mentioned 
before, there is a relationship between those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, crime results from systemic violence inherent in the 
illicit drug trade.  We are familiar with different turf wars 
that occasionally happen.  We are also familiar with the fact 
that in many very strong ethnic communities in Canada, people who 
have come to Canada to build a better life for themselves and for 
their children are preyed upon by others within their own ethnic 
community who are involved in the drug trade.  It is a very 
serious problem for law-abiding citizens, no matter what their 
origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are police costs.  According to figures I have in front of 
me, in 1992 the attributed costs of policing were estimated at 
$208.3 million for illicit drugs and approximately $168 million 
was expended on the enforcement of drug laws per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are court costs.  There are correction costs because the 
people involved in these property offences and other things end 
up being put away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the issue of customs and excise and the costs 
involved there.  Obviously we have to have borders that to the 
best of our ability will interdict the flow of drugs in and out 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, speaking of in and out of Canada, let me read a paragraph 
from the city of Toronto Drug Prevention Centre's article about 
the truth about marijuana.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to population surveys, past year cannabis use among 
Toronto adults remained relatively stable in 1999 at about 10%. 
Among Toronto students, past year use of cannabis increased from 
9% in 1993 to 18% in 1995, levelling off at 19% in 1997.  The 
1999 survey found past-year cannabis use among 26% of junior high 
and senior high school students in Toronto, the highest rate 
reported since the survey started in 1994. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 almost one in five, or 18%, of drug treatment clients 
cited cannabis as a problematic substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth about marijuana is that it is not the innocuous 
substance that many of our hippie generation grew up with.  The 
truth about marijuana is that it is cultivated and has a potency 
that was absolutely unimagined before.  The truth about cannabis 
is that it has the potential to create tremendous serious 
societal problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude with this statement.  Often young users come 
from a background of poverty, physical and sexual abuse and 
substance misuse, particularly alcohol.  Even before any 
influence by their peers, they are very much at risk of 
developing problems with alcohol or drugs.  Experimentation with 
drugs and altered states of consciousness can start out 
innocently and often does not lead to harm.  However young people 
can develop severe drug dependence and can be suddenly forced to 
navigate a complex, criminal environment to obtain the substance 
they are physically dependent upon to make it through each day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the motion by the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford 
will be supported by all members because it is with the young 
people of Canada, it is with the very basis of our Canadian 
society that we must wrestle with these problems, and the buck 
stops here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows:  the hon. 
member for South Shore, the Lumber Industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise and to speak in support of the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we heard from my colleague from Kootenay—Columbia, we have 
heard many statistics, many studies and many comments, and those 
certainly have their place in the debate.  It gives us some kind 
of an indication of the scope of the problem when we refer to 
numbers.  Unfortunately, numbers tend to make things cold and 
impersonal.  Human lives are reduced to numbers through 
statistics.  We can never lose sight of the human element in the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to just take a bit of time to make a few comments 
on my personal experiences with some of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall back to November 4, 1992 when I was watching the 
evening news in B.C.  There was a report about a double homicide 
in Cloverdale, B.C., which is a community in my city of Surrey. 
As the report unfolded, we knew that two women had been murdered. 
That developed over the next couple of days.  I recall a couple 
of days later seeing on the news again a gentleman who was red 
eyed and crying.  He was the father of one of the women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I and my family were recoiling at that time from 
a very specific traumatizing incident two weeks prior to that.  I 
had the man's name so I took it upon myself to find his number 
and call him.  I told him if he ever wanted to talk to let me 
know.  It is an awful way to meet people but Bob and Pat are now 
among some of my closest friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the story developed, those two women, and I will not name 
them, shared a house in Cloverdale.  One lived downstairs in her 
basement suite with her three children and one lived upstairs by 
herself.  A gentleman friend of the upstairs tenant paid her a 
visit.  An argument developed over something and eventually he 
pulled out a knife and stabbed her.  The lady in the basement, 
not knowing what was going on, went upstairs to see what all the 
ruckus was about.  He stabbed her on his way out.  The lady 
upstairs died instantly.  The lady downstairs managed to make it 
out to the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other element in this is that the lady downstairs had three 
children.  Two of those kids were in school that day and that is 
where they found out what happened to their mother.  The four 
year old was at home and saw the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how this ties into the debate.  When the case was 
investigated and was before the court, it was discovered that the 
gentleman friend was stoned on cocaine.  He used the defence of 
cocaine psychosis.  In other words, he said he blacked out and 
did not know what he was doing.  Two minutes later there were two 
women dead as he ran out of the house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend talked about our generation.  There was a song by a 
group back in the sixties called <I>I Got Stoned and I Missed 
It</I>.  I do not buy that kind of defence.  We could get into a 
whole debate about what is an adequate or acceptable defence for 
killing people and whether cocaine or alcohol intoxication is 
valid, but that is a debate for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is two women are dead, three children are without a 
mother and one of those children will be completely traumatized for 
the rest of his life because at four years old he saw his mother 
stabbed to death.  All because of what?  Cocaine, an illicit 
drug.  That is part of the human side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in this place have quite frequently heard me talk about 
how I like to ride along with the RCMP in my community of Surrey. 
I encourage all members to do the same, not just to have a cup of 
coffee with them for an hour and talk shop, but to get in the 
right-hand seat of a police cruiser and spend 12 or 14 hours 
overnight on a Friday or Saturday.  These are usually pretty good 
nights to find out what goes on in the streets.  I try to do 
that every couple of months with my detachment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a couple of experiences.  It tends to be fairly 
routine most nights but every once in a while something comes 
along.  I recall one time about a year and a half ago when we got 
a call very early in the evening about a shoplifter in a 
supermarket. 
When we responded to the call the security guard was holding a 
woman in her mid-thirties with no identification who had stolen 
three cans of Enfalac, baby formula, a hand puppet and a few 
little things. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we questioned her we found out that her welfare cheque had 
not come and there was no food in the house for the baby.  When 
the officer ran her name through police records he discovered she 
was on probation and was not supposed to be within 100 metres of 
the store.  She was in breach of her probation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could the officer do?  Where was the baby?  The baby was at 
the drug recovery house where the mother had been living for nine 
months. The woman's husband was minding the baby.  He was able to 
visit on weekends because he lived in another drug recovery 
house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could we do?  Did the police officer breach her, which 
means take her to jail right away?  No, he did not.  He tried to 
help her and give her a break.  The woman was taken to the house 
where the father, himself a recovering drug addict, was with the 
six month old child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police officer wrote her up and made her promise to appear 
at the police station the following morning and to appear in 
court about a month later.  He lectured her.  I gave her a piece 
of my mind and told her she was not doing her baby any good.  I 
told her that people were trying to help her.  The police officer 
could have taken her straight to jail but he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came back to Ottawa.  About a month later I received a call 
from the police officer.  The woman had never showed up at the 
police station and never showed up at court.  There is now a 
double warrant for her arrest.  What will happen to the child? 
That is my concern.  Another young child will now go into foster 
care as a ward of the state.  The whole vicious cycle will start 
over again because of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be done?  I could take a hard line against the 
mother and say we should refuse to help such people.  I could say 
that we give them all the help in the world but they do not want 
to take it and we should finally say enough is enough.  However I 
am more concerned about the child because we have started the 
cycle all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all too easy to make such judgments, especially if one has 
never seen how it is on the street.  People here should look at 
the downtown east side of Vancouver or the core of Whalley in 
Surrey and see the junkies.  They are called junkies and losers. 
I can tell hon. members that they are not.  They have problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on a call one night, again on a ride along, to a house 
where a man had found his brother dead on the kitchen floor with 
a syringe beside him.  He was in terrible shape.  He was skinny, 
scrawny and dirty.  I stood and looked at him and knew he was 
someone's son.  It was the brother who called us.  Let us never 
lose sight of that.  We are not dealing with losers.  We are 
dealing with people who have problems and we must do what we can 
to help them.  Some want to be helped and will be helped.  Others 
do not and we must deal with them too.  They are all someone's 
kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have kids of my own.  The most traumatic incident in my life 
was the murder of my son.  It was drug related.  My son was not 
involved in drugs but the six people who attacked him and his 
friends that night were stoned.  They had been doing drugs all 
day long.  That is the human side of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sense in this place a real mood of co-operation to do 
something about this issue.  We all have different ideas, 
philosophies and approaches as to what should be done.  However 
it is high time to bring those differences to the table, talk 
them out and do something.  The country cannot take it any more.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have an opportunity to speak about a topic that has generated 
enormous debate in the country.  I congratulate the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford who has spent a lot of time on the issue and 
has brought it before the House today.  For those who might have 
just tuned in this is a motion to review Canada's laws regarding 
illicit drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the issue from the perspective of someone who 
has had a stethoscope around his neck for much of his life.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take on the human component of this as well, as my 
colleague did.  I will talk about some of the experiences I had 
with the treatment end of drug problems and reflect upon how I 
think there is a need for a fresh look at what Canada is doing 
with its drug laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by talking about a jurisdictional issue.  This is 
reflective of the different positions of Canada and our large 
neighbour to the south.  I noted this week that the U.S. supreme 
court has taken a specific stand on the medical use of marijuana. 
The supreme court said there is no redeeming value to marijuana 
for medical purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada we have taken a different approach.  We are 
trying to figure out what diseases are helped by marijuana.  This 
is a significantly different approach.  My own feeling is that as 
a physician I was able to use the strongest painkillers available 
for those who were ill, especially at the end of life as 
palliative care for those with cancer and very serious illnesses. 
I could use heroin.  Everyone said that was reasonable because it 
was being used for a specific purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that if marijuana is the only thing that will help people 
with a serious disease at the end of their lives it is reasonable 
to use it.  I do not think smoking marijuana is ideal for this. 
Research has been done to get marijuana in different forms, forms 
that will allow it to be used in a waxy capsule or even used like 
the Nicorette patch.  In my mind that is reasonable.  For end of 
life issues, for palliative care, for severe problems when no 
other medication works, I do believe that there is room for the 
medical use of marijuana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what happens if our big neighbour to the south says 
“Forget that.  That will not happen in the U.S.”?  What might 
Americans do who are living close to the border, have a severe 
illness and feel that marijuana is the only thing that will help? 
They might well come to Canada.  They might well cross the 
border.  In a sense, they might end up putting some strain on our 
medical system here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring that up because I think it is very important in regard 
to jurisdictional issues that we do not forget what is happening 
nearby.  We could end up with major problems if we forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one debate I have been involved in and have listened to 
both sides of it.  Some say that softer penalties for drugs would 
make sense.  In some cases that is a compelling argument, because 
I think an intelligent individual looking at the drug issue in 
Canada would say that we have not made huge progress.  I am now 
stepping a little bit into what I think the debate in this 
committee might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the argument that softer drug laws would be of 
benefit?  To get a sense of that answer, I look at places where 
this has been tried.  It is possible to look at other 
jurisdictions.  In some parts of Europe the penalties for drug 
use are substantially different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a jurisdiction fairly close to home that gives me some 
sense of what might happen.  In Alaska, the home of the free, the 
home of “don't tell me what to do”, they decided that the 
penalty for marijuana use would be virtually zero for adults. 
There would be no criminal penalty, no fine, nothing.  If an 
adult wanted to smoke marijuana in Alaska not so long ago, have 
it was the attitude.  That is the pioneer spirit, is it not, 
from the frontier?  Yukon is the jurisdiction close at hand. Both 
of these jurisdictions are similar.  They are fairly isolated and 
the populations are similar.  A comparison of the two was done 10 
years later.  The use of marijuana in the adolescent population 
doubled in Alaska compared to Yukon, so it became obvious that 
this approach in that location was not a great success. 
I have heard individuals argue and debate that those are just 
straight statistics.  From my perspective, to simply make it 
easier for kids to get an illicit drug is not the answer at least 
in that locale.  I am not convinced that is the solution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another specific example from my own experience.  In 
my little black bag I used to carry a medication called Demerol. 
I had little vials of it with me all the time.  The proper 
chemical name for it is Meperidine.  I would take it on house 
calls.  If people broke a leg, for example, I could give them a 
shot of Demerol and they would be more comfortable going in the 
ambulance.  It was thought to be fair and reasonable for me to do 
that.  Demerol is very inexpensive to buy.  I needed a triplicate 
prescription to get a supply and kept it with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a powerful, inexpensive narcotic.  What is it worth on the 
street?  It is not worth $10 for a big vial of Demerol.  It is 
worth $1,000, plus or minus.  Why is that?  It is not available 
on the street.  It is a potent narcotic.  It is very close to 
heroin in its effects and so it is very popular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way to get Demerol on the street is to break into a 
pharmacy or swipe it from a physician's black bag or get it from 
the manufacturer.  There are other ways.  There are people who 
wear the cloak of physician who dispense it.  It gets out on the 
street in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use it as an example because it is an inexpensive medicine 
used for legitimate purposes which is very valuable in the 
illegal market.  There are break-ins to get it.  There are 
assaults to get it.  There is damage done to individuals to get 
this drug.  There are illicit activities for those who are using 
the drug so they can have it available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What then would happen if we just made all these drugs available 
as that one was to me?  That example tells me that it may not be 
the complete answer either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of those who say that we should put all our resources into 
treatment?  That is also a good debate.  There would be nothing 
directed toward those who were trying to supply the drug.  We 
would just let people do what they want.  There would be no 
penalties to the addict and the addict would be a patient.  We 
would make the drugs available, license places to distribute them 
and might even tax them.  There would be resources for the public 
and they would be very clean.  It would not be illicit or illegal 
as the source would be government sponsored.  What does that 
sound like?  It sounds like the way we already handle one major 
drug, alcohol, which of course is a drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my practice I was able to talk with a number of addicts.  I 
should like to tell the House what treated addicts say.  When 
treated addicts ask themselves why they started using drugs, the 
recurrent point I hear from them is that they started because of 
a broken family, peer pressure, loneliness, or because pushers 
tricked them.  Why did they quit?  Some quit because they hit 
bottom. Some found religion.  Some had a wonderful rehab 
counsellor or friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is about what society should do.  My colleague who 
put the proposal forth suggests that we take a very careful look 
at the issue and debate it carefully.  I support that and hope my 
colleagues across the way will as well.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA MARINE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK229">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ)</B> moved that Bill C-253, an act to amend the Canada 
Marine Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to put before the House of 
Commons this bill I tabled, which aims to bring the Canada Marine 
Act into line with the reality of our regional ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I will give a bit of background on why this bill 
had to be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Government of Canada decided to institute a policy 
of divesting itself of regional ports. Some ports were inactive, 
others were operating.  Some were not cost effective, others 
were. The federal government therefore decided to establish a 
policy that would enable local communities possibly to acquire 
the port facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, the port of Cacouna was affected.  A port 
development corporation took this question on and studied the 
matter in depth.  I would say it learned a lot about managing a 
commercial port like that of Cacouna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule also spread to all regional ports along the St. 
Lawrence. Analysis has shown that in the medium term it was 
impossible for the local people to assume ownership, for the 
community to assume ownership, because this was too costly given 
the long term investments. Proposals were made to the federal 
government.  There were counter-proposals, but never any 
conclusion because the infrastructures are indeed too costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this state of affairs, I had a look at the Canada Marine 
Act, with the realization that the federal government had put 
into place for the Canadian port authorities, which are the 
major ports, a structure which retains the government as owner, 
although day to day administration falls to the local community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means huge municipal tax bills can be avoided and allows a 
certain competition between ports.  This has made it possible to 
promote and market the ports. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT88"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT88"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the same thing was not done with the regional ports 
where the federal government in my opinion settled for a kind of 
clearing out of the existing facilities, closing those that were 
absolutely not operational, in order—and I believe it was in 
good faith in so doing—to allow the local communities to acquire 
facilities.  But in practice, as I have said, community takeover 
was absolutely impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the regional ports people thought it over, and I 
have my own ideas of what they concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill, I propose that a regional port may remain 
government property. 
It could be the federal government, but it could also be the 
Quebec government. The responsibility for managing the port would 
be delegated to local interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the introduction of this bill, the Quebec government has 
taken a very positive measure. It has told the federal government 
that it would be interested in negotiating to get a number of 
ports, such as those of Baie-Comeau, Matane, Rimouski, Cacouna 
and perhaps the port of Gaspé, for which negotiations with the 
federal government are already quite advanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal from the Quebec government is interesting. It 
would achieve the same objective as the one that I pursue with 
the bill that I introduced. Indeed, my bill would allow for such 
transactions, because I anticipated that the provincial 
government, namely the Quebec government, could become the owner 
of the facilities and hand over the responsibility for managing 
these facilities to local authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is the result of what I call dropping the whole 
idea of a marine policy for Canada. For years and even decades, 
the federal government has neglected things, even though it is 
responsible for marine issues under the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière knows that 
better than anyone else. 
He fought an extraordinary battle to try to finally get a 
shipbuilding policy, but we are no further ahead.  Despite his 
repeated attacks, his motions and his initiatives, we are still 
waiting for action from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happened with the ports system.  Under the 
constitution, this is a federal responsibility.  But for years 
the government has been penny wise and pound foolish.  When there 
was too much pressure in one sector, when partisan political 
pressure was strong, the government did the equivalent of 
slapping down a bit of asphalt.  It applied just enough to calm 
public opinion to be able to win an election, but there was no 
comprehensive development strategy, just as there was no 
comprehensive strategy for managing waterways such as the St. 
Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we must work very hard in this area.  The proposal 
by the government of Quebec to negotiate in order to acquire the 
ports will be a step in the right direction, particularly as it 
is getting ready to introduce a marine policy.  In the coming 
weeks, for the first time since confederation, there will truly 
be a marine policy to develop the St. Lawrence River, this 
magnificent waterway which allows goods to be transported in the 
best possible environmental conditions.  This is much cheaper in 
the long run.  It promotes sustainable development and will also 
increase communications along the whole length of the river, as 
well as bringing the north and south shores into contact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could reinvent many things, such as cabotage, and allow 
ferries specialized in transporting raw materials, cargo 
material. 
Other ferries could carry standard vehicles and foot passengers 
wanting to get to the other side.  There are all sorts of 
possibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since the federal government had renounced its 
responsibilities in this area, the government of Quebec, at the 
suggestion of Jacques Baril, the minister responsible for this 
area by virtue of his transport portfolio and a very realistic 
and down-to-earth man, saw this as a fantastic opportunity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He visited the port personally and analyses were carried out of 
the potential projects for shore-to-shore transportation.  All of 
this was connected to the immense economic development we have 
seen on the north shore with all the major companies there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This wish of the government of Quebec will be translated into a 
marine policy that will be presented in the next few weeks.  It 
is the outcome of consultation with all stakeholders.  That is 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people I referred to earlier worked in the various port 
development corporations and were part of the consultations, as 
were Quebec stevedores and marine carriers who are shipowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of all this will be the marine policy that is about 
to be announced.  I believe it will be a historic moment for the 
use of the mighty river, an extraordinary rebirth that will 
allow the St. Lawrence to return to what it once was, a fantastic 
means of connection with other continents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week we were visited by a lobby of people involved in the 
Canadian marine industry.  One of the things they explained to 
us was that a lot of shipping within the Americas is done by 
truck, but the main connection between Quebec and Canada's 
businesses and the rest of the world is by water.  We now know 
how important transportation infrastructures are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes down to it, this is often what determines whether 
or not a product can be sold elsewhere.  If savings can be 
achieved on shipping costs, then contracts get signed. 
There is a fairly important issue at stake and that is to know 
where the ships will pass.  Is it not to our advantage to have 
the St. Lawrence used properly and the possibility of going in as 
far as Montreal, then using another means, including the railroad 
or truck, in order to maximize the impact of this industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is passed, this bill we are debating today will make a new 
form of ownership and participation possible for the community in 
port facilities.  At the same time, this would mean flexibility 
so that a provincial government could acquire a number of 
facilities and give responsibility for management to local 
authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This model is to some extent the result of the consensus there 
has been in recent years. I hope that the federal government will 
apply the same sensitivity to this issue it applied in the 
context of consultation on the Canada Marine Act.  Initially, 
Canadian port authorities were supposed to become local owners 
and be subject to all municipal laws, including taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following consultation throughout Canada, the situation was 
corrected.  The federal government retained ownership, but handed 
management over to local authorities.  The results have been 
good.  The model has proven itself.  However, when it came to the 
regional ports, the government neglected to provide for this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the bill I am proposing would be a worthwhile 
amendment, an update of the Canada Marine Act.  It would 
establish these situations and would give regional ports the 
opportunity to help the regions develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area, the port of Cacouna is an important infrastructure. 
A gas pipeline is being built and will, in the medium term, run 
from Sable Island through Rivière-du-Loup to the port, which 
could be used to export gas. The port could also be used to 
export other products, such as the powdered milk that is produced 
in Saint-Alexandre de Kamouraska and sold in North African 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole lumber export trade could also be redeveloped and a 
coastal shipping system could be set up. The link to the north 
shore would relieve some of the road transportation traffic in 
that area, and would prevent problems, particularly for the 
tourist industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we must take a new look at the whole issue of river 
transportation to make it one of the elements of an integrated 
transportation policy, which I think would have been done long 
ago if transportation were the responsibility of one government 
only.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what has happened in the past. Being responsible 
for roads, the provincial government invested money so that 
everything would work fine. The federal government was 
responsible for other things. In some cases, it was so far away 
that it did not necessarily make appropriate investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had there been only one government, it could have ensured that 
its policy allowed intermodal transportation to maximize the use 
of the St. Lawrence River, which could have maximized the impact 
of ports, like the one at Cacouna, where the water is deep 
enough. 
This would have made the port a point of contact with the 
northeastern American states.  This could have led to greater 
economic development than we now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to say that this bill would contribute 
positively to better use of existing port infrastructures in 
Canada.  I know that the regions are prepared to take over the 
management of these port facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that governments, such as the government of Quebec, 
would be able to carry the load of a comprehensive system.  We 
could share use of all the ports, which would maximize benefits 
and enhance international marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that this House is listening and that members pass this 
bill to amend the Canada Marine Act. 
The economies of all regions of Quebec and of Canada would stand 
to benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his work on Bill C-253. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Marine Act, which the member would like to amend, 
calls for a statutory review by June 2003.  Given that there are 
a lot of other items that would certainly need to be reviewed 
under the umbrella of the Canada Marine Act, it is our view on 
this side that his proposals would best be left for review, again 
to be concluded by June 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain a little bit about the Canada Marine Act and why 
we feel the way we do, notwithstanding the good work he has done 
thus far and, no doubt, will continue to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Marine Act was passed in 1998.  It was intended to 
and does help the Canadian port system to become more efficient, 
competitive and commercially oriented to commercialize the 
operations of the St. Lawrence Seaway and ferry services and to 
improve the operations of pilotage authorities.  It marked the 
first comprehensive effort to increase competitiveness and to 
reduce costs in the marine sector.  By making it easier for ports 
to operate according to business principles, it will make the 
marine sector even more competitive than it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of the act are substantial.  Ports benefit from 
reduced red tap, increased freedom to develop contracts and 
leases and to set tariffs and fees, and because funding no longer 
comes from the federal treasury, they will be free to pursue 
private sector capital to finance port projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Marine Act was a product of a lengthy and 
comprehensive review process.  In 1994 the then minister of 
transport requested the House of Commons standing committee on 
transport to undertake a broad review of the marine sector in 
recognition of an inherent need to modernize Canada's marine 
system to ensure that the major ports and other marine 
infrastructures were in a strong position to respond to the 
demands in international trade, which is critical to Canada's 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there was a need for a port system that could 
serve both domestic and foreign shippers efficiently, one that 
was not only reliable and competitive but also one that could 
compete with the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee issued its report in 1995 after hearing 
the views of provincial governments, municipalities, organized 
labour, shippers and other marine industry stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December of 1995, following a further round of consultations, 
we announced our national marine policy and our intention to 
bring in legislation containing comprehensive changes to the 
ports, the seaway, the ferries and the pilotage components of the 
marine industry.

commercial ports are now competing on a level playing field for 
the first time.  They have the tools they need to compete in the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The St. Lawrence Seaway, which runs right past our Speaker's 
door in his riding, has been commercialized with control passing 
to a non-profit corporation controlled by the users of the 
system.  It is saving money on operations.  Ferry services have 
also been commercialized and changes to the pilotage regime have 
been implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Marine Act provided the authority to dissolve the 
Canada Ports Corporation, which the government did on November 1, 
2000.  It was not long ago that the running of Canada's ports was 
being stifled by too much centralized government decision making, 
including the role played by Canada Ports Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To remain competitive with American ports, Canadian ports needed 
to reduce their transaction times and their overhead costs to 
make the kinds of local decisions that make commercial sense. The 
new port authorities have been a great success because control of 
the ports is now in the hands of those best able to adjust to 
competition and introduce greater efficiency in the marine 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sector is vital to Canada's competitiveness in a global 
economy.  It provides us with a key strategic advantage in the 
movement of key commodities for important industries such as 
steel and container traffic.  It is also becoming evident that 
the marine mode is in a good position to benefit and participate 
in the growth of the worldwide tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cruise industry in Canada is witnessing a staggering growth 
on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts in the number of visits 
being paid annually to the Canadian ports and in the amount this 
industry adds to the Canadian economy.  Canada's cruise industry 
is forecast to continue its growth for some time to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that the world looks to the marine mode 
to provide leadership in terms of setting the standard for an 
environmentally sustainable and safe mode of transport.  It is 
evident that the marine mode is not just important for economic 
reasons but because of the Canada Marine Act it has contributed 
to other aspects of our well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the Canada Marine Act was to curtail the federal 
government's extensive involvement in port operations, to 
introduce a high level of commercial decision making, to 
encourage financial self-sufficiency and to reduce inefficiencies 
and overcapacity, which I believe are being achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, under the old regime we believe that the taxpayers of 
Canada were not receiving an adequate return for the funding of 
many port development projects over the years.  To date, as a 
government, we have created 18 Canada port authorities and will 
soon have 19 when the Hamilton port authority is created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada port authorities are defined as federally incorporated, 
non-share capital, not for profit corporations with powers and 
responsibilities similar to corporations established under the 
Canada Business Corporations Act.  Under this regime, which 
combines various aspects of the old port regimes, the Canada 
Marine Act has given Canada port authorities the autonomy and 
flexibility to operate according to business principles and to 
make investment decisions to the overall benefit of the port 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments contained in Bill C-253 will create a 
third class of ports which will receive automatic federal 
funding.  These ports will be competing directly with Canada port 
authorities who are legally prohibited from receiving federal 
appropriations other than under a program of general application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canada Marine Act, port authorities operate in a more 
commercial manner than under previous regimes.  As Canada port 
authorities are not eligible for federal appropriation of funds, 
they are required to borrow funds from private markets. This 
gives port authorities the ability to make investment decisions 
to their overall benefit without government approval in advance, 
thereby allowing a quicker response time in the ever changing 
business environment of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Canada Marine Act gives port authorities the 
ability to make their own operating bylaws and charge harbour 
dues without having to obtain governor in council approval.  By 
making it easier for ports to operate according to business 
principles, cut excessive red tape and reduce overhead costs, it 
puts port authorities in a better position to meet their own 
needs and the needs of their customers.  Also, port authorities 
now have increased authority to lease land and to determine 
priorities associated with capital expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a new port class were to be created and were to receive 
subsidies, it would undermine the level playing field of the 
financial rules and authorities that have been created for ports 
coast to coast.  The government's view is that the current 
proposal is unnecessary and would re-introduce the inefficiencies 
and overcapacity that existed prior to the Canada Marine Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another main objective of the Canada Marine Act was to focus the 
Government of Canada's attention on ports vital to domestic and 
international trade.  These ports have become or will become 
Canada port authorities.  All other ports, except for those that 
serve the remote regions of the country, are to be divested to 
local or regional interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that local users are in the best position to determine 
the level of service required at these ports and that the 
Government of Canada is prepared to negotiate a fair and 
reasonable transfer funding package to help ensure the long term 
viability of these facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, the government has also established a $125 
million divestiture fund.  The purpose of this fund includes the 
following uses: bringing existing port divestiture up to a 
minimum safety or operating standard, covering a portion of the 
cost incurred by the transferee in complying with regulatory or 
insurance requirements, making a lump sum payment to facilitate 
the takeover of a port, assisting a group of communities or other 
interests to take over a collection of ports and to achieve cost 
savings by rationalizing infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the fund is to facilitate port transfers and to 
provide a one time contribution to help ensure the port's long 
term viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of good work has been accomplished by the government 
through the Canada Marine Act.  Its five year review will be 
coming up by June 2003.  I would encourage my hon. friend across 
the way to discuss his ideas with other stakeholders in the 
marine community and to make sure his ideas are brought into the 
mix during that review.  We wish him well, nonetheless, with his 
work on behalf of his constituents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in support of the bill.  I will restrict my 
comments primarily to the experience we have had in my home 
community, an experience which has been less than pleasant in 
spite of what we have heard from the government in the last few 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite interested in the approach that my friend from the 
Bloc has taken in terms of recommending that authority be given 
under this bill to transfer the management and control of these 
ports to the province.  We ultimately would like to see them 
divulged down to the municipality because of the experience we 
have had in the city of Windsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I have indicated, we are quite prepared to support 
the bill because I think inevitably, at least in Ontario, the 
result would be that the province would give the municipality the 
authority to manage and control these lands and the traffic that 
works its way through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support the point my friend from the Bloc made about 
the need for an integrated policy around transport.  However I 
would add that we also need an integrated program that would 
allow the municipalities to do the municipal planning they need 
to do in order for a large city to function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point that needs to be made.  Because of the 
nature of some of the lands that the port authority has in the 
city of Windsor the issue of conservation raises its head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience that we have had in Windsor has not been a 
pleasant one.  There has been a great deal of conflict between 
the local and municipal authorities around the issues of how 
transport is handled and how some of the shipping is done, 
particularly around the issue of municipal planning, and some of 
the lands the port authority holds.  The city has had specific 
designs for not only its land but for some of the land 
surrounding it.  There has been quite severe friction in some 
cases over the role the municipal government has and the planning 
that it wishes to do for these lands in a macro way.  It has been 
thwarted on a number of occasions by the local authority in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I filed a petition with the House a week or so ago concerning 
one specific piece of land that borders the Detroit River.  It is 
a piece of land that would act as a bridge to a large 
conservation area that we have in Windsor but which is controlled 
by the port authority. 
It wishes to develop it in a commercial fashion that would in 
effect act as a barrier for wildfowl that uses the Detroit River 
as a base and moves through this other region.  This particular 
piece of land acts as a bridge.  There is a local environmental 
group in Windsor that has been trying to get the land designated 
as a park but it has received absolutely no support from the port 
authority in that regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been other times where there was development with 
which we wanted to go ahead within the city and it too has been 
thwarted in various ways by the port authority because of its own 
self-interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one additional point concerning the history of 
the legislation that we now have.  My friend from the government 
talked about the review that went on in the mid-nineties that 
culminated in legislation in 1998.  Windsor sent a delegation to 
Ottawa at that time to put forward some specific proposals as to 
how the legislation should deal with the land and the control of 
it and its proposals were totally ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments that are being proposed in the form of the 
private member's bill would be much more in keeping with the 
position that Windsor had taken at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to indicate that my party supports the private 
member's bill.  Assuming that it is not successful in passing, 
and I assume that will be the case given the government's 
position, the issue will be raised again at the end of the five 
year review.  I assure the government and my friend from the Bloc 
that at that time Windsor will be here once again to make 
proposals on how the land should be more properly dealt with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to have the opportunity to say a few words on Bill 
C-253, an act to amend the Canada Marine Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summary at the beginning of the private member's bill 
indicates that the bill would create a new class of port under 
the name “local port council”.  The summary goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional and local ports that become local port councils are not 
required to be financially self-sustaining when they are 
incorporated and may receive financial assistance from the 
federal government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a local court council becomes financially self-sustaining, 
some aspects of a local port council may be transferred to the 
government of the province where the port operated as a local 
port council is located. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is a private member's bill I assume the hon. member 
proposing the bill must have a port or ports in his region or 
constituency that fits the thrust of the bill.  In the ordinary 
course of events many ports that were operated directly by the 
federal government over the years have been placed under local 
port authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see what has happened in some of the 
eastern Canadian provinces and, in particular, in my own province 
of Newfoundland.  The federal government has been delinquent in 
how it has been treating small communities that have these 
wharves.  These little wharves and local ports were built under 
Canada works projects or LIP grants.  Since the current 
administration came to power about 10 years ago it has completely 
abandoned those small communities and has sent them adrift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When communities look for money to do repairs on these small 
local wharves they are given the old song and dance routine that 
it is no longer viable to keep these wharves and ports operating. 
As a result they have become dilapidated.  The federal government 
waves its hand and says that they are not getting any money 
because they have become dangerous and a hazard to navigation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT94"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT94"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is okay for ports that have sufficient traffic and 
an appropriate infrastructure already in place.  They are able to 
get along quite well.  They have financial viability combined 
with the flexibility and sensitivity that can only come from 
independent local management.  However, in the case of small 
communities, the viability of these small ports and wharves 
cannot be maintained without the involvement of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem arises when the local port has dedicated local users 
or it is vital to the local economy but it is not viable in the 
financial sense.  The government appears to be getting out of the 
business of running such facilities as a service to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is currently 
divesting itself of 325 harbours nationwide.  That is a blow to 
the communities.  A full 42% of these ports are located in the 
province of Newfoundland.  I would say to my colleague that there 
is quite a number of them located in Nova Scotia, in Guysborough 
county, and in New Brunswick.  However 42% of them are in 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the state of the province's rural economy, many harbours 
will have nobody coming forward to set up a local port authority. 
Perhaps many of the harbours in other provinces on the list are 
also non-viable in a financial sense.  What will become of them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, many of the wharves, sheds and breakwaters were put 
out to tender for dismantling or demolition, but the watchword of 
the federal government these days is viability or debt.  If it is 
not viable it goes.  The parliamentary secretary gets up and 
gives such glowing reports on the federal government and how it 
is looking after all these things when that is simply not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite him to come to Atlantic Canada.  He should get out of 
central Canada for a change and get out in the boondocks. He 
should come to Atlantic Canada and see what is going on in the 
small communities.  I am sure the parliamentary secretary and the 
Minister of Transport would have a much different outlook on what 
they are doing to these small communities.  The watchword of the 
federal government is viability or debt as far as ports and 
harbours are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally the same applies to airports.  We have many 
airports in rural Canada that are being forced under local 
airport authorities and are now facing a struggle for their very 
existence.  Such airports might be invaluable to the local people 
and economy, but the traffic volumes are not there to sustain an 
economically viable operation.  The end result for many of these 
ports and airports would be closure unless the government is 
willing to subsidize the operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-253 does not directly address the policy question about 
whether or not the federal government should directly maintain 
financially non-viable ports as a public service.  However the 
member proposing the bill is offering the federal government an 
indirect route to maintain non-viable ports by setting up a new 
entity called local port councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill the government is being offered a vehicle through 
which it can subsidize the continued existence of financially 
non-viable ports.  The parliamentary secretary and the Minister 
of Transport would do well to listen to the member who is 
proposing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the wording in the bill reads that the minister may 
approve the setting up of a local port council.  The Minister may 
make financial assistance available to such a port council.  The 
Minister may transfer all or part of such a facility to the 
provincial government if the port becomes financially viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local people in an area might be all for setting up a local 
port council to save a financially non-viable port, but they 
would be dependent on the goodwill of the minister to turn any 
of that into a reality.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give it more teeth, a bill such as this one should try to 
establish certain objective criteria for port viability.  Once 
the port meets those criteria, it is appropriate for there to be 
wording in the bill to say that the minister shall provide 
funding until such time as it becomes viable.  The problem is 
that I am not sure the minister would want to be bound by the 
word shall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government appears to be getting out of running all kinds of 
services that are not financially viable.  If local entities 
cannot run services on a self-sustaining basis, we can expect 
their closure or elimination.  As I said a moment ago, with the 
current government the watchword has been viability or death over 
the last seven or eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else, the member's bill points out a growing reality 
of the total elimination of federal services in institutions in 
rural Canada.  The post office is now in the local drug store. 
The rail spurs are gone.  The local airport is closing.  Ports 
and harbours are being abandoned or dismantled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough said that the 
federal government was hot to trot on trying to get out of a 
whole range of services.  It is looking at banks.  It is looking 
at an awful lot of things.  As I said, viability or death is the 
watchword of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill helps the member draw attention to a potentially 
viable port in his area, and if it sheds light on the problems we 
are having in rural Atlantic Canada, it is worthy of the effort. 
I congratulate the member on presenting the bill.  We certainly 
support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
knowing my interest for the maritime sector, and for 
shipbuilding in particular, members will certainly understand 
that it was with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I accepted 
the invitation extended to me by my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques to speak to his 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second reason why I accepted his invitation. It is 
because—he will not like this because I did not tell him in 
advance—through his dedication to defending the interests of his 
region and his riding, this member and colleague is a model for 
us all. 
He is very active in the House and cannot be accused of being 
negative. The proposal contained in the bill that he drafted 
some time ago and that we are debating today is one that the 
government seems to have considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the remarks made by my Liberal colleague from a riding 
whose name I have unfortunately forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The riding of Algoma—Manitoulin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> I listened to the Liberal member for 
Algoma—Manitoulin and he was very receptive to the idea. It is 
nice to see this kind of attitude from members on the other side 
of the House from time to time. He probably saw the benefit of 
such a policy with regard to ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a third reason for taking an interest in this 
debate. Even though I represent the riding of 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, I was born in the riding of my 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois. 
Specifically, I was in the Rivière-du-Loup section of the riding. 
When I was young, although I am still not all that old, a number 
of election campaigns were waged over the future of the port of 
Cacouna, what we locally call Gros-Cacouna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one Liberal MP at that time, now deceased, and also, 
it must be said, the former mayor of Rivière-du-Loup.  The people 
must have been behind him because he was elected seven times in 
all.  Something really interesting occurred, however.  In just 
about every election, he promised he would get the port.  He was 
a model of perseverance.  After he finally got the port, he lost 
the next election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Prime Minister has learned a lesson from this, and 
feels it is better to make promises than to follow through on 
them.  I hope that is not the case. This was a typical 
situation, and one known to everyone in eastern Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to downplay the importance of the other gulf 
ports, but this was and still is, the most important south shore 
port, next to Quebec. For the region this is a port with a really 
important infrastructure. My honourable colleague's proposed 
solution is an appropriate one, because such an infrastructure 
cannot stand alone overnight the way things are at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The port is still the property of the federal government, which 
wanted to see it taken over by the local community.  The bill 
presented by my colleague is a kind of compromise; it is like 
applying the principle of the community taking over an 
infrastructure of this size, while at the same time saying “Hold 
on, let us be realistic.  This cannot be done so soon, just like 
that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore a matter of amending the Canada Marine Act to 
enable this community, which really wants to take over this 
port, but which also lacks the ability as things stand at the 
moment to develop it as it would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I support my colleague's bill, but there is a project 
even longer in the developing than the port of Cacouna.  It took 
even more elections.  I am talking of the famous merchant marine 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has talked of it as long as I can remember, and I 
became interested in the policy very early on.  This has been 
discussed since the second world war. 
During the war, Canada had one of the largest merchant marine 
and warfare fleets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With three oceans, the longest seaway in the world and the 
presence of the largest market in the world, the United States, 
how is it that we still have to plead for a merchant marine 
policy, a transportation development policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maritime transportation is the most advantageous, the most 
economical in economic terms, the least dangerous in ecological 
terms and the form of transportation that carries 80% of goods 
the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a quick historical overview. A retired general 
spoke to me about the veterans. 
He gave me his point of view as to what had made Canada change 
direction after the war. There were thousands of people working 
in the shipping industry, in ports. Cabotage was booming. What 
happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly describe what happened. Tax havens began to 
appear in the marine sector. People legally use all sorts of ways 
to pay less for people working on ships, to avoid paying 
corporate taxes and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally this was a result of unionization. At the time 
people did not want that. The government co-operated in that 
regard. This is old stuff. This led to unionization by an 
American group. In the end it turned into a big mess.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been talking about this issue for years. If we had had 
one more week last year my bill on shipbuilding would have been 
passed. So far, I have not introduced a new bill on shipbuilding 
because there has been a coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister agreed to set up a committee bringing together 
union officials, employers and his own representative, with a 
mandate to report back to him. The minister has had this report 
for close to two months and he promised he would do something, 
but it takes time. 
Had my bill been passed the problems in shipyards would already 
have been solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the government of Quebec is concerned about this 
issue, perhaps because of the associate minister of transport, 
Jacques Baril. He will soon be presenting a shipping policy 
within the framework of Quebec's jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will revive the issue of coastal shipping on the St. 
Lawrence River. In this context the future is even brighter for 
the port of Cacouna, an important infrastructure that is solid, 
well designed and very well located. Shipping activity between 
ports on the St. Lawrence River in Quebec is one more argument 
in favour of this bill, in favour of an integrated federal 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interprovincial and international trade comes under federal 
jurisdiction. Again, I was impressed this week to see all the 
people who are interested in this issue: pilots, exporters, 
carriers, shipowners, builders. One of the problems that cannot 
be overemphasized is that we need an integrated approach because, 
as far as I know, at least 12 departments are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciated the comments made by our colleague opposite and by 
members of the other parties on this issue. I can see that the 
debate is moving ahead. I remember Rosaire Gendron, who 
represented the riding of my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques some time 
ago. With patience and perseverance, he succeeded in having the 
port of Cacouna built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the bill introduced by my colleague will lead to a true 
policy for the development of small ports in Canada, and in 
Quebec, of course.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that I am quite pleased by 
the favourable reception the member for Algoma—Manitoulin has 
given my bill.  I do not know if I may presume he was speaking on 
behalf of the government, but it is interesting that he thinks 
this should be included in a review of the Canada Marine Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the review will not take place until 2003. 
The process of port divestiture is scheduled to end in 2002. 
There is therefore an undefined period that will not contribute 
to the economic development of the regions.  I am very pleased by 
the favourable reception this bill has had, and would be more so 
if the government had accepted to have it passed as quickly as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the whole issue of the importance of maritime 
transportation, the need for an integrated development strategy 
in this sector, is making itself felt. I think the government of 
Quebec has taken the lead on this issue.  It will be announcing 
its strategy soon, and it will be interesting to see how the 
industry receives it.  I think the consultation undertaken will 
show this to be a joint industry and government project.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good thing if the federal government listened to 
all the arguments put forth by hon. members following the 
awareness day we had on this issue earlier this week. A true 
marine strategy must be developed and implemented as quickly as 
possible to deal with issues such as the merchant navy, 
shipbuilding, intermodal transportation and environmental 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I just wanted to make one constructive proposal 
to give regional ports new impetus so that they can look after 
their development, and to allow local communities to do their 
share in that development, while at the same time not 
overburdening them with the cost of infrastructures, which can 
quickly run into the tens and even the hundreds of millions of 
dollars. It is from that perspective that I submitted my 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased by the general reaction to my bill here. If the 
government feels that it is indeed a worthwhile piece of 
legislation, I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House 
to make it a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not obtain the unanimous 
consent of the House, but I simply wish to conclude by saying 
that the substance of the bill was well received.  I will pass 
the proposals along, so that the Department of Transport can 
consider them.  It will see what is acceptable from its point of 
view, and will discuss them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must avoid years of delay, which will result in 
regional ports being denied a satisfactory tool of development. 
That is my main concern in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hour provided for the consideration of 
private members' business has now expired. As the motion was not 
selected as a votable item, the item is now dropped from the

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had a 
question some time ago on softwood lumber.  What brought my 
question about was the fact that from the Progressive 
Conservative Party's perspective we did not see any specific 
agenda that the government had to deal with the full-fledged 
crisis in softwood lumber.  We felt the government did not have a 
plan or direction.  It was treading water and not responding to a 
very important issue facing Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Canada depends upon the softwood lumber industry as a 
major job producer.  It produces a large percentage of the gross 
domestic product in Canada.  It is an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another point to which I would ask the parliamentary 
secretary to respond.  The government keeps saying that the 
softwood lumber industry is part of free trade.  What has it done 
about it?  How many delegations and when did we start sending 
them to the U.S. to speak to our counterparts in a minister to 
minister type of situation?  The Minister of Industry says one 
thing while the Minister for International Trade says another. 
The Prime Minister is not responding at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six provinces had free trade with the United States.  The 
Atlantic accord kept Atlantic Canada out of the softwood lumber 
agreement and provided free trade for Atlantic Canada, which has 
a long tradition in free trade going back to the 1800s between 
New Brunswick and Maine.  Manitoba and Saskatchewan were also 
included in free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were only four provinces that did not have free trade: 
British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.  Those four 
provinces obviously need to get in on the free trade agreement, 
but everyone has been sucked into the vortex.  Now, as everyone 
predicted, the Americans are playing hardball by putting in 
countervailing duties and anti-dumping is being claimed against 
all 10 provinces in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The countervail was not a problem.  We have beaten countervail 
before, especially in eastern Canada, and we would expect to beat 
it again.  The anti-dumping became a much more serious problem 
because that included all the provinces automatically and there 
was no opt out clause for anti-dumping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a long list of mistakes that the government has 
made.  It did not start two or three years ago dealing with the 
Americans on softwood lumber.  It had no plan, no direction and 
no initiative on the Canadian side to deal with this extremely 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have local sawmills in the South Shore riding that I 
represent which have shut down and are no longer exporting 
because they do not know what is down the road.  Quite frankly 
they cannot put themselves into the precarious position where 
they possibly get slammed with an anti-dumping situation and a 
large fee or a countervail duty to which we do not expect to be 
susceptible but could be.  Every time something like this issue 
goes to an international court it becomes a precarious 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the government tell us what it has done 
about the softwood lumber agreement and when it expects to see an 
end to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is incredible to 
hear the hon. member raise those points.  It boggles the mind 
that he could be that misinformed about what the government has 
done.  I do not know if he believes that the government has done 
nothing or if he has just been in rhetorical flight.  Let me 
remind my colleague about what the government has done on behalf 
of Atlantic Canadians and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this matter was raised at the highest levels by the Prime 
Minister of Canada on several occasions with President Bush. This 
matter was raised by the Minister for International Trade 
repeatedly with his U.S. trade counterpart, Bob Zoellick.  When 
we were in Quebec City for the summit, the minister and I both 
had the opportunity to raise the issue with commerce secretary 
Evans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been raised on a repeated basis.  There have been wide 
consultations with the industry.  The hon. member must surely 
know that.  There have been weekly, sometimes daily, meetings 
with the stakeholders in Atlantic Canada in particular and 
throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister continues to put forward the idea of an envoy, a 
more sensible way to try to resolve this dispute.  There was very 
little interest apparently from the Americans until recently. Now 
we are at the point where Mr. Zoellick has been raising it with 
the Minister for International Trade.  Perhaps we are finally 
starting to see the Americans realize that there does not have to 
be the unnecessary confrontation they have caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is the government's position is very 
clear.  I respect that the hon. member represents a riding in 
Atlantic Canada, but the government is charged with taking care 
of the interests of all stakeholders from coast to coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a matter of east versus west in Canada.  It should 
not be that.  I encourage the hon. member and all hon. members 
not to weaken our position by playing to that kind of argument 
because it is divisive and it is not constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter of north-south.  The United States is the one 
which has said it would not exempt the Atlantic provinces.  We 
have supported the claim of the Atlantic provinces for an 
exemption, as we will support any province that feels it has the 
right to an exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying there has been a clear national 
strategy.  There has been a huge amount of work.  I ask the hon. 
member to pull back his partisanship a bit and support the 
government in trying to put forward a national case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.19 p.m.)
