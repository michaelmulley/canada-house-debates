<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK2"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MOTION NO. 8 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a question of privilege concerning the government House 
leader's tabling on the March 1 Notice Paper of a motion that 
threatens the rights and privileges of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain.  Motion No. 8 introduced by the government House 
leader and published in the Notice Paper yesterday could, if 
deemed in order, threaten the rights and privileges of 
parliamentarians, of the House and, worse still, of the Chair. 
If this motion were deemed in order, it would show contempt for 
parliamentary democracy.  It would unilaterally—and I emphasize 
the word unilaterally—change the rules of the parliamentary game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, when the standing orders are amended—and this is the 
practice, or has been since I have been here—the parties consult 
each other and hold discussions, which has not been the case 
this time around.  This motion would muzzle the opposition by 
limiting its right to introduce amendments to the government's 
bill.  It would allow only one amendment per member, but this 
limit would not apply to ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be unfair because the motion would thus create 
intolerable discrimination among parliamentarians.  It would 
allow members of the government party—but not all—to introduce an 
unlimited number of amendments, but would place outrageous 
limitations on the right of opposition members and of members of 
the government party not in cabinet to do likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion strikes me as out of order because it makes a 
distinction between the rights of the constituents of a minister 
and those of opposition members, by giving more rights to one 
group than to the other.  This motion is an illustration of how 
democracy is eroding in the hands of the Liberals, who want to 
gag not only the people of Quebec, but also the House of 
Commons, and all parliamentarians sitting in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government of secrecy, as we have seen with the HRDC 
scandal, with the APEC summit, and with the multitude of gag 
orders this government has made use of since it came in.  This 
motion will again give more prerogatives to the government, 
which is already assured of a dominant position as far as all 
the business of this House is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is out of order because it would impose unreasonable 
and unprecedented limits on any and all criticism, when that is 
precisely the role of an opposition in a British style 
parliamentary system.  It is the role of the opposition to 
question the government party, which has an obligation to be 
answerable to parliament for its actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion would constitute an attack on the right of 
parliamentarians and members of parliament to speak, a right 
that goes back to the very origins of democracy.  This motion is 
out of order because it would limit the freedom of the Chair to 
decide undisturbed and fully independently the status of the 
amendments we in the opposition might submit to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is out of order because it would break with the age 
old tradition preventing the Chair from becoming the executor of 
the wishes of the executive. 
It is out of order, Mr. Speaker, because it would deprive you of 
your role, which is to deal in total impartiality with all 
parliamentarians, from the highest of ministers to the lowest of 
MPs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is out of order because it would strike at the very 
heart of an institution whose role it is to maintain and 
preserve a space and a forum for public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has raised the issue of the cost of debate here 
in this House.  That is serious.  Has the government reached the 
point where it raises the question of money when the opposition 
wants to debate an issue?  How to explain the government's 
criticism of the Bloc Quebecois' opposition to committees 
travelling outside Ottawa and the country, as in the case of the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, which would like to visit 
the Caucasus?  Perhaps there would be no cost involved?  How can 
they spend money in one instance and in another say it is a 
terrible thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy has a cost.  It is far preferable to places where 
there is no democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the argument that the government side is going to 
win the vote in any case, I say we know the morning after an 
election that one party has a majority.  Is the government 
telling us that there should be no opposition parties because it 
is a matter of fact that the party with the majority will win 
the vote?  That is not valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, Mr. Speaker, your role is at stake.  You must 
have the trust of all parliamentarians and all parties.  That 
presupposes that the Chair is absolutely neutral and perfectly 
impartial.  This motion would make you an instrument of the 
government.  You cannot assume such status without losing the 
trust of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I ask you to recognize that the action by the 
government House leader infringes the rights and privileges not 
only of parliamentarians but of the House and, more seriously, 
of the Chair, without which there would be no democratic debates 
here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> So far, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois has 
addressed Motion No. 8, which, in my opinion, has yet to be 
introduced.  When the motion is introduced in the House, if it 
is, perhaps that would be the time to raise the issue rather 
than debating a hypothetical issue right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to debate all the motions on the Order Paper before 
they are called by the government?  I wonder.  If the question of 
privilege of the leader of the Bloc Quebecois relates to Motion 
No. 8, the motion is not yet before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to understand what you just said. The Bloc Quebecois 
leader clearly specified that his question of privilege did not 
have so much to do with the motion per se, as with the action 
taken by the government House leader, and I also want speak to 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you indicated, Motion No. 8 is on the order paper, but the 
action in itself is highly reprehensible, because it ensures 
that, by remaining on the order paper, this motion will be a 
constant threat to all opposition parties for the rest of the 
session. This is totally unacceptable.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I urge you to take into consideration the fact that 
the question of privilege raised by the hon. Bloc Quebecois 
leader does not have so much to do with the motion as with the 
action taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this measure will have the effect of creating a 
threat to all parliamentarians in this House, particularly to 
opposition parties but also to government backbenchers, who 
should understand that this is an unacceptable and intolerable 
violation of the privileges of this House and of every 
parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the protector of the rights and privileges of independent 
members, you must take into consideration the fact that Motion 
No. 8 is also a potential threat to their right to table 
amendments at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge you to allow the debate on this question of 
privilege to continue. Again, the question of privilege is not 
so much on the motion itself as on the intolerable action taken 
by the Leader of the Government in the House, who put this 
motion on the order paper, where it will remain indefinitely, 
thus posing a threat to our rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, yesterday, in response to the Thursday question about 
the future business of the House, he announced that this issue 
would be debated today. For one reason or another, it is not 
being debated today. When will it be? When will our rights and 
privileges as parliamentarians be put into question? 
I am asking you to consider this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> In connection with the motion, if it is not the 
motion we are going to discuss, but rather the action taken in 
relation to a question, then perhaps I will hear a few other 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that the Leader of the Official 
Opposition is on his feet; I will recognize him. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to 
the privilege motion brought forward by the leader of the Bloc. 
For clarification Mr. Speaker, are you just taking 
representations on what the whip presented?  I am not sure what 
you are asking for here, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The day before yesterday I ruled that we would 
have points of order and points of privilege, whatever we wanted, 
when Motion No. 8 was brought to the floor. A very subtle change 
is being brought up here that is not so much on Motion No. 8 but 
now the whip is introducing the question of a gesture that is 
being made which may or may not carry with it some kind of 
threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never heard this point before so I am interested in hearing a 
bit more about it.  I am not going to let this go on forever but 
I want to hear a bit more about this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I have already recognized the House leader of the 
opposition, and I am going to give him the floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not think it is without precedent to treat a motion on the notice 
paper as something that should concern the privileges of the 
House.  I would remind the Speaker for example that if someone 
were to place something on the notice paper that said they had 
lost confidence in the Speaker, even though it is on the notice 
paper, the House would be seized with it.  Whether it has been 
called or not is not the issue.  The issue is it is a threat over 
the head of the House in the case of non-confidence in the 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same way, I think this motion does hang as a sword over 
the rights and privileges of all members of parliament and I will 
explain that in some depth. I believe that the motion violates 
the first principle of parliamentary law because it targets the 
minority groups in the House.  It takes away the privileges of 
the minority while leaving in tact the privileges of the cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 and section 18 of the 
act provides that the privileges, immunities and powers of the 
House of Commons and of its members are those of the British 
House of Commons and can only be defined by an act of parliament. 
Thus they cannot be suspended, altered or diminished by simply 
passing a motion here in the House of Commons dealing with those 
privileges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member's right to propose amendments, call concurrence motions 
and vote is a well established right that indisputably makes up 
part of the powers enjoyed by individual members of parliament. 
It is a constitutional democracy and the right of members to vote 
is fundamental and goes to the very heart of our parliamentary 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 refers to a 
constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. 
A 1993 Supreme Court of Canada decision in New Brunswick 
Broadcasting Corporation v Nova Scotia confirmed the 
constitutional nature of parliamentary privilege on that very 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the powers and privileges of members of this House are 
the result of centuries of practice and convention.  The courts 
have clearly recognized that conventions are part of our 
constitution.  Our legislative procedures, including voting on 
amendments, are part of our historic heritage, our parliamentary 
traditions and, indeed, the privileges collectively of the House 
and individually of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Motion No. 8 were allowed to be moved, if it even gets to 
that, and were adopted it raises the question, what can this 
House not do by majority vote?  I submit that it would constitute 
a very dangerous precedent.  Even if there were a way to achieve 
the government's objective of trying to affect votes in the 
House, I would argue that could only be done by means of a 
statute, not by a mere motion that takes away the rights that we 
have gained collectively over the centuries and decades by 
convention and historic practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in 1985 that the requirement 
of section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and of section 23 of 
the Manitoba Act, 1870 respecting the use of both the English and 
French languages in the records and journals of the Houses of 
Parliament is mandatory and must be obeyed.  Accordingly, the 
House can no longer depart from its own code of procedure when 
considering a practice protected by the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had two similar cases in the last parliament regarding 
committees.  On June 20, 1994 and November 7, 1996 the Speaker 
ruled that “while it is a tradition of this House that 
committees are masters of their own proceedings, they cannot 
establish procedures which go beyond the powers conferred upon 
them by the House”.  If we are to be consistent, I would point 
out that while this House is a master of its own proceedings, it 
cannot establish procedures which go beyond the powers conferred 
on it by the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want you to consider, Mr. Speaker, is the very 
first principle of parliamentary law, as set out in Beauchesne's. 
Beauchesne's states that the principles of parliamentary law are 
“to protect a minority and to restrain the improvidence or 
tyranny of a majority”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 targets the opposition.  It is no secret that 
Motion No. 8 is designed, in part, to deal with Bill C-20. 
Virtually every motion to amend Bill C-20 is in the name of a 
member of a minority party.  While Motion No. 8 would restrict 
the minority, it leaves in tact a cabinet minister's right to 
propose amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, independent members and independent minded members 
of recognized political parties would also fall victim to this 
motion.  The motion presupposes that every member has a right to 
move amendments at committee.  As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, 
independent members are rarely members of committees. 
Independent minded Liberal members are often thrown off 
committees or removed by the whip because of their independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall when certain Liberal members voted against the gun 
control bill.  The very next day those members were moved off the 
committee by the government whip and other people were moved into 
their place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other consideration is the fact that the government runs 
roughshod over the opposition in committees, which often 
seriously hampers the opposition in its ability to move 
amendments in those committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 is offensive.  It is an affront to all opposition 
members, independent members and independent minded members of 
all parties of the House.  Mr. Speaker, it is your duty to defend 
their rights against the government majority.  You cannot allow 
the majority to deny the minority its right to propose and vote 
on motions.  Because of the situation in committees, you have to 
be the guardian of the rights of the minority and independent 
members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Motion No. 8 was designed with Bill C-20 and the Bloc 
in mind, it affects every bill that will be considered in the 
House and restricts independent members and members of all 
parties.  The government cannot continue to upset the balance 
between the opposition and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 14, 1987, in response to a Liberal complaint about the 
bullying tactics of the day, it was said:  “It is essential to 
our democratic system that controversial issues should be debated 
at reasonable length so that every reasonable opportunity shall 
be available to hear the arguments pro and con, and that 
reasonable delaying tactics should be permissible to enable 
opponents of a measure to enlist public support for their point 
of view”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles, a former member and table officer of this 
place, once said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has only the rules for its protection, hence the 
authorities on parliamentary process emphasize the great 
importance to the opposition of the only protection it has, the 
protection of the rules.  Only by according such rights to the 
opposition is it possible to achieve anything even approaching 
equality of strength between the two sides. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to drastically change our procedures and 
upset the balance between the opposition and the government.  It 
is attempting to destroy that balance of strength which Mr. 
Knowles and Speaker Fraser addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize how important this principle is to this 
institution.  It cannot function without some semblance of 
balance between the role of the opposition and the role of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this House is becoming dysfunctional is because the 
government no longer seems to support that principle of balance. 
It did while in opposition, but it has since abandoned respect 
for balance in this parliament.  The government has invoked 
closure or time allocation 62 times.  It bypasses members by 
making announcements outside the House.  It routinely leaks 
information intended for this House.  Now it is suggesting a 
measure that goes too far to solve a problem that is a response 
to the government's own way of handling issues in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to consider how Motion No. 8 
targets the minority with respect to committee concurrence 
motions.  Again, a cabinet minister could restrict opposition 
members, and backbench members of all parties, by deeming the 
debate on a concurrence motion adjourned simply by rising on a 
point of order.  Even if a member has the support of the majority 
of members of the House for the concurrence of a committee 
report, that member could not, without the consent of a cabinet 
minister, obtain that support for the motion.  The cabinet then 
would have seized control of one of the last few remaining 
procedures that backbench members of parliament enjoy on both 
sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that would remain is Private Members' Business.  The rules 
of private members are already so restricted that very few 
members of parliament ever get their issue on to the floor for 
debate, and even a smaller number get an actual vote on the 
issues they bring forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote an MLA from the Nova Scotia House of 
Assembly.  Mr. Holm said on January 26, 1995: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old saying that holds as true today as it has forever 
in parliamentary democracy; the government opens the legislature 
and the opposition closes it.  That truth is no more evident than 
it is right now.  There is opportunity for compromise, for 
working together.  We won't get everything we want as opposition; 
the government will probably get most of what it wants.  The 
opportunity is there but we have to start anew with a 
relationship that will work. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will seek another remedy that we can all 
work with and buy into on both sides of the House.  Until that 
spirit of compromise and working together to make this place more 
functional, more winsome to the Canadian public, exists, I would 
ask, Mr. Speaker, that you take this question of privilege 
seriously.  If you do not find that there is a prima facie 
question of privilege, I urge you to at least consider my 
comments as a point of order and remove Motion No. 8 from the 
order paper.  I think it is offensive and an affront to the 
House, an affront to the workings of how this place should 
function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This place functions because we work together as men and women 
who want to work together for the betterment of the country. 
With Motion No. 8 hanging over the heads of all members of the 
House, backbenchers on both sides, I do not think that spirit of 
co-operation or that spirit of balance between the rights of the 
opposition and the right of the government exists.  That balance 
has to be restored and maintained so that opposition members are 
not singled out as people who not only do not carry the agenda 
forward, but are not even heard in this place.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, in order to do away with any 
possible ambiguity, since you may have not heard the beginning 
of my point of privilege properly, what I said was—and I am 
repeating it word for word—that I am raising a point of privilege 
in connection with the action taken by the government house 
leader on March 1.  That is exactly what the whip of the Bloc 
Quebecois said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for the clarification.  I 
am going to listen to a few more hon. members on this matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I can understand the ambiguity of the Chair with respect to 
whether it is appropriate for the House to be raising questions 
of privilege or, for that matter, points of order with respect to 
Motion No. 8, but I think it is wise on your part to hear us out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consult our latest tome, <I>House of Commons Procedure 
and Practice</I>, which we all celebrated not too long ago, there 
is a role for the Speaker cited at page 971, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a notice is submitted for inclusion on the <I>Notice 
Paper</I>, it is examined by procedural staff of the Clerk.  If 
any procedural irregularity is found, modifications as to the 
form and content of the notice may then be made in consultation 
with the sponsoring Member. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we see that at least in some senses, although I would 
presume this is at a stage prior to it actually appearing on the 
notice paper, there is a role for the office of the Speaker in 
relation to a matter that is not yet before the House.  This 
matter is actually further along and is therefore more before the 
House than a matter which has not yet reached the notice paper. 
It is on those grounds, it seems to me, that there is wisdom in 
your hearing members of parliament with respect to Motion No. 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that one of the procedural problems, if you like, 
with Motion No. 8, as opposed to the politics of Motion No. 8, or 
for that matter all of the other things that have been brought up 
with respect to the appropriate balance between government and 
opposition, has to do with protecting minority rights, a matter 
on which you have heard me speak before, in this parliament and 
in previous parliaments, Mr. Speaker.  All of these things have 
merit and should be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to repeat them, but it seems to me that there is 
another matter which you should consider, and that is the 
retroactive nature of Motion No. 8.  If it were to come before 
the House and pass, it would take place right in the middle of a 
process and it would be directed at the middle of a process, in 
this case a process having to do with Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, there is the dilemma in which I found myself 
yesterday, not knowing whether I should keep my name on all of 
the amendments that I had submitted for Bill C-20, or whether I 
should ask other members of my party to move those amendments, 
because Motion No. 8 would stipulate that there would only be one 
amendment per member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite unfair to the House and to all members, 
particularly to critics, to have put us in this procedural 
twilight zone where we did not know whether we were going to be 
dealing with amendments in the context of Motion No. 8, or 
whether we were going to be dealing with amendments in the 
context of the established procedure.  We did not know whether to 
withdraw amendments.  We are only entitled to four pursuant to 
Motion No. 8.  Should we withdraw the rest of our amendments? 
Or, if we left them on the order paper, would we then be 
endangering our right to select which four of our amendments 
would be dealt with by the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were so many uncertainties that I would submit it created 
a violation of our privileges; that is to say, a violation of our 
ability to do our job, our ability to know what to do to make 
sure that those things which are most important to us to come 
before the House would actually come before the House.  We did 
not know exactly what procedure we would be dealing with. 
Even if we knew, we did not know exactly what to do because, I 
would submit, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to how 
that would unfold should Motion No. 8 pass.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people in the House rail in other circumstances when it 
comes to various economic measures and other things about the 
unacceptability of retroactivity, yet in this case we have before 
us something which I think you, Mr. Speaker, should take very 
seriously as guardian of the House and guardian of the ability of 
members to do their jobs properly, which is the way in which this 
retroactivity, and the uncertainty that attaches itself to it, 
makes it impossible for us to do our jobs properly.  That is one 
other thing I would like you to consider, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us be frank.  This arises out of a particular 
procedural opportunity being used by the opposition, which I 
think is legitimate, but legitimate only in the sense that it is 
a response to a government's suppression of proper debate.  It is 
something I do not like.  In the end, the fact that we vote day 
and night brings the whole House into disrepute, which does not 
help anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, it is quite unfair to lay this entirely at 
the foot of the opposition.  This is a response to a growing 
frustration with the ability of the House to deal substantially 
with matters of importance.  We have arrived at a place in our 
parliamentary tradition where if something is important it has to 
be dealt with briefly.  If something is not that important it 
drags on and on and on.  This seems to me to be just the 
opposite of what should be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to my point, Mr. Speaker, I think we all need to be 
concerned, and you, in particular, with what brings the House of 
Commons into disrepute.  We have a practice growing of far too 
many votes at report stage and a practice of voting through the 
night, which does not enhance the reputation of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, how can we deal with that in a way that does 
not call the House of Commons into further disrepute.  My concern 
is, and I think your concern, Mr. Speaker, should be, that Motion 
No. 8 makes the problem worse.  It does not improve on the 
situation and does not deal with that particular problem. 
Instead, it purports to deal with that problem while at the same 
time redressing the already imbalanced balance between the 
government and the opposition in a way that is not just a matter 
that the government should be concerned about, because obviously 
it would be subject to a great deal of criticism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into that because that would be getting 
into debate on the motion.  However, I think we all have a 
responsibility to see if we cannot put our heads together and 
deal with the problem we have on report stage.  This cannot be 
done by eliminating the rights of members of parliament, not by 
making the imbalance between the opposition and government worse 
and not by taking away the rights of members to move concurrence 
in committees, because that will affect not just the opposition 
but, as others have pointed out, the rights of government 
backbenchers.  The very thing that they have at their disposal 
now, the one lever that they have over the cabinet, will be taken 
away from them by their own government House leader in the name 
of dealing with something that has nothing to do with it, that is 
to say, report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things impinge on the reputation of the House of 
Commons with the Canadian people.   This motion belongs to all of 
us.  It is a matter that you should concern yourself with, Mr. 
Speaker, and ask yourself whether or not this is in fact a motion 
that should be deemed in order, that should even come before you 
or whether there is a responsibility on the part of the Chair 
either to convene a meeting in which this problem could be dealt 
with or to ask House leaders to get together and see if we can 
deal with the problem we have on report stage that does not take 
away from the rights of members of parliament.  Those kinds of 
solutions are available, Mr. Speaker.  I would urge you to urge 
the House to find that solution and never have before us the kind 
of motion that the government put down yesterday.

Speaker, I must add to earlier comments that we appreciate the 
indulgence and the wisdom displayed by the Chair in hearing this 
point of privilege because it is an extremely important matter 
for all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 brings about a very dark era for the remainder of 
this parliament should it pass.  I realize that the Chair has 
directed members to speak specifically to the potential threat, 
the threat of intimidation that arises as a result of this motion 
even sitting on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the motion, by virtue of its being tabled 
and resting before the House, even being held in abeyance, 
threatens to impale democracy and to impale the good workings of 
this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House is the place for the people of Canada to speak and 
for the people of Canada to be represented by their elected 
officials.  By virtue of changing the rules of engagement, by 
virtue of the very intent of this motion, having this motion 
waiting, holding it over us like the sword of Damocles ready to 
descend, impugns the ability of members of parliament to do their 
work on behalf of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very provocative attempt by the government in 
response, I might add, to a very specific situation.  Obviously 
this is aimed at one piece of legislation and one party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you as a member of the House but, more importantly, 
as the individual who presides over this House as a judge would 
preside over a court, should be blind, armed with a sword and 
armed with the scales of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion asks you, Mr. Speaker, to remove the blindfold and 
use the sword.  That is what the motion seeks to have you do, 
which, as has been alluded to earlier, undermines your ability 
and your credibility within this process.  This would impugn the 
impartiality of the Chair and remove the non-partisan nature of 
the office that you hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House we are to respond and conduct ourselves with 
impartiality and fairness.  The motion, without a doubt, is aimed 
at removing those boundaries, removing our ability to interact on 
a fair and even playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you are a fan of the sport of hockey. What 
the motion would do—and we are playing short-handed as it is—is 
essentially turn the government's net around and remove the blue 
line.  It changes the rules by which we play the game. It changes 
the way we conduct ourselves here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak specifically to the issue of intimidation.  I 
refer the Chair to Erskine May, 22nd edition.  I would also note 
quite importantly that this is British procedure, the basis on 
which the government is now relying on for Motion No. 8.  On page 
121 of Erskine May, 22nd edition, under the chapter headed 
“Obstructing Members of Either House in the Discharge of Their 
Duty”, I will read from a paragraph half way down the page.  It 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will proceed against those who obstruct Members in the 
discharge of their responsibilities to the House or in their 
participation in its proceedings. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to page 123, I will refer to the last paragraph on that 
page.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To attempt to intimidate a Member in his (or her) parliamentary 
conduct by threats is also a contempt, cognate to those mentioned 
above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actions of this character which have been proceeded against 
include impugning the conduct of Members and threatening them 
with further exposure if they took part in debates;

influence”, it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Attempts by improper means to influence Members in their 
parliamentary conduct may be considered contempts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion and those actions which would flow from this motion 
intimidate members of the House.  This motion, by virtue of 
sitting on the order paper ready to be used at some near future 
date in response to a specific bill in the House, as has been 
alluded to, having this hang over us undermines our ability to 
carry out our parliamentary duties.  It hinders the Chair and all 
members on both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be much easier if the government in its wisdom would 
agree now to withdraw the motion and, as was suggested by the 
hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, go back to the way we used 
to conduct ourselves here, to sit down, co-operate and try to 
work together in some fashion to come to a reasonable solution as 
opposed to the bullying tactics that have been displayed by the 
government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the motion not only sullies your office but, I 
would suggest, it sullies the entire process and sullies and 
damages all members of the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will be watching to see how this occurs because a 
significant number of them still have faith in this process, as 
they should. However, in order for that process to be reinforced 
and for Canadians to continue to have faith, we must now deal 
with a situation that has arisen.  It has arisen as a result of a 
provocative attempt by the government House leader to somehow 
intimidate and put members off their ability to conduct 
themselves in the normal fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not overstating the case when I say that the government is 
now, by virtue of the motion, standing in the House with a knife 
to the throat of the opposition.  It has said to the opposition 
members that if we do not back off with our intentions it will 
change the rules under which we play and it will somehow 
undermine the process by which we have been playing and 
conducting ourselves over the past number of years.  The 
government must be disarmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the Chair to exercise its discretion, to 
exercise the tools of office with which it is empowered. By 
removing the motion from the order paper, we will then be able to 
fall back on the processes and the normal rules of engagement to 
which we are accustomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should withdraw the motion and once again, I 
would suggest, the spirit of co-operation and consultation could 
then flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told, and the Chair would obviously be aware of 
this by virtue of having reviewed the motion, that we will now 
face a situation where we have two classes of members.  We know 
that the cabinet and the executive will be given certain powers 
and specific entitlements.  However, in this Chamber, I, as a 
young, new member of the House, was led to believe that we were 
all equals.  When we set foot in this sacred, hallowed Chamber we 
were to be treated equally and fairly by the Chair and by one 
another with mutual respect for the purposes of the smooth 
workings of parliament.  This motion changes that.  It changes 
the class structure.  It changes the equity that is supposed to 
exist and pertain and reflect on all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an attempt, I would suggest, a last desperate and 
despotic attempt to bankrupt the administration and the smooth 
workings of the House.  We have been working within these rules, 
albeit there are certainly times when there should be change and 
certainly occasions when we should all participate in a positive 
fashion to try to improve the workings of parliament not 
denigrate them nor remove or impinge on the ability of members of 
parliament to do do their work, but to improve and ameliorate the 
ability of members of the House to act.  This is a step 
backwards. 
This is an attempt to return to an age when all of the power was 
centralized in the hands of but a few.  I suggest that it would 
be a very dark day and a very sad day if we are to allow this to 
happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sad to report that I believe for the most part Canadians do 
not understand the amount of hard work and the amount of positive 
work that is done at the committee level because it is done 
behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very much with reference to Bill C-20, which I think 
again is the specific root cause of what we see happening before 
us today, that the work that can be done at committee is very 
much curtailed.  Even more than the work that takes place here in 
this public and open fashion, the work that is done at committee 
is the real, the substantive and the very important sustenance of 
what takes place in terms of the preparation of legislation and 
the presentation of new ideas, new laws and changes to our entire 
workings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we allow this motion to sit on the order paper, to continue 
to be a knife at the throat of members of parliament, we will not 
be able to move forward to make positive changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I implore and ask the Chair to take into consideration the 
words of all members of the House.  I would expect that we would 
hear from the government on this particular point of privilege. 
Again I would suggest that by the very virtue of this motion 
sitting before us, pointed directly at us like a gun at our 
heads, the government is saying “If you do not comply, if you do 
not participate in the way we want you to, we will pull the 
trigger”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we are asking you, as members of the opposition, to 
remove that threat, to take that threat away, to disarm the 
government and allow us to get on with the work that Canadians 
expect from this Chamber.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
also raising the question of privilege in relation to the 
actions of the government House leader in tabling with the 
Journals Branch on March 1 a motion which infringes on the 
rights and privileges of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not asking you to rule as to whether or not the motion is 
in order, but rather on the action by the government House 
leader in putting on the Order Paper a motion violating the 
privileges of the members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, in my opinion, an attempt to extinguish or render 
meaningless one of the most fundamental privileges of a British 
type parliamentary system.  Contrary to tradition, without 
consulting the opposition, the government House leader has 
introduced a motion to change the rules of the House for the 
rest of the current session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By raising a point of order, this motion would enable the 
government to shut down debate in the House even before a member 
has finished speaking to his or her motion.  The motion would be 
transferred to Government Orders and the debate would be resumed 
as the government saw fit, which would likely mean never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, this motion is intended, to all intents and purposes, 
to prevent the members of the opposition from proposing 
amendments at the report stage in the House.  No amendment would 
be selected for consideration at the report stage if it was or 
could have been proposed and been deemed in order in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practice, this means that no amendment at report stage can be 
selected for consideration, except amendments to delete clauses 
of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the motion provides that the total number of 
amendments to the bill that may be received shall not exceed the 
number of clauses, preambles and schedules contained in the 
bill. Each member can propose only one amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are always exceptions, of course, and these restrictions 
do not apply to ministers. That is disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is an unprecedented violation of the rights and 
privileges of the members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, members of the House of Commons had some guarantees 
that allowed them to freely express themselves on the 
appropriateness of government measures. These guarantees are 
provided by the standing orders, the conventions and the 
practices of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of the rights of the opposition is one of the 
most fundamental unwritten rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contemporary role of the House of Commons is to monitor 
government action. Members must have the opportunity to question 
and to criticize freely, constantly and publicly the government 
and the measures that it proposes to the House. Any infringement 
on the role of a member diminishes the useful role of the House 
of Commons as a democratic institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to propose amendments and to debate motions to adopt 
committee reports are critical tools to allow members to 
exercise the most important privilege granted to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Marleau and Montpetit, at page 261, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freedom of speech...a fundamental right without which they 
would be hampered in the performance of their duties. It permits 
them to speak in the House without inhibition, to refer to any 
matter or express any opinion as they see fit, to say what they 
feel needs to be said in the furtherance of the national 
interest and the aspirations of their constituents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Government in the House would want to 
transform parliament into a docile and partisan instrument, this 
for the rest of the session. He would want to transform 
parliament into a servile and insignificant institution, which 
would merely rubber stamp the government's decisions and 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion would infringe on the authority of the Chair to 
decide in an impartial manner whether an amendment is admissible 
at the report stage of bills, as provided in Standing Orders 
76(5) and 76.1(5). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Marleau and Montpetit, at page 668, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Standing Order, the Speaker thus has the power to 
select or group motions in amendment to be proposed at report 
stage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision leaves him a certain discretion that he must 
exercise with the utmost impartiality.  If Motion No. 8, 
standing in the name of the government House leader, were to 
come before the House, this would mean that he could no longer 
exercise this discretion and protect the right of members to 
introduce amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 299 of <I>Droit constitutionnel</I>, Brun and Tremblay state as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In enforcing the Standing Orders, the Speaker sets aside his 
political persona in order to perform a neutral and impartial 
function.  This flows from tradition. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the government House leader's motion, the Speaker's hands 
would be tied and he would be forced to reject all amendments at 
report stage because motions that were in order in committee 
could no longer be ruled in order at report stage by the 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, the Speaker could no longer serve the House 
and its members.  He would become nothing more than a ceremonial 
presence in the House.  This would be a dangerous precedent that 
could jeopardize the democratic operation of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this motion were to come before the House, it would violate 
the integrity and the very dignity of this place because it 
would have a direct negative impact on members' duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion infringes the rights of parliamentarians to express 
their views and to do their work properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Maingot wrote on page 26 of <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privilege of freedom of speech, though of a personal nature, 
is not so much intended to protect the Members against 
prosecutions for their own individual advantage, but to support 
the rights of the people by enabling their representatives to 
execute the functions of their office without fear of either 
civil or criminal prosecutions.  One of the first and greatest 
of its privileges is free speech and one of the advantages of 
legislative bodies is the right of exposing and denouncing 
abuses by means of free speech. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By tabling his motion on Wednesday, March 1, the government 
House leader's sole intention was to block members' rights to 
criticize and oppose government measures. 
It was his intention to compromise the most important privilege 
of the members of this House, the freedom of speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, placing this motion on the Order Paper represents a 
threat to the House and the members of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, the government House leader is sending the 
following message to the House and more specifically to the 
opposition members “You would be well advised to table no more 
amendments at report stage, otherwise I will prevent you from 
doing so for the rest of this session”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, the government House leader is saying he is 
prepared to limit the powers of the Chair and to jeopardize the 
rights and privileges of the members of this House if they 
disagree with the Chair.  This is contempt of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore your duty to consider the action taken by the 
government House leader a threat to the rights and privileges of 
the members and contempt of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I appeal to your impartiality and to 
your sense of justice and democracy.  You are the last bastion 
against the arbitrariness of the government majority in this 
House.  Without your energetic intervention, parliament could 
become a totally meaningless institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am prepared, with your authority, to table a motion of 
privilege in order to refer this matter to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> It being eleven o'clock, the House will now proceed 
to Statements by Members and then Oral Question Period.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am concerned about recent reports that the government 
will not implement all the recommendations of its own commissions 
on grain transportation.  Both reports emphasized the need for a 
more commercial, accountable, contract driven system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key recommendation was to remove the Canadian Wheat Board from 
any involvement in grain transportation.  Mr. Kroeger gave this 
warning to the transportation committee on Tuesday: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am worried about the proposal from the wheat board that you go 
to a contractual system but the wheat board would hold all the 
contracts.  If the wheat board holds all the contracts but the 
parties haven't got contracts with each other then a grain 
company can't call a railway to account. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government not to cherry pick pieces of these reports 
to suit its political purposes but to implement the proposed 
changes including moving the Canadian Wheat Board to spout. 
Regulation and government control caused the problems in grain 
transportation today and so will not solve them.

EPA.  It reflects badly on Canada's reputation internationally, 
let alone on the health of Canadians who live in Ontario.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, March 8 is a time for us to celebrate the first 
International Women's Day of the new millennium.  Women's day is 
a time to reflect and celebrate the progress that has been made 
in achieving women's equality in our homes, communities and 
across the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the stage is set for the exciting seven month long 
event, the World Women's March, otherwise known as March 2000. 
After the success of the Bread and Roses campaign in 1996, the 
Quebec Women's Federation decided to expand its idea and create a 
forum for women to talk, lobby, protest and march all around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>March 2000 will begin on March 8 across Canada and will continue 
until October 15 with a large rally in Ottawa.  For the next 
seven months organizers of the women's march will draw attention 
to two key issues:  poverty and violence.  Whatever gains women 
may have made, poverty and violence are still huge obstacles to 
achieving true equality and justice for women in Canada and 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadian women the next seven months will be very exciting. 
It will be a time for creating and renewing relationships and 
connections around the world in solidarity with our sisters.  The 
women will all come marching, marching hand in hand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this morning we received an extensive communications 
plan developed by HRDC to position the release of the internal 
audit on the billion dollar boondoggle. It includes discussions 
on strategic considerations, storylines, media strategies and 
time lines.  It was dated August 30, 1999. Given this, is the 
minister planning to stick to her story that she only found out 
about the audit on November 17, 1999? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, speaking of communications plans and stories, I am 
surprised the hon. member did not get up and with her first words 
admit that she was totally wrong yesterday when she said Export 
Development Corporation had given a $10 million line of credit to 
Earth Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was totally wrong on that.  Her colleagues' accusations were 
baseless.  If she had respect for the House, for herself and her 
party, the first words she should have spoken would have been to 
withdraw, to retract and to apologize.  That would be 
communication. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is the government that cannot get its story straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very hard to believe that the minister's department 
was in the process of developing a department-wide action plan in 
August to deal with the release of internal audit results and 
that the minister knew nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this communications plan is very extensive.  It talks 
about release strategies and the need to equip the minister with 
questions and answers, question period cards and media lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister expect us to believe that she did not know 
anything about the internal audit until November 17, 1999? 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member 
opposite is showing her ignorance of government and how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I would hope we would refrain from 
this kind of comment in question period.  I know that the member 
for Calgary—Nose Hill would also want to refrain.  I would 
invite the parliamentary secretary to continue with her answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown:</B>  I apologize, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a problem in the department, it is the job of the 
deputy minister and senior officials to prepare solutions and 
options for the minister's perusal.  I would remind the member 
that the final audit report was not finalized and brought in 
until the fall.  Before it was presented to the minister it would 
have had to have the problems outlined with potential solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These draft communications plans to which she refers were part 
of the potential solutions to be put before the minister after 
the audit was finalized and the plans were finalized.  That 
happened on November 17, 1999. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the minister needs to know what her department 
is up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from a letter from her deputy minister, which says, 
“Since June, when the interim audit report became available, we 
have devoted intensive and sustained management attention”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June HRDC set up a working group to deal with the internal 
audit.  In August it started developing a department-wide action 
plan.  By the end of August her department had produced an 
extensive communications plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the minister one more time, how could she possibly be 
unaware that her department was in high gear— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform 
Party may jump to conclusions before a final report comes but we 
do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department did what it should have done.  When the first 
results showed something to be worried about, it began to prepare 
for the final report.  There is nothing untoward about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exchange of letters she refers to took place in December 
1999.  They show that the minister was determined to be open, 
transparent and to have a strong management response to these 
problems. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is revealing that the very first thing the department did once it 
knew by the interim audit that there was a big problem in the 
department was to develop a communications plan rather than fix 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what actually happened.  The communications plan and 
strategy was ready to go as of August because there was a crisis 
in the midst, but the minister waited until January to release 
the information on the audit.  Why?  She waited by happy 
coincidence until the day after we submitted an access to 
information request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long was the minister really planning to keep it under cover 
that she had actually bungled a billion dollars? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, why does the Reform Party not fix its own problem, 
restore its dignity and credibility and start off by 
acknowledging that it was totally wrong in its baseless 
accusations against the Minister for International Trade when it 
said that he was involved in giving a $10 million line of credit 
to Earth Canada?  That was totally wrong.  Reform members are 
showing their lack of credibility, their lack of respect for the 
House and for Canadians by keeping quiet on this and trying to 
have some diversionary tactic which does not stand up to 
examination. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
this a diversionary tactic, it looks like the Grand Coulee Dam 
over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows what is going on. The department knew there was a 
crisis.  The interim audit pointed to all the problems: the 
reporting; the lack of reliability; the lack of statistics; the 
lack of credible job numbers; and the lack of everything we have 
been talking about for the last month.  What did it do?  It did 
not fix the problem.  It said it would have to develop a 
communications plan.  A communications plan went ahead in August. 
The department suggested that the audit be released in October. 
What happened?  The minister waited until January when the access 
to information request came in.  Why? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
correct the record on a few things the member said.  First, their 
billion dollar bungle implies that a billion dollars was lost. 
Such is not the case.  We have reiterated that over and over 
again.  The minister moved with alacrity as soon as she had the 
final report and the final management plan.  She ordered a 
stronger management plan.  As soon as it was prepared she 
released it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communications suggestions that Reform members are referring 
to are naturally part of the whole methodology to deal with the 
problem. They are nothing more than that.  But they will put a 
negative spin on everything.

there are 12.  The number increases with each passing day. 
Pretty soon they will run out of investigators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not high time the government called an independent public

improve health care in that province.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
because of answers like that that we are calling for an inquiry, 
because they are obviously trying to hide things.  That is what 
is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what they are trying to hide is that, too often, names like 
Fugère, Champagne, Gauthier, Lemire, all in Saint-Maurice, all

reports with respect to the progress of the legislative committee 
and the <I>Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence</I> that were heard 
between the dates of February 14 and February 24, that short time 
allotted for the committee to contemplate Bill C-20, are shown as 
unavailable or not available to those who would be tracking the 
process of what was taking place in the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a window on this world that occurs when the evidence is 
posted on that website.  This window is essentially closed and 
the blinds are pulled.  This technical line of communication is a 
very important and very symbolic site where the government and 
members of the opposition have the opportunity to communicate 
over the Internet and on the government website on what is taking 
place.  It is a very important lifeline and form of 
communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question of privilege concerns the ability of members of 
the House to review, to re-examine and to contemplate what has 
already taken place in committee with respect to this bill, which 
has been given a great deal of priority.  There has been 
tremendous pomp and ceremony about the importance put forward by 
the government on Bill C-20 and yet to date, for some unknown, 
unexplained reason, this information is not available on this

</I></B></P><P align=left>We already discussed at length previously today and on other 
occasions the inability of the opposition or others in

others to reflect on what has taken place already in this

part of the procedural ambush we have seen in the past I would 
suggest that it is improper and I would be prepared, with your 
indulgence, Mr. Speaker, if you find there is a prima facie 
breach of privilege, to move the necessary motion.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic question is whether or not a bill in the House of

completely finished in its English and French printing.  I have 
made a search of the records since Confederation, and there is no 
case that says that a bill in the House of Commons which is up 
for discussion cannot be proceeded with until the evidence has 
been filed.  If we were to accept the suggestion of the hon. 
member for Lapointe (Mr. Grégoire), emotionally pleasing as it 
may be, nevertheless procedurally in my opinion it would be 
completely wrong, and would establish a very bad precedent.

add something.  You quoted a comment made by a predecessor of 
yours in the sixties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in the electronic era. Like my colleague, I find 
there is a serious problem, because the clerk of that committee 
told me, the day after the proceedings, that the minutes of the 
proceedings of the legislative committee on Bill C-20 would be 
posted in the coming days. We are already one week past that 
deadline and the minutes have yet to be posted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the statements— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> As I said, it is not absolutely necessary to have 
all the printed documents. We are doing our best. The hon. 
member will get them, if not today, certainly when we come back 
in the House to resume debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. This concerns the permissibility of 
some of my amendments to Bill C-20 at report stage, which I 
submitted this week to the Journals Branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rising now on a point of order so that you may rule on 
this, at your earliest convenience, before we start debating 
Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>The House of Commons Procedure and Practices</I>, by Marleau and 
Montpetit, says on page 538, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Points of Order respecting procedure must be raised promptly and 
before the question has passed to a stage at which the objection 
would be out of place. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of the utmost importance. 
Some of the amendments I am proposing are aimed at clarifying 
the wording of clauses 1(5) and 2(3) of Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These clauses state that the House of Commons shall take into 
account any views it considers to be relevant to the 
consideration of the question and the will to secede.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendments, which were rejected, are only aimed at specifying 
that these views can be the ones of the government of the 
province that wants to secede and, in my humble opinion, my 
amendments do not go beyond the scope of the bill. However, they 
were deemed out of order, which seems to indicate that my 
freedom of expression has been restricted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, since you are the guardian of the 
privileges of members of the House, particularly those in the 
opposition. On this issue, the <I>House of Commons Procedure and</I> 
<I>Practice</I>, by Marleau and Montpetit, also specifies, on page 261, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the Speaker to act as the guardian 
of the rights and privileges of Members and of the House as an 
institution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freedom of speech may be the most important of the privileges 
accorded to Members of Parliament; it has been described as: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...a fundamental right without which they would be hampered in 
the performance of their duties. It permits them to speak in the 
House without inhibition, to refer to any matter or express any 
opinion as they see fit, to say what they feel needs to be said 
in the furtherance of the national interest and the aspirations 
of their constituents. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since you are the guardian of the privileges of this House and 
of its members, I draw your attention to the consequences of 
ruling out of order the amendments I submitted as a member 
representing his fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I do not understand why I cannot discuss 
these amendments. Because you ruled them as being out of order, 
not only myself, but all the members of this House are prevented 
from debating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important and urgent matter, but you should take the 
time to examine the situation and make an informed decision. 
Your ruling will determine the freedom that the members of this 
House will enjoy in the future. Neither I nor my colleagues want 
to see this freedom of speech challenged only because my 
amendments deal with Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would like to quote constitutional experts whom 
our PC colleague quoted this morning, namely professors Brun and 
Tremblay, who, in the fifth edition of their book on 
constitutional law, wrote the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safeguarding the rights of the opposition is one of the most 
fundamental unwritten rules that the Speaker of the House must 
advocate, if necessary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we need you to be the guardian of our privilege to 
speak, to amend legislation, to introduce amendments that were 
ruled out of order and should not have been.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  I 
think we have seen the type of democracy this government has to 
offer.  After showing some openness a while ago, it is now 
resorting to another gag order and refusing that a motion be 
sponsored by another colleague, thus eliminating that motion 
from the Order Paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only wanted to ask, since we will now proceed with the debate 
on the amendments to Bill C-20 proposed by the Bloc Quebecois and 
some other parties, if you intend to hand down your ruling on 
the question of privilege raised by our colleague, the hon. 
member for Rimouski—Mitis, concerning the way some of our 
amendments were dealt with, before we begin debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> To answer the specific question, I will certainly 
make a ruling before we complete debate on Bill C-20. The House 
will know my decision at that time.  Let us proceed with debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But before, the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the motions in Group No. 
2, you have decided that the vote on Motion No. 48 would also 
apply to Motion No. 49. However, in Group No. 3, even though the 
content is exactly the same, you have decided that there would 
be separate votes on Motions Nos. 70 and 71. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did you decide that the vote on Notion No. 70 would not 
apply to Motion No. 71 but that the vote on Motion No. 48 would 
apply to Motion No. 49? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> As for the question raised by the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, I will take the member's question into 
consideration and rule on it in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, further to some indications 
from our colleagues opposite, I again ask for the unanimous 
consent of the House so that Motion No. 12 standing in the name 
of the hon. member for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert now stand in the 
name of the hon. member for Mercier.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important for me to speak today at report stage to Bill C-20, an 
act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in 
the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
Secession Reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly important to me to speak to Motion No. 4, 
which moves that Bill C-20, in the preamble, be amended by 
deleting lines 1 to 6 on page 1, in other words by omitting: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that there is 
no right, under international law or under the Constitution of 
Canada, for the National Assembly, legislature or government of 
Quebec to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada 
unilaterally. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it is so important for me to speak today is that this 
bill, the so-called clarity bill, is not just nebulous, but 
undemocratic, and I will demonstrate why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, Bill C-20 gives the House of Commons the power to 
overturn an act of the National Assembly and the decision of the 
people of Quebec. It gives the House of Commons the power to 
consider the referendum question and, by resolution, set out its 
determination on whether, in the House's view, the question is 
clear—I am referring to clause 1, first paragraph—or whether, 
again in the House's view, there has been a clear expression of 
a will by a clear majority of the population of that province to 
separate from Canada, as set out in clause 2, first paragraph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 also gives the House of Commons the power to overturn a 
motion by the National Assembly to adopt a referendum question, 
as well as the power to overturn and to censure the result of a 
referendum that does not have a majority that is clear, again in 
the House's view.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By extending such authority to the House of Commons, Bill C-20 
reactivates what is referred to by constitutional specialists as 
“the power of disallowance”, which fell into abeyance as 
recognised by the supreme court itself in its August 20, 1998 
reference. Such an attempt is totally inconsistent with the 
independence of each level of government which represents one of 
the basic principles of federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This power of disallowance is extended to a chamber of the 
Parliament of Canada where less than 25% of elected members are 
Quebecers—members should keep this percentage in mind—which gives 
to the rest of Canada a new form of veto on the political and 
constitutional future of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of the House of Commons is strengthened by the 
obligation imposed on it by Bill C-20 to take into account the 
views of many political players from the rest of Canada, who can 
also jeopardise Quebec's freedom to choose its own destiny, 
while if French is spoken to them they will not understand a 
word of what is being said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason alone, Bill C-20 is undeniably undemocratic. It 
should be withdrawn before 60% of the members of the House of 
Commons coming from Quebec—at least 45 out of 75 members—vote 
against this measure and deprive it of any legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my first point and I will now discuss a second point. 
Bill C-20 denies Quebec the freedom to choose its political 
destiny and among other things to include in a referendum 
question, if so it chooses, a offer of partnership with the rest 
of Canada. 
It is truly an attack on the freedom of choice of Quebecers, and 
God knows that we know what we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By rejecting the partnership, thus limiting the constitutional 
and political options for the future of Quebec, Bill C-20 
purports to prevent Quebec from reaching out to the rest of 
Canada and propose a form of partnership that would be entirely 
compatible with the new status of a sovereign Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As numerous analysts indicated—and we have heard from a great 
many of them—this is a scheme, a trick to force Quebecers to 
chose between status quo and secession, to use the minister's 
pet word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the supreme court opinion justifying the 
hard line taken by the minister and the government. For that 
reason also, I repeat that Bill C-20 is clearly undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third reason is that Bill C-20 denies the universal rule of 
the 50% plus one majority and the basic rule of the equality of 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to recognize the 50% plus one rule and by drafting a 
provision, namely clause (2)(<I>b</I>), which is itself the opposite of 
clarity, the Liberal government ignores a rule which was very 
widely accepted by political actors in the 1980, 1992 and 1995 
referendums, and which they still consider valid. The 50% plus 
one rule is a universally recognized rule, which has applied and 
continue to apply to all referendums held under the auspices of 
the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government relies on an opinion of the Supreme 
Court of Canada to suggest that the 50% plus one rule is not 
valid, when in fact nothing in that opinion supports such a 
position, quite the contrary. 
The fact that the court made reference to a qualitative majority 
contradicts him and we will repeat this over and over again 
during the next few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The refusal to abide by the 50% plus one rule is outright 
discrimination against individuals and is contrary to the 
principle of equality of votes. In the end, the winning option 
is the one that has more weight than the other. For this very 
obvious reason, Bill C-20 is clearly undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly wish our institution, the House of Commons, would 
withdraw it because it goes against the imperative standard of 
the equality of all citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is Bill C-20 an unprecedented attack against Quebec 
democracy, but the government also now seems determined to use 
undemocratic methods to force its passage by the House of 
Commons: review by a legislative committee instead of a standing 
committee; hearings restricted to expert witnesses; refusal to 
consult the public; and finally, Motion No. 8, which is nothing 
more than a gag order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister seems to want to show once again that his 
government lacks transparency. It is not by refusing an open and 
democratic debate on Bill C-20 that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs will convince people that all he wants 
is truth and, above all, clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK198">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion No. 5 be amended by adding, after the word “donné” in 
the French version, the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“un”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I sign the amendment, so as to prove that all is transparent 
with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20, proposed by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and the Prime Minister to force on Quebecers referendum rules 
that are contrary to the most basic principles of democracy, is 
a departure from tradition and from respect for democratic 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that the federal government, which took 
part in the 1992 and 1995 referendums, is now breaking with the 
democratic tradition of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, we are asking for the freedom to have a responsible 
government in Quebec, the freedom to make sure that the 
Government of Quebec is recognized as responsible and 
legitimate, the responsibility and the freedom to determine the 
referendum question and to not be tied up by an untenable status 
quo. This is called the freedom to have the country of our 
choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have heard 
a lot said in the last little while about democracy in the House. 
There have been great protestations about what is taking place in 
the House, how the government is moving and the kinds of tactics 
that are being used in order to get the business of the House 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason to be concerned.  The House has not been a 
happy place in which to work or in which to have a legitimate 
debate for some time now. 
When considering that, we have to look at where that feeling 
arises from.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has spoken for a long time about the need to do 
something to clarify the rules for secession. The Prime Minister 
spoke about it during the 1995 referendum. I recall that he 
repeatedly stood in the House and said that 50 plus one was not 
enough.  This did not come to the floor of the House this week or 
last week; it is a position that has been held by the government 
for a very long time.  There was a discussion of this last summer 
leading up to the renewal of the session. In the Speech from the 
Throne there was an indication of the government's desire to do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each step of the way one of the parties opposite, rather than 
seeing this as an opportunity to debate a fundamental question of 
fundamental importance to the country, has said that it does not 
matter what occurs in this Chamber.  That party has said it does 
not matter what is put down by the Government of Canada, that its 
members will not involve themselves in the process and will do 
everything they can to stop it. That has been stated over and 
over again by members of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a certain point we are left to decide whether we want to let 
one party hijack the House.  It is unfortunate that the tools one 
has to deal with are heavy handed.  The tool to limit debate is 
not one which anybody in the House likes to see used but it is a 
necessary tool in the face of the activities, particularly in 
this place, of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this.  If we are talking about democracy, if we 
are talking about legitimate debate on legitimate questions in 
front of the House, let us look at what we are debating today. We 
entering into debate on 411 amendments to Bill C-20.  We are 
debating 12 of those amendments and now a subamendment to one of 
them. What are these earth shattering important amendments that 
we are going to take up the time of the country to debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 is “That Bill C-20 be amended by deleting the 
title”.  This is the quality of the debate the Bloc wants to put 
on the floor of the House. Motion No. 3 deletes lines 1 to 37 on 
page 1 and lines 1 to 33 on page 2 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read some of the lines that members of the Bloc would 
have us delete. “Whereas any proposal relating to the break-up 
of a democratic state is a matter of the utmost gravity and is of 
fundamental importance to all of its citizens”.  That is what 
they want us to delete, but there is more. “Whereas the 
government of any province of Canada is entitled to consult its 
population by referendum on any issue and is entitled to 
formulate the wording of its referendum question”.  That is what 
they want us to delete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we hear them arguing fiercely that the 
Government of Quebec has the right to ask any question that it 
wishes.  When I read “Whereas the government of any province of 
Canada is entitled to consult its population by referendum on any 
issue and is entitled to formulate the wording of its referendum 
question”, it seems to meet the test that the Bloc would have us 
consider.  Yet Motion No. 3 calls upon us to delete that from the 
preamble of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in case people have not understood that, Motion No. 7 is a 
very narrowly drawn motion.  Motion No. 7 says “That Bill C-20, 
in the preamble, be amended by deleting lines 11 to 15 on page 
1”. What are lines 11 to 15 on page 1?  “Whereas the government 
of any province of Canada is entitled to consult its population 
by referendum on any issue and is entitled to formulate the 
wording of its referendum question”.

<A NAME="LINK202">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 18 consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On debate, with six 
minutes left, the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to carry on with my speech regarding the private 
member's motion put forward by the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion, as stated, calls for the government to undertake a 
study for the implementation of the recommendations of the 
Richard inquiry on the Westray mine.  It is a very worthwhile and 
timely motion.  We were very pleased when it was brought before 
the House because all Canadians were horrified when 26 miners 
were killed in the Westray mine through what I believe to be 
criminal negligence and through what the chief justice found to 
be criminal negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were even more horrified when they realized that the 
crown prosecutors of Nova Scotia would have to drop or stay the 
charges against the Westray mine because under the current 
Criminal Code of Canada there was no way to make those charges 
stick.  That certainly is what caught in the craw of most 
Canadians.  There was no way to deal with the grief of the actual 
deaths of the 26 miners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was incredibly frustrating to see that the crown prosecutors 
of Nova Scotia did not have the tools to do the job to bring to 
justice the people who caused the deaths of the 26 miners through 
what I call criminal negligence, through what Justice Richard 
called criminal negligence, and I would go further, to what I 
call murder.  I am not afraid to call death caused by criminal 
negligence murder.  I am pleased to do so.  It goes beyond 
manslaughter.  In circumstances where those in control of an 
enterprise have been made aware over and over again that what is 
being done is dangerous, that workers' lives are being put at 
risk and yet they continue to do so until somebody dies is 
murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to join in the debate on the motion.  I would 
hope that the government members would see fit to support the 
motion because it is worded and crafted in a way that is very 
easy to agree with even for those who do not feel as strongly 
about the subject as I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the motion calls for is the government to begin to study how 
we could implement the recommendations of Judge Richard, 
specifically recommendation No. 73 which calls for amendments to 
Canadian legislation to contemplate the concept of corporate 
murder.  That is essentially what it is calling for, the concept 
of corporate manslaughter and corporate murder and to make 
changes and amendments to any legislation, such as the Workplace 
Safety and Health Act, the Canada Labour Code and the Criminal 
Code of Canada, to ensure that people, from the CEO right down to 
the boards of directors, the foremen, the managers and the 
frontline workers, can all be held criminally accountable when 
they cause death due to criminal negligence. 
I think it is a very worthwhile motion.  In fact, the leader of 
our party, the member for Halifax, has introduced a private 
member's bill that actually goes further than the private 
member's motion from the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  It states exactly what changes 
to those pieces of legislation are necessary to make corporate 
accountability a reality in matters of workplace safety and 
health.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the building trade, the construction industry.  I am 
no stranger to seeing people injured and killed on job sites.  It 
was my job, as the job steward, to pick up the tools of my fallen 
comrades and take them back to their families and wives and tell 
them the unhappy news that there had been an injury on the job. I 
picked up their tools so they would not lay in the mud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all too familiar with it.  I am familiar with it to the 
point where I can say right now that there is no production 
schedule in the world that justifies injuring, butchering, 
maiming, poisoning or killing Canadian workers.  I feel very 
strongly about that.  I think we have made that point clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members on the other side that if they will not 
consider the obvious moral and ethical issues around clean, safe 
and healthy workplaces, to please consider the economics of 
clean, safe and healthy workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province that I come from, we lose approximately 50,000 
person days a year due to strikes and lockouts and labour and 
work stoppages.  In that same period of time, we lose 550,000 
person days per year due to injuries and accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economics are clear.  If we are concerned about Canadian 
productivity, the onus should be on all of us to clean up the 
workplaces and minimize lost time due to injuries and accidents. 
The hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough certainly 
raises that issue for us when he asks us to debate the very 
important issue he raises with his motion on the Westray mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said earlier that some people call it murder when a death 
is caused due to criminal negligence, I asked the House to 
consider what happens when someone drinks a bottle of whiskey, 
hops in a car, runs someone over and kills them.  That is 
criminal.  That is murder.  That is not just a traffic violation. 
The person is guilty of murder if he or she is convicted under 
the Criminal Code of Canada.  It is not just a workplace safety 
and health issue when someone is killed due to criminal 
negligence on the job, it is murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding, I am sad to say, a couple of months ago the 
owner of a scrapyard hired a 17 year old kid.  He gave him a 
cutting torch and told him to cut an oil drum in half.  The kid 
blew himself to kingdom come.  That guy murdered the 17 year old 
kid and we will fight for legislation which will contemplate the 
concept of corporate murder and corporate accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I must protest.  The member is abusing the rights and privileges 
he enjoys in the House by using the word murder in the context of 
a terrible tragedy, in which indeed there may have been 
negligence, but it is before various tribunals.  If he really has 
the courage to use that term, then he should use it outside the 
House not inside the House because he has protection, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington has had the opportunity to put his thoughts 
on this on the record.  The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre is of

in May 1992.  It may help members gain a better understanding of 
what provoked the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 9, 1992, at 5.20 a.m., a violent explosion ripped under 
the tiny community of Plymouth, just east of the town of 
Stellarton, Nova Scotia.  The explosion occurred in the depths of 
the Westray coal mines, instantly killing the 26 miners working 
there at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 79, formerly Motion No. 455, was introduced by my 
colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough to ensure that 
something like this never happens again. 
Workplace safety must be the norm across the country, no matter 
what profession one chooses, whether working in a coal mine, a 
fish plant or on an assembly line.  Every Canadian has the right 
to feel safe at work and every corporate executive must take the 
initiative to ensure those standards are met.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 79 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of the House, the Criminal Code or other 
appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance with 
Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public Inquiry 
into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of ensuring 
that corporate executives and directors are held properly 
accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 73 in the report of the inquiry commissioner, 
Justice Peter K. Richard, reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, 
should institute a study of accountability of corporate 
executives and directors for the wrongful or negligent acts of 
the corporation and should introduce in the Parliament of Canada 
such amendments to legislation as are necessary to ensure that 
corporate executives and directors are held properly accountable 
for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 73 does not endorse any particular legislative 
action by parliament.  However, I will proceed by stressing that 
Motion No. 79 wishes to address the concerns referred to by 
Justice Peter Richard in his report, with an emphasis on the 
personal liability of key corporate officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal to create a new criminal offence for corporate 
officials for failing to maintain safe workplaces would, by 
definition, require adding new provisions to the criminal code. 
This could be done by adding new sections to the criminal code 
under subsection 467.5 and 467.6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 467.6 would extend personal criminal liability for 
the corporate failure to every officer or director of the 
corporation who knew or ought to have known, based on their 
experience, qualifications and duties, about the unsafe 
conditions in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way to address the matter would be to amend the criminal 
code provisions which define criminal negligence, section 219, 
and culpable homicide, section 222, in a way which specifically 
addresses death or bodily harm caused by a failure to maintain 
workplace safety on the part of a director or executive of a 
corporation.  The drawback to this approach is that it does not 
deal with situations where death or injuries do not result. As 
well, if one wished to strengthen the accountability of officials 
for workplace safety violations of their corporations, one could 
amend subsection 149.2 of the criminal code to include additional 
circumstances in which their liability could be triggered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am sure you are aware, Mr. Speaker, many corporate 
officials in today's marketplace have developed a cavalier 
attitude toward fair labour practices and workplace safety.  This 
approach cannot be condoned in any capacity.  As Canadians, we 
are all entitled to wake up and go to our place of work, wherever 
that may take us, and know that our well-being as individuals is 
protected and that workplace safety is reinforced and upheld on a 
daily basis.  However, in many situations the almighty dollar 
overshadows the secure working environment to which we are all 
entitled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the bottom line of any business is to make a profit. 
At the end of the day that is a very normal mindset for anyone 
who operates a business large or small.  If there is no profit at 
the end of the day, there will be no business shortly thereafter. 
In short, profitability equals sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must not let employers allow profits to take 
precedence over workplace safety.  This mindset is precisely what 
sets the tone for workplace tragedies and creates unsafe working 
conditions.  Businesses must ensure that their employees are 
adequately supervised and consistently updated on safe work 
practices.  Sadly, in the past, we have all witnessed individuals 
doing jobs they were not properly trained how to perform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that companies take the time to train employees 
so that additional risk is limited for employees and those around 
them who are in the workplace doing their everyday job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Management must also ensure that their employees have an 
appreciation of any special dangers inherent at the job site.  In 
the case of the Westray coal mine, many of the tradesmen were 
prone to perform unsafe tasks or to take dangerous shortcuts in 
their work, never once being told any different by management. In 
fact, in many cases there is no question that management was well 
aware, or ought to have been aware, that safe mining practices 
were not being performed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in Chief Justice Richard's report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no question that Westray management knew that the 
levels of methane underground at the coal mine were hazardous. 
Under section 72 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, such 
conditions mandated the withdrawal of workers from the affected 
area, and that is the primary reason, management in this instance 
chose to ignore that fact. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this situation, as in all situations, the open door policy of 
management could have helped prevent the deaths of the 26 coal 
miners that devastating morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No employee ever wants to feel as if his or her safety concerns 
are falling on deaf ears.  A collaborative effort among upper, 
middle and lower management must be invoked to create an 
environment that is hazardous free for every employee across the 
country.  Of course, accidents happen, but measures must be in 
place to minimize the risk of death or injury.  No single 
environment is 100% danger free, but in most cases the risk of 
danger can be significantly less with a bit of common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the Westray coal mine tragedy, the inquiry was set 
out to investigate the following:  the occurrence of the 
explosion that resulted in the loss of life; was the occurrence 
preventable; whether any neglect caused or contributed to the 
explosion in any way; and was the mine in compliance with 
applicable statutes, regulations, orders, rules or directions. 
These questions which were investigated at the time of the 
inquiry are many of the same questions that should be reviewed 
with business executives on a daily basis to ensure that they are 
operating a safe company.  As well, it would be a good 
opportunity to ensure that businesses are in compliance with 
current regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As representatives of the federal government we have to ensure 
that accountability is upheld in this country so that situations 
such as Westray and others do not ever again repeat themselves. 
The devastation of the Westray explosion will be felt for many, 
many years in the tiny community of Stellarton and, indeed, all 
of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, on behalf of every individual affected by this horrible 
tragedy, I ask members to lend their assistance to this motion 
and give it their strongest consideration and support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in my riding, which is adjacent to Hamilton, there is a 
bronze sculpture that was created a few years ago which caused a 
lot of controversy in my riding.  It is to commemorate those who 
have died in the workplace.  What it is comprised of is a huge 
slab.  A workman is holding on to the edge of the slab backward 
and he is headless.  It is very, very dramatic.  Many people in 
the Hamilton community were almost offended by this piece of 
sculpture, and yet it makes its point enormously eloquently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say that Hamilton is an industrial town.  It has two 
major steel corporations and a number of heavy industries.  I 
hate to say it, but industrial accidents are not an infrequent 
occurrence.  Fortunately they are much rarer than they used to be 
20, 30 or 40 years ago, but they still occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with industrial accidents is that it is very 
difficult to determine if negligence occurred.  Sometimes it may 
not be negligence at all.  It may be that the firm has done 
everything it thought was correct, but still the accidents occur. 
The problem is, where do we draw the line between no negligence, 
negligence and wilful negligence.  This motion is directed toward 
the idea of wilful negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a number of years during my youth I was a police reporter at 
the local newspaper.  I had the occasion to be on the scene of a 
number of industrial accidents.  I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
there is nothing more horrible than to see somebody who has been 
absolutely crushed to a pulp by some sort of machine, or has been 
pulled into a machine, or some young person who suffocated as a 
result of going into a chamber in which the air was exhausted. 
These things do occur and they are dreadful tragedies.  When one 
has any kind of experience with that one can certainly appreciate 
and sympathize with the very strong feelings of the relatives of 
those at Westray who lost their lives.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty I have with the motion is twofold.  One is this 
concept of where one draws the line between criminal negligence 
as already defined in the criminal code and some other area of 
wilful negligence that is not defined in the code.  I am not 
certain you can do that very easily, Mr. Speaker.  I am just not 
certain at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would like to make is the problem that the 
motion also uses the words “corporate executives”.  The motion 
is directed against this idea that corporations, in their haste 
to make profit, are the ones that are most likely to be negligent 
to the point of risking their workers in a criminal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Right on.  You have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  That may be where the frustration occurs 
with the Westray instance, but I have to point out to the member 
opposite who is remarking that it would be more precise to use 
the word businessman or entrepreneur because, in my experience as 
a police reporter covering industrial accidents, I can tell the 
member opposite that I saw more death associated with small 
business than I did with large corporations.  The reality is that 
the large corporations, by and large, have the means to make sure 
that workplace safety provisions are in place.  But the small 
entrepreneurs often fail in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  Not very long ago we had a fatal 
accident with a student employee in a bakery who was operating a 
machine that kneads dough.  If I understand this motion 
correctly, it is that the person who is in charge of that small 
bakery should be subject to some sort of criminal code provision, 
rather than the Ontario labour code provisions that are already 
applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Mr. Speaker, you could reduce it even further.  You 
could take this problem of industrial safety to the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in a small community in Ontario in the countryside and we 
have had several accidents within my memory where people have 
been drawn into a combine or where people have climbed down into 
a silo and have died as a result of the gases that are heavier 
than air and form a pool at the bottom of the silo.  Should these 
farmers be subject to criminal code provisions because they 
allowed an accident to occur on their farm, which may indeed have 
actually happened to their very family?  It might have been a son 
who died or a farmhand who died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have enormous sympathy for the frustration felt by the 
people who lost loved ones at Westray, it seems to me that the 
proper direction of the anger and the reform should be to bring 
in better provincial laws regarding workplace safety.  It is 
perfectly possible to have provincial laws that have severe 
penalties if employers do not provide adequate safety for the 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, Mr. Speaker, I just want to make the point to all members 
who are interested in this issue that you cannot make a 
distinction between corporate Canada and then leave out every 
other type of employer.  Mr. Speaker, if you are going to apply 
the criminal code or any other law you must apply it universally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a member opposite nodding.  I see some sympathy there. 
Yes, by all means, if we can improve the law federally, perhaps 
not through the criminal code, so that it enforces cross-Canada 
standards of workplace safety, whether it is on the farm, whether 
it is in a small enterprise or in a large corporation, I would 
say yes, absolutely, and amend the motion to that effect, except 
there is one reality check here and that is the problem that 
unfortunately workplace safety is primarily a provincial 
responsibility.  Certainly we who are MPs from Ontario find that 
it is almost impossible to make any kind of meaningful dialogue 
with the provincial government on any issue.  I certainly do not 
think the provincial government would accept any kind of 
standards brought in by the national government on workplace 
safety, but I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, if it were possible I 
would dearly love to do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to talk about an important subject that is dear to 
my heart. I will try to easy, since it is a question that is 
very dear to many hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason all of this is so dear to my heart goes back to the 
accident at the Westray Mine on May 9, 1922. We lost friends in 
this tragedy, 26 miners. Talking about this here in the House is 
a very emotional thing for me, because I myself am a former 
miner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked for more than 15 years in the depths of a mine, I 
remember that, in 1976, in the mine where I was working, we 
buried six miners in 18 months. It is really not easy to accept 
the death of a colleague in one's workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, one of those guys drove to work with me every day. 
One morning we came in together and by nighttime, he was gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for introducing this bill in the 
House. It reminds me of another bill, introduced by the leader 
of the NDP, which has not been drawn yet and which is intended 
to show Canadians that it is absolutely unacceptable in Canada 
that a corporation, whether small, medium or large, would not 
have a license to hire workers and then be found guilty of 
criminal negligence causing the death of a worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Motion No. 79 is asking members to support. We need 
a bill to forbid an employer to obtain a licence to hire workers 
and then do what it pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I recall correctly what happened in the Westray disaster, the 
federal government should assume its responsibilities, because 
it is partly to be blamed for what happened. I will explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my memory serves me right, workers from the Westray mine went 
to the employment insurance office and asked if they would be 
penalized if they quit their job. They were told that if they 
quit their job, it would not be justified. The same thing 
happened in others mines in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, a fellow named Stéphane quit his job because it was 
unsafe, but the employment insurance commission denied him 
benefits. 
He appealed and lost his appeal. He then had to appear before an 
adjudicator and won at long last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another similar case occurred when a worker refused to perform 
an unsafe task with a truck. The truck had faulty brakes, and 
when he quit his job the federal government turned down his 
application for employment insurance benefits, stating that 
safety was not sufficient grounds to quit one's job. He appealed 
to the employment insurance commission in Bathurst, and the 
commission denied him benefits. He then appeared before an 
adjudicator and won his case. The same thing happened at the 
Westray mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers from the Westray mine appeared before the employment 
insurance commission, asking to quit their jobs because of 
safety concerns. 
I want to inform the House that the steelworkers' union had been 
approached to establish a local union at the Westray mine 
because it was unsafe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington is changing his 
mind to protect companies, to protect the big bosses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he does not represent Canadians or workers of this 
country. Today, if I get behind the wheel of my car after I had 
three or four drinks and I kill someone, I would be guilty and I 
would go to jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a corporate executive can blackmail his employees by 
telling them “If you do not work, you will lose your jobs” and 
when the federal government condones that by refusing to pay 
employment insurance benefits to those who want to leave their 
jobs, I say that those who made those decisions and the 
ministers who decided to impose such restrictions on workers 
should go to jail too. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad we have to plead with the government to pass a law 
that any person in charge of a company should not have a licence 
to run an industry unsafely and jeopardize the lives of workers 
in a mine or any workplace.  That is what happened at Westray 
mine. Those people claimed it was an unsafe workplace. When they 
wanted to take the president of the company to court to be put in 
front of a judge, they were refused because there was no law to 
do it. We are asking the Government of Canada to set an example 
and show every province that no one will have a licence to have a 
place of work which jeopardizes the safety of the workers because 
it is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked underground for 15 years.  In 1976 within a period of 
18 months, we buried six workers.  We buried one after the other 
for 18 months.  It was no fun having to bury our friends and 
colleagues.  Remember how members of the House reacted when we 
lost one of our colleagues a few years ago and another colleague 
last year. Hon. members know how they felt.  The member who flew 
on a jet to Windsor knows how he felt.  I can tell him how I felt 
when we lost our miners underground at Brunswick mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how the people at Westray felt when they lost 26 of their 
miners.  I know how hurt they were.  The government can help them 
by putting a law in place so that a court of law will judge 
whether or not the person was negligent.  We are asking for that 
basic principle, that those who are negligent are judged in a 
court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the culprit, the vice-president of the company, getting 
away with all of this?  It is totally unacceptable and it should 
never be tolerated in Canada. That is why I am asking the 
government to rethink what is going on, to rethink its position 
on the motion by the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
Let us put a committee together to look at some rules and 
regulations that will take care of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a miner or a worker is negligent and does something to kill 
somebody else, he will go in front of a judge.  Why do the people 
in charge of a company have the licence to get away with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for something that is out of the ordinary.  We 
are asking for justice.  We are asking for justice for our 
workers, the women and men who are forced by negligent people to 
work in an unsafe place.  We see it every day.  We cannot hide 
behind facts when culprits get people to work in unsafe places. 
We cannot hide behind facts. The culprits should go before a 
court and be judged like any other Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to spend a few minutes on the private member's 
motion that is before us today. The motion is that that this 
House should be called upon to amend the criminal code or other 
appropriate federal statutes to be in accordance with 
recommendation no. 73 of the province of Nova Scotia's public 
inquiry into the Westray mine disaster. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1405"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is certainly supportable because of the aspect of 
accountability for negligence. It makes good sense that people 
should not be asked to work in obviously unsafe conditions.  If 
there is a requirement to work in an unsafe area, then the 
employee should have the right to refuse that work.  If an 
employee is injured or killed in an unsafe work area and the 
employer could be shown to be negligent, I agree that he or she 
should be held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been waiting for some time for amendments to part II of 
the labour code which would deal with health and safety.  I 
believe there will be provisions in that code which will come 
very close to achieving these ends.  We have indicated that we 
will be supporting that legislation when it comes to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit and intent of the motion is to hold employers 
accountable for providing a safe workplace.  I know that Mr. 
Speaker has been an employer for a good many years and has always 
striven to provide a safe workplace for his employees. No doubt 
his employees are his number one consideration.  This is only 
reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very cautious and strike a balance.  It is up to 
the employer to provide a safe workplace.  There also should be a 
recommendation or at least an onus on the employee not to use the 
clause frivolously and only to protest about bona fide unsafe 
working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have appreciated the opportunity to say a few words to the 
motion. I am certain that when Bill C-12, the amendments to the 
Canada Labour Code, comes before the House we will have a lot 
more to say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the motion put forward by the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. Our leader, the member for 
Halifax, has already put in place a private member's bill which 
has not yet been drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Judge Richard's recommendations came down on December 
18, 1997, sadly we have not seen the government come up with any 
answers to his recommendations.  Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no doubt in anybody's mind whatsoever what happened at 
Westray.  There was negligence on behalf of the corporate 
executives and the owners of Curragh Resources, namely Clifford 
Frame.  There was no question, but what was missing was the law 
to hold them accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time we did not have laws that strongly enforced impaired 
driving charges. At one time we did not have laws which brought 
criminals to justice when they raped women.  At one time we did 
not have laws in place in regard to spousal abuse.  At one time 
we did not have laws in place for child molesters.  But what did 
we do to improve those situations?  We brought in laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government with any degree of conscience, leadership or vision 
would have come forth with a motion or bill to address this 
issue.  It should not be left to the members of the opposition, 
but thank God members on this side have seen fit to address the 
issue because the government has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot about what happened at Westray. Canadians 
nationwide were appalled.  They could not believe that when 
workers go into their workplace they give up the right to be 
treated equally.  They give up the right to be treated as human 
beings, as any other Canadian citizen, if someone's negligence 
and outright disregard causes their death.

in Canada?  It is not to protect the workers.  It is to protect 
the corporations from being sued by their workers if there is 
negligence and they become injured on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were supposed to be no-fault insurance plans to protect 
the corporations but what has happened?  Workers do not have the 
same rights.  They cannot sue their employer for outright 
negligence.  What is even worse, we now find out that even if 
there are numerous deaths as a result of that negligence there 
are no laws that can bring those executives to task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about whimsical approaches.  This is not about a one 
time instance where something happened and the worker died.  This 
was chronic negligence.  This was repetitious disregard for 
health and safety legislation.  This was as a result not just of 
the company but of the conflict of interest of provincial 
governments and federal governments because they had been 
involved in making sure that project took place, that the mine 
operated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we expect justice when there was provincial and federal 
government involvement in that whole Westray Project?  How can we 
ask for justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not let the lives of those 26 miners and the hardship and 
grieving of their families go for naught.  Let us at least see 
one inkling of good come from that disaster. Let us see the 
criminal laws in this country change to bring those negligent 
employers—I do not care whether they are large employers or 
small employers—if they have been negligent, let them be taken 
to task before the courts of this country and be held 
accountable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise with 
pleasure this afternoon to participate in this debate.  I will 
take this opportunity to congratulate and thank my hon. colleague 
from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for bringing this motion 
forward and for working so hard to make this Westray motion 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague continues to shed light on the important matter of 
workplace safety as a result of the Westray mine disaster in May 
1992.  I and indeed the entire caucus of the PC party support the 
motion fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to read Motion No. 79 to the House.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the Criminal Code or other 
appropriate federal statutes should be amended in accordance with 
Recommendation 73 of the Province of Nova Scotia's Public Inquiry 
into the Westray disaster, specifically with the goal of ensuring 
that corporate executives and directors are held properly 
accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I think that it is important for me to read 
Recommendation 73 of the Westray inquiry.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through the Department of Justice, 
should institute a study— 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Of the accountability of corporate executives and directors for 
the wrongful or negligent acts of the corporation and should 
introduce in the Parliament of Canada such amendments to 
legislation as are necessary to ensure that corporate executives 
and directors are held properly accountable for workplace safety. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 73 clearly calls on the Government of Canada 
through the justice department to institute a study to ensure the 
accountability of corporate executives.  The criminal code must 
be amended to ensure that corporate executives and directors are 
held properly accountable for workplace safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me inform members of the House what brought this motion to 
life.  On May 9, 1992, an explosion occurred at the Westray mine 
killing 26 workers.  It was a horrible tragedy, one that was felt 
throughout the province of Nova Scotia and indeed the country. 
Many Nova Scotians acted in heroic fashion that deadly day back 
in May 1992.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devastation on that Mother's Day nearly eight years ago has 
left a long and painful memory in the hearts and minds of miners 
in the province of Nova Scotia.  The explosion at the Westray 
coal mine sent a very chilling message to the people.  The 
message was that haste and financial gain often put people's 
lives in danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death of the 26 coal miners was foreign and unexpected to a 
peaceful community like Plymouth.  The families of these miners 
were left having to come to grips with how such a tragedy could 
have occurred.  That is why it is incumbent upon us as 
legislators to ensure that there is a safe working environment 
for all workers engaged in labour activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Days after the Westray mine explosion, on May 15, the Government 
of Nova Scotia appointed Mr. Justice Peter Richard to head a 
commission of inquiry established under the Public Inquiries Act. 
The commission had a very broad mandate so as to shed light on 
the explosion and all related circumstances.  The commission's 
work thus began immediately to prepare the public hearings set to 
begin on October 19, 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final tabling of this report occurred five years later in 
November 1997.  The report entitled <I>The Westray Story: A 
Predictable Path to Disaster</I> contained 74 recommendations.  It 
concluded that this tragedy could have been avoided if minimal 
occupational safety standards had been met.  Allow me to take a 
moment to read from Justice Richard's report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Westray Story is a complex mosaic of actions, omissions, 
mistakes, incompetence, apathy, cynicism, stupidity, 
neglect—viewed in context, these seemingly isolated incidents 
constitute a mindset or operating philosophy that appears to 
favour expediency over intelligent planning and that trivializes 
safety concerns.  Indeed, management at Westray displayed a 
certain disdain for safety and appeared to regard safety 
conscious workers as the wimps in the organization.  To its 
discredit, the management at Westray, through either incompetence 
or ignorance, lost sight of the basic tenet of coal mining that 
safe mining is good business. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ways to prevent such tragedies.  There are ways to 
eliminate criminal actions by corporations, and this is what the 
motion seeks to address.  There are ways it can be done by 
amending the criminal code, some of which were proposed by 
Justice Richard.  One proposal would be to create a new criminal 
offence that would impose criminal liability on directors or 
others responsible for failing to ensure that corporations 
maintain an appropriate standard of occupational health and 
safety in the workplace.  This is precisely what this motion 
would address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia mining is regulated by three pieces of 
legislation: the mineral resources act, the occupational health 
and safety act, and the coal mines regulation act.  Mr. Justice 
Richard reviewed all these provincial acts and concluded that 
their main purpose was to ensure the safety of all workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we have seen many examples of occupational safety 
in the workplace taking second spot behind the bottom line, 
especially in the mining industry where the very nature of the 
work involves a great deal of risk.  It is the duty of company 
officers to ensure that the work is done in the safest possible 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that individuals inside and outside corporate 
Canada are dealt with equally and fairly under the law. 
Executives will not be able to hide behind their job titles in 
the commission of their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporate Canada understandably has two related functions: to 
make a profit and to create jobs.  Profit is a good thing but a 
balance has to be struck between making a profit and the cost 
that is sometimes incurred by the behaviour of some companies. 
There must be a balance between making a profit and the means by 
which to get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 220 of the criminal code refers specifically to criminal 
negligence causing death.  Similarly section 234 refers to 
manslaughter.  There may be the need as well to introduce 
amendments to these sections that would broaden the scope of 
culpability, or perhaps even go so far as to make specific 
references to executives, directors or persons in management 
positions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that the devastation of the Westray disaster will 
not be forgotten.  Just as important, the recommendations of the 
inquiry cannot be forgotten either.  The fundamental and basic 
responsibilities for the safe operation of an underground coal 
mine, and indeed any industrial undertaking, rest very much with 
the owners and managers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westray management starting with the CEO was required by law, 
and certainly by good business practices and good conscience, to 
design and operate a mine safely.  The significance of that 
failure cannot be overstated.  Simply because others were also 
abdicating their responsibilities is not an answer.  Shared 
responsibility can be said to be implicit in the recommendations 
that came from Mr. Justice Richard's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies must ensure that to avoid practising hazardous or 
illegal practices these acts cannot be condoned in any capacity. 
If companies have not already done so, they should do everything 
within their power to implement safe, ethical work practices. 
Ethics such as these should be studied and followed everywhere in 
places of employment, even in upper management.  If this is not 
the case, actions must be taken to demonstrate the importance and 
the seriousness of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business executives must promote and nurture safe work ethics 
and have an open, approachable attitude toward their employees. 
No one ever wants to feel the effects that were felt in Plymouth 
with the Westray mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion and thank 
my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take a few minutes to speak to the issue we are addressing 
today, the Westray mine disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government seems to forget such disasters quickly. 
This is something that should leave a mark, that we should not 
forget and, if possible, that should not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inquiry into the Westray mine accident showed that there was 
negligence, that part II of the labour code was not complied 
with. A review of part II of the labour code has been tabled, 
but we sense that this is not part of the government's 
priorities at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been almost 10 years that this part of the labour code 
has not been reviewed. This is something that should be reviewed 
regularly, not every 10 years. Ten years is much too long; there 
are too many adjustments and changes to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this part of the labour code, many things are written, but 
are not done. It says we should do this and that. Also, fines 
for non-compliance are ridiculously low. Employers take advantage 
of this, particularly big companies such as the ones operating 
the mine. They do not comply with the code and, in any case, do 
not care about these ridiculous fines. They can afford to pay 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a crucial point and I think it should be entirely 
reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Powers should also be given to these industries' employees. They 
should be able to lodge complaints. Currently, under the labour 
code, in respect of occupational health and safety, officials 
are sent by the government to inspect sites and mines.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the new labour code provides for 
the establishment of committees made up of inspectors, employees 
and employer representatives, who will ensure compliance with 
the occupational health code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How it will be done is another story because the way the bill is 
drafted, it seems very complicated. However, we will discuss 
this in committee and make amendments if necessary. We must 
correct what is wrong with respect to occupational health and 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noted other significant errors in this document. Fines 
are imposed, but nothing is said about the way they will be 
collected. 
Inspectors do not deal with that. Very often, the government 
does not do its job. It makes tough laws, but does not provide 
the people required to enforce those laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all fine and well to have a very tough and very clear 
piece of legislation. It looks good, but we need the human and 
financial resources to enforce it. It is not a job for the 
police, but for the experts in labour code issues who inspect 
these sites. We must never ever see such a tragedy again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I look at what is being done in Quebec, our labour code and 
our legislation are a lot tougher than those of the federal 
government. That is why our miners are much better protected. 
There are legal procedures for them to make formal complaints or 
take group action against the employer if he does not do his job 
and does not see to the safety and security of his workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could take as an example what is being done in Quebec and 
elsewhere where there are laws protecting employees, people 
working in the mines, and their families. It is hard enough on 
these people's health to work in a mine. We know how they suffer 
from chronic diseases and other problems, how quickly these men 
and women age because they work underground in an environment 
that is not necessarily healthy. We must make sure they have 
what they need, all the necessary tools and equipment to protect 
them physically in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot give this to miners, to people who work very hard 
all their life for these companies, we are not worth much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some work to do in this area. The labour code is not the 
only solution. There are many other options. Legal proceedings 
for instance. I know that often, and this is another problem, 
when one tries to sue big companies, mine owners, the final 
outcome is far from certain. Obviously small miners, or the 
families affected by these events, cannot afford to take on big 
companies like that, to hire lawyers and pay court fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe justice must be done. Those who are really to blame, 
who were negligent, must pay for their mistakes. Such a tragedy 
should never ever be allowed to happen again, both for the sake 
of the families and the children involved, and for all those 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. The 
order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
order paper.

March 13, at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Orders 28(2) and 
24(1).
