	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to thank the city of Calgary for hosting 
MusicFest Canada 95.
<P>
	MusicFest Canada is the largest educational music festival in 
North America. With school choirs, jazz ensembles and concert 
bands from coast to coast, over 7,000 students were welcomed 
by the people of Calgary. Their warm hospitality was 
appreciated by all schools attending this event including Huron 
Heights Secondary School which is in my riding.
<P>
	The Huron Jazz Ensembles conducted by Kevin Anderson 
represented Huron Heights with class in their role as 
ambassadors of the York-Simcoe region in this prestigious 
festival. Both c'est jazz, Huron's vocal jazz ensemble, and After 
Hours, the senior jazz band, were honoured with silver awards 
for their splendid performances.
<P>
	In individual categories, Huron Heights again placed among 
the nation's best. Andrew Jones was named lead trombonist in 
the festival's Canadian All-Star Jazz Band. Andrew was also 
honoured with a prestigious General Motors award of 
excellence scholarship.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
cuts announced at Telefilm threaten successful festivals like the 
international film festival in Abitibi-Témiscamingue and the 
Carrousel festival in Rimouski, which will lose their subsidies 
entirely.
<P>
	These festivals, however, have proven their success, often on 
shoestring budgets, with the quality of their events and their 
popularity with the public. They are local initiatives that are the 
pride of their region and of all of Quebec.
<P>
	Telefilm's director, François Macerola, revealed his true 
colours with the dispassionate comment that the cuts had to be 
made somewhere. Clearly, the aim is to cut in the regions and 
concentrate everything in the major centres to benefit the 
money-making cultural events and industries. That is what it is 
all about. Quebecers cannot imagine their future as a people 
without the support and vitality of all the regions in Quebec.
<P>
	This is another example of Quebec solidarity that the federal 
government fails to grasp. We wonder whether the directors 
should not attend one of the Minister of Canadian Heritage's 
$2,000 a plate dinners to ensure the survival of the regional 
festivals. When is the minister's next dinner?

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate a select group of men and women we as 
parliamentarians have come to know on a professional basis. 
The people of whom I speak are the men and women of the 
House of Commons security services which is celebrating its 
75th anniversary this year.
<P>
	The history of the security services may be traced from the 
original two parliamentary door guards appointed to keep watch 
on the newly constructed departmental buildings in 1865 
through the creation in 1868 of the Dominion Police Force 
which was absorbed into the Royal North West Mounted Police 
in 1920, to the creation of the House of Commons protective 
staff. In recent years, in recognition of the broader scope of its 
activities, the House changed the title to security services. It has 
and continues to provide an excellent service, not only to the 
members of this House, but to all who enter these buildings.
<P>
	I invite all members of this House to join me in congratulating 
members of the House of Commons security services on a job 
well done as well as wishing them continued success in the years 
to come.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERESTRATES">INTEREST RATES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, 
Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the battle lines continue to grow each 
day concerning who is right and who is wrong in analysing the 
Canadian economy. On one side people such as Lloyd Atkinson, 
former head economist at the Bank of Montreal, are saying that 
unless the Bank of Canada eases up on interest rates, our 
economy will be heading toward a recession within a year. On 
the other side is Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen who 
feared a move to decrease the interest rate because it would 
undermine his bank's inflation fighting credentials.
<P>
	Still other noted economists strongly believe that the Bank of 
Canada will have no choice but to either lower interest rates or 
let the dollar weaken to keep the economy afloat. Yesterday's 
unexpected announcement by the Bank of Canada of a reduction 
rate by 19 basis points to 7.19 per cent was a welcome relief for 
Canadians. Our standard of living has steadily declined over the 
past four years. We need a made in Canada interest rate policy.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPINABIFIDA">SPINA BIFIDA</A></H3>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
bringing to the attention of the House the plight of lesser known 
diseases is neither exciting nor titillating, but the tragedies they 
leave in their wake are real.
<P>
	This is Spina Bifida Week in Canada. This illness occurs 
within the first four weeks of pregnancy and causes various 
levels of permanent nerve damage and lower limb paralysis. 
One in every 750 children born in Canada has spina bifida.
<P>
	We now know that giving folic acid to a woman during early 
pregnancy can reduce the risk of spina bifida in the fetus. The 
Spina Bifida Association would like to raise awareness of the 
benefits of folic acid among women of child bearing age and 
among the population in general.
<P>
	In 1994-95 Health Canada contributed $55,000 to assist the 
national level of the Spina Bifida Association of Canada in its 
many developmental, promotional and service activities across 
the country.
<P>
	I congratulate the Spina Bifida Association and its many 
volunteers for their quiet but excellent work, and ask members 
to join me-

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, culinary writer Marcella Hazan refers to it 
as the best of its kind in the world. A Cornell University study 
called it the best all round training school.
<P>
	The success story they are referring to is the Stratford Chefs 
School. The school is operated by Stratford restaurant owners 
James Morris and Eleanor Kane. From November to March, 
their restaurant kitchens are transformed into classrooms and 
their cooks into teachers.
<P>
	By learning from professionals in a working atmosphere, 
graduates are able to make the transition to the workforce 
without missing a step. Today, graduates are being snapped up 
by the world's hottest restaurants in Germany, England, New 
York and Japan.
<P>
	Considering the 100 per cent employment record of the 
school, there is little mystery surrounding the yearly flood of 
applications to fill the 65 available positions.
<P>
	I congratulate the Stratford Chefs School and wish it 
continuing success in the international sphere.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, more 
damning revelations were made yesterday by Dr. Perrault in 
connection with the work of the Krever Commission.Dr. Perrault, formerly of the Red Cross, stated that only one 
national political authority could have resolved the impasse at 
the time and prevented the infection of hundreds of 
hemophiliacs.
<P>
	For the first time, Dr. Perrault indicated that this political 
authority was the federal Minister of Health, since the products 
used by hemophiliacs were clearly under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	Despite these allegations, Justice Krever still does not intend 
to ask the federal politicians involved in the matter to testify 
before the commission. Why this stubbornness? Whose interests 
are being served by not having this whole disturbing business 
come to light? The Bloc Quebecois is wondering about the real 
reasons keeping the whole truth on this terrible tragedy from 
coming out.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the hon. member for Waterloo asked me 
when I was going to poll my constituents on Bill C-68 and 
follow the results. I did. The results of an impartial question 
were 84 per cent opposed to government legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13801"> 13801 </A></B>
<P>
	Last night after the Liberals rammed through the passage of 
Bill C-68, a CTV program held a phone in poll asking whether 
or not the public supported the government legislation. The 
program Canada Tonight which is broadcast from Vancouver 
to Toronto made use of two 1-900 numbers for the listening 
audience to phone in and cast their vote. Twenty-three thousand 
six hundred people made their wishes known. Eighty-four per 
cent opposed the government legislation.
<P>
	For Liberal backbenchers who wanted to represent their 
constituents, the Prime Minister had a warning in caucus this 
morning. Vote against me once, that is once too often. Vote 
against me twice, you are out. That is Liberal democracy.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice thought his problems were over last 
night. They are only just beginning.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
usually not my style to rub salt in a wound, but after sitting in the 
House last week listening to all the Ontario Liberal MPs state 
how they were going to sweep the provincial election and wipe 
out the Conservatives, I feel it is time for me to have my say. 
Therefore, first and foremost, I am serving a special lunch 
tomorrow in my office. I invite all of them to come. They will 
eat crow as the entrée.
<P>
	Also, it is truly sad to hear the Reform members taking credit 
for the Conservative party win when they did not get a single 
solitary Reform member candidate elected.
<P>
	Let us give credit where credit is due. Let us congratulate 
Premier-elect Mike Harris and the PC party on such a decisive 
victory.
<P>
	All I have to say to the Liberals and the Reformers is that in 
1997 I will see them once again. I will be serving the entrée of 
crow.

Speaker, today the Minister of Health presented Canada 
volunteer awards to several outstanding Canadians. Among 
them was Brian Ducharme of Tecumseh, Ontario in the riding of 
Windsor-St. Clair.
<P>
	Brian Ducharme has served as a volunteer board member with 
Hiatus House in Windsor since 1981. Hiatus House is a shelter 
for battered women and their children. Because of the 
contributions of Brian Ducharme and others like him, it is a 
shelter with a difference. Indeed, it is the premier facility of its 
kind in Canada.
<P>
	I am proud to be able to acknowledge Mr. Ducharme and his 
contributions in this House.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this week we paid tribute to the tremendous 
contribution of the federal Public Service of Canada. With all 
the pain associated with downsizing where many employees are 
deemed surplus and unnecessary, it is critical during this 
difficult period that we dispel the many stereotypes that exist 
about our public service.
<P>
	It is also critical particularly at this time that we offer support 
to those public servants and their families who have been 
affected. We are at a crossroads in our history where the role and 
direction of government is being scrutinized.
<P>
	Canada is a great nation that is making great strides to remain 
competitive in an ever changing global marketplace. Canada's 
public service is known as one of the best in the world. All 
Canadians benefit from the many services they deliver which 
makes Canada the number one country in which to live.
<P>
	Today I salute the many public servants in my riding of 
Cumberland-Colchester. I thank them for their dedicated 
quality service and their commitment to finding better ways to 
improve Canada.

am pleased to announce that Mrs. Claire Culhane of Vancouver 
East has been selected as one of the 23 recipients of the 1995 
Canada Volunteer Medal and Certificate of Honour.
<P>
	Mrs. Culhane is a respected and admired Canadian who is a 
competent fighter for justice. Some of her campaigns against 
injustice include: anti-Franco activities in Spain in the 1930s; 
anti-poverty activities in Montreal in the 1940s; assisting her 
husband with the Shipyard Labour Organization in 1944; 
leading the Workers Education Association in 1945; and 
opposing Canada's involvement in the Vietnam war.

Canadian peacekeepers are among the hostages still being held 
by Bosnian Serbs, while several other UN peacekeepers and 
observers were released yesterday.
<P>
	We hope that they will not be used as the ultimate bargaining 
chip and demand that they be released immediately and 
unconditionally.
<P>
	We deeply regret the rather low key involvement of the 
Canadian government in this crisis. Not only is Canada not a 
member of the contact group, which considerably limits its 
influence, but it has no policy regarding a Canadian contribution 
to the new rapid reaction force.
<P>
	Such a lack of leadership could harm not only Canada's 
reputation but also the efforts of peacekeepers on the site, as the 
Bosnian army prepares to launch an offensive north of Sarajevo, 
which could lead to another crisis.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SENTENCINGLEGISLATION">SENTENCING LEGISLATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-41 
destroys the principle that as Canadians we all stand equal 
before the law. Section 718.2 of this bill would have the courts 
administer greater penalties for violent crimes committed 
against certain groups identified by the justice minister in this 
bill.
<P>
	The courts already take aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances into consideration when determining the penalty 
to impose on an offender. This section tells the court that some 
acts of violence are to be taken more seriously than others 
because of who the victims are. This creates special status and is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Section 718.2 serves absolutely no purpose other than to grant 
an opportunity for the justice minister to make a politically 
correct statement. The Criminal Code, the law of this land, is not 
the place for the government to be making politically correct 
statements. The Criminal Code must uphold the most 
fundamental principle of law: that all Canadians, all citizens 
must stand equal before the law.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of France has just announced that it plans to resume 
nuclear testing in the South Pacific, ending a moratorium on 
testing that has held since 1992.
<P>
	The statement of principles from the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty signed in May of this year commits all 
nuclear weapons states to exercise utmost restraint on nuclear 
testing pending the signing of a comprehensive test ban treaty. 
The French announcement is clearly a step in the opposite 
direction.
<P>
	The Canadian government was one of the many nations that 
pushed to make this treaty binding and permanent. Now, just one 
month after that signing, the spirit of the agreement is 
threatened.
<P>
	I call on the Canadian government to show that it means what 
it says by protesting France's decision and to restate this 
country's commitment to a ban on all nuclear testing.

yesterday, the Deputy Premier of Quebec took the opportunity, 
while visiting the Parliament in Strasbourg, to make waves and 
try to discredit Canada over the issue that has become known as

<P>
	``We were extremely disappointed'', he said,``to see our

<P>
	Must we remind the Deputy Premier of Quebec of the 
extraordinary support received by Canada both at home and 
abroad in this conflict? Perhaps he should be reminded that the 
Bloc Quebecois and a very large majority of Quebecers also 
supported our position.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADASOCIALTRANSFER">CANADA SOCIAL TRANSFER</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in a report published today, the National Council of 
Welfare launched a stinging condemnation of the Canada social 
transfer. According to the report, this brainchild of the Minister 
of Finance was the worst initiative in 30 years because it 
threatened to destroy the very foundation of social services and 
programs in Canada. According to the Council, the reform of 
transfer payments would inevitably lead to a reduction in 
spending on social assistance.
<P>
	My question is of course directed to the father of this 
brainchild, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Does the minister agree, as the Council stated, that by 
reducing federal contributions to social programs funding, the 
Canada social transfer will cause the provinces to reduce their 
budgets for social assistance and make the most vulnerable in 
our society even poorer?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I liked the 
preamble much better than the question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fact is that the Canada social transfer as such will not 
involve any cuts in transfers to the provinces. What it does 
provide, whether there are cuts or not, is far more flexibility for 
the provinces in deciding how to meet the needs of their 
residents. I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition 
should complain that we are giving the provinces the flexibility 
they want.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Department of Finance and its minister seem to 
live on another planet, because if they were right about this 
explanation, it would mean that the demand for health care has 
dropped and that to adjust to a changing world, in other words, to 
a reduction in the need for health care and social services, the 
Department of Finance would, very sensibly, have reduced its 
contribution.
<P>
	That, however, is not the case and I wonder how the minister, 
who is unable to justify the reduction in the Canada social 
transfer, would be able to justify the new cuts totalling $1.6 
billion in the Unemployment Insurance Plan, cuts that will have 
a more severe impact on the regional economies of Quebec, 
which has more seasonal workers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, there 
will be no cuts in the Canada social transfer concept. The 
transfer is a concept that will give the federal government a 
chance to maintain its transfers and at the same time give the 
provinces more flexibility.
<P>
	I think the Prime Minister was very clear about this last week 
when he said, in referring to medicare, that it would put the 
federal government in a position where it could protect and also 
maintain cash transfers which, according to a timeframe 
established some years ago, will disappear if no action is taken 
immediately.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I know that political speeches and responses in the 
House may be somewhat complex and sometimes unnecessarily 
so, but this is a real masterpiece.
<P>
	How can the federal government tell us that Canada transfers 
will help the federal government protect medicare, for instance, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13804"> 13804 </A></B>
<P>
while in the same breath it says that it intends to make 
substantial cuts in the  government's contribution to medicare? I 
would appreciate an answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister was very clear last week, as was the minister of HRD, 
as I was, that the cash contributions of the federal government 
are steadily declining, according to a schedule that was 
established a long time ago.
<P>
	With this particular measure we have put the federal 
government in a position where it will be able to flat line those 
cash contributions over a period of time while maintaining the 
federal government's contribution to the very important social 
programs of the country.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a year 
ago, rumours were flying that the Canada assistance plan was 
headed for the chopping block. In the last budget, it was 
announced that the cash payments to the provinces for social 
programs would be cut by $7 billion within two years, which 
was the amount previously allocated to social assistance.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance confirm that the Canada social 
transfer's sole objective is to progressively reduce to zero the 
federal government's contribution to social assistance funding, 
while preserving its ability to continue setting national 
standards?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
premise is totally wrong. First of all, the provinces, including 
Quebec, started to cut well before the federal government tabled 
its budget.
<P>
	Second, for this year and next year, not only does the budget 
not prescribe any cuts but it actually increases federal transfers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin:</B> I must tell you that the hon. member's figures 
are wrong. I cannot answer a question based on an invalid 
premise.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
speechless. In case he forgot, the Minister of Finance announced 
$7 billion in cuts in his last budget. Today, he tells us that there 
are no cuts.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, he says there are increases.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Well, I am dumbfounded. Mr. Speaker, I will 
give the minister a second chance.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Since the funds allocated to the provinces for social 
assistance will dry up in two years because of the federal cuts 
announced in his budget, will the Minister of Finance frankly 
admit that it would have been impossible  for him to impose 
federal standards on the provinces had he not invented the 
Canada social transfer ruse?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member says 
he has a little difficulty understanding French, a little difficulty 
understanding Latin. My Latin is not too good either.
<P>
	Let me say it again in English. The Leader of the Opposition 
says his colleague has no difficulty understanding math. He now 
says I have got the wrong person.
<P>
	Since the government took office, transfers to the provinces 
have increased. Transfers to the provinces have not been cut for 
this year and in fact are going up.
<P>
	Ultimately there will be a cut but that is no excuse for 
provincial action. The fact is any province, including the 
province of Quebec, has as much money to work with today as it 
did when we took office. Let us be very clear about that.
<P>
	As far as social programs are concerned, a mechanism has 
been put in place that stops their continuous erosion all the way 
down to zero. There have been reductions but we have set in 
place a mechanism and any province that wants to sit down with 
us or the minister of HRD and is prepared to look at national 
values, that mechanism is in place.
<P>
	There is a pre-condition to all of that. That is the goodwill and 
the understanding that this is one country and that this country 
wants to build, not destroy.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MINISTEROFCANADIANHERITAGE">MINISTER OF CANADIAN HERITAGE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, another day and yet another troubling revelation about 
the heritage minister and his dollars for contracts dinner in 
Montreal.
<P>
	André Bureau, the former head of the CRTC and the current 
president of The Astral Broadcasting Group, has now revealed 
that he received an invitation to the minister's private money 
gathering event, as did his business partner, Harold Greenberg. 
Astral has direct business dealings with both the CRTC and with 
the heritage department. Mr. Bureau and Mr. Greenberg, 
however, could see a potential conflict of interest in the dinner 
and to their credit declined the invitation.
<P>
	If André Bureau, a former and respected public servant, aware 
of the federal code of ethics, could clearly see the potential for a 
conflict of interest in the minister's dinner, why is it that the 
minister, the Prime Minister and the government cannot see that 
conflict?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13805"> 13805 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I could ask the leader of the Reform Party in return 
why the hon. member cannot see that this is an open and 
transparent event because of the way the donations are reported 
according to the election law of Canada. Therefore what the 
hon. member is looking for is simply not there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians are wondering why the government 
pretends it cannot see the ethical issue which is involved here. 
Legitimate political fundraisers involving a minister do not 
target clients having business or regulatory dealings with the 
minister's department.
<P>
	The heritage minister was clearly in the wrong and the 
government is making matters worse by pretending that it does 
not see the wrong.
<P>
	By the ethical standards of the red book, is it right or is it 
wrong for ministers to participate in political fundraisers 
targeted to clients having business or regulatory dealings with 
their departments? Is it right or is it wrong?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not accept the premise of the hon. member's 
question.
<P>
	Ministers take part in fundraising activities just as the leader 
of that party takes part in fundraising activities. It is a normal 
part of the political process in this country to take part in 
fundraising activities.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister or House 
leader can present themselves to this House as the guardians of 
ethics in government unless they can tell right from wrong and 
unless they are willing to act on discernments of that kind. That 
is what ethics are all about.
<P>
	I ask the government House leader one more time, and I will 
say it slowly so it is clear. Is it right or wrong for ministers to 
participate in political fundraisers targeted to people having 
business or regulatory dealings with their departments? If it is 
wrong, will the heritage minister resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again I do not accept the premise of the hon. member's 
question. It is clear when it comes to this topic that it is not the 
hon. member's strong suit.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development. In its 
recently tabled report on Bill C-76, the Liberal majority on the 
finance committee states, and I quote: ``The Committee 
recognizes the obligation of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to develop, through mutual consent with the 
provinces, principles and objectives for the social assistance 
and post-secondary education components of the CHST''.
<P>
	What does the minister intend to do with the finance 
committee's recommendation, which insists on his obligation to 
develop national standards for education and social assistance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we set out very clearly in 
the budget what the process would be.
<P>
	We will be inviting the provinces to meet with us to discuss 
how we can arrive through mutual consent at a useful and 
effective set of principles that will help guide the country in a 
united, co-operative, integrated way to reach our social goals. It 
is really based upon good faith that there is a real willingness by 
all provinces and the federal government to come together and 
arrive at a way in which we can effectively combine our 
resources to target them to the groups of people who are in most 
serious need and at the same time make sure we can protect and 
maintain the fundamental principles underlying our system of 
health care and social assistance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
minister has yet to get together with his provincial counterparts, 
will he now pledge not to impose new principles or national 
standards if a province objects to them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think anybody 
should prejudge the process. As I read the recollections, I was 
very interested in the comments of the minister in Quebec who is 
responsible for employment matters, who talked about the need 
to come together to look at more active programming for 
employment and to try to find ways in which we can facilitate 
investment in individuals.
<P>
	This is the same thing we have been saying for a year and a 
half. It is nice to see that there is now a coming together of minds 
on this matter from the Government of Quebec and that it now 
shares the point of view that we need reform and reorganization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13806"> 13806 </A></B>
<P>
	I am sure that if we can organize the goodwill we will find 
effective ways to give Canadians a common, co-operative, 
united framework to approach some of our most important 
social concerns.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOMALIAINQUIRY">SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday it was revealed that Private David 
Brocklebank, who was acquitted of all charges in the death of 
Shidane Arone, was charged because of his conduct in the First 
Airborne video.
<P>
	Despite the minister's promises of openness, these new 
charges were kept secret from the public and even from the 
Somalia commission itself.
<P>
	How can the public have any confidence in the government's 
commitment to the Somalia inquiry when it insists on acting 
behind its back?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Private 
Brocklebank was informed, as was his counsel, on April 7 that 
two charges were to be laid under the National Defence Act for 
conduct unbecoming a member of the Canadian military.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	Those charges were held in abeyance pending a legal review 
of the case to see whether or not proceeding with that 
disciplinary action would prejudice the commission.
<P>
	The legal opinion was that proceeding with this would not 
prejudice the commission. As a result, the charge was allowed to 
go on in conformity with the normal practices of the National 
Defence Act and the nature of this particular offence, which in 
no way related directly to the criminal charges and others related 
to the death of Mr. Arone.
<P>
	Therefore, this particular matter was allowed to proceed and a 
summary hearing was heard. This was all in accordance with 
normal practices. It is not anyone's intention to go behind 
anyone's back. We did this in the normal way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I understand it, this was a weapons handling charge. 
If such charges are not included in the Somalia commission 
inquiry, they should be.
<P>
	The minister has frequently told this House, and yesterday 
said it to the face of a tearful wife and mother, that he cannot 
prejudice the inquiry. In my view, keeping the Brocklebank 
charges secret for two months prejudices the inquiry. Mark 
Boland's imprisonment prejudices the inquiry. Barry 
Armstrong's sudden deployment to Bosnia prejudices the 
inquiry.
<P>
	How can the minister defend the contradiction between his 
professed wish for openness and his department's policy to lock 
up, shut down, or ship off eyewitnesses to the events in Somalia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I reject 
categorically all of the accusations contained in the hon. 
member's question.
<P>
	It seems that the hon. member, for whom I have great respect 
as an individual, and the members of his party are more 
interested in putting partisan considerations before justice.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	During the year and a half that the federal government has 
been in power, the reforms it has proposed have had only one 
purpose: to increase its inefficient intervention in several of the 
provinces' jurisdictions. More than ever, flexible federalism 
means that Ottawa decrees and the provinces must 
accommodate.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that the Canada social transfer 
not only offers nothing new or of interest to Quebecers, but also, 
on the contrary, that it brings the federal government closer and 
closer to its dream of creating a highly centralized Canada, 
which is unacceptable to Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
has contradicted himself in his own question. What we are in the 
process of doing with the Canada social transfer is, first of all, 
keeping the fiscal burden under control, which will enable the 
federal government to continue transferring money for social 
programs to the provinces.
<P>
	Second, what we are trying to do is give the provinces the 
flexibility they need to adapt their own programs to the needs of 
the people. I must say that I find it utterly absurd that a Bloc 
Quebecois member is actually criticizing the federal 
government for having given more power and flexibility to the 
provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the real contradiction lies in the fact that it is 
irresponsible to impose national standards without pledging the 
corresponding funds.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Will the minister not admit that everything that 
his government has done since it was elected, the single window 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13807"> 13807 </A></B>
<P>
concept, the rationalization of employment centres and the 
creation of the human resources investment fund, goes totally 
and utterly  against the consensus in Quebec, which is that 
Quebec must gain full power over labour?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> On the contrary, Mr. Speaker. 
Everything we have done, everything we have said, whether it 
was regarding single window service, the fund for entrepreneurs 
or community initiatives, has addressed the requests and wishes 
of local communities.
<P>
	Not only are we in the process of decentralizing, but we are 
doing it because that is what the regions have requested.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us be very clear what the member said in the preamble to 
his statement. He said that he, on behalf of his party, was against 
national standards in the CHST. The most important national 
standards in the CHST are the principles of the Canada Health 
Act. This government stands behind the Canada Health Act and 
so do the people of Quebec. He had better learn that.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this highway 104 controversy is not going to go away, much to 
the dismay of the minister of public works. As I stand here, a 
lawsuit is being initiated by the Citizens for Fairness in the 
Wentworth Valley of Nova Scotia naming the minister of public 
works as a defendant. This moves us not only into morally and 
ethically wrong behaviour but also illegal actions.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister refuses to call in the ethics 
counsellor, why will this government not cut its losses on this 
mess now and commit to returning the misappropriated funds 
back to the Wentworth Valley bypass project on highway 104?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question of allocation of funds to highway 
construction, as the hon. member should know by now, is a 
provincial responsibility.
<P>
	In the event that the Government of Nova Scotia or any other 
government in the country wishes to discuss the reallocation of 
funds, we will be prepared to do that, as we have done on dozens 
of occasions as a federal government over the past 10 years.
<P>
	The case in question the hon. member refers to is a situation 
that arose when the Government of Nova Scotia decided to 
reallocate funds within the existing agreement. Section 12 of 
that agreement allows for the reallocation of funds by 
consensus.
<P>
	If the Government of Nova Scotia wishes to reallocate funds 
to this or any other highway, as is the case with any other 
province where a similar agreement exists, we will look at it, 
because that is what the hon. member often refers to as being 
flexible federalism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister's ethics counsellor gets about as much work 
as the Maytag repairman. The only difference is the Liberal 
machine is in desperate need of repair.
<P>
	I wonder if corruption is a federal or a provincial 
responsibility.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Transport is also going to be named as a 
defendant, I will place the question to him. Will he recommend 
to the Prime Minister that he tell the public works minister to 
return the money he diverted to buy votes in his riding or at least 
step down pending the results-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would urge you not to impugn 
motives of any kind in your questions.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member perhaps if he could rephrase that 
question, but just the question with no preamble.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not mean 
to suggest the minister of public works would buy votes.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister be willing to look at the situation 
and ask the minister of public works to step down pending the 
investigation of the auditor general's report, pending litigation, 
pending the complaints from the Reform Party, pending 
Liberal-

predicted that the 1996 slowdown would be even worse than this 
year's. Most economists are talking about a possible recession 
in Canada for 1997.

should look for hope.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional

found in the infrastructure program the government has set up. 
Hope may be found in the job creation programs of the Minister 
of Human Resources Development. Hope may be found in the 
programs of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and of the 
Minister of Agriculture. Hope may be found in the high tech 
policies of the Minister of Industry. Hope may be found in the 
policy of this government, which reversed the policies of the 
previous government in order to give Canada a real future.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	When he appeared before the transport committee, the 
minister refused to guarantee the survival of CN's subsidiary, 
AMF, which employs over 1,300 workers in 
Pointe-Saint-Charles, one of the poorest areas in Canada. The 
minister even said that AMF's situation was precarious.
<P>
	Given the economic situation which currently prevails in 
Montreal, and particularly in Pointe-Saint-Charles, will the 
minister tell us why he refuses to guarantee that AMF will 
survive and that its 1,300 employees will not lose their jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that AMF's situation is precarious. I 
hope that the hon. member will realize that other regions in the 
country have experienced the same situation. As a New 
Brunswick native, I can tell you that we had the same problem in 
Moncton, when CN decided to pull out of there, a decision which 
affected over 1,000 employees.
<P>
	AMF's best chance of survival is to find a solution to CN's 
current problem in its negotiations with an international 
company interested in moving there. A solution must not only be 
found to the impasse related to the acquisition costs, but also to 
the productivity of that plant.
<P>
	We all recognize the problem which exists at AMF, and I hope 
that CN and the eventual buyer will find a solution to the 
difficulties which, so far, have been a major obstacle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the Minister of Finance, who is 
responsible for regional development in Quebec, agree that 
saving 1,300 jobs in Pointe-Saint-Charles should be at least as 
important for the federal government as buying capital assets to 
make CN more interesting for its future buyers? Beyond the 
minister's rhetoric, where is the hope for these 1,300 workers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the possibility of commercializing CN is a very serious 
issue. So is, of course, the future of AMF, both for its workers 
and for greater Montreal. We are all aware of that, and every 
effort is being made to try to find a solution.
<P>
	We will continue to co-operate with CN, in the hope of 
finding a way to reach an agreement which would ensure the sale 
and survival of AMF, which is a very important industry for the 
Montreal region.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week it was revealed the government is prepared to 
allow Hughes Aircraft to delete three main features of its 
contract to provide a new automated air traffic control system 
and stick Transport Canada with the cost of training and 
installation which was included in the original contract and 
lease us the equipment we were supposed to own.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Also, the completion date has been pushed back two years. To 
add insult to injury Hughes wants more money, and the 
government is actually considering giving it.
<P>
	Will the minister please tell the House why Hughes was not 
told to live up to its original contract or have it cancelled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member of the Reform Party who is critic in 
matters of transport obviously lives an exciting life. On one 
hand for months in the House he has talked about the 
cancellation of the Pearson contract as an example of what 
governments should not do. Now in the case of the Hughes 
contract he wants it cancelled.
<P>
	We have to do the best we can in any commercial undertaking 
to arrive at a solution in the best interests of the Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	I have said that with respect to the Hughes contract and all of 
the CAATS arrangements so far the government is extremely 
concerned about them. We are concerned about cost overruns, 
about glitches. We are attempting to find a solution in the best 
interests of both air safety and the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	The hon. member will have to decide whether he wants to 
cancel contracts, support contracts or try to negotiate out of a 
specific contract. In the case of Hughes I wish the hon. member 
would decide which way he wants to go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	No value has been placed on the deleted items. No value has 
been placed on transport's new obligations and no figure has 
been given on how much transport is asking the Treasury Board 
for.
<P>
	Knowledgeable air traffic controllers are now questioning the 
value of the diminished system. Will the minister agree to hold 
off on any amendments to the contract and have the Standing 
Committee on Transport review the whole issue and make a 
recommendation to the minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if there were a knowledgeable air controller on that 
committee I might consider it.
<P>
	Because we have to deal with this issue in a fairly short order 
we will proceed as best we can to deal with finding a solution to 
this problem. We will make sure whatever deal is arrived at is 
absolutely transparent.
<P>
	As this matter came to my attention I immediately advised the 
auditor general of our concerns with respect to it. We will try to 
resolve a very serious problem.
<P>
	The hon. member should recognize that our intention to 
commercialize the air navigation system, which I hope he will 
support, should avoid any problems like this occurring in the

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In spite of laws regarding safe storage of guns in Canada there 
are a lot of guns sitting behind kitchen doors. In order to flush a 
lot of those weapons out of the system and therefore reduce the 
need for compliance with the law, would the Minister of Justice 
in dialogue with the Minister of Finance consider an incentive, 
perhaps a small tax credit, for each gun turned into police as a 
way of making our communities safer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure 
to dialogue with the Minister of Finance, particularly in light of 
the suggestion for tax credit to rely on the legendary generosity 
of the Department of Finance.
<P>
	The point the hon. member raises is important with respect to 
the safe storage of firearms. Registration aspects contained in 
Bill C-68 passed in the House last night are intended among 
other things to encourage compliance by owners with those very 
safe storage obligations.
<P>
	With respect to firearms no longer wanted or where an owner 
wants to dispose of them, Bill C-68 provides that even in the 
case of prohibited firearms those who own those firearms can 
sell them to others in the same class. That was a change 
introduced on the recommendation of members of the Liberal 
caucus. Furthermore, firearms that are unwanted can always be 
surrendered at an amnesty or delivered to museums for a credit.
<P>
	The suggestion made by the hon. member is an innovative 
one. I will be happy to take it up with the Minister of Finance and 
pursue it.

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	Last year, the Minister of Agriculture declared a moratorium 
on the use of bovine somatotropin, or BST, to allow the dairy 
industry to adjust and to give the public the information it needs. 
Although these two requirements have still not been met, the 
minister indicated in this House yesterday that he had no 
intention of extending his moratorium.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that the public still does not have 
the information it needs on BST and that the dairy industry is in 
no position to meet consumers' demands for a way to 
distinguish dairy products with BST from those without?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while not necessarily accepting 
all the suggestions made in the hon. member's question, I would 
point out to him that a tremendous amount of information has 
been made available. There is obviously a difference of opinion 
with respect to this product.
<P>
	Might I say that in all the very legitimate questioning about 
rBST we should be careful not to feed unfounded doubts and 
fears. We do not yet have the scientific analysis that is presently 
being conducted by the Department of Health. I think we should 
wait for it and we should get all the facts on the table.
<P>
	In the meantime we should not engage in comments or 
allegations that question the safety of Canadian milk. To do so 
would be to harm the Canadian diary industry, including that 
very significant portion of the industry in the province of 
Quebec.

outrageous numerical targets. If the minister will not listen to 
Canadians, will he at least listen to his Liberal friends and scrap 
his own version of a quota bill, Bill C-64?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

<P>
	Last week I met in St. John's with executive officers of the 
Newfoundland Dockyard Trades and Labour Council as well as 
Mike Apostilidis, president of the dockyard.
<P>
	In view of the uncertainty about the future of the dockyard 
which employed 850 people last year, will the minister agree to a 
full independent review of the books of Marine Atlantic? Will he 
finally meet with the dockyard workers and not pass this off to 
his colleague, the Minister of Transport from New Brunswick? 
Will the minister finally stand up for the dockyard workers just 
as much as he stood up for the turbot in Newfoundland?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

the country, from the great province of British Columbia, finally 
had an opportunity to visit Newfoundland. It is regrettable that it 
took a large convention and a sought after position to bring him 
to this part of the land, but we welcome him to the island.
<P>
	I met with the dockyard workers and with the management 
this week in a meeting arranged by my colleague, the Minister of 
Transport. We had a very frank and open discussion about the 
future of the dockyard. There is currently an ongoing 
negotiation between an interested party and the dockyard 
management on a possible purchase of the dockyard. We will 
have an answer on the negotiation within a matter of days. 
Following that negotiation we will see whether or not it is 
successful. Other discussions are under way with the workers.

consideration, and will not be solved by unduly raising 
expectations or setting out simplistic solutions. I know my

Digby county in the federal riding of South West Nova.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament not amend 
the human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the

indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality, including amending the human rights code to 
include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the 
undefined phrase sexual orientation.

	The first petition is from 60 Canadians, some of whom reside 
in the riding of Ottawa-Vanier. The petitioners call on

the second petition which I would like to present is from 37 
constituents of Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	They call on Parliament to amend the Divorce Act to include a 
provision similar to article 611 of the Quebec civil code, which 
states that in no case may a father or mother, without serious

Speaker, I have the honour to present petitions signed by 
residents of my constituency of Burnaby-Kingsway as well as 
residents elsewhere in British Columbia and in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House the fact that 
the current Criminal Code denies people who are suffering from 
terminal or irreversible and debilitating illness the right to 
choose freely and voluntarily to end their lives with the 
assistance of a physician.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to amend the 
Criminal Code to ensure the right of all Canadians to die with 
dignity by allowing people with terminal or irreversible and 
debilitating illness the right to the assistance of a physician in 
ending their lives at the time of their choice, subject to strict 
safeguards to prevent abuse and to ensure that the decision is 
free, informed, competent and voluntary.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a petition from Canadians who point out that acts of 
discrimination against lesbian, gay and bisexual Canadians are 
an every day reality in all regions of Canada, that this kind of 
discrimination is unacceptable in a country known for its 
commitment to human rights, equality and dignity for all 
citizens and that the citizens who are so discriminated against 
pay taxes and make contributions to employee benefit plans and 
are entitled to the same rights and responsibilities as other 
citizens.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners call on Parliament to act quickly to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and to adopt all 
necessary measures to recognize the full equality of same sex 
relationships in federal law.

<P>
	The petition states that we the undersigned residents of the

orientation is a real and hurtful form of discrimination in this 
country; that all forms of families in this country, those based 
on financial and emotional interdependency, are equally 
meaningful and important to the social well-being of Canada; 
and that both protection against discrimination and recognition 
of relationships based on financial and emotional 
interdependency are necessary to ensure the equal treatment of 
gays, lesbians and bisexuals under the law.
<P>
	Therefore your petitioners request that the Parliament of 
Canada amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to include 
sexual orientation as a basis for protection against 
discrimination and to include recognition of relationships based 
on financial and emotional interdependency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to present a petition from constituents from Fraser

Question No. 174-Mr. Robinson:<B></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Does the government plan to participate with NORAD or NATO allies in joint 
research initiatives examining ballistic missile defence as proposed in the 1994 
defence white paper and, if so, (a) what previous Canadian defence research, 
will the government propose to use as a basis for such joint research (b) will the 
Canadian government use previous research into an EHF space-based radar 
system as a basis for further joint research, and (c) what kind of new research 
will the government propose to initiate as a part of such joint research efforts?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
(a), (b) and (c) As outlined in the 1994 defence white paper, 
Canada is interested in gaining a better understanding of missile 
defence through research and consultation with like-minded 
nations. We expect that these consultations will address both 
limited missile defence for North America and theatre missile 
defence within Europe. Whether Canada will choose to 
participate in joint research initiatives will depend on what 
opportunities arise, and most significantly, whether these joint 
initiatives are cost effective, affordable, and make an 
unambiguous contribution to Canada's defence needs.
<P>
	In the NORAD context, the NORAD renewal negotiations are 
set to begin this year. Joint reseach with the U.S. in ballistic 
missile defence will be discussed during the negotiations, 
however, the outcome of these discussions cannot be prejudged. 
Accordingly, it would be premature to speculate on the specific 
form and content of possible joint research activities in the 
absence of any agreement that such research should in fact take 
place.
<P>
Question No. 178-<B>Mr. McClelland:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the October 24, 1994 signing of a treaty between the 
Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of India on mutual 
assistance in criminal matters, (<I>a</I>) when the treaty was signed, was the 
government aware that India has in place a law known as TADA (Terrorist and 
Disruptive Activities Act) and (<I>b</I>) can Canadians of Indian origin be threatened 
or prosecuted by Indian law as a result of TADA legislation?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
(a) The preamble of the treaty between Canada and India on 
mutual assistance in criminal matters makes specific reference 
to Canada and India desiring to improve the effectiveness of 
both countries in the investigation, prosecution and suppression 
of crime, including terrorism related crime.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is unable to comment on the full scope 
of India's Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act 
(TADA) and on the extent of its extraterritorial reach, if any.
<P>
	(b) The mutual assistance treaty does not make India's TADA 
legislation part of Canadian law. The treaty generally provides 
for assistance relating to the gathering of evidence for the 
purpose of a criminal investigation or prosecution pending in 
the state requesting assistance. The assistance contemplated 
under this treaty does not include the arrest of persons for the 
purpose of their return to the requesting state through 
deportation or extradition.
<P>
	Requests for assistance made to Canada under the mutual 
assistance treaty are executed in accordance with canadian law 
once their execution has been authorized by the Minister of 
Justice. For this purpose the requests must contain information 
prescribed by the treaty. This includes the relevant law of the 
state requesting assistance.
<P>
	There is no requirement under the treaty that an offence under 
investigation or prosecution in India also exist in Canada 
(referred to as double criminality requirement). This is common 
in mutual assistance treaties.
<P>
	Canada may refuse or delay assistance based on grounds set 
out in the treaty. The treaty provides that assistance may be 
refused where executing the request would impair Canada's 
sovereignty, security, or public order and that assistance may be 
postponed where executing the request would interfere with 
ongoing investigations or prosecutions. These grounds are 
intended to protect the fundamental interests of Canada, where 
Canada is the requested state. They can be relied on in 
appropriate cases based on a consideration of the circumstances 
of each case in view of the treaty and the relevant law and could 
apply to

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 13 consideration of Bill C-41, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other acts in 
consequence thereof, as reported (with amendment) from the 
committee; and on Motions No. 5 to 17 inclusive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me a great deal of pleasure to speak on this section of Bill C-41.
<P>
	Coming to this House has been really quite instructive. One 
can learn from many members. I have learned from the member 
for Burnaby-Kingsway that it does one good to express exactly 
where one is coming from in terms of one's own personal 
perspective.
<P>
	In keeping with that, before I speak specifically to section 
718.2, I might state to the House very clearly where I am coming 
from. I stand clearly, unequivocally and in a very 
straightforward way in favour of and in full support of the 
traditional family unit as generally understood within society.
<P>
	To that end, it might be of interest to the House for me to very 
briefly read something that is in the public domain that I wrote 
to an editor at the Calgary <I>Sun</I> last March. The editor had stated: 
``Decision targets family values'' and ``marriage and family, as 
we all know, are not only cornerstones of our society, but are the 
bedrock of our civilization''.
<P>
	I wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I tend to agree with him.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The preferential treatment given to mom, dad and the kids, I believe is 
reflective of the value that our society places on the biological reality of 
propagation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are many instances of cohabitation in our society: The single parent and 
child, siblings living together or good, long time friends of the same or opposite 
sex. They may choose not to become involved in physical sexual contact. To 
extend spousal benefits to homosexual partnerships and not to other couples 
would be a grave act of discrimination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A redefinition of family unit that would step outside of the obvious biological 
relationships to include same sex or opposite sex couples must include all 
relationships. It must not have reference to sexual orientation or activity. 
Otherwise, we would be extending a financial reward for sexual involvement 
between people who cohabit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Max Yalden, Canadian Human Rights Commissioner, has stated the Human 
Rights Act should be amended ``to reflect today's reality'' by prohibiting 
discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals on the basis of sexual 
orientation. He is wrong. If we extend spousal benefits to people who cohabit on 
the basis of sexual orientation and not to all couples, we have truly engaged in an 
act of discrimination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fooling around and ignoring the obvious reasons for spousal benefits will 
cost our society much more than countless millions or billions of dollars. It has 
the potential of costing society its cornerstone and the bedrock of our 
civilization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I give that as a background because it is true that all of us 
arrive at this House with predisposed attitudes and values that 
come from our very soul. I want to make it clear what my 
motivation is in taking a look, hopefully, at the deletion of 
section 718.2 from this bill.
<P>
	In reading the notes that were given to the Liberal members I 
was interested to see that they say: ``We will keep our campaign 
commitments and send a strong message against hate crimes. As 
an election promise and a matter of fundamental human rights, 
Bill C-41 will not be subject to a free vote''.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	The heavy hand of the whip is coming down on all of the 
Liberal members in this House, and we have seen the 
devastation that will do to their political careers as long as they 
toil within the Liberal Party. However, that does not change the 
fact that there are many people within the Liberal Party who 
have a serious concern about this issue, I suggest perhaps 
because of the same reasons that I have stated from my own 
personal background and belief.
<P>
	It is also interesting that this document given to the Liberal 
members includes what I consider to be some terribly erroneous 
advice. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is essential to list the grounds in Bill C-41. The hate crime section is 
meaningless without the list. In several court rulings, the Supreme Court of 
Canada has warned that any hate-related legislation must be very precise and must </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13817"> 13817 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>identify target groups it intends to protect, otherwise it may be subject to 
constitutional challenge.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think it passing strange that in exactly the same legislation 
the government is bringing forward a total patchwork in terms of 
alternative measures. In other words, it is saying in one section 
of the act we will not have any national standards and in the 
other section of the act saying that we must have precise 
standards. The question must be asked: Which is it?
<P>
	Last evening I was very interested to listen in the debate to the 
hon. member from York South-Weston, who is a lawyer. I 
respect the fact that he would be able to read this bill as it is 
presently before the House and I concur totally with his 
perspective. In part, from <I>Hansard</I>, page 13767, he says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What are those alternative measures? We do not in this legislation describe 
what those alternative measures are, what crimes will be subject to those 
alternative measures. In fact it says any crime. We do not know. Does that mean 
that a rapist, someone who is alleged to have committed a rape, can for example be 
diverted out of the criminal justice system and into some alternative measures? 
What can those alternative measures be? We do not know. This bill does not 
define what alternative measures are. The bill leaves it up to the attorneys general 
of the provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	For sake of time, I will not read further, but he went on to 
say-again, I concur with him totally-that what we have here is 
a total patchwork.
<P>
	I ask the Liberals, I ask the justice department, I ask the 
parliamentary secretary: How can we have within Bill C-41 on 
one side of the coin an absolute patchwork and on the other side 
of the coin something that has to be very specific and very 
precise? The two things in the same bill do not make any sense.
<P>
	I suggest to the Liberal members that in fact the advice they 
have received in their documentation, in their talking notes 
when they stand to talk on this act, is simply not good advice.
<P>
	I suggest very strongly that section 718.2 is unnecessary. In 
the judgment of many Canadians, it is put in specifically so that 
the undefined term sexual orientation may be put into federal 
legislation. This is the first step of putting that undefined term 
into federal legislation. It is not an innocuous thing. It is not an 
inconsequential thing. It actually is the first step in a logical 
legal sequence for that undefined term to be included in the 
charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Again, I read from the Liberals' documentation. They tell 
their members:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We've heard a lot lately about the myths of ``special rights''. C-41 does not 
confer special rights. No one is ``left out''. C-41 protects all Canadians. Every 
Canadian has a nationality, a race, an age, a gender, a sexual orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We've heard that C-41 will result in sweeping changes, including the 
recognition of same-sex marriages. That is nonsense.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, in the strictest sense of the term, that is 
nonsense. Bill C-41 will not achieve that objective on its own. I 
submit that the reason Canadians are concerned about Bill C-41 
is because they see this very clearly as a very transparent, thin 
edge of a wedge that is an important stepping stone in order to 
get the undefined term sexual orientation included.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals know this. The justice department has received 
over 70,000 letters opposing this bill. Furthermore, until 
yesterday there had been 7,250 names in favour of the inclusion 
of sexual orientation in petitions presented to this House. That is 
7,250 for, and 83,471 against. These are people in Canada who 
take the time to put their names on petitions, to gather these 
petitions together. Yet this government is prepared to absolutely 
turn its back on these representations from ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Based on misrepresentation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> It is interesting that a member opposite has said 
based on misrepresentation. May I suggest to that member that 
exactly the same statistics were used to theoretically justify the 
imposition of Bill C-68, the gun control, which was based on 
lack of information. Those polls are being quoted and were 
being quoted as justification by the justice minister.
<P>
	Here we have 83,000 people taking the time to sign petitions 
and send them to this House, and they say those polls do not 
count, they are not based on good information.
<P>
	There are none so blind as those who will not see. But for 
those who have eyes, I implore them to vote for the exclusion of 
section 718.2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege and honour to rise in the House to speak to Bill C-41.
<P>
	There has been a great deal of confusion and misinformation 
being disseminated about this bill. Unfortunately, a lot of the 
verbal shadow boxing around Bill C-41 has almost entirely 
focused on one phrase in one clause in the overall bill. The term 
sexual orientation seems to have piqued the interest of many 
narrow minded individuals whose sense of reason has been 
drowned out by the self-righteous pontificating about the so 
called provision of special rights to designated groups and 
individuals.
<P>
	Last week an impatient man approached me in my 
constituency office. He asked me whether I was going to vote 
yes or no for that ``same sex benefits bill and special rights for 
gays''. I proceeded to try to explain to the gentleman that he had 
it all wrong, that the legislation was not about same sex spousal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13818"> 13818 </A></B>
<P>
benefits or special rights for gays and that it had more to do with 
protecting individuals from hate motivated violence. The man 
stormed out of my office before I could get a further word in 
edgewise. That is exactly the kind of intolerance  and confusion 
that underlines most of the opposition-especially from the 
third party in this House-to provisions in Bill C-41.
<P>
	For the edification of the man who stormed out of my office 
last week and for many others like him, many to be found in the 
third party opposite, who may have forgotten or perhaps never 
took the time to find out what Bill C-41 was actually all about in 
the first place, I want to highlight for them the main objectives 
of this legislation along with some of the compelling yet often 
misunderstood and ignored portions of this bill.
<P>
	Some of the most significant provisions of Bill C-41 are those 
related to enhancing the rights of the victim. This bill includes 
an unprecedented amendment to section 745 of the Criminal 
Code that would provide victims of violence with the 
opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the criminal justice 
system by presenting victim impact statements when convicted 
criminals apply for early parole consideration. This would 
ensure that victims of violent crimes have the opportunity to 
speak out about the harm done by the offender.
<P>
	Quite frankly for me, and I know for another member at least 
in this House, maybe that is not enough. To my way of thinking, 
section 745 should be rescinded. But that is what is in the bill 
today, and it has gone a lot further than what members opposite, 
especially in the third party, are proposing. Therefore, the 
victim's experience will now be taken into account at the very 
least when deciding whether the parole ineligibility period of an 
offender should be reduced.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The bill also encourages tougher sentences for the abuses by 
offenders in positions of trust or authority. It encourages 
alternatives to fines for those unable to pay them and provides 
for stricter penalties for offenders who breach probation and 
provides cost effective alternatives to those expensive and often 
unnecessary formal court proceedings. Furthermore, the bill 
will allow judges greater leeway to impose certain conditions on 
an offender to ensure that the punishment fits the crime.
<P>
	This bill follows through on the government's commitment to 
Canadians who have so passionately expressed the need for 
meaningful and progressive criminal justice reform. It should be 
noted that Bill C-41 adds a statement to the Criminal Code that 
provides clear direction from Parliament on the purpose and 
principles of sentencing.
<P>
	The reforms provide a balanced and sensible range of options 
that address the public's need for safety, the victim's desire for 
restitution, and the important principle that serious offenders 
should be dealt with more severely than minor or first time 
offenders.
<P>
	This legislation clearly indicates that the purpose of 
sentencing is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, 
peaceful, and safe society and to promote respect for the law by 
imposing just sanctions.
<P>
	The statement sets out objectives for sentencing, which 
include protection of the public, rehabilitation, promoting a 
sense of responsibility among offenders, making reparations to 
victims and the community, and deterring crime. These 
objectives are guided by the idea that a sentence must reflect the 
seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the 
offender. In this regard, the courts will be required to consider 
aggravating and mitigating circumstances associated with a 
particular crime.
<P>
	Accordingly, the proposed statement of principles indicates 
that when an offence is motivated by hate based on the race, 
nationality, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical 
disability or sexual orientation of the victim, this must be 
considered as an aggravating circumstance. On this point, 
people have asked why hate motivated crimes warrant harsher 
sentences than non-hate motivated crimes, suggesting that such 
provisions and the use of the term sexual orientation would 
grant special rights and magical privileges to 
non-heterosexuals. Some people have even gone so far as to 
suggest that use of the term sexual orientation would encourage 
a homosexualist agenda, if you can believe it. Quite frankly, this 
is surely and simply ludicrous.
<P>
	As stated by my colleague, the Minister of Justice, we are 
talking about the criminal law here. We are talking about crimes 
motivated by hate. To say that including sexual orientation in 
Bill C-41 is encouraging a lifestyle is like saying that because 
we have included religion we are encouraging people to become 
Catholics.
<P>
	Hate crimes are distinct in that they are not only an attack on a 
single individual, they are also an attack on an entire group in 
our society. For example, if someone paints graffiti on 
someone's house, that person would probably be charged with 
mischief and the house owner would likely be the only victim. 
But if someone were to paint swastikas on one of the five 
synagogues in my riding of Hamilton West, the victims would 
include all members of the Jewish faith. Try to understand that, 
members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Yes, tell us about the bar association. Come on.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would ask 
colleagues for the co-operation of the House on this subject 
matter, which has certain sensitivities. I certainly want to be 
able to hear the interventions of all members.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13819"> 13819 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, targeting members of a single group 
and attacking them simply because they belong to that 
particular group is loathsome, deplorable, and must be taken 
into consideration at sentencing.
<P>
	With regard to the notion of special rights, perhaps someone 
can explain to me how protecting Canadians who are victimized 
by hatred and harassment constitutes special rights. Perhaps 
someone can explain to me how seriously punishing a neo-Nazi 
for splitting a person's head open with a baseball bat just 
because they are gay constitutes special rights.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Maybe someone can tell me how a humane government can 
simply ignore the plight of the innocent law-abiding Canadians 
who are sadly victimized by violent attacks just because of their 
skin colour, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation or mental 
or physical ability.
<P>
	I wonder if someone can show me how reneging on our 
commitment to the overwhelming majority of Canadian voters, 
who elected me and my colleagues on this side of the House on a 
solid platform advocating equality for all Canadians and 
cracking down on crimes motivated by hatred, would advance 
the principles of Canadian democracy.
<P>
	When we told Canadians that the sentencing practices in 
Canada must be responsive to their concerns and social values, 
we meant it. When we said heinous crimes motivated by pure 
hatred would not be condoned by a Liberal government, we 
meant it. When we said that we would protect the rights of all 
Canadians and strengthen justice in our nation by coming down 
hard on those who chose to victimize Canadian communities, we 
meant it.
<P>
	As a member who was elected on a platform that emphasized 
the need for criminal justice reform, I am proud to stand on this 
side of the House with the right hon. Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Justice and all my colleagues in support of this 
legislation and the Liberal notion of a humane and anti-violent 
society.
<P>
	In closing, I move:

<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I sat here until 11.30 last night. I just sat and listened to 
all of the debate. I laid my speech aside.
<P>
	We often refer to this place as the highest court in the land. We 
should all be setting aside our ideology and our politics. We 
should be examining every bill to see whether it is good 
legislation. We are making the laws of the land in this place. As I 
sat and listened to the debate last night, I attempted to do it with 
an unbiased mind which is difficult to do but that is what should 
be happening in this place.
<P>
	I am not an expert on all of the things that are going on here, it 
is impossible. I have been working a lot on Bill C-68. However, 
I listened to the various experts, people who analysed Bill C-41. 
Many of them come from the other side of the House and I 
listened to what they had to say. There is a variety of people in 
this place and there are some very serious concerns with this bill 
which have not been addressed.
<P>
	Having listened to the debate and the arguments, I have come 
to some conclusions which I am going to share with the House. 
We really need to have democratic reform in this place. I have 
come to that conclusion in the last few weeks as I see the 
processes which are taking place. That is something which is 
desperately needed.
<P>
	We stand and debate these laws. We look at them. Recently 
there has been the attitude to just get through with the debate; 
summer is coming so let us get this stuff through the House. 
Millions of Canadians out there will have to live with these laws 
forever more. We should not have the attitude of simply getting 
this done, having an arrogant, almost cavalier attitude about 
what is taking place here and just getting it out.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	The negative impacts about this legislation were related 
yesterday. Canadians have expressed many concerns to us. Even 
people in the legal profession who have analysed this bill, 
lawyers at the top of the justice system, have seen the flaws and 
we continue to push this bill through. That causes me grave 
concern.
<P>
	As I listened to the debate last night I saw some of the 
members opposite trying to portray themselves as being more 
compassionate than some of the other people in this House. 
They were trying to show that they were more tolerant.
<P>
	In the end we have to look at the nitty-gritty, the facts, the 
very reasonable things people are saying about this legislation. 
We must not let ideology or politics blind us. Common sense 
must not be thrown out the window. We cannot play on people's 
emotions.
<P>
	When the dust settles we are going to have to live with the 
facts. We are going to have to live with the content of Bill C-41. 
We are trying to explain our intentions in this bill, but good 
intentions do not necessarily make good legislation. That is why 
we are here discussing this and debating it and doing all the 
things we are doing. We have to listen to each other.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13820"> 13820 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a question for the last speaker. I was listening to the 
debate his colleagues presented yesterday. The hon. member 
said that we are protecting the rights of all Canadians. If we 
are protecting the rights of all Canadians, why do we need a 
list of categories? Why do we need to even include this? It does 
not make sense to me. Do not all victims deserve equal 
protection? Why do we have to have categories of victims? If 
someone is assaulted by someone who is doing it just for fun, 
that is no different from doing it for some other motive.
<P>
	I am going to speak on behalf of my constituents this 
afternoon on some of the things they have told me. I have 
received hundreds and hundreds of letters over the last year and 
a half on the issue of including the term sexual orientation and 
many other concerns. That is not the only concern they have 
with this bill but it is one that keeps coming up again and again. 
We need to listen. I have the honour and the privilege to speak on 
their behalf as I believe all members in this House should have.
<P>
	To limit this debate to six hours is a travesty of justice and of 
democracy. I hope it is not an example of an arrogant dictatorial 
Liberal government, but I am afraid that is the way it is coming 
across.
<P>
	I said I have the privilege of representing my constituents in 
this debate on Bill C-41. Many members of Parliament will be 
denied that so I consider it to be a privilege.
<P>
	Voters have sent me to Ottawa to be their voice in Parliament. 
What we do is very important. We must not take 
anti-democratic measures as has been done. We would all be 
willing to go well into the summer to listen and analyse all of the 
aspects of this Bill C-41 debate. It makes me very sad. It should 
make every Liberal member who did not oppose this abuse of 
power sad as well.
<P>
	The Liberals have the majority. They can use that majority to 
do almost anything they want to and voters can do nothing to 
stop them, until the next election. By forcing time allocation the 
Liberal government has declared its highest priorities to be gun 
control, MPs pensions and including the term sexual orientation 
in the sentencing legislation.
<P>
	Personally I do not believe these controversial issues are 
priorities with the people of Canada. I am sure that if people 
knew how democracy was getting a kick in the teeth here in 
Ottawa today, a lot more concern would be expressed. Most 
people are not following all the debate here. I wonder if Liberals 
are hoping that voters will forget this by the time the next 
election rolls around.
<P>
	There are some provisions of this bill for which I give my 
conditional support. I heard the reasons behind them and they 
are good. I support them particularly with respect to the 
restitution orders and victim impact statements. There are some 
excellent aspects to the bill.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, we have a long way to go before the victims of 
crime are treated with as much respect as the criminals. To this 
end I will continue to work on my victims bill of rights which I 
spoke about previously.
<P>
	I support the Reform amendments to delete section 717 
regarding alternative measures and to delete section 745.6 
regarding the application for judicial review for premeditated 
murders.
<P>
	The most controversial idea we are talking about is section 
718.2(a)(i) and the reason the Liberal government has waited so 
long to get the bill before the House and why it had to invoke 
closure in order to get the bill through the House of Commons. 
This provision will call for greater penalties to be imposed if 
there is evidence the crime was motivated by bias, prejudice or 
hate.
<P>
	We complained a lot about the term hate, but what about bias 
and prejudice? These things can be construed in many different 
ways. We do not know five or ten years down the road what will 
happen with bias, prejudice or hate based on the race, 
nationality, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical 
disability, or sexual orientation of the victim.
<P>
	My first choice would be to support the Reform amendment to 
delete the section entirely. Reformers believe that the courts 
already take aggravating or mitigating circumstances into 
consideration when determining the length of the sentence to be 
imposed on a convicted offender. I agree with my colleagues 
that this is an attempt by the Minister of Justice to get the 
unnecessary and undefined term sexual orientation into a piece 
of legislation so it can be used as justification for amending the 
Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	Reformers believe in true equality and that all Canadians are 
equal before the law. Every time the government divides us into 
different categories it creates the politics of envy, which divide 
us rather than unite us. We should not have all of these groups 
mentioned in our legislation.
<P>
	Back on March 24 the <I>Globe and Mail</I> editorial writers made 
the statement: ``The real problem with section 718.2 is not that it 
refers to homosexuals but that it is proposed at all''. They go on 
to give many other valid points.
<P>
	Because of the time allocation I will not have a chance to 
finish my remarks.
<P>
	We need to take a serious second look at this matter. The 
Liberals are opening a door with this legislation which should 
remain shut. We should take more time to look at this because 
the concerns which Canadians have expressed to me are real and 
legitimate ones which need to be addressed. I wish I had more 
time to do that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-41 covers a wide range of sentencing 
initiatives, including provisions aimed at assisting victims of 
crime, improving the administration  of justice in Canada and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13821"> 13821 </A></B>
<P>
tougher sentences for those offenders who abuse a position of 
trust or authority. The bill also includes harsher sentences for 
crimes based on hate for a particular race, nationality, colour, 
religion, gender, age or sexual orientation.
<P>
	In discussions with constituents, by correspondence and 
through the electronic media I have heard from many opponents 
of Bill C-41. Most of the opposition regards the inclusion of the 
term sexual orientation in the bill. Opposition to the bill seems 
to be based upon fundamental misunderstandings about the 
intent and also the consequences of passing Bill C-41 into 
federal law.
<P>
	Bill C-41 asks the court to take into consideration not only 
that a crime was committed, but that the offender was motivated 
by hatred against the victim based on the listed grounds which, 
as I have stated, include race, nationality, religion, age, gender 
or sexual orientation.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	I have emphasized to concerned Canadians this provision of 
the bill comes into effect only once a crime has been committed. 
Bill C-41 does not create any new crimes. It does not make 
moral opposition to homosexuality a crime and it does not affect 
freedom of expression.
<P>
	I have worked hard to correct the spread of misinformation by 
explaining to religious communities Bill C-41 will not prevent 
churches and religious instructors from talking about their 
beliefs regarding the morality of homosexuality. The bill is not 
creating any new hate crimes or expanding hate provisions in 
law.
<P>
	The other major concern with Bill C-41 is that by including 
the term sexual orientation in federal legislation we are setting a 
major legal precedent. As the Minister of Justice has told the 
House, sexual orientation is not a new term and has been in use 
in Canadian legislation since 1977. It appears in provincial 
human rights legislation in eight jurisdictions within Canada.
<P>
	Another misconception I have encountered is that by not 
defining the term sexual orientation, Bill C-41 will open legal 
loopholes that will legitimize the actions of paedophiles. Once 
again, the Minister of Justice has listened to this concern and has 
assured Canadians the term sexual orientation is included in 
provincial human rights legislation and that Canadian courts 
and tribunals have never had trouble understanding or 
interpreting the term which is unambiguous and does not 
include acts set out in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The bill makes an important statement that society will not 
tolerate crimes committed against individuals simply because 
of their race, religion, colour, gender, age or sexual orientation. 
Bill C-41 protects all Canadians. All Canadians have a 
nationality, a race, a gender, an age, a religion and a sexual 
orientation. Bill C-41 is an important part of the government's 
efforts to improve public safety, enhance the rights of victims 
and protect the rights of all Canadians to participate fully in the 
social and economic life of their country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to address the issue of the 
statement of purpose and principles in Bill C-41.
<P>
	I fear the government is misguided on this issue. The bill 
instructs judges to consider as aggravating circumstances in 
sentencing any evidence the offence was motivated by bias, 
prejudice or hate based on the race, nationality, colour, religion, 
sex, age, mental or physical disability or sexual orientation of 
the victim.
<P>
	Judges have latitude already in sentencing. They have been 
known to use it to hand out harsher sentences for crimes they 
consider particularly harmful to society. Why pass a law that 
asks them to be tougher in a few select categories? All crime and 
violence should be condemned and the punishment should be in 
proportion to the crime.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague from Central Nova that respect for 
our justice system stems from the notion we are all equal before 
the law. I do not see that principle reflected in the statement of 
purpose and principles of Bill C-41.
<P>
	I hope none of us disagrees that it is completely unacceptable 
and abhorrent that anyone should be the object of violent attack 
for any reason. Why should one form of assault be judged or 
condemned as more unacceptable than another?
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	In my mind any assault is completely unacceptable and should 
not be tolerated regardless of motivating factors. It is the crime 
that needs to be judged, not whether the accused held a personal 
bias toward the victim.
<P>
	Any type of act based on hatred for a group for whatever 
reason should be recognized as something intolerable in society. 
Section 15(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 states that every 
individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to 
equal protection.
<P>
	I believe Bill C-41 will to change this. It will say certain 
crimes against certain victims are worse than the same crime 
against any other victim. That is against the fundamental 
principles of the charter of rights, that every Canadian has the 
same equal right to protection under the law of Canada.
<P>
	I also fear the inclusion of the words sexual orientation in the 
statement of principle is a back door attempt at eventually 
legalizing same sex benefits and same sex marriages. It has been 
reported that on March 30, 1995 in New York City at a UN 
meeting the top Canadian officials at the United Nations were 
pushing for homosexual rights internationally so they can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13822"> 13822 </A></B>
<P>
compel domestic compliance in Canada and justify the route 
they are taking with Bill C-41.
<P>
	The government should be up front about its agenda and 
should also listen to Canadians. The hon. member for 
Scarborough West recently shared some telling information 
with other members about the statement of principles on Bill 
C-41 and the government's intention to amend the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. According to the member for Scarborough 
West 631 petitions have been presented in the House on the issue 
of sexual orientation. Of these petitions 87 per cent were against 
the sexual orientation amendment to the CHRA and/or against 
including the phrase sexual orientation in the statement of 
purpose and principles of bill C-41.
<P>
	My feelings on this matter are the same as those of the 
members for Scarborough West and Central Nova. In the face of 
this overwhelming opposition why is the government not 
listening to Canadians, for this is a slippery slope for Canada, a 
slippery slope the government is taking for the traditional 
family unit, and it is a dangerous route that will eventually 
become an avalanche if it is adopted in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while there is much that is 
laudable in Bill C-41, public concern has focused on one issue, 
the inclusion of the words sexual orientation as one of the 
categories for which crimes motivated by hatred would merit 
stricter sentencing in section 718.2 of the bill.
<P>
	I have listened to those concerns from my constituents who 
have spoken to me personally and hundreds who have written 
letters to me, and I share their views. I do not feel the words 
sexual orientation should appear in the bill and I support the 
amendment proposed by the member for Ontario to remove the 
list of categories altogether.
<P>
	It is important to explain the basis of my objections as there is 
a misconception that opposition to including sexual orientation 
as a category in this bill is in itself motivated by hatred of 
homosexuals. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	My riding contains a significant gay community. I have met 
with some of its organizations and have been very active in 
trying to address its concerns. I am also strongly opposed to 
so-called gay bashing or any crimes motivated by hatred against 
a minority group in society. That is why I support the bill in 
requiring stricter sentencing for assault and other crimes 
motivated by hatred.
<P>
	Yet I cannot bring myself to support the inclusion of sexual 
orientation as a legal category in the bill, as it seems to me there 
may be unintended consequences of this inclusion that may 
affect our definition of the family, freedom of speech and 
freedom of religion.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	When the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was 
being drafted the then justice minister, the current Prime 
Minister, said the term sexual orientation had not been included 
in section 15 because of the problem of the definition of those 
words. Speaking of sexual orientation he then stated: ``Do not 
ask me to tell you what it is because those concepts are difficult 
to interpret, to define, and that is why we do not want them in the 
Constitution''.
<P>
	Why should a term too vague for the Constitution of Canada 
in 1981 suddenly be clear as day in 1995? Some hon. members 
have proposed amendments to define this term for greater 
clarity but I think the wiser approach is to avoid the problem 
altogether by striking the list of terms from the bill.
<P>
	I fear that by including the words sexual orientation in federal 
law for the first time without clarification or definition, we are 
extending an invitation to the courts to read sexual orientation 
into other statutes as they have done with the Canadian and 
Alberta bill of rights in previous provincial court decisions. The 
legitimacy of this reading in has not yet been ruled on by the 
Supreme Court of Canada. By including these words in a section 
15 like list in a federal statute we are saying as federal 
legislators that what we did not want to include in 1981 we want 
to include today.
<P>
	The courts may well turn to this wording for guidance on other 
matters. What we have already seen is not encouraging. The 
Alberta Court of Queen's Bench ruled the Alberta human rights 
code had to be read as if sexual orientation was included in the 
Vriend case, which meant a private Christian Reformed college 
had to hire a teacher who was a practising homosexual despite 
its religious objections to his behaviour.
<P>
	In recent years we have seen attempts to deny the Salvation 
Army the right to use municipal property in the city of Toronto 
as it will not hire openly homosexual employees or clergy.
<P>
	We have seen Catholic school boards in Montreal forced to 
rent property to homosexual organizations all on the basis of 
including sexual orientation in human rights legislation and 
despite freedom of religion and freedom of association.
<P>
	Two weeks ago in Ontario a provincial court judge ruled 
homosexual couples were eligible to adopt children despite the 
fact that the legislators had defeated a similar measure only a 
few months before.
<P>
	If we as federal parliamentarians choose to include the words 
sexual orientation in federal law for the first time we will only 
encourage the courts in this practice at a time when many 
Canadians are questioning whether the courts are being too swift 
in striking down the decisions of elected legislators.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13823"> 13823 </A></B>
<P>
	While this bill may be a simple sentencing bill, not the 
charter or a human rights bill, our use of this language sends 
a message to the courts they may choose to interpret in ways 
we had not intended.
<P>
	We may not want to prevent a Salvation Army band from 
playing a Christmas concert for the poor on public property. We 
may not want private religious schools to be forced to hire 
openly homosexual teachers despite their religious teachings. 
We may not want paedophilia to be accepted as a legitimate 
sexual orientation. That is what may happen not because of this 
bill but because of what the courts may choose to do in applying 
this statutory language in other unrelated contexts.
<P>
	I hope I have made it clear why I, without any personal 
disrespect or malice toward homosexual persons, do not feel it 
would be prudent to include the words sexual orientation in this 
legislation. We are opening the door to the use of this language 
in other contexts that may lead to legitimizing other forms of 
sexual orientation we would not want to approve or to the use of 
the concept of sexual orientation to harm the rights of religious 
and other groups to freedom of religion, freedom of expression 
and freedom of association.
<P>
	The whole problem can be avoided by accepting the 
amendment by the member for Ontario and eliminating this 
contentious list of categories altogether.
<P>
	If the purpose of the bill is to ensure crimes motivated by 
hatred are more severely assessed in sentencing, let us leave it at 
that. If the purpose is to create a precedent of recognition of the 
concept of sexual orientation, a concept the Prime Minister felt 
was too ambiguous to include in the Constitution of 1981, one 
that might be used in other contexts we would not approve of as 
legislators, then this section of Bill C-41 does not deserve the 
support of the House.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to be addressing Parliament today 
on Bill C-41. To say the least, the legislation has caused quite a 
stir.
<P>
	The government has introduced close to 100 bills since the 
election but next to Bill C-68, the gun bill, no other bill has 
raised the kind of attention this one has.
<P>
	Although the bill is extensive the focus has been on just one 
small section. However the implications of this one section are 
great and could create a social shift in the Criminal Code. The 
general intent of the bill is reasonable. The Criminal Code needs 
to be overhauled in terms of its sentencing guidelines. The code 
is rather weak and soft as I know all Canadians will attest. 
Canadians want a code that will protect them and keep our 
streets safer.
<P>
	On the first day the bill was brought before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, November 17, 1994, 
the minister was present as a witness. I was at that hearing and 
listened closely to what the minister had to say. In particular I 
listened to his reasoning behind section 718.2, the clause that 
would increase penalties for those who commit crimes while at 
the same time they might have thought about someone's sexual 
orientation or religion or whatever.
<P>
	With regard to section 718.2 the minister stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's there, provided that a court that imposes a sentence shall take into account 
both aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In connection with aggravating 
circumstances, the court must consider evidence that the offence was motivated 
with bias, prejudice or hate based on race, nationality, colour, religion, sex, age, 
mental or physical disability or the sexual orientation of the victim.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As a court officer for over 20 years I have sat through enough 
court cases to know that judges already take into account all 
these factors in sentencing. I ask the justice minister, if 
something is already being done in the courts on a regular basis 
with innovation and flexibility, why it is necessary or 
appropriate to write them into the code and thereby stultify what 
is presently working. Where are the events in the community of 
such a pervasive nature that begs this kind of legislative 
response?
<P>
	I refer to another piece of testimony given by the minister on 
that day. The minister stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I'm asked why not define the term ``sexual orientation''-there's no need to 
add a definition. It's perfectly clear what the intention of the legislation is.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister in that committee finally stated what he thought 
was a definition of the term sexual orientation. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That interpretation of that provision has been that sexual orientation 
encompasses homosexuality, heterosexuality and bisexuality.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Fine, I can understand that definition. Why is it then that when 
an amendment is proposed at the clause by clause stage to add 
such a definition to the term sexual orientation-and I may say 
the identical definition the minister stated at the 
committee-every Liberal member except three voted against 
it?
<P>
	Witnesses had come before the justice committee and stated 
that sexual orientation could mean anything, including 
transsexuality and even pedophilia. Canadians need to know the 
direction the government is taking. I think they are observing 
that it is downhill. This type of leadership is unacceptable and 
must be highlighted so that the public can see. Then it can infer 
what kind of government we have.
<P>
	I quote from the minutes of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs a question I asked of John Conroy from 
the Canadian Bar Association on the definition of sexual 
orientation. I said to him:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13824"> 13824 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to my mind, the term ``sexual orientation'' is pretty broad. It could involve all 
kinds of repugnant possibilities, even those that are illegal. So could you 
address your mind to the definition of the term ``sexual orientation'' and 
support what you are saying when you say that it is carefully and narrowly 
drafted? I ask this because my assertion is that the term ``sexual orientation'' is 
not defined and is too broad.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Here is the response that was given to my question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would take the definition that you raised a minute ago. That has certainly been 
the definition I've always understood: homosexual, heterosexual, or some other 
sexual orientation. It could be any kind of sexual orientation, and it could be 
something that, as you say, is illegal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The definition could be any kind of sexual orientation. One 
would assume from this that someone who practises bestiality, 
pedophilia or transsexuality would be considered under this 
section. The minister says no, but he is unwilling to define the 
term sexual orientation. His social agenda is clear and it has 
little to do with getting tough on crime.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The proposed sentencing guidelines are redundant and ill 
considered, injecting politics and social fashion into the 
administration of criminal law. Judges already have wide 
discretion in sentencing within limits provided by the courts of 
appeal. They often use this discretion to hand out particularly 
harsh sentences for crimes they consider harmful to society.
<P>
	As far as I can determine, the government has presented no 
evidence that judges are being unduly lenient with criminals 
motivated by hate as compared to the leniency for other 
offences. Why pass a law that in effect asks judges to conform in 
accordance with a fashionable list?
<P>
	The Criminal Code is not a toy or a political manifesto. Nor 
should it be a showcase for the government's style. It is the law 
of the land, the moral border of tolerance where the state will 
intervene. Before the government makes any changes to the 
Criminal Code it should show first that there is a problem and, 
further, a problem that can be effectively addressed by the 
criminal law. Demonstrate, then legislate.
<P>
	The problem contemplated by section 718.2 of Bill C-41 
relates to an important principle. I said from the very beginning, 
and I will continue to say it, that the legislation ignores the 
fundamental principle that everyone is equal before the law. It 
suggests that violence against one person is less or more 
significant than against others, and that it provides special 
recognitions and advantages to select groups of people. I do not 
believe it is a wise course for the administration of justice.
<P>
	Several years ago a boy was murdered in Calgary by a young 
offender. His reasoning: the victim was overweight, shy and too 
brainy for his liking so he stabbed him to death. Not one of these 
characteristics is in the listed schedule in Bill C-41. Clearly the 
young boy was victimized based on discrimination of 
aforethought. Where does the list of discriminating 
characteristics end?  The list is indefinite and that is why the 
Reform Party wants clause 718.2 of the bill removed to keep all 
persons equal before the law.
<P>
	The courts already take into account the surrounding 
circumstances of the offence at the time of sentencing. If 
someone commits assault causing bodily harm that person is 
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years. The 
judge makes the decision concerning the length of the sentence 
not exceeding 10 years.
<P>
	As it currently stands, if the judge feels that a person was 
assaulted because of religion, the accused could be given a term 
of up to 10 years in prison. What many do not understand is that 
even if the amendments to Bill C-41 come into force, the 
maximum penalty the judge can give in such a case is still 10 
years. The legislation will not strengthen the limits of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	It is evident that section 718.2 is not presented for any 
criminal justice purpose but rather to mollify some loud 
political voices. This section of the Criminal Code is for a social 
fashion purpose, what is currently politically and socially 
correct as defined by the Liberals.
<P>
	By slipping section 718.2 into Bill C-41 the government 
manoeuvres one step closer to its overall agenda to include 
homosexuals in the Canadian Human Rights Act, which would 
then enable gay couples to claim spousal benefits and perhaps 
overturn by legal challenge any pro-traditional family social 
policy of the federal government. All in all section 718.2 should 
be deleted from Bill C-41. Deleting it would make it a better 
piece of legislation and more in line with the true will of the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	I want to address another amendment that we as a party have 
proposed. It is simply to delete anything to do with section 745 
of the Criminal Code. The clause has no right to be part of the 
code at all. Bill C-41 should not be referring to it. I know the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce feels differently as this had 
become his legacy when he was the solicitor general. Liberals 
see section 745 as the glimmer of hope. Reformers see a life 
sentence as just that, a life sentence. Life should mean life.
<P>
	Today a court in Ontario is in the midst of the very disturbing 
trial of Paul Bernardo. He is charged with the murders of two 
young girls. If convicted he could receive a life sentence, but 
because of section 745 he could be walking our streets in 15 
years. I cannot even bear to think of the possibility of this 
occurring. Yet the bleeding hearts condemn Reformers for even 
thinking of repealing this offensive section.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston has a private member's 
bill at committee stage that would get rid of section 745. If clear 
heads prevail, the bill will pass through the committee stage. 
The bill passed second reading and I believe that 74 members of 
the Liberal caucus supported it. We have hope then that our 
amendment will have similar results when it comes to a vote. 
When 74 Liberal members vote differently than the  justice 
minister and the Prime Minister, one can only come to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13825"> 13825 </A></B>
<P>
conclusion that these members are simply doing what is right for 
the justice system in our society.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Repeal of section 745 represents what the majority of 
Canadians want. It is a bellwether issue to measure the 
appropriateness of the social philosophy of the section 745 
defenders. Who could ever even vote for and support in 
Parliament any MP who has the kind of mind that would 
continue to defend section 745? Canadians want it repealed. I 
hope the government is listening.
<P>
	In conclusion I am saying that the underlying social 
philosophy of Bill C-41 is a measure of the basic value structure 
of the Prime Minister. He alone is ultimately responsible and 
accountable for the devalued tone of the bill's inherent message. 
Everything in the bill has his stamp of approval.
<P>
	The Prime Minister sometimes appears as a likeable guy. 
However his legislation and values represented in the bill are not 
very likeable. The bill does not represent mainstream Canadian 
values. Consequently it is revealed that neither does the Prime 
Minister. Improvement will only come with a new government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would love to tell you today that I rejoice in 
participating in this debate. I must confess that I do not. Like 
many members I suppose I hesitated before doing so.
<P>
	I speak in the House as a practising Roman Catholic, a 
pro-life supporter against euthanasia. I believe strongly in what 
hon. members would consider to be family values. I also speak 
in favour of the bill before us today. I suppose it would be far 
easier to keep quiet.
<P>
	However the debate I have heard over the last couple of days 
has put me in a position where I feel I have to speak. Lest any 
member think that I am wearing my MP hat as opposed to my 
whip hat and so on, I say to the House and to all hon. members 
that there is no difference. I cannot take off the jacket and tie and 
put on the team jersey when I feel like it. I have to reconcile the 
fact that I operate in both roles at the same time and all the time.
<P>
	Some of the things I have heard make it such that I feel 
compelled to express my views on the issue. I want to address 
two topics: first youth offenders and second the hate crime 
provision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On the topic of young offenders, I must say that I was 
disappointed with some of the speeches I heard yesterday. I am 
the father of two teenagers and the remarks made by the hon. 
member for Wild Rose yesterday aroused in me a feeling of 
helplessness to see what I would call a generalized inclination to 
tar young people in this country with the same brush by 
ascribing criminal tendencies to all, most or at least a large 
number of 16- and 17-year olds.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Paragraph after paragraph of the speech of the member for 
Wild Rose-and I have a copy of <I>Hansard</I> before me-describe 
16 and 17-year-old hooligans. They indicate that sentences are 
inappropriate for young criminals, that youths raised in poverty 
have no excuse for adhering to a life of crime; that alleged 
dysfunctionality was not a reason to be a criminal; and that 16 
and 17-year-old butchers have to be treated like their victims 
and so on.
<P>
	All of us want sentences that are appropriate and that fit the 
crime.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	Each one of us has a moral responsibility in the Chamber 
when we speak to ensure what we say does not create more 
misery than the good we are pretending to espouse in our views.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Which brings me to my second topic: hate crimes. Never, 
since first arriving in this House a long time ago, have I read 
letters from constituents and others expressing such disturbing 
grievances.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us remember the bill is about sentencing with regard to 
crimes already committed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I received letters and preprinted cards from people in other 
ridings, like this one, which talk about the government wanting 
to legitimize the lifestyle of a group that undermines basic 
family values.
<P>
	I have here another letter I have received.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another letter says Bill C-41 would harm the rights of parents 
to protect their children, the rights of institutions to have a 
preference over adoption policy, historical rights of freedom of 
religion, the right of religious institutions to have hiring 
practices consistent with their religious belief and so on.
<P>
	I am not mocking anyone, I say to the hon. member across, 
and if he had listened carefully the letter I am reading does not 
come from a constituent. The hon. member may make fun of 
what I have to say but I do not believe anything we do which in 
any way shows that kind of intolerance is beneficial to any of us. 
If the hon. member will be patient, once I finish my speech he 
can give us his wisdom.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13826"> 13826 </A></B>
<P>
	The B'nai Brith of Canada, the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities, the chief of police of the Ottawa-Carleton 
regional police force, the Canadian Jewish Congress and others 
have all asked us to support this legislation. I have in hand a 
letter from the United Church of Canada talking about the bill 
and the need to have it, talking about hate crimes, crimes are 
motivated by the vulnerability of certain individuals and groups 
within society. It urges these groups to be explicitly included.
<P>
	I must say with regret that my church did not send a letter of 
support of this kind. I do not wish to elaborate on that but I have 
to state it because it is a fact. That does not change what I believe 
to be intolerance on the part of some, lack of knowledge on the 
part of others and selfish motives on the part of yet others 
making it such that the debate today has taken on the ugly 
tangent I see attached to it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is unfortunate that, as we sit here asking questions on a bill 
partly aimed at protecting hate crime victims, there is so much 
controversy surrounding this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One amendment says that for greater certainty, referring to 
sexual orientation, it does not include preference toward any 
sexual act or activity that would constitute an offence under this 
act. That is to clarify that presumably a sexual activity that 
would be criminal would not be legal by virtue of passing the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister indicated there was no need for such an 
amendment. Notwithstanding that, for greater certainty he put 
one in. If they are clear in their conscience members opposite 
will look at group No. 7, Motion No. 24:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, conduct that constituted an offence under the Criminal 
Code before the date on which this section comes into force constitutes the same 
offence after that date.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, for greater certainty anything that was 
criminal before is reaffirmed this way in the same way as we 
reaffirm through a greater certainty clause in the gun bill with 
respect to a certain group. We have done it again here just to 
ensure there was no doubt.
<P>
	Will that make the members who are heckling right now vote 
for the bill? I regret to say that probably will not happen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What we must do in this House, if we see ourselves as living in 
a mature democracy that has embraced certain basic rights, is 
not only to believe in these rights but also to ensure that some 
groups in our society do not become the victims of intolerance. 
The least we can do is not to make speeches in this House which 
promote intolerance against others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today we are not having a debate or a speech about family 
values, about the promotion of gay rights or anything like that. 
They have nothing to do with the bill. They could have 
something to do with other bills and we will deal with those 
when the time comes if and when it does. Those are not the 
issues before us today. The issue before us today is the 
protection of victims when crimes have been committed. That is 
what we have to remember. To twist that in order to achieve 
some other objective is not correct. It is not the kind of tolerance 
I was brought up to live with and to live by. I ask my colleagues 
to share with me in that kind of tolerance toward other people, as 
I was taught to do in the church of which I am a member.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Davenport, the environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-41.
<P>
	I begin by voicing my absolute disgust with the government in 
its move to invoke time allocation on the bill. Bill C-41 is an 
important bill with serious implications. My constituents of 
Comox-Alberni deserve to have their opinions heard through 
their representative in the House. The government's move to 
silence MPs by preventing reasonable debate of legislation is 
undemocratic and unprincipled.
<P>
	Bill C-41 proposes to amend the Criminal Code to restructure 
sentencing provisions contained in the Criminal Code and rules 
for evidence and procedure for use in the sentencing process. 
Bill C-41 ensures harsher penalties are imposed for crimes 
motivated by hatred based on race, nationality, colour, religion, 
sex, age, mental or physical disability or sexual orientation.
<P>
	I agree with the concept that legislation should provide for 
victim impact statements to be used in court proceedings. The 
Reform Party has also been a strong advocate of victims' rights 
and it is high time this be given priority by the government. 
However, the bill before us hardly addresses the issue. Bill C-41 
does little to protect victims' rights.
<P>
	The bill provides only for written statements to be filed with 
the court, which is simply not adequate. The bill fails to provide 
for oral or written statements to be made directly to the court by 
the victim or by the victim's representative. With this provision 
the legislative proposals are virtually meaningless.
<P>
	If the government is serious about victims' rights, provision 
to allow for both oral and written statements to be made directly 
to the court by either the victim or the victim's representative 
should be provided for.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13827"> 13827 </A></B>
<P>
	When the Reform Party suggested a number of amendments 
to the bill at committee stage which would provide for these 
provisions, the lack of commitment by the government was 
demonstrated when all amendments were voted down by the 
Liberal majority in committee.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	As much as I support provisions for victim's rights, I am 
dismayed to note that passing this legislation will hardly change 
the status quo.
<P>
	The implications of victims' rights within the bill may be 
insignificant. However, I have serious reservations about the 
implications of section 717, which requires serious revision 
before it is passed by the House.
<P>
	Section 717 proposes to make provisions for allowance to 
bypass court proceedings for those accused of offences. If an 
accused person admits to committing or to having involvement 
in an offence this section would eliminate the use of the courts to 
determine guilt or sentencing.
<P>
	Reform supports the use of alternative measures for specific 
offences, particularly non-violent offences, but this clause is 
too open ended. Offences punishable by alternate measures are 
not specified and this needs to be spelled out more.
<P>
	The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police recommended 
section 717 be amended to restrict the availability of the 
program to persons who have committed less serious offences as 
well as first time offenders. I support such an amendment before 
the bill becomes law.
<P>
	In addition, the bill fails to give any indication of what will 
constitute an alternative measure. This must be spelled out. It is 
not enough to delegate responsibility to the provinces because 
even though provinces are given authority to design their own 
system there will be vast differences in measures from province 
to province.
<P>
	When Reform proposed an amendment to clarify the situation 
the Liberal majority voted it down in committee. Without 
clarification the bill leaves the system of fair trial and 
punishment wide open to abuse.
<P>
	I cannot support section 717 without the necessary 
amendments, which the government is unwilling to make. As it 
stands, section 717 should be scrapped.
<P>
	Another section which needs serious revision is the 
controversial hate section 718.2. It has raised the ire and 
concern of many Canadians. Section 718.2 stipulates that a court 
which imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration that 
sentences should be increased or reduced to account for any 
relevant, aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the 
offence or the offender.
<P>
	Furthermore, the bill goes on to propose that sentences take 
into account that evidence the offence was motivated by bias, 
prejudice or hate based on race, nationality, colour, religion, 
sex, age, mental or physical  disability or sexual orientation of 
the victim shall be deemed aggravating circumstances.
<P>
	One problem with this section which has been raised by many 
Canadians is the loosely defined use of the term sexual 
orientation. Canadians have repeatedly attempted to get their 
concerns regarding this section heard by the government. 
Numerous petitions and calls in the House for a legal definition 
of the term sexual orientation in the bill have fallen on deaf ears. 
The government still insists proceeding with the section as it 
stands; so much for consulting the people.
<P>
	Without a definition of sexual orientation the government is 
leaving itself wide open to a whole new era of legal challenges. 
The bill opens the door for the public and courts to define sexual 
orientation as they see fit. This could include legitimizing 
paedophiles' engaging in sexual activities with young children, 
suggesting that because it is their sexual orientation it is a 
legitimate activity. This is nonsense. It is a major concern. 
Canadians are aware there has been an active movement for 
paedophilia to be considered a legitimate sexual orientation. 
This has to be addressed.
<P>
	Another problem with section 718.2 is it opens the door for all 
kinds of confusion before the courts. If a person who fits into 
any one of the categories has been assaulted, this person will 
have the right to insist the crown attorney show the offence was 
motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on sexual orientation 
of the victim.
<P>
	Clearly bias, hate and prejudice against another person should 
not be tolerated. However, opening up this section as a basis for 
increased penalties opens a can of worms the government will 
not be able to close.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	In determining appropriate sentences for crimes, courts 
should only consider the nature of the offence: Was it a robbery 
or a sexual assault? Was violence involved? Whether or not the 
offence was directed against a heterosexual or a homosexual, a 
Catholic or an atheist, a Caucasian or non-Caucasian is simply 
irrelevant. The whole concept of adding hatred threatens equal 
treatment under the law.
<P>
	Hatred, bias and prejudice cannot be defined. The nature of 
the crime should be judged and punished accordingly, not the 
race, religion or sexual orientation of the victim or the 
perpetrator. It should not matter who or what kind of person the 
victim or perpetrator is when a crime is brought before the 
courts. Law has no business investigating or questioning these 
attributes. In doing so the proposed law will infringe on the civil 
rights and liberties of individuals.
<P>
	Just as this government proposes to impose on civil rights and 
liberties of Canadians with its prejudicial hiring quotas in Bill 
C-64, the act to impose hiring equity, the government also 
proposes to entrench inequities through this bill. Just as all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13828"> 13828 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians should be able to compete equally for jobs 
irrespective of race, religion,  gender or disability, so should all 
Canadians be able to defend themselves in a court of law 
regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
<P>
	Canadians will not tolerate the big brother attitude of this 
government. The Liberals may be able to hide from Canadians 
the contents of their bills now by invoking closure on debate but 
Canadians will not be silent when their rights and liberties are 
threatened.
<P>
	Over 71,000 Canadians have petitioned this House not to pass 
Bill C-41 as it stands. Over 10,000 letters opposing this bill 
were delivered to the justice minister last week. The justice 
minister has received over 70,000 letters opposing this bill. 
There is no question Canadians clearly do not agree with the 
Liberal government on this issue.
<P>
	The minister states that he consulted with Canadians before 
implementing legislation, but with whom did he consult on Bill 
C-41? The growing arrogance of this government is becoming 
very apparent and Canadians simply will not continue to tolerate 
it.
<P>
	Come next election the message of Canadians will be loud and 
clear. Just as the people spoke in the 1993 election, so they will 
speak in 1997. The government may be able to ignore and 
silence the will of Canadians today but no government is above 
the democratic voice of the people. The Liberals, like the 
Conservatives before them who did not listen to the people, will 
go down in flames.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, originally, my speech 
was supposed to be in French but as you know, this is an issue 
that has caused some controversy in many parts of English 
Canada and especially among representatives of the third party 
here in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is only one part of this bill which is controversial. Let 
us cut to the chase and talk about that one part, namely crimes 
motivated by hatred, particularly hatred of a person's sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	In this debate, we have heard that sexual orientation is an 
ambiguous term. Not only is this term in the bills of rights in 
almost all of our provinces, but only two weeks ago the Supreme 
Court of Canada acknowledged that sexual orientation was a 
form of discrimination and used those specific legally definable 
words.
<P>
	We have heard talk about special rights being given to one 
segment of society. This bill does not give anyone special rights. 
It tries to restore basic human rights which are being stolen from 
some segments of our society.
<P>
	Gangs of neo-Nazis are not prowling the streets looking for 
straight, white males to beat up and throw off cliffs. There are 
however gangs of neo-Nazis beating up and killing gays.
<P>
	We have heard that looking at intent sets a dangerous 
precedent for our criminal justice system. Intent is the basis of 
our entire criminal justice system. After all, what is the 
difference between manslaughter and first degree murder if it is 
not the intent of the perpetrator? The sentence for the latter is 
life in prison, yet both deal with killing.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	We have heard the argument that a crime is a crime and that 
punishment for beating and killing should be the same for all 
people. There are different crimes and the punishment should fit 
the crime.
<P>
	When a Jewish cemetery is desecrated the damage is not to 
property, it is to the entire community. As a result Jewish people 
feel unsafe in their homes as they recall their history and an 
entire segment of our society is scarred. That is exactly what the 
neo-Nazis want. When a gay person is beaten or killed it is not 
simply that person who is murdered but the entire community is 
victimized. This is exactly what the neo-Nazis and bigots of all 
kinds want.
<P>
	We have heard the right wingers talk of conspiracy and 
agendas. The only agenda is that of the radical religious right 
trying to advance religious beliefs on the Canadian public. After 
all, this is not about new rights but about saving lives. The polls 
show that the Canadian public overwhelmingly wants this 
legislation, more than those who wanted gun control and that 
was well over 70 per cent.
<P>
	I realize there are some members in this House who feel their 
personal religious beliefs are more important than either their 
constituents' views or an individual's fundamental rights and 
freedoms. However I would urge them to follow the lead of 
Quebec, the only province in Canada which has an official 
religion and the first province in Canada to acknowledge that 
there is widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<P>
	I would also urge these members to remember what we are 
talking about here. We are not talking about same sex benefits. 
We are not talking about adoption. We are talking about 
stopping gay people from getting systematically beaten and 
killed by bigots of all kinds.
<P>
	Not too long ago a person walking across the bridge out here 
from Hull to Ottawa was seized upon by a gang of so-called 
neo-Nazis. His crime was only that these bigots thought he 
looked gay. The media later made a point of saying he was not 
gay but that should not have been relevant. This young man was 
thrown to his death at the foot of the cliff beneath these 
Parliament Buildings because the neo-Nazis thought it was 
good and right to kill gays.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13829"> 13829 </A></B>
<P>
	I know some of my colleagues believe that their religion 
prohibits homosexuality. I also know that their religion 
prohibits killing. In Christianity the basis for the former is an 
obscure passage written in prose and the latter is one of God's 
Ten Commandments. I sincerely hope they will see their duty 
clear and join us in trying to stop these killings once and for 
all.
<P>
	As a Roman Catholic and as a married man, I fully recognize 
the obligation of this House to recognize equal rights for all. All 
we are asking is that these fundamental rights which we hold 
especially on the government side be extended to all Canadians 
and that includes gays and lesbians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to enter into the public debate on Bill C-41. I was just having a 
private debate with one of the government members on the 
controversial section 718.2.
<P>
	There are some good points in this bill as well as the bad ones. 
The emphasis has been on section 718.2 regarding the phrase of 
sexual orientation. I wish to go on the record as being totally and 
absolutely opposed to the point that we would introduce that 
phrase and give the protection under the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I may be wrong but I think this is the first time the House has 
given to people the protection of sexual orientation which is 
totally undefined, whatever their sexual orientation may be and 
however repulsive that may be to a large number of people. They 
will now be protected under the Criminal Code.
<P>
	If we go back to the charter of rights and freedoms that was 
passed in 1980 at that time the House specifically said that 
sexual orientation shall be left out. Then we found that the 
courts have introduced it. They said it shall be read in. I wonder 
who gave them the power to read it in when this House said it 
shall not be in there.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Thousands and thousands of petitions have been presented in 
this House and the government has not listened to any one of 
them. There is an article in today's Ottawa <I>Sun</I> regarding some 
members of the Reform Party who delivered to Parliament in a 
wheelbarrow thousands and thousands of letters objecting to the 
term sexual orientation. Not one of them was listened to by this 
government.
<P>
	I do hope government members took note of what happened in 
this province last Thursday when the government was thrown 
out for not listening to the people. A new government was 
introduced which promised some serious policy, not only in 
balanced budgets but also in social reform.
<P>
	Most unfortunately, perhaps the Liberals will pay more 
attention to that than the tens of thousands of Canadians who 
have registered their strong disapproval to this clause. It has 
identified certain segments of society and has given them 
special protection. That special  protection is not available to 
anybody else. We pride ourselves as Canadians for being fair, 
treating everybody equally, that no one is better or worse than 
anybody else.
<P>
	Yet because of a person's sexual orientation, which is 
undefined and may be reprehensible and disgusting, that person 
is not only protected but we are also going to mete out a more 
severe punishment to people who are victims within those 
groups than those who are victims of a group not mentioned in 
the section. That is why I find it repulsive. It is not only the fact 
that sexual orientation is in here which I find repulsive, but also 
the fact that a few Canadians have been identified and are being 
told that they are entitled to special treatment but nobody else is. 
All of us are supposed to be equal in the eyes of the law but we 
now find that is not the case.
<P>
	I fully expect the citizens of Canada will remember this at the 
next election. They will ask MPs how they voted on June 14, 
1995 on Bill C-41 when this type of amendment to the Criminal 
Code was introduced for the first time. I am fairly sure a large 
number of people who voted Liberal last time will not be voting 
Liberal the next time based on the fact that the Liberals have 
totally ignored the wishes of Canadians and have pushed this 
through much against their will.
<P>
	Moving on to other sections, section 745.1 deals with people 
under the age of 18. Because we have focused on section 718.2 
we have not talked about the other sections. Section 745.1 deals 
with the sentencing of people under the age of 18 convicted of 
first degree murder and second degree murder who shall be 
eligible for parole between five and ten years.
<P>
	No more than 10 years shall the person spend in jail if he or 
she commits a murder in this country while under the age of 18. 
No more. What is the value of human life when we let our young 
people run through the streets committing murder and violent 
crime and we say the maximum is 10 years in jail for the crime?
<P>
	There is a trial going on at this very moment which has 
despicable and heinous videotapes of the most repulsive crimes 
that perhaps have ever been committed in this country. Had 
these people been under the age of 18, the sentence would have 
been no more than 10 years in jail.
<P>
	Where is this country going when it comes to criminal 
justice? Canadians from coast to coast are saying that they want 
safer streets and safer communities. And we turn around and pat 
those criminals on the head saying: ``Do not do it any more. 
Perhaps you should know better''.
<P>
	It is time we got tough on crime, time that we told criminals 
we do not want to see them back in court again. The sentence 
should be appropriate. It should give them the message that we 
are serious about being serious on crime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13830"> 13830 </A></B>
<P>
	Section 717 regarding alternative measures and sentencing 
allows more appropriate sentencing. A couple of weeks ago we 
heard that a court in Saskatchewan banished a native for one 
year to live in isolation because he raped and humiliated 
someone. That is not sufficient.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	If we are going to give the courts the right to alternative 
measures then we should have some real serious messages built 
into the system that the punishment must fit the crime. To banish 
someone to the wilderness who is perfectly capable and 
acquainted with living in the wilderness is basically to tell him 
to go home for a year and stay there. When this country is totally 
and absolutely fed up with violence against women and 
everybody, we find that a sentence like that is repulsive.
<P>
	We already have a private member's bill to try to repeal 
section 745.6. That is the open door for people who are 
sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 15 years. It used to 
be the faint last hope and now we find it is the open door to get 
back on the street. That also has to be closed.
<P>
	I have one final point, on section 722. We have to applaud that 
one, because it now gives victims the right to be heard in court. 
We must say that is an advancement, because victims need to be 
heard. We need to hear the pain they have suffered. It is time that 
criminals realized they are destroying our society and society is 
going to speak back and hit back to ensure that criminals get the 
message once and for all that we have had enough with crime 
and criminals. We want to do what we can through tougher 
sentencing and tougher laws to ensure that crime statistics start 
going down rather than up.
<P>
	I could speak all day on this particular subject, but I think I 
have put my point across. There are five bad points and one good 
point in this bill. Therefore, I think Reform and everybody else 
in this country wants this bill defeated.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-41 has proven to be a very controversial bill based 
exclusively on the inclusion of the term sexual orientation in 
section 718.2, two words in a bill that runs 75 pages in length. 
These objections, even with a cursory study, do not stand up to 
scrutiny.
<P>
	First I want to briefly deal with what the rest of C-41 talks 
about. C-41 provides the courts with a clear statement of 
principles and guidelines to be considered when sentencing 
offenders. Sentencing is a very delicate balance between 
competing principles. There is far more to consider than simply 
locking up the offender and separating him from society. This is 
not to say that the safety of society must not be the paramount 
goal, but we must also rehabilitate where we can and use our 
limited financial correctional resources in the wisest possible 
fashion.
<P>
	Canada has one of the highest rates of incarceration in the 
western world. This is not because we are a violent or lawless 
people. On the contrary, only 10 per cent of crime in this country 
actually involves violence. Over half of all crimes involve 
property, not people. And frequently offenders are locked up not 
because they represent in any way a threat to society but because 
we simply do not know what to do with them. We do not have the 
resources at present in our code.
<P>
	For example, nearly a third of the people liable to 
incarceration in our provincial jails are in that situation because 
they could not pay fines. Particularly hard hit of course are 
aboriginal and poor Canadians. The bill provides measures to 
help the provinces collect outstanding fines through the civil 
court system or levy community service or withhold provincial 
licences or permits in lieu of fines.
<P>
	The bill also takes into much greater account the victims of 
crime, the people so often overlooked in the sentencing process. 
The new law will revise the parole provisions of the code. 
Henceforth, when an offender brings an application for an 
earlier parole eligibility date the court will specifically be 
required to take into account the perspective and evidence of the 
victim or the victim's family in deciding whether permission 
should be granted to the applicant to seek early parole.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill also gives priority to the principle of restitution. 
Offenders must be made to understand the consequences of their 
crimes. To do this, the code will be amended to ensure that 
restitution orders can be enforced through civil courts like any 
other court order, through garnishment of wages, seizure, sale or 
otherwise. At the same time, the restitution order will not 
preclude the victim from suing for damages in the civil courts in 
that province.
<P>
	Jails should be reserved for those who need them. Bill C-41 
proposes alternatives to create a more equitable, less costly, and 
more effective system which Canadians can trust. It introduces a 
diversion program for adults guilty of minor crimes, for 
instance shoplifting, that will allow the courts to divert the 
offender into a program of community service and counselling 
to deal with the problem in a more humane and less costly 
manner.
<P>
	Another new aspect of the bill is the conditional sentence. 
This provision will give authorities the discretion to have the 
offender serve his or her sentence in the community where-and 
I want to stress this-the court is satisfied that the offender 
would not endanger the safety of the community. If the offender 
does not comply with the conditions imposed as part of that 
sentence, he or she is brought back before the court to explain. If 
the court is not satisfied, it can order that the remainder of the 
sentence be served in custody.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13831"> 13831 </A></B>
<P>
	Last, Bill C-41 will require that a judge passing sentence 
state her or his reasons and enter those reasons in the record 
of proceeding. This will increase public understanding of the 
judicial decision making process, encouraging judges to make 
consistent, well-informed, reasoned decisions based on the 
principles enunciated in the bill.
<P>
	Now to section 718. Hate crime is increasingly manifest in 
Canada. There are over 40 organized hate groups operating in 
Canada today, and there is no evidence that the number is 
abating. It is with this in mind that the Liberal government has 
moved to toughen up the Criminal Code to crack down on crime 
and to make it known in absolutely unequivocal terms that we 
cannot and will not allow hatred and prejudice to tear us apart in 
this country. This was our promise to the Canadian people 
during the election campaign. We say now that crimes motivated 
by hate will be and indeed must be more severely punished.
<P>
	Hatred comes in many guises. There is neo-Nazism, 
anti-Semitism, racism. They are only the obvious forms. 
Prejudice based on sexual orientation is just as real and one of 
the most common forms of discrimination we encounter today.
<P>
	Some studies estimate that as much as 12 per cent of the 
population is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Others purport to put the 
number as low as 3 per cent. Whatever the percentage, be it 1 per 
cent or 50 per cent, the fact is that we cannot tolerate prejudice 
and hate motivated crimes against any segment of our 
population, no matter how small. In fact, I will argue that if it is 
smaller then they need our protection more, since they do not 
have the numbers to protect themselves.
<P>
	Studies show that as many as one-third of the people we are 
talking about here-or they are talking about, that great they 
over on the other side-have been threatened or subjected to 
violence simply because of who they are. According to the 
Metro Toronto police force, hate crimes motivated by sexual 
orientation today represent the third largest category of hate 
related offences.
<P>
	The evidence all points to a steady increase in hate crime, 
particularly in the United States. It is naive to think that this 
does not spill over to Canada. If we contemn hatred, we must 
contemn all hatred, not just against some groups, but against all 
groups equally.
<P>
	Some people have expressed a concern that the new law would 
legalize pedophilia. Let us be perfectly clear here. This 
legislation does not legalize any sexual activity that is currently 
outlawed, and the bill explicitly states so. A person's sexual 
orientation no more includes pedophilia than it does sexual 
assault or incest. I wonder how many heterosexuals think of 
themselves as rapists.
<P>
	People who violate the sexual offences in the existing 
Criminal Code will continue to be punished to the full extent of 
the law. In fact, section 718.2.(ii) of the bill will allow for even 
harsher sentences to be imposed on sex offenders where the 
victim is in a relationship of trust to  the offender, for example, 
where a doctor molests a patient, a teacher a young student, a 
babysitter his or her charge, or a priest his parishioner.
<P>
	I have also heard it said that the new bill will make it a crime 
to speak out publicly against homosexuality. Again, let us be 
perfectly clear. It is the right of every Canadian to be able to 
speak his or her mind. A church sermon expressing a moral view 
is not a crime. Freedom of speech and religion are both 
specifically protected under our charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-41 as a sentencing bill will become operative only 
after someone is found guilty of a crime. Only at the sentencing 
hearing may a judge hear evidence that the crime was motivated 
by hatred, and only then may the judge take it into account in 
passing sentence.
<P>
	Some critics have expressed concern that the bill will open the 
door to sweeping changes leading to the recognition of same sex 
families or gay and lesbian spouses. Bill C-41 does not and will 
not have this effect. You are in the wrong act, people. It does 
nothing more than what it appears to do. It is a bill to give the 
court guidance in determining a sentence where a crime has been 
committed. The bill does not advocate or encourage any 
lifestyle, nor does it undermine in any way the traditional 
family. It does not even speak to the subject. It is relevant only to 
the criminal law.
<P>
	Bill C-41 is about many things. It is about the right of 
everyone to live as they choose within the law and to live their 
lives free from fear. It is far more than a debate on sexual 
orientation. It is about sentencing. It is designed to restore faith 
in our courts, faith in our system of justice, and faith in our 
communities, where people need to be reintegrated.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to give their support to this 
important bill.
<P>
	I must say that I have felt ashamed in the last two days about 
statements of intolerance I have heard in the debate. I hope I 
never rise again saying that I feel ashamed about statements of 
intolerance in the greatest democracy in the world today, 
Canada.

<P>

<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, we are going to have a few votes 
this afternoon. We are going to take it nice and easy so that 
everyone understands what is going on. We are not going to rush 
at all. Here we go.
<P>
	The first question is on Motion No. 3. An affirmative vote on 
Motion No. 3 obviates the necessity of putting the question on 
Motion No. 4. A negative vote on Motion No. 3 necessitates the 
question being put on Motion No. 4.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 5 lost.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 6. An affirmative vote on 
Motion No. 6 obviates the necessity of putting the question on 
Motions Nos. 7 and 17. A negative vote on Motion No. 6 
necessitates the question being put on Motions Nos. 7 and 17. Is 
it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 12 lost.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like 
you to clarify two things for me. I have noticed that a lot of 
government members are going in and out of their seats. I 
believe-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. whip of the Reform Party has the 
floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rose to ask you to please check the 
record on the last vote on Motion No. 12. I believe you will find 
the minister of immigration cast his vote and should be in that 
total, but before the totals were given he left his seat. That vote 
should not count.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, you will recall earlier in the night I 
asked you to kindly stay in your seats from the beginning to the 
end of each vote. Perhaps one or two members did leave a bit 
earlier. I cannot see all members at the same time. I appeal to 
you that when a vote begins, once you vote please stay in your 
seat until the vote is terminated.
<P>
	I will do it this one time. Because an hon. member questioned 
another hon. member's presence, it is very simple, did the hon. 
minister of immigration leave his seat during the vote?
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There it is. His vote in this instance I rule will 
not count by his own admission.
<P>
	I ask members to please abide by the rules. We will get 
through these votes, they will just take a little while.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 13. An affirmative vote on 
Motion No. 13 obviates the necessity of putting the question on 
Motion No. 14. A negative vote on Motion No. 13 necessitates 
the question being put on Motion No. 14.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 14 carried.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I seek some clarification from 
the Chair. My understanding is that the effect of Motion No. 14 
by the member for Scarborough West is to insert a comma into 
the legislation. Can you confirm that, please, or can the author 
confirm the effect of that amendment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to confirm that 
the amendment adds a comma. I am very happy that the 
government supported it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The next question is on Motion No. 15. An 
affirmative vote on Motion No. 15 obviates the  necessity of 
putting the question on Motion No. 16. A negative vote on 
Motion No. 15 necessitates the question being put on Motion 
No. 16.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My Motion 
No. 16 calls for stiffer sentences against spousal abusers. Today 
in debate a motion was put by the hon. member for Hamilton 
West to amend Motion No. 17 that had been moved by the 
Minister of Justice.
<P>
	I am pleased that Motion No. 17, as amended, would very 
nicely cover the intent of my motion. Therefore I ask for 
unanimous consent of the House to withdraw Motion No. 16.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	<I>After the taking of the vote:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Table would like some clarification. Either 
the member of Parliament for Beaver River voted twice or 
someone like her voted. Would she tell us if she did vote and if 
she did, which way she voted.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Fortunately 
there only is one member for Beaver River in this House. I am 
about as tired as the woman who is calling the vote. She is 
exhausted. I stood to try to expedite it. I am in fact a nay.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not know if this is in order but maybe the 
hon. member for Beaver River could pass this time.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> I am happy to pass, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 19 carried.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 22. A vote on this motion 
also applies to Motions Nos. 23 and 25.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. On December 13 
the House passed at second reading private member's Bill 
C-226, which deals with section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The House in principle supported the repeal of section 745 of 
the Criminal Code. This amendment to this piece of legislation 
purports to amend a bill or a section of the Criminal Code 
Parliament has already pronounced on in terms of repealing it at 
second reading.
<P>
	The private member's bill is presently before the justice 
committee. I seek some direction from the Chair as to whether 
this amendment and the section in this bill are in order.
<P>
<B>(2020 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have been asked for a ruling. I rule these 
amendments are in order because the other bill is not now before 
the House and therefore we will proceed with Motion No. 22.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was sure 
which way I voted. I should like to seek unanimous consent of 
the House to give a great round of applause to Audrey O'Brien 
who has been on her feet for hours and called every vote here 
tonight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Now that 
members of the Reform Party have been gracious enough to pay 
tribute to someone who has done a lot of work for us tonight in 
counting the votes, perhaps they would stop playing games and 
get on with the votes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Neither of those were points of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The 
hon. member on the other side impugned that we do not take 
serious the democratic process. I would ask that he withdraw the 
comments.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have been at it now for three hours. 
Everything is going quite well. I am reminded of the story of the 
elephant and what he said when his tail was cut off. He said: ``It 
won't be long now''.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that the bill, as amended, be 
concurred in.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will please 
say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>

	The House proceeded to the consideration of amendments 
made by the Senate to Bill C-69, an act to provide for the 
establishment of electoral boundaries commissions and the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint Their Honours that this 
House agrees to amendment number 4(<I>a</I>) made by the Senate to Bill C-69, an 
act to provide for the establishment of electoral boundary commissions and the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries, and this House disagrees with 
amendments numbers 1, 2, 3, 4(<I>b</I>), 4(<I>c</I>), 5 and 6 for the following reasons:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The bill was, in accordance with the new procedures of this House, prepared 
by a committee of the House. While amendment number 4(<I>a</I>) corrects an 
omission, the other amendments address points, each of which were supported 
by members representing at least two of the three parties officially recognized in 
the House. Taken together, the bill represents a balance aimed at improving the 
responsiveness of the system of readjusting electoral boundaries both to rapid 
shifts of population and to the operative realities of effective representation of 
the people, a balance that, in the opinion of this House, requires:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) in view of the varied Canadian geography and demography, the retention of 
a variation of up to 25 per cent from the electoral quota of each province 
(addressed by amendments number 1 and 6(<I>a</I>));</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13854"> 13854 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) the avoidance of unnecessary electoral boundary adjustments in provinces 
where shifts of population do not require them (addressed in amendments 
number 2, 3, 5, 6(<I>b</I>)(i) and 7);</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) the clear acceptance of the non-partisan status of members of commissions 
through the provision of parliamentary oversight of appointments (addressed 
by amendments number 4(<I>b</I>) and 4(<I>c</I>));</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) the retention of the definition of ``community of interest'' developed on a 
non-partisan basis by currently serving elected representatives, through a 
consensus of all parties, in the House of Commons Standing Committee rather 
than the substitution of another definition (addressed by amendment number 
6(<I>b</I>)(ii)).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader </B><B>of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to support the motion proposed by 
the government House leader in respect of the Senate 
amendments to Bill C-69.
<P>
	The motion before the House accepts one of the amendments 
proposed by the Senate to this bill and rejects the other 
amendments proposed.
<P>
	I am pleased to support the motion before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, under a little 
used section on Private Members' Business, could the Speaker 
indicate whether that private members' motion will be within 
the closing session of the next seven days.
<P>
<B>(2050 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In response to the question of order it is the 
responsibility of the Speaker to reschedule this private 
member's day within the next 10 days.
<P>
	It is my intention to try to reschedule it before the end of this 
session. This session is scheduled to finish in the next seven 
days and I will attempt to put it on there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to assist you in 
rescheduling it at 3.30 this morning.
<P>
	I want to go ahead with the speech I have before me. This is an 
attempt to obstruct my speech and I hope the Chair will put a 
short end to it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, in light of 
the proceedings earlier this evening it might be wise to now 
move that the House do now adjourn.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
has the floor and the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster cannot move that motion as a point 
of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government fulfilled its 
obligation in respect of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act when it appointed a committee to draft and bring in a bill to 
the House. The procedure and House affairs committee, which I 
have the honour to chair, worked for a considerable period of 
time drafting and bringing in amendments to the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act. In most cases the amendments 
were agreeable to all the members on the committee.
<P>
	There were only a couple of items on which there was 
disagreement. I am sure that will be reflected in the speeches 
from the other parties in the course of the evening. Basically 
there was substantial agreement on the elements of the bill.
<P>
	The end result of the work the committee did was to give 
Canadians a more open, transparent and effective system of 
readjusting electoral boundaries. The bill which was brought to 
the House by the government based on the committee report and 
in substantial compliance with the committee report was 
adopted by the House following on that committee's work.
<P>
	In other words, there had been consensus at the beginning. 
There was consensus basically all the way through, although I 
respect the fact the opposition parties voted against the bill in 
the end for two different reasons. One was unconnected with the 
bill and condemned the bill for something it did not contain. The 
other was due to disagreement with one of the provisions in the 
bill which carried on a provision from the previous law that 
allowed for ridings that vary by more than 25 per cent from the 
provincial quotient.
<P>
	As I have indicated, the motion proposed by the government 
House leader agrees with Senate amendment 4(a) which would 
add a requirement to the law that members of a boundaries 
commission be resident in the province for which the 
commission is established. That was omitted from the bill 
largely by oversight on the part of the committee and we are 
happy to agree with the Senate that the provision could be fixed. 
I acknowledge the oversight on the part of the standing 
committee and I am glad to see it corrected by this amendment.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	However, the other amendments proposed by the Senate in my 
submission are unacceptable because they would repeal the 
most important innovations set out in Bill C-69, each of which 
was supported by at least two of the parties in the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs when introduced 
and considered in that committee.
<P>
	These amendments therefore upset the balance struck by the 
standing committee in improving the system for electoral 
boundaries and in my view should therefore be rejected.
<P>
	I respectfully disagree with Amendments Nos. 1 and 6(a) to 
reduce the maximum deviation from the electoral quota for a 
province from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. This quota was agreed 
on after extensive discussion, after extensive hearings in the 
committee and I admit over the objections of the Reform Party 
which wanted to reduce the quota to 15 per cent. There is a 
genuine difference of opinion on that. Members of the Reform 
Party will likely maintain that difference of opinion tonight.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13855"> 13855 </A></B>
<P>
	Members of the Bloc and members of the Liberal Party are 
both of the view that in a country as large and as geographically 
diverse as Canada limiting the boundaries to 15 per cent of the 
provincial quotient, a deviation of 15 per cent either way, would 
be too restrictive and might result in serious inequities, leaving 
members to represent enormous ridings scattered over a vast 
distance with very few people in them but obviously trying to 
make up for the lack of population by adding to those ridings 
in a very substantial way.
<P>
	We do not feel the system in the past has worked that badly. 
The most recent set of commissions has done a poor job and we 
have come up with a new and better way of appointing of those 
commissions and in our view a better way of having the 
commissions work where there is public input early in the 
process. That was a provision agreed on by all parties in the 
committee.
<P>
	I also disagree with proposed Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 5, 
6(b)(i) and 7 which would repeal the provisions that would avoid 
unnecessary electoral boundaries readjustments in provinces 
where shifts in population did not require them. Again, this set 
of provisions was agreed to by all parties.
<P>
	Why would we spend money on having an electoral 
redistribution in a province when there has been no significant 
change in the population, no new seats in the province and the 
boundaries are more than adequate? Yet the committee formed 
that view very strongly. We put this in the bill. The Senate has 
decided in its view this should come out. We disagreed with that 
and are requesting the Senate simply acknowledge the House is 
insisting on these amendments and accept that we disagree and 
allow the bill to proceed.
<P>
	Amendments Nos. 4(b) and (c) which in my view are 
unacceptable eliminate the provision of parliamentary oversight 
of appointments to electoral boundaries commissions. The 
appointment process in our view had flaws. The committee 
agreed on this. After extensive discussion in committee we 
agreed on this new appointment procedure.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, under the procedure in the bill you have the right 
to make nominations of persons to act as commissioners. Those 
names are to be submitted to the House of Commons and will be 
considered here. If members object motions can be moved that if 
carried could result in your having to come up with a new 
appointment. We think that is a fair and reasonable way to 
proceed. We supported it. The House supported at the time the 
bill came here and we hope it will be supported in the Senate 
later.
<P>
	Also we disagree with Amendment No. 6(b)(i) which would 
redefine community of interest by incorporating the definition 
recommended by the royal commission on electoral reform and 
party financing. I think all members of the committee 
considered whether to adopt that definition. The definition was 
agreed on after extensive  discussion among all members of the 
committee, and there was substantial agreement on it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-69 was a good agreement, approved by all committee 
members on almost all points. There are, however, some clauses 
in the bill that are not to everyone's liking.
<P>
	The member for Bellechasse, who is here now, did not agree 
with the bill, because he felt certain provisions were not 
included. He will probably talk about them in his speech. That is 
fine, but unfortunately everybody cannot have everything they 
want in the bill.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	We have before us a fine bill, and I hope that all the members 
here will support the motion currently before the House 
proposed by the government House leader to send these 
amendments and the wishes of the House to the Senate for its 
consideration and quick adoption of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> No, Mr. Speaker, 
I am not rising to move that the House do now adjourn but to 
speak to the substantive motion addressed by the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	First of all, I may say it is rather ironic that a House whose 
members are appointed by the governor in council, by cabinet, 
to all intents and purposes, to sit until the age of 75 tries to teach 
us a thing or two about democracy in connection with such basic 
issues as electoral boundaries readjustment.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands is listening carefully to my speech, as is the hon. 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. We have 
worked very hard without a hint of partisanship. I would also 
like to mention the hon. member for Cochrane-Superior who 
showed a great interest in this bill. The hon. member was 
instrumental in having the bill drafted in its present form, 
especially one specific point that I will discuss later on, and I am 
referring to the 25 per cent deviation from the electoral quota.
<P>
	I said earlier that the non-elected House, the Canadian 
Senate, wants to teach us a lesson about democracy, and I think 
there is something fundamentally wrong with this Parliament. It 
should be up to us to say that the other House should either cease 
to exist and be abolished or its members should be elected, one 
or the other.
<P>
	In any case, the process started a long time ago with Bill C-18 
which suspended for a certain period of time the work of 
commissions which had already been appointed until June this 
year so we are getting close to the deadline, and the Committee 
of the House on Procedure and House Affairs was subsequently 
instructed to draft a bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13856"> 13856 </A></B>
<P>
	Strictly speaking, it is not a government bill, although it was 
tabled on behalf of the Government House Leader. This is a bill 
that was drafted in committee, before the Standing Committee 
of the House on Procedure and House Affairs, as I said before.
<P>
	There was a very broad consensus among committee members 
on most clauses. In fact, there were far more items on which we 
agreed than on which we disagreed.
<P>
	Unfortunately, there was one item on which we could not 
agree and since it was a fundamental rule, the crux of the whole 
debate, this meant that the official opposition, the Bloc 
Quebecois, could not vote for Bill C-69 on third reading. This 
item was the subject of a motion that I tabled in this House and 
that was defeated, a motion that guaranteed Quebec a minimum 
representation rate of 25 per cent, irrespective of its population 
at the time of the census.
<P>
	We hope we will never have to apply this minimum guarantee, 
because in the next federal election, I assume or in any case I 
hope we will then be living within a new Quebec-Canada 
partnership so that this legislation would not apply to Quebec, 
which will have its own legislation that will apply to Quebec's 
125 ridings.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	This basic characteristic of holding 25 per cent of the seats 
was, and still is, related to the fundamental notion that Canada 
has two founding peoples, not equal in numbers but equal in 
rights. A pact, an agreement, was made in 1867 between two 
nations: the anglophone nation and the francophone nation.
<P>
	They decided to pool certain things to be managed by this 
Parliament and they decided to grant the legislatures of the 
founding provinces, and those which subsequently joined 
confederation, specific jurisdictions which made them 
autonomous and sovereign states, when it came to their spheres 
of jurisdiction. Did they ever fool us in 1867. And I use the 
polite term, because I cannot use any other in this House.
<P>
	Today, the interpretation of events given by our Reform 
colleagues, in particular the hon. members for Calgary West and 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, has made us realize that the Canada 
of today is no longer a bicultural and biethnic country, but a 
multicultural and multiethnic one: this is not the Canada of 
1867, the one in which our fathers, mothers, grandfathers, 
grandmothers and ancestors so strongly believed.
<P>
	In 1965, the premier, Daniel Johnson Sr., said that Canada 
will be made up of two nations and two cultures or it will cease 
to exist. We have already seen this in practice, the proof. Just 
look at what is happening today. This is what Mr. Johnson said in 
1965, Sir George-Étienne Cartier said in 1867, Louis Riel said 
after him, and Franco-Ontarians were saying at the time that 
they were making demands-remember Regulation 17 in 
Ontario- at the time that they were pursuing the issue of having 
to fund public schools and fund their own private schools, 
because public funding for their schools was  dropped 
altogether. These are the kinds of things that tend to be forgotten 
in this country.
<P>
	There is a tendency to forget the heroic battles led not only by 
francophones in Quebec, but by francophones outside it and by 
Acadians to protect their rights. These were major battles. The 
fight against the Greenway laws in Manitoba. From 1889 on, the 
rights of francophones were suspended in Manitoba and they 
were only restored by the Supreme Court almost 100 years later.
<P>
	Over the past 100 years in Manitoba, the percentage of 
francophones has gone from 50 per cent, one in every two 
Manitobans was francophone, to 4 per cent. That is the result of 
having no constitutional guarantees.
<P>
	If only we had known. We had no way of knowing or those 
who should have seen it coming did not. And now we are faced 
with a situation where the survival of francophone communities, 
in particular outside Quebec, is a daily struggle. Even the 
survival of the francophone community in Quebec is a weighty 
issue, and we have to deal with it every day because each new 
day brings with it new menaces.
<P>
	Do not forget that we only represent two per cent of the 
population on the North American continent. Therefore, we 
should be equipped with some legal protection in our battle as 
North American francophones. Where were those who, in the 
Senate, claimed to have promoted a guarantee of 25 per cent for 
Quebec?
<P>
	Where was the senator for Stadacona, the one who claimed to 
have promoted protection of 25 per cent of seats for Quebec? 
Where was the senator for Lasalle, the one who claimed that 
Trudeau had made an offer that Quebec had rejected?
<P>
	There is nothing in the Senate's report about a guarantee of 25 
per cent. The Senate's greatest omission is to have failed to 
consider the issue of representation for Quebec and probably 
francophone communities as well, to ensure a guaranteed 
minimum in this House.
<P>
	We must not forget that other provinces such as Prince 
Edward Island and New Brunswick have, because of the 
senatorial provision of 1915, a constitutional guarantee of never 
having fewer members in this House than they have senators in 
the Senate.
<P>
	Quebec does not have this guarantee. The national home of 
the francophone people in Canada has no guaranteed 
representation in this House.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	Some passages in Canada's history have been forgotten. 
Oddly enough, the forgotten bits almost always have to do with 
one party. I think that we are at the point where, to solve this 
puzzle, we are going to have to cut our losses and define what 
should have been defined in 1867, go back to the real spirit of the 
founding fathers, which was to see the two nations work 
together, as equals, neighbours and partners.
<P>

<B><A NAME="13857"> 13857 </A></B>
<P>
	The Senate's motions in amendment are totally unacceptable, 
except for one, which merely corrects a technical error we 
made. The first amendment proposes reducing the allowable 
variation from the provincial quota from 25 per cent to 15 per 
cent. For Quebec, which, like Ontario by the way, has no 
constitutional guarantee as I mentioned earlier-we think about 
franco-Ontarians who are scattered across a large area and have 
no more protection than Quebecers at that level-reducing the 
allowable variation from the quota from 25 per cent to 15 per 
cent directly imperils the ridings in the Gaspé Peninsula and 
the Lower St. Lawrence.
<P>
	I can hear behind me my colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, who represents a riding that 
would be directly affected if the allowable variation from the 
quota were reduced to 15 per cent from 25 per cent. The only 
way it would be possible to guarantee adequate representation 
would be to eat into the metropolitan region of Montreal, to ask 
ridings in that area, Montérégie and the Laurentides to have 125 
per cent representation everywhere. Given the territory, given 
the uniqueness of the people there, given the fact that the 
Magdalen Islands are stranded out in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 
there is no way we will be able to maintain adequate 
representation in these regions if we have to accept that the 
allowable variation from the quota will be reduced from 25 per 
cent to 15 per cent.
<P>
	It would also be impossible to keep the riding of 
Manicouagan, which stretches far to the north and we would be 
putting at risk ridings like Abitibi, at least in the future-not 
with the current figures but in coming censuses, if this law were 
to apply in Quebec.
<P>
	The same reasoning would certainly apply regarding the 
boundaries which would be imposed in Ontario's north.
<P>
	I believe that by maintaining the 25 per cent variation which 
has been the standard for the past 30 years, ever since the first 
legislation on electoral boundaries readjustment, we have kept a 
very sensible provision on the books that allows for making 
adjustments where necessary.
<P>
	The 25 per cent variation reflects the situation in rural 
Canada. The fact is that in Quebec and Canada we have a number 
of cities with a high population density because of developments 
that have taken place during the past fifty years. However, rural 
Canada, which in the process lost some of its population, must 
maintain a strong and powerful voice in this House.
<P>
	In the past few days, and I do not have to elaborate, we have 
seen the effects of reduced rural representation in this House. 
Some votes would probably have been different if rural areas 
had been represented as they were 30 years ago in the House of 
Commons, when the regions were far better represented.
<P>
	Obviously, we cannot support the first amendment proposed 
by the Senate. Therefore I suggest retention of the variation of 
up to 25 per cent from the electoral quota of the province when 
establishing electoral boundaries.
<P>
	The Senate also suggests deleting provisions that would allow 
20 members of this House to challenge appointments made by 
the Speaker of the House to provincial commissions instructed 
to establish electoral boundaries.
<P>
	I believe this provision is a guarantee that will simply 
encourage the Speaker to conduct consultations prior to these 
appointments with the various political parties recognized in 
this House.
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	I would be very surprised if appointments made by the 
Speaker of the House following consultations with the 
recognized parties were subsequently criticized by members. I 
think it is quite simply a precaution to ensure that the process 
follows normal procedure.
<P>
	So the Senate is asking us to remove this provision. The 
non-elected House is saying: ``You who have been elected by 
the people do not even have the right to discuss who will sit on 
provincial commissions and who will be appointed by your 
Speaker''. Let them get on with their own rules, but they better 
not meddle with ours.
<P>
	If they want to discuss, we will discuss. We will not, however, 
be told how to behave by the non-elected House, by the 
honourable senators, who do not have to put their head on the 
chopping block every five years, like the members of this 
House, and who are not accountable for their actions to the 
public, who are accountable to no one. We will also not support 
the Senate's proposal with respect to allowing this House to 
overturn an appointment made by its Speaker.
<P>
	The Senate is also proposing that the provisions providing 
exceptions to the establishment of a commission after a 
decennial census be removed. The best example in this regard is 
the Province of Newfoundland and the region of Labrador. The 
latest census reported a change of fewer than 1,000 persons over 
the previous one, if memory serves me, in Newfoundland and 
Labrador. However, a provincial commission was set up and it 
turned the whole electoral map upside down.
<P>
	We had provided, in Bill C-69, that no commission would be 
set up in such a situation. We can see that the population did not 
change and that the population did not shift from one region to 
another, and so no commission is set up. Taxpayers' money is 
saved, and people continue to feel they belong to their region. 
The people of St. John's, Newfoundland, know that they are 
going to vote in St. John's East or St. John's West or some other 
riding- Bonavista, for example-it does not matter, the feeling 
of belonging remains. So, why set something in motion when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13858"> 13858 </A></B>
<P>
there is no need to? We will  also oppose the motion the Senate is 
sending us to this amendment.
<P>
	We are also asked to eliminate the discretionary power of the 
provincial commissions to reject changes to the electoral map if 
these changes are not significant enough. Excessive change 
must be avoided. Many, I would say, even, almost all, members 
appearing before the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs in June and July of last year, made the same 
complaint, regardless of their political affiliation, with a few 
exceptions among Reform Party members, who wanted to 
muddle things even more.
<P>
	But the Liberal and Bloc members who appeared before us all 
shared the same concern. They wanted to retain this sense of 
belonging, so that someone who lives in Lachine, for instance, 
will not be in one riding for one election, in another riding for 
the following election, and goodness only knows where for the 
provincial election in between. This was one of the concerns 
expressed by all the members who appeared before the 
committee.
<P>
	Therefore, the provincial commissions should, of course, 
have discretion to correct certain small problems that may arise 
because there is a realization that, at a given time, a 
municipality has closer ties with a nearby town or, 
economically, leans in a particular direction. The commissions 
should be able to make these small changes, but not to turn 
everything upside down if there is no need to. Here, as well, 
moderation is preferable.
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	The Senate is also proposing that the notion of community of 
interest be redefined. In clause 19(5) of the bill we set out the 
criterion of community of interest as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-``community of interest'' includes such factors as the economy, existing or 
traditional boundaries of electoral districts, the urban or rural characteristics of 
a territory, the boundaries of municipalities and Indian reserves, natural 
boundaries and access to means of communication and transport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The amendment proposed by the Senate would make 
community of interest the basic criterion from which all 
subsequent changes would flow.
<P>
	Let us remember that the amendment which the Senate is 
proposing and on the basis of which we would have to decide 
electoral boundaries must be read with the other amendment 
being proposed by the Senate, which is to reduce the variation 
from the quota from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, in other words a 
minimum variation, with community of interest as the basic 
criterion. The criterion of community of interest is extremely 
important, except that it comes up against the mathematical wall 
of the 15 per cent deviation. They cannot seriously be telling us 
that the boundaries will be defined on the basis of community of 
interest, having just said that the variation is only 15 per cent, 
because the criterion of community of interest is subordinate to 
the 15 per cent variation which the Senate is also proposing.
<P>
	Therefore, not only am I of the opinion that we must not 
change our definition of the criterion of the community of 
interest, but that we also have to retain a variation of 25 per cent 
from the electoral quota of each province in order for the two 
criteria to have a real impact in practice. The constituents of 
Bellechasse, my riding, should know what to expect from one 
election to the next, which parish could become part of the 
riding and which one could cease to be, what minor or major 
adjustments could be made to take demographics into 
consideration, but still take into consideration the community of 
interest.
<P>
	This community of interest is not an abstract notion, it is a 
notion that can be seen in action. And the people in the best 
position to define communities of interest, all partisan politics 
aside, are probably the hon. members of this House who, each 
day, each week or each month, depending on the distance they 
have to go, travel the roads of their ridings. And when there are 
no roads, they take the plane, or use a helicopter, sometimes 
even a snowmobile or a dog sled-whatever means of 
transportation is available.
<P>
	Therefore, who is in the best position to define a community 
of interest? I will not pass judgment on my own case, but, take 
the hon. member for Cochrane-Superior, whose riding is huge, 
for example. Is it he who is in the best position to talk about the 
community of interest in Cochrane-Superior and to tell us that 
the town of Kapuskasing is the community of interest for such 
and such a region or is it a senator from Ontario representing this 
region who is in the best position to talk to us about it? There can 
be only one answer: the representatives elected by the public, 
whose basic mandate is to defend the interests of all of their 
voters, of everyone who voted for them, of course, but also the 
interests of everyone, of everyone who voted against them, of 
everyone who did not vote or have the right to vote, because MPs 
basically are the representatives of everyone who lives in the 
territory they represent. What an important role! A role which 
must not be subordinate to the interests of a minority appointed 
to the other place, most of whom are there for purely political 
reasons and were either defeated or were never successful in 
getting elected in general elections.
<P>
	It takes some nerve to come and propose amendments on 
behalf of people who were defeated, people who, with a few 
notable exceptions, just cannot get elected.
<P>
	It is high time we slashed government spending, and one of 
our first decisions should be to suspend the other House for a 
time, perhaps five years, to find out whether we really miss it. 
This could be in the form of a constitutional amendment or we 
could agree to get rid of the Senate for five years. If we really 
need it, nature, like Parliament, abhors a vacuum. We will create 
a new Senate and make new appointments according to a system 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13859"> 13859 </A></B>
<P>
to be determined by the Canadian people, by the members of the 
other House.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	But for the time being, we should get rid of the surplus. Let us 
have a garage sale but keep the main House, the House of 
Commons. We represent the people, and we are elected by 
universal suffrage. The rule should be that from the president of 
the largest mining company down to the worker doing the 
simplest tasks, everyone has the same right to vote so everyone 
should have the same access to his member of Parliament. The 
House is what counts.
<P>
	In Canada there is a consensus on at least one thing: there is 
one House too many at the federal level, and it is certainly not 
the House of Commons where people's elected representatives 
speak on behalf of the people, but the Senate. The problem is to 
decide whether we should reform the Senate or get rid of it. I 
suggest getting rid of it for five years.
<P>
	The Senate does have its uses, however. It pointed out that we 
had overlooked a clause that would provide that commissioners 
should reside in the province for which they were appointed. 
That is what the Senate pointed out to us. This from 
parliamentarians who in most cases do not even have an office in 
the senatorial district they happen to represent.
<P>
	A legal adviser earning a modest salary could have done this. 
Our employees are not overpaid, and members of the House are 
not overpaid either for the work they do. If they are, it will be up 
to the voters to determine whether the member who represents 
them is getting too much money for the kind of work he does. 
That is up to the electorate in a general election.
<P>
	One or two legal advisers could have pointed out that the 
clause was missing. We do not need a House with 104 
individuals and their staff, their operating budgets and all the 
expense and waste of time that entails. How many bills are 
languishing before the other House right now?
<P>
	The bill concerning Pearson Airport has been lying around for 
quite some time. It was passed in this House when the 
government first came to power, by a House of Commons that 
had just been elected, and then put on hold by the other House.
<P>
	The same thing happened to Bill C-69. In this case, it is even 
worse because Bill C-69, which concerns electoral boundaries 
readjustment, is not a case of gerrymandering and is not 
intended to give special privileges to parliamentarians. Bill 
C-69 met with a very broad consensus on its wording, with the 
notable exception of the request for a minimum of 25 per cent of 
the seats for Quebec. We will have a chance to get back to this 
issue in the debate that will take place this fall in Quebec. In our 
proposal for partnership to be extended to Canada, we will 
suggest a number of institutions where we will have a 
representation rate of 25 per cent.
<P>
	That being said, as the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands indicated when he spoke for the government, we will 
only support the Senate motion that would make it mandatory 
for a commissioner appointed for the purpose of electoral 
boundaries adjustment to reside in the province for which he or 
she is appointed.
<P>
	I hope that when it comes to a vote, the Senate will sit up and 
take notice and stop these delaying tactics that are useless, futile 
and cost money. They prevent us from allowing electoral 
boundaries readjustment to take its course and, I also hope that 
these commissions can be set up again so that hon. members and 
the public will be able to resume the process under the rules 
established by Bill C-69, and we will have a balanced electoral 
map for the next general election, in which I do not hope to 
participate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Bill C-69 rings a familiar bell. It was Yogi Berra 
who said it was déjà vu all over again.
<P>
	This issue of electoral boundaries readjustment will not go 
away. Before we get into the amendments that have been 
proposed by the Senate to deal with Bill C-69, we should 
quickly review the chronology of events which have led us to 
today when we are dealing with this bill yet again.
<P>
<B>(2130 ) </B>
<P>
	I first became aware of some perceived problems with the 
electoral boundaries readjustment process when the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands cornered me one evening 
and said: ``We have a real problem with the new electoral maps 
that are being presented by the electoral boundaries 
commissions. They are just incompetent. They are doing a 
terrible job. The boundaries are all drawn in the wrong places. 
They have made some grave errors and our caucus feels we have 
to do something about it. We can't put up with this type of 
incompetence.'' He suggested that a major review of the whole 
process needed to be undertaken.
<P>
	This was shortly after we had launched out on this first 
session of the 35th Parliament. In fact you could say that those 
of us who are newly elected were launched from the electoral 
womb out into the cold, cruel world. It seemed like a number of 
Liberal MPs were rather unhappy with the uncomfortable 
climate they found themselves in. They were not prepared for 
the political realities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13860"> 13860 </A></B>
<P>
	I think there was a little revolt in the Liberal caucus, which 
I suspect was mainly composed of Ontario members of 
Parliament, and probably some Atlantic Canada members as 
well, who found that their boundaries were redrawn and that 
those people who had elected them and the organizations that 
had won the election for them had suddenly become irrelevant. 
They were concerned. They were inexperienced 
parliamentarians, many were inexperienced politicians, and 
they were not able to cope with the prospect of change.
<P>
	With this revolt in the Liberal caucus the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands came with all of this concern. We asked 
what the problems were. When it came down to brass tacks it 
was not so much the system that was the problem but the 
outcome of that system with which they were unhappy. They felt 
the way to solve the problem was to pretend it never happened, 
strike new commissions all across Canada and let them redraw 
the boundaries in a way the Liberal government might find more 
acceptable. They were quite certain they would be able to draft 
some master plan, some revolutionary new boundary 
readjustment plan that would solve their problems.
<P>
	In March 1994 the Liberals introduced Bill C-18. Not 
surprisingly, they time allocated the bill. We thought that was 
extremely unusual. What was the emergency? After all, we had 
just been elected and they were time allocating this Bill C-18 to 
suspend the electoral boundaries process so they could cook up 
some new and wonderful scheme to readjust our electoral 
boundaries.
<P>
	We have seen time allocation and closure imposed on this 
House many times. We should have know then what was 
coming, that this government is not prepared to deal with reality. 
It finds unacceptable any opposition whatsoever and uses its 
clout and the might of its majority to ram things through the 
House with very little regard to other members.
<P>
	After the government had suspended the process it had to 
launch a new process, so it introduced a motion to this House, 
Motion No. 10. I have an Order Paper from Tuesday, April 19, 
which has Motion No. 10 in it. For the record I will read the 
motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs be instructed 
to prepare and bring in a bill, in accordance with Standing Order 68(5), 
respecting the system of readjusting the boundaries of electoral districts for the 
House of Commons by Electoral Boundaries Commissions, and, in preparing 
the said bill, the committee be instructed to consider, among other related 
matters, the general operation over the past thirty years of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act, including:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) an assessment of whether there should be a continual increase in the number 
of Members of the House of Commons after each census, as now provided in 
section 51 of the Constitution Act;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will break there for one minute and review what happened 
with regard to that instruction put forward in Motion No. 10.
<P>
	We considered the expansion of the House that is called for 
under the existing provisions of the electoral act and the 
Constitution of the country. Our seats currently are 295. Mr. 
Speaker, as you can tell, we are pretty well stretched to the 
maximum, but we are going to have to find room for six more 
seats in this House. It seems very odd that we would want to be 
adding seats to this House when the trend in Canada is to go the 
other way.
<P>
	Currently in my province of Saskatchewan a provincial 
election is being fought, and it is being fought for fewer seats 
than in the last election. In 1991, 66 seats were available for the 
taking in the election. In this current campaign only 58 seats are 
available to be contested.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	I understand there was an election in Ontario the other day. 
We do not hear too much about that election from members on 
the other side, but I happen to know that the successful 
campaigners were also campaigning for a reduction in the size 
of the Ontario legislature. They wanted to see fewer seats in 
Queen's Park, not more. And they won. I think they wanted to 
reduce the seats by something like 30 per cent, if I am not 
mistaken.
<P>
	However, do the Liberals in Ottawa, listen to the Canadian 
public? Do they think Canadians want smaller government or 
less government? Did they take it seriously when this motion 
was drafted that stated we should look at reducing the size of the 
House or freezing the number of seats so it could not expand? 
Not on your life, Mr. Speaker. They thought they had it made. 
They thought they were in lotus land and that no one was going 
to take away any of their seats. They refused to consider 
reducing the number of seats in this House of Commons. They 
wanted it the way it was. In fact they wanted more seats. They 
refused to do anything that would keep this House from 
expanding. It would have to go on to 301 seats, and in future 
years, after censuses, they would see even more seats added to 
this House.
<P>
	That was the first point in Motion No. 10, to deal with 
freezing the size of the House and reducing the number of seats 
in the House, but to no avail.
<P>
	The second point in Motion No. 10, point (b), states: ``A 
review of the adequacy of the present method of selection of 
members of the Electoral Boundaries Commissions''. Now 
these commissions were supposed to be terrible. They had done 
a terrible job, so we really had to revolutionize the way we 
structure these committees and the way they choose these 
commissions.
<P>
	The Liberals scratched their heads and tried to think of ways 
in which they could recraft the appointment of these 
commissions. They tried to think of ways in which they could 
restruc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13861"> 13861 </A></B>
<P>
ture them. It was almost to no avail. There was a little tinkering 
around the edges and a few little new wrinkles were put into the 
process. But if we look at Bill C-69, the bill we are debating 
here tonight, we will see that the composition of the 
commissions and  almost every aspect of the commissions is 
very similar to what was in place before.
<P>
	We have to wonder about the concerns the government 
expressed in the first place about the way in which the 
commissions were chosen or appointed and the way they were to 
function.
<P>
	We go on to point (c). Point (c) of Motion No. 10 states: ``A 
review of the rules governing the powers and methods of 
proceedings of Electoral Boundaries Commissions, including 
whether these commissions ought to commence their work on 
the basis of making necessary alterations to the boundaries of 
existing electoral districts wherever possible''.
<P>
	I will admit that there have been some improvements in this 
area. The fact that there have been some improvements does not 
justify suspending the process, wasting $5 million of taxpayers' 
money and getting ourselves into the bind we now find ourselves 
in, still dealing with Bill C-69.
<P>
	Those improvements could have been introduced without 
suspending the process and they would have come into play 
when the next boundary readjustment took place. While this is 
one small reward for the fruit of our labour, it certainly was not 
justification for all the pain this House has had to go through, the 
procedure and House affairs committee has had to go through, 
and those Liberal MPs who were so concerned about the process 
have had to go through.
<P>
	Point (d) in Motion No. 10 states: ``A review of the time and 
nature of involvement of the public and the House of Commons 
in the work of the Electoral Boundaries Commissions''. Here 
again some minor changes were made. Hopefully they will be 
improvements. They were certainly ideas or proposals the 
members of the Reform Party in the procedure and House affairs 
committee saw as small improvements. Again, this certainly 
was not justification for the suspension of the process and for 
the dilemma we now find ourselves in, having to deal with Bill 
C-69 once again.
<P>
	When I began my speech tonight I talked about this all 
beginning before March 1994 when a panicked member for 
Kingston and the Islands said: ``Disaster has struck. The sky is 
falling. Our electoral process has broken down and it is 
irreparable. We have to fix it.''
<P>
	The Liberals introduced Motion No. 10 on April 19, 1994, and 
with very little improvement over what we had prior to that.
<P>
<B>(2140 ) </B>
<P>
	What did we do? Like all good parliamentary committees, we 
brought in witnesses. Sometimes the government agrees to bring 
in witnesses and sometimes it does not. If it is dealing with 
electoral boundaries, which affects MPs, it is very important 
that members of Parliament be allowed to appear as witnesses 
before the committee. It is imperative. No MP should be denied 
the right to appear before the procedure and House affairs 
committee. However, if it happens to be MPs' pensions, 
members of Parliament have no business appearing before the 
procedure and House affairs committee. They were refused the 
right to appear before the committee. The Liberals found this 
issue very embarrassing. We have to question the motives of the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	However, we had members of Parliament appear before the 
committee. We also had expert witnesses who appeared before 
the procedure and House affairs committee. They told us that we 
have one of the best processes in the world. We talked about 
what they did in Australia, what they did in Europe, and how the 
process works in the United States.
<P>
	When we started to draft Bill C-69 on the basis of the 
information from the witnesses, we made very few changes. 
Commissions are still composed of three members. One is still 
appointed, the chief justice of the province, and two are selected 
by the Speaker. There are a few new wrinkles and a little more 
consultation in the process. That is fine, those are small 
improvements. But again, there is absolutely no reason to 
suspend the process, as was the case in Bill C-18.
<P>
	We heard the witnesses and we met with the government 
House leader, who appeared as a witness before the committee, 
and then we began going through the clause by clause study of 
the bill. We made some changes and achieved some 
improvements. We found that during our initial discussions with 
Liberal members on key issues of the legislation there was 
co-operation and often agreement.
<P>
	I remember the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
telling me: ``I think 15 per cent variable quotient is superior to 
25 per cent. I agree with you absolutely.'' However, as we got 
near the end of the crafting stage of the bill suddenly 15 per cent 
was just impossible. ``It is unacceptable to my members'', he 
said. He said that it had to be 25 per cent, that it just would not 
fly if it was 15 per cent. Suddenly the members in the committee 
who had been saying yes, it is reasonable to have a 15 per cent 
variable quotient, withdrew that support and went back to the 
comfortable old familiar 25 per cent variable quotient. Here we 
are in Canada, in 1995, a modern, highly educated, highly 
developed country, and we have to stay in the dark ages; we have 
to stay in the days of yore and allow for a wide variant of at least 
25 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13862"> 13862 </A></B>
<P>
	We met with Elections Canada officials and they were 
extremely helpful. They helped us with the technical 
components of the bill and they provided resources that helped 
us in the crafting of the bill.
<P>
	While the Liberals were inflexible on key principles such as 
the schedule and the variable quotient, and to a degree on the 
communities of interest, although we were able to make some 
small improvements there, this bill was passed here in the House 
of Commons earlier this year and sent off to the Senate.
<P>
	I should backtrack for a minute and talk about the Liberal 
backbenchers who came to appear before the procedure and 
House affairs committee. They were mainly rural members and 
members from large, growing, urban areas. It was quite 
interesting to watch the rural members saying ``We want to 
make sure the bill is drafted in such a way that our already very 
large rural ridings will not be made any larger, so that in areas 
like northern Ontario, where we have few rural ridings, we will 
not lose some of those and have even fewer rural ridings and 
more urban ridings''. They were very concerned about that. The 
Liberal brass, the chairman of the procedure and House affairs 
committee and other Liberals said ``Don't worry. Everything 
will be fine. We will leave the 25 per cent variable in there and 
you will be all right.''
<P>
	The members from the large urban ridings came before the 
committee and said ``We are very concerned. Our areas are 
growing so quickly and we are concerned that we will be 
representing 200,000 or 300,000 people, like we are now, if we 
do not have a readjustment process that takes into consideration 
the growth in our areas.''
<P>
	Now the Liberal brass had to worry about another problem. 
They said ``Don't worry, we have the 25 per cent variable 
quotient''. They said: ``We will make sure your ridings are 
smaller when we start out so there is room to grow and they will 
not become too large''. They are trying to pull the wool over 
their own members' eyes.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	It cannot be both ways. We cannot have the large growing 
urban ridings with a small population and maintain a smaller 
rural riding to keep from eliminating rural ridings. It is 
impossible. The Liberals try to say one thing to urban members 
and another thing to rural members to try and sneak this through 
all on the basis of a 25 per cent variable quotient. It reminds me 
of Liberal economics: It just does not work and it gets us into 
trouble. The government is going to pay a price for 
miscommunicating to its members.
<P>
	The bill was sent to the Senate without Reform approval. 
There were flaws. Principles were violated that should not be 
violated, principles of democracy and proper representation. 
But the government had its way and the bill was sent off to the 
Senate. Lo and behold, as our leader has aptly said, the place 
which is known more for its consideration of protocol, alcohol 
and geritol actually must have read some of the speeches the 
Reform  Party made with regard to the bill because it actually 
came up with a couple of conclusions that were the same as ours.
<P>
	We will be speaking to the amendments proposed by the 
Senate. The hon. member for Calgary West will deal with them 
in more detail.
<P>
	In my concluding remarks I will talk about what is going to 
happen if we expand the size of the House. What does bigger 
government mean for Canadians? I just got my statement of 
expenses, what it costs to keep me as an MP here in the House. 
We have the average as well, so we know these figures are 
similar for all members.
<P>
	Currently there are 295 members. The average travel cost of 
members of Parliament using the 64 point system is $32,885. If 
we add six more members as Bill C-69 recommends, the costs 
would add up to over $400,000 because there are telephone costs 
and other office costs that are not included in the MOBs. If we 
take the $66,000 it costs to keep each MP and multiply it by six, 
it comes to about $400,000. Then there is the MOB which is 
about $185,000 each. If we multiply that by six it adds up to 
approximately $11 million in additional costs. Then of course 
there are our salaries of approximately $64,000 which if 
multiplied by six comes up to $385,000. The expense allowance 
of $27,000 multiplied by six comes out to $160,000.
<P>
	Then there is the big one so many people have been talking 
about, the pension. Of course, Reform MPs will opt out of the 
pension plan. However if the impossible happened and the six 
new MPs were Liberals or Conservatives, and I hope that does 
not happen, or NDPers or members of the Bloc, we could look at 
about $1 million per MP for pension costs. That would be 
another $1.1 million.
<P>
	We are looking at about $20 million or $25 million just in the 
basic costs of more MPs in the House, not including the costs of 
handing out contracts if members of the House are trying to 
wheel and deal and get special deals for-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I find it curious 
that we are talking about costs and this is the same member of 
the same party who just took us through three hours of voting at 
$48,000 an hour when we could have done it in half an hour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I see by the clock that it is 9.50 
p.m. The House was scheduled to sit until 11.30 p.m. because of 
a special government order. Therefore this party has not cost the 
Canadian taxpayer one cent. We are taking democracy seriously.
<P>
	This means that the added costs of having extra members 
here-

<HR>
<B><A NAME="13863"> 13863 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, there would not have been a waste 
because there would have been more legislation put through the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Liberals' rationale is 
sometimes very hard to understand. They do not seem to think 
that debate and taking the votes seriously is important. They 
have become so arrogant on that side that they think just because 
they introduce a bill it should get speedy passage through this 
place without the cut and thrust of debate and serious 
consideration in voting.
<P>
<B>(2150 ) </B>
<P>
	There were a lot of members tonight who put great effort into 
some of the amendments on that bill. Members on that side 
would have quickly rushed through the process without allowing 
those members to stand and vote for the principles in which they 
believe. We know the Liberals do not believe in free votes 
because they sent talking points around saying that it was not a 
free vote. The Liberals want to bring six more MPs in here and 
tell them that they do not want free votes. The Liberals want 
them to be their little voting machine slaves. It is a shame and 
this House deserves much better than what the Liberal 
government is giving us.
<P>
	The government is supporting one of the amendments that 
came back from the Senate. I assure the House that it makes 
sense. We will be supporting it as well. That is the 
commissioners must be residents of the province which they are 
serving.
<P>
	There are some other changes. The Senate suggested that the 
variable quota be reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. Of 
course, the Senate heard us arguing a very good case here in the 
House and agreed with it. I believe there is one other amendment 
Reform can support. The other amendments we do not find 
acceptable.
<P>
	Part of the reason for the problem tonight was because the 
Liberal government mismanaged this evening's activities. We 
talked to the Liberals. We wanted to arrange the situation much 
better than we did, but they were not interested. It is very typical 
of what they have done with Bill C-69. They have mismanaged 
the process. They have set targets which they cannot reach. They 
have tried to pass legislation that is unacceptable to Canadians. 
It is receiving obstruction or meeting a roadblock in the Senate 
and with real justification.
<P>
	In wrapping up, I want to thank the Senate for sending this bill 
back. I certainly wish the Senate had been elected so that it 
would have more legitimacy. It could do this on a more regular 
basis. It could offer sober second thought, as it is supposed to, to 
legislation this House passes that is ill conceived and not of the 
quality Canadians deserve.
<P>
	The government has introduced a motion to send this bill back 
to the Senate with some amendments. These amendments do not 
concur with the wishes of the Reform Party because of the 
arguments that not only myself, but my colleague from Calgary 
West and perhaps some others will bring forward.
<P>
	I would like to move an amendment to the motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint Their Honours that this House 
agrees to Amendments Nos. 1, 4(a), 6(a) and 6(b)(i) made by the Senate to Bill 
C-69, an act to provide for the establishment of electoral boundary 
commissions and the readjustment of electoral boundaries, and this House 
disagrees with Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4(b), 4(c), 5, 6(b)(ii), 6(c) and 7.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair will reserve on the 
amendment to see if it is valid.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, who commented rather negatively 
on the reception given members by the standing committee, that 
it must have taught him a lot about Quebec. When I made my 
proposal on the ridings in eastern Quebec, he asked me whether 
it was to protect the ridings of real French Canadians, to use his 
expression. He felt that what was happening was self-serving. 
So, we had an opportunity to give him a good history and 
geography lesson and show him that there is also a strong 
anglophone minority in eastern Quebec and in the Gaspé.
<P>
<B>(2155) </B>
<P>
	We argued that the ridings should be left as they were. One of 
the reasons was in order to support this section of the 
population, which is both substantial and historically important. 
These people are the descendants of the loyalists, who came and 
settled of their own volition, particularly because they were 
fleeing a system they could not live with. I was quite surprised 
by the hon. member's ignorance of these facts. I hope he has 
learned an important lesson he will long remember, that there is 
an anglophone minority in Quebec and that it is scattered pretty 
well throughout the province, in the Gaspé-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are well served.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> They are indeed well served, as the member says. 
In the Gaspé, for example, the anglophone minority has 
college-level courses in English in Gaspé. For all of the Gaspé, 
there is a regular service and regular train service is maintained 
because, for one reason, many of these people have family in 
Ontario and elsewhere. They are very well served in many 
places.
<P>
	I particularly wanted the member to realize that not only 
improper things had happened in committee, that one person at 
least learned something.
<P>
	My question concerns another matter. Does the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster not think that the Senate could have 
considered many other aspects of the legislation? Including the 
fact that a little more than half the Reform members were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13864"> 13864 </A></B>
<P>
elected by fewer than 40 per cent of the electorate and that their 
democratic claims are not really very high.
<P>
	Could the Senate not have looked at that? While it was doing a 
superficial job, it could have gone a little further and looked to 
see if the members in the House representing the fewest voters 
were not members of the Reform Party?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question from 
my colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	I remember the procedure and House affairs committee 
meeting the hon. member is reflecting upon. That committee 
meeting was held just a few days after one of his colleagues 
made the suggestion that in the referendum we expect to be 
called this fall, if the separatists have the courage to call it this 
fall, only old stock Quebecers should have the franchise. Those 
are not my words. I am quoting his colleague. In other words, 
only old stock Quebecers should be allowed to vote. Those are 
not my thoughts and I would certainly not suggest that but one of 
his colleagues did.
<P>
	I saw some of the flip-flopping on the whole electoral 
boundaries issue. For a while the critic for the Bloc was in 
favour of the bill then later opposed it. He supported some parts 
of it and then was not sure.
<P>
	I began to wonder what was the rationale for the Bloc's 
arguments regarding Bill C-69. I asked the hon. member the 
reason. I asked whether the member was trying to design an 
electoral system in Quebec that would give the advantage to old 
stock Quebecers. That is a very honest question in light of the 
comments his colleagues made, not mine. I assure the hon. 
member that I am not as ignorant of the situation in Quebec as he 
might have this House believe.
<P>
	This goes to the more important issue of democratic 
principles. If his colleagues can suggest that democracy can be 
abused to the point where only certain people would have a 
franchise based on their ethnicity, that causes some concern as 
to whether or not they are legitimate spokespersons for the 
democratic process and the whole process of determining how 
the electoral boundaries readjustment act is crafted.
<P>
	The other very interesting question is, why would they even 
care? If they lose the referendum, they have lost the argument. 
That means Quebecers have decided they want to stay in 
Canada. I suspect that is what Quebecers will say when the 
referendum is held, if it is ever held. Why would they care? They 
have lost and would not represent Quebecers.
<P>
	On the other hand, if the separatists win the referendum in 
Quebec, they say they are going to leave, that they are going to 
separate. It is going to be unilateral and they are gone. Therefore 
what do they care about how Canada crafts the electoral 
boundaries readjustment act?
<P>
	It just shows how irrelevant the Bloc Quebecois is to 
legislation we are considering in this House. It shows how 
irrelevant the Bloc is as Canada's supposedly loyal official 
opposition.
<P>
<B>(2200 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has been speaking about keeping the 
number of seats as they are at present. Under such a proposition 
the province of Saskatchewan would lose about two seats, which 
would mean that almost 20 per cent of the seats in Saskatchewan 
would be lost.
<P>
	Does he agree that the province of Saskatchewan should lose 
almost 20 per cent of its representation in the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I touched on that in my 
speech. Saskatchewan is seeing a reduction in the total number 
of MLAs. They have gone from 66 to 58. The people in the 
province with whom I have talked applaud that. They want less 
government.
<P>
	If we start reducing the number of seats in the House of 
Commons the way we proposed in the procedure and House 
affairs committee, Ontario would lose a few seats as well. The 
province of Quebec would lose a few seats. Instead of B.C. 
increasing its number of seats it would lose a few and, yes, 
Saskatchewan would lose a few.
<P>
	We are fair minded in Saskatchewan. We know what we could 
lose. We believe in smaller government and we are prepared to 
accept it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment of the hon. House 
leader of the Reform Party is acceptable as to form.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, in replying to questions from my 
colleague, the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, the 
hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster suggested that I 
had acted inconsistently and without due consideration on the 
committee. I wish to point out that, throughout study of Bill 
C-69, I supported the proposals made, offering my critical 
analysis.
<P>
	It was not until report stage, in the House, that an amendment 
was proposed to guarantee Quebec 25 per cent of the seats. It 
was from that point on that I decided I could no longer support 
Bill C-69, not because it had been badly drafted, but because the 
issue of the 25 per cent guarantee for Quebec was not accepted 
by the majority of members in this House. I therefore voted 
against it at third reading.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13865"> 13865 </A></B>
<P>
	I wish to point out the facts, so as not to give rise to a debate 
as indicated in Beauchesne.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> I rise on the point of privilege, 
Mr. Speaker. If you were to review that point you would find 
there is no point of privilege. If you were to review the blues on 
the speech of the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster you 
would see that he merely stated a fact, that there were several 
changes of position by the Bloc Quebecois in the course of the 
electoral redistribution debate.
<P>
	The Bloc member is certainly capable of describing what was 
his motivation. I think you will see that the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster was simply establishing the fact he 
behaved that way, and in any case it is not a violation of his 
privileges to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want the House to know that 
I do not doubt the abilities of my colleague, the hon. member 
who served with me on the procedure and House affairs 
committee, but I brought into question why he and his party 
would change position on the electoral boundaries process from 
supporting the government to opposing the government. In fact I 
believe they changed critics. I think that is fair comment. I do 
not think I made any personal allegations against the member.
<P>
	If the House deems that I did, I would certainly withdraw 
them. It was certainly not my intent. I was trying to deal 
specifically with the positions taken by the Liberals and the Bloc 
Quebecois with regard to all the legislation including Bill C-69 
which we are debating this evening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues know very well that the 
Chair always takes questions of privilege seriously. I will 
therefore reread the blues and, if need be, communicate my 
decision to the House as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>(2205) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would find it interesting, as I begin my speech, to 
go over the reasons that led the Bloc Quebecois to intervene on 
several occasions during study of the bill on the readjustment of 
electoral boundaries.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was elected to defend the interests of 
Quebec, and in that sense, faced with this bill, it has shown its 
complete respect for democracy by making no assumptions 
about the choice Quebecers will make in the referendum. We 
wanted to ensure that, in the event that Quebecers voted no, they 
could continue to have the advantage of the best electoral map 
possible in their continued representation within the 
government of Canada. But I am sure they will decide to vote 
yes, for a number of other reasons.
<P>
	To answer the member's question, I have no doubt that 
Quebecers will decide to vote yes, for all sorts of historical 
reasons. For more than 125 years, and particularly over the last 
30 years, they have tried everything they could to change the 
system and they were never successful. The most recent 
example was here in this House, when the Liberal majority 
refused to give Quebec the 25 per cent minimum it was asking 
for. This 25 per cent minimum, already agreed to in the 
Charlottetown accord, would have been a demonstration of 
respect for Quebec, but the present Liberal government, under 
the direction of the Prime Minister we all know, refused to make 
this minimum gesture. This is one more reason, symbolic but 
practical, why Quebecers will opt for full control over their 
future development.
<P>
	I have spoken to this bill several times. I participated in 
debate at each reading and in committee, always to argue that 
rural regions must have adequate representation.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have never at any stage seen amendments 
that are as out of touch with Canadian reality as those put 
forward by the Senate. Before talking about the substance of the 
amendments, I wondered why the Senate was so out of touch 
with Canadian reality. Why do senators seem to be from Mars 
rather than from the country in which we live?
<P>
	My first thought was that it was certainly not for lack of travel 
since, as we know, our senators travel a great deal within 
Canada. They travel at taxpayers' expense on a regular basis. 
There must be a real reason why senators decided, among other 
things, to demand that the maximum variation from the quota, 
which makes it possible to determine the number of ridings, be 
reduced from 25 to 15 per cent.
<P>
	I found a reason which I think is significant: an amendment 
like this one will, somewhat insidiously, impose even greater 
restrictions on Quebec representation. In fact, if we look at the 
current electoral map as a whole, we see that there are 
constitutional, historic protective measures for very small 
ridings, like those in Prince Edward Island. Although I have no 
intention of depriving the people of that province of their 
members of Parliament, the Tories' amendment would give 
Quebec ridings even less weight because lowering the maximum 
allowable gap to 15 per cent would reduce the total number of 
members and expand the areas represented by members to an 
absolutely unrealistic extent.
<P>
	Consequently, to replace the 25 per cent variation by a 15 per 
cent variation would be somewhat disrespectful of Canadians 
and Quebecers, while also showing a total ignorance of 
geographical considerations, as well as a systematic attempt to 
promote centralization. Indeed, to define boundaries strictly in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13866"> 13866 </A></B>
<P>
terms of arithmetic would result in an overrepresentation of 
urban areas, while also promoting a migration to those urban 
centres, something  which, in the long term, would be very 
harmful to Canada's future. Should there be a snowball effect, it 
could lead to the situation which exists in some southern 
countries, where there are very large cities with shanty towns, 
while the rest of the territory is very sparsely populated and 
people have access to very few adequate services to ensure their 
future.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Canada was not developed by 
concentrating its population in certain areas. Indeed, it was 
always felt that the territory as a whole should be populated. 
However, the amendments proposed by the Senate would go 
against that historical pattern. I find it quite disturbing that a 
House of non-elected representatives would come to such 
conclusions.
<P>
<B>(2210) </B>
<P>
	Another rather surprising amendment by the Senate provides 
that a group 20 MPs would no longer be allowed to challenge 
appointments to electoral commissions. We, as elected 
representatives, and this is particularly true when we form a 
sufficiently large group, should be considered a watchdog, for 
the public, regarding this issue. I think that the Conservative 
amendment would have an effect opposite to the intended one 
and could create many more unacceptable situations.
<P>
	There is another aspect to the Senate amendments which I 
would like to bring to the attention of the House and I am 
referring to the different definition it gives of ``community of 
interest''. The people in the Senate use the same words as before 
but provide a definition that restricts the concept of community 
of interest to demographic and geographic considerations as 
well as the existing boundaries of municipalities. However, the 
definition now no longer considers the human factor.
<P>
	For instance, in a riding like Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
which I represent, there are 55 municipalities and four regional 
county municipalities I have to cover. Perhaps the senators 
overlooked this or perhaps some of them are not aware of this 
because they were never members of the House of Commons, 
but a member has to sit in the House four days a week in Ottawa, 
spend day five in his riding and on the weekend participate in 
social activities and meet his constituents. In a riding like this 
one where there are 55 municipalities, we get to the point where 
people are no longer able to meet their member of Parliament.
<P>
	Narrowing the definition of community of interest and 
decreasing the quota will lead to situations that make no sense at 
all. If we look at the draft electoral map the commission used to 
conduct consultations in my riding, if, for instance, the riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup were to go on in the same way 
until the next election, it would include 72 municipalities. From 
55 to 72, I do not know whether you have any idea what this 
means in the way of additional work, but it has the effect of 
creating an even greater gap between the voter and the 
individual who is supposed to represent him.
<P>
	Shutting off communications between constituents and their 
elected representative has the somewhat perverse effect of 
strengthening the power of the other House which cannot claim 
to represent the electorate. Our strength has always been that we 
can say we are there to represent the people. Even more so when 
we represent more than 50 per cent of the population, as in the 
case of most members of the Bloc Quebecois, many Liberal 
members, but only a few Reform Party members. But in any 
case, the way the legislation works, we are elected by the people, 
and as far as I am concerned, that is the principle that gives us 
the right to have the final say on bills, as opposed to the Senate.
<P>
	Distancing us from our electorate would help weaken the link 
between the electorate and government decisions and would 
give very bad results.
<P>
	In particular, I would like to draw the attention of the House to 
the effect that such a decision as reducing the variation from the 
provincial quota from 25 to 15 per cent would have on eastern 
Quebec. Currently, there are five ridings in eastern Quebec: 
Gaspé, Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
Matapédia-Matane, Rimouski-Témiscouata and 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, which is my riding. Keeping 
these five ridings, even with the current map, would require a 
decision from the electoral commission. But, if the variation 
were reduced from 25 to 15 per cent, which is now being called 
for, it is certain that one riding would disappear, possibly two. 
This would have the following effects on all of the inhabitants of 
those areas: it would encourage depopulation and the neglect of 
their regions and it would take the weight of representation away 
from these people who are in one of Quebec's resource regions. 
The same thing would happen in several other regions in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(2215) </B>
<P>
	We have discussed issues like unemployment insurance 
reform, where the first proposal was quite bureaucratic, which 
was to create a two-tiered system: one for people who do not use 
it often and one for people who do. If the representation of the 
people from these regions is reduced, decisions which are out of 
sync with their reality will be more readily accepted.
<P>
	If the human resources development committee had not been 
able to meet with Quebecers and Canadians across the country, it 
would not have achieved the result that it did, which was to 
convince the government that this proposal was not in sync with 
reality.
<P>
	It is true for other legislation as well. When it comes to a vote, 
in the end, if there are fewer members representing these areas, 
the country's future will suffer. It is not true that Canada 
comprises only large centres and nothing else. The people who 
represent these various parts of the country must be given a real

<P>
right. If they are not, we will be facing very negative situations 
in the medium term.
<P>
	By way of example for the members of the House, I would 
point out that, when the rural fact is denied in one way or 
another, the voters always have the last word.
<P>
	The Conservative government had set up a devastating post 
office strategy. They believed, in good faith, that a significant 
number of municipal post offices had to be closed. We saw the 
results in the election. I do not say this is the only reason for the 
change in government, I think there were a number of good 
reasons for it. However, the fact that the people in rural settings 
felt they would not be properly represented by those they had 
elected led them to terminate the relationship, because they felt 
not enough attention had been paid to this detail.
<P>
	If we do not permit the rural communities sufficient 
representation, we will find ourselves in the same situation.
<P>
	It is perhaps understandable that an institution, such as the 
other House, should be so far removed from the concerns of the 
public that it does not give the importance of representation its 
due, but I think it is our responsibility here in the House, because 
we are elected by the people, to bring things back to reality. The 
quota is perhaps the most important criterion. In talking of a 
variation in the quota in defining boundaries, 25 per cent was 
rightly given as the most reasonable variation. In this regard, the 
member for the Reform Party preceding me argued in support of 
the 25 per cent.
<P>
	If members appearing before the committee representing 
urban centres felt that 25 per cent was the maximum permissible 
and those representing rural communities felt it was the 
minimum, it seems a pretty reasonable choice over the figure of 
15 per cent. This figure would mean completely absurd 
situations and the combining of communities that had nothing in 
common simply in order to satisfy arithmetical criteria, which 
should not be the case in my opinion.
<P>
	To conclude, I want to say that we should take this opportunity 
to ponder the usefulness of sending bills to an institution such as 
the other place. In fact, nowadays, in the society we live in we 
can no longer distinguish, as was done 100 years ago, between 
members of the Commons and the Lords. We should keep in 
mind that our system is based on the British one and that a 
non-elected house was created to advise members coming from 
the working class and whose real wisdom was in doubt due to 
their lack of education. I do not believe that this was ever a 
problem, but more than ever today, one cannot assume that 
elected members are less educated. In this respect, we can hold 
our own to the same degree as any senator. This situation no 
longer reflects today's reality in this country.
<P>
<B>(2220) </B>
<P>
	Keeping this in mind, this bill shows that we could perhaps 
find a better use for the $40 million the Senate costs every year.
<P>
	To conclude, I do hope that this is the last time we will revisit 
the changes to the electoral boundaries. For my part, I am 
convinced that the electoral map will never again be used in 
Quebec, since in the fall, we will decide to take full control of 
our destiny. After the referendum, we will suggest to the rest of 
Canada an association which will put an end to the constitutional 
industry, ensure that neighbours of equal status deal with each 
other on an equal footing, and eliminate the negative effects, the 
useless spending and the overlap due to the present system, so 
that we can debate the real issues, and each of us build our own 
house as we really want it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour of having the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup as my neighbour, in the next 
riding. The riding that he has the honour of representing shares 
its eastern border with my riding of Bellechasse, so that we have 
a common border. The communities of 
Saint-Roch-des-Aulnaies, Sainte-Louise-des-Aulnaies, 
Mont-Carmel, that is from the St. Lawrence River to the Maine 
border, are the eastern limit of the riding of Bellechasse.
<P>
	My colleague from Chicoutimi was saying that it is a 
beautiful riding. Indeed, all the ridings that we represent are the 
most beautiful in Canada or in Quebec, because that is where we 
live, those are the people that we represent. So, it is quite normal 
for us to think that our ridings are the most beautiful. The South 
Shore, most of which I have the honour to represent with my 
colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, is definitely a 
beautiful region.
<P>
	These ridings may look alike in many respects, with more or 
less the same number of municipalities, about 60 of them, and 
with the new map, about 70. I now realize that it took me about 
18 months before I managed to cover my whole riding. I do not 
know about the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup; 
perhaps he will have the opportunity of enlightening me by 
answering my question.
<P>
	I am bringing up the point raised by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster in committee and here, during 
debate. Let us expand rural ridings; that is no problem, we can 
simply have more staff. Let us add two or three assistants in the 
ridings. However, as far as I know, on the ballot, we do not vote 
for parliamentary assistants, for riding assistants, we vote for 
the member of Parliament.
<P>
	Any constituent in my riding, whether living in 
Saint-Pamphile- de-l'Islet, in Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, in 
Lac-Etchemin, in Bromont or in Sainte-Claire-de-Dorchester, 
has the right to meet me. As a rural member, I find myself in a 
situation where these constituents, because of distances, 
because of all the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13868"> 13868 </A></B>
<P>
restraints, because of the multiplication of municipal councils 
and other municipal and regional organizations, are less able to 
meet me than the constituents of an urban member.
<P>
	I want to ask my hon. colleague whether he has the same 
problems and whether he believes, like the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, that the increase in constituency 
staff will compensate for the extension of rural ridings in such a 
way that the voice of rural constituents will be adequately heard 
in the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, place names like 
Saint-Roch-des-Aulnaies and Sainte-Louise-des-Aulnaies 
help me answer the hon. member's question. A few weeks ago, 
we had the opportunity to meet with mayors of that regional 
county municipality.
<P>
	Our discussions dealt with the decentralization requested by 
various regions in Quebec. To go to that meeting, I had to travel 
75 kilometres through the regional county municipality which 
includes those two communities, at one end of my riding.
<P>
	That shows that having a larger territory would not be a 
suitable solution, because we already have to cover a very large 
territory.
<P>
<B>(2225) </B>
<P>
	However, I would like to suggest another solution. I think the 
hon. member for Bellechasse will agree. We realize that double 
representation should be eliminated because it serves no 
purpose. Today, we have federal MPs and provincial MNAs 
whose ridings overlap and whose jurisdictions overlap also. One 
never knows who is responsible for what. When people come to 
us in our ridings, the last thing they want to know about is 
whether their question concerns a federal or a provincial 
jurisdiction. The only thing they know is they want to see their 
member.
<P>
	This is what Quebecers came to realize. A great many of them, 
over 70 per cent of Quebecers according to the polls, would like 
to deal with only one member of Parliament, someone who 
would represent them at a National Parliament in Quebec City 
and who could probably be sent to the joint Parliamentary 
assembly in Canada to make suggestions on how to manage the 
partnership between Quebec and Canada once Quebec has opted 
for sovereignty.
<P>
	We would then be able to reduce a lot of the unnecessary costs 
and settle many of the problems we currently have. As federal 
MPs, if we have to call a provincial MLA who is not a member of 
our own party, we find it a bit awkward. Oftentimes, when our 
constituents come to us, they do not know if they will be able to 
find a solution to their problem at one level or the other. It is up 
to us to try to find out if there are provincial or federal programs 
that can be helpful to them. I think this is where we have a 
problem.
<P>
	Finally, I want to say that in a region like mine, the riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, as well as in the riding of 
Bellechasse and all along the shores of the St. Lawrence, home 
to the only French-speaking community in North America, 
where a lot of Lévesques, Pelletiers, Ouellets are living-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Crêtes, Langlois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Langlois and Crêtes, as well, yes, although there 
are not so many Crêtes in that area, I think.
<P>
	I want people to realize that Quebecers have gone beyond the 
plumbing all the way to the architect's plan. We, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, are here to protect the interests of Quebec, which is 
why, during this debate on the redistribution of seats, we have 
tried to ensure that Quebecers are as well represented as 
possible. We are a few months away from a much more crucial 
decision which would not only ensure us an adequate 
representation, but also give us full control over our own 
development. I think this is what the future holds for the 
province of Quebec and this is what Quebecers will decide.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first let me explain exactly what it is we are debating tonight.
<P>
	At the moment we are debating Senate amendments to Bill 
C-69 which amends the previously amended bill from the 
Senate, Bill C-18, which sought to amend and suspend the 
Electoral Boundaries Commission. If that explains what we are 
doing, let me add a little more. If we accept all or some of these 
amendments the process will continue amended. It will amend 
Bill C-18 which will then be suspended. The amended process 
will begin again and we will have amended boundaries for the 
next election.
<P>
	However, should we decide not to proceed with any of this, 
the process continues just as it was before with no amendments 
whatsoever. This is the incredible journey we have been on in 
the government's quest to, for reasons that are becoming less 
and less clear by the day, redo the electoral boundaries all over 
again. I think I will stop there before I confuse myself.
<P>
	The member for Bellechasse addressed a very interesting 
point in his speech. He really addressed the role of the Senate in 
making these amendments. It is an interesting question because 
I think all members of the House feel some concern about the 
role of the Senate. We are here at the end of the 20th century, 
nearly the 21st century, and we will be one of the very few 
countries even if we include the non-democratic world that 
actually has a quarter of the seats in its Parliament unelected.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13869"> 13869 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2230) </B>
<P>
	There are two proposals to deal with that, as the hon. member 
for Bellechasse suggested, either of which would be preferable 
to the status quo. One is to abolish the  Senate, the proposal of 
the Bloc Quebecois. I find it interesting that it comes from the 
Bloc because Quebec was the last province to eliminate its own 
upper house, in 1968, in the living memory of virtually every 
member of this institution.
<P>
	At the same time, Mr. Parizeau has created a council of 
ministers, a council of unelected regional advisors, to really 
parallel the very role the Senate is supposed to play in the 
Chamber, which it does not. It was admirable innovation by Mr. 
Parizeau. I do not know if it is working quite as he hoped but it is 
interesting that he would appoint an unelected second cabinet.
<P>
	We prefer to have the Senate elected but the question we have 
to ask ourselves, given the government supports status quo 
federalism and does not believe in changing anything and 
believes in appointed senators, is what the senators are supposed 
to do. Senators have constitutional responsibilities to execute. 
Bills go to the Senate, the Senate is paid to consider those bills 
and the Senate has considered those bills.
<P>
	The Senate has suggested six sets of amendments. It has taken 
some time to study these. In all honesty, although some of the 
people in the Senate are not my favourite people and that is 
probably an opinion they share, they have conducted themselves 
very responsibly on this issue. They have examined a case in 
which Parliament has grossly abused its authority in a way that 
is irresponsible financially because it is costing us $6 million. It 
is irresponsible democratically because it is suspending a 
process set up by Parliament to be independent. It is 
irresponsible in a basic governmental sense. The reasons for 
doing this are obviously for self-interest in interrupting this 
whole process, so evident it is quite embarrassing to this body.
<P>
	The Senate has examined these things and proposed a number 
of amendments. I do not support all its amendments. If I have 
time I will go into describing why I support some and why I do 
not support others. The Senate has looked at a number of issues 
that need examination and has given us an honest opinion. 
Certainly no one here doubts the chairman of the committee in 
the Senate that examined this bill is an outstanding 
constitutional expert, Senator Beaudoin. Everybody recognizes 
that and certainly he has tried to play a useful role in this debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is also interesting to note that the Bloc Quebecois's 
opposition is based on the absence of a guarantee of 25 per cent 
of the seats in the House of Commons. The hon. member for 
Bellechasse has repeated this fact tonight. It is also interesting 
because that would obviously be an unconstitutional 
amendment to this bill. Senator Beaudoin knows that, as do all 
the constitutional experts, but this is also interesting because it 
must be remembered that the solution to these problems, as far 
as the Bloc Quebecois is concerned, is in fact a Parliament 
where Quebec would have 0 per cent of the members.
<P>
<B>(2235) </B>
<P>
	The important course taken by Quebec at the present time, the 
course taken by its premiers over the last thirty years, would 
have disappeared, and this is the solution. Quebecers should not 
forget that. The Bloc Quebecois's solution does not guarantee 25 
per cent of the seats in the House of Commons. Its solution lies 
in a Quebec with 0 per cent of the seats in the Parliament of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me go over these amendments in some detail to give my 
party's considered position on them. To repeat what the member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster said, one amendment is certainly 
acceptable to the Reform Party, just as it is acceptable to the 
government. In Amendment No. 4(a) the Senate is proposing to 
add a requirement for the two non-judicial commissioners to be 
resident in the province for which the commission is 
established. The Senate recognized that is a tradition and 
something that really should be in the bill.
<P>
	It is fair to say in the committee that studied this bill, of which 
I was a member, this requirement was inadvertently omitted by 
the technical drafters. This is an amendment the Liberal 
government will accept and which we are certainly prepared to 
accept. Our amendment also accepts this change and clarifies 
something that should be in the bill. It would be an abuse to have 
a commission that contained members who were not resident in 
the province.
<P>
	Consistent with what we have advocated in the past, the 
Senate has proposed that the allowable deviation from the 
provincial quotient be reduced in its general application from 25 
per cent to 15 per cent. This is was one of a series of amendments 
the Senate is proposing because it felt, not without some 
justification, we have drifted so far from voting equality in a 
number of clauses of the bill that there needs to be some 
correction. Independent of that we in the Reform Party had 
already supported this consideration when the bill was before 
committee last summer and also when Bill C-69 was in the 
House.
<P>
	Our view is there should be more equalized voting power, that 
the 15 per cent discrepancy should be acceptable between 
various rural and urban constituencies in all but the most 
exceptional cases. That would achieve this. We argued for this at 
all previous stages of the bill.
<P>
	The contrary argument is there need to be special 
discrepancies for rural areas but 15 per cent is a wide 
discrepancy. It means a variation from 85 per cent to 115 per 
cent. We would actually have quite a wide variation in the 
number of constituen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13870"> 13870 </A></B>
<P>
cies plus the fact the bill actually allows for exceptional 
circumstances that go beyond that, not just those laid out in the 
senatorial clause or the grandfather clause of the Constitution 
but discrepancies that go over and above that for exceptional 
ridings in the far north of the various provinces. We propose in 
our amendment that this amendment from  the Senate be 
accepted and we have argued for it at all previous stages of the 
bill.
<P>
	The Senate has proposed along the same lines in its 
Amendment No. 6(b)(i) to eliminate the provision that a 
commission will only recommend changes to existing electoral 
district boundaries where the factors set out are significant 
enough to warrant such a recommendation. This was basically 
designed to encourage the commission to give greater 
consideration to electoral boundaries.
<P>
	We had a lot of debate on this and related topics in committee.
<P>
<B>(2240) </B>
<P>
	The government should remember I was troubled by the 
comments of the parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader in the House and before the Senate committee on 
legal and constitutional affairs. He really tried to convey the 
impression there had been massive agreement on this 
legislation.
<P>
	In our case we disagreed fundamentally with the entire 
purpose of this legislation, with the idea of suspending electoral 
boundaries right from day one. We had questioned also the 
purpose of re-establishing the commissions prior to the next 
census when it would be necessary. There were disagreements 
beyond that in terms of the amending formula, for the number of 
seats in terms of the quotient. Beyond that there were many 
items in which we had multiple differences before arriving at an 
agreement.
<P>
	When the member for Kingston and the Islands suggests we 
had agreed on all these areas, we had agreed on all these areas 
only after our first, second, third, fourth and fifth preferences in 
many cases had been rejected.
<P>
	To say there had been enthusiastic agreement about all these 
things from the Reform Party is certainly an exaggeration. As he 
knows and knows full well, both opposition parties and 
particularly the Reform Party have opposed this bill at every 
important stage of its development.
<P>
	With regard to Amendment No. 6(b)(i) the Senate has in its 
consideration come upon something that deserves 
re-examination. There are probably a lot of things like that, 
given the timetable forced on this bill. The re-examination here 
is that there should be this special factor, clause 19(2)(c), that if 
factors are not significant enough to warrant such a 
recommendation the commission should not recommend 
changes.
<P>
	That is covered in several other clauses of the bill, as the 
Senate pointed out. There is the definition of community of 
interest which describes existing constituencies as one of the 
most important basis of any new electoral map. Wide deviations 
are already allowed, the 25 per cent plus additional 
consideration for constituencies that go beyond 25 per cent in 
come cases. There are already many factors in the bill that give a 
very high priority on keeping existing ridings intact.
<P>
	As well, the bill as it is now probably provides to members a 
bit of a false assurance. One of the things we were told in our 
committee hearings last summer by people who had been 
involved in the drafting process is to stop thinking of our ridings 
as individual ridings. This is a trap that we fall into as members 
of Parliament. We represent a riding and if that riding changes 
we see that as a change to our riding. Commissions do not draw 
ridings, they draw boundaries to ridings. It is impossible to 
change one riding without changing another riding.
<P>
	Once the criteria set out in the act require a change to any 
riding, almost always that has a domino effect that impacts on 
the vast majority of ridings in a province. Therefore in practical 
terms once one hits the basic triggers laid out in the bill it is 
impossible to preserve existing ridings exactly as they are in any 
case.
<P>
	For that reason the Senate has pointed out a consideration 
which is probably not terribly useful and which the House 
should withdraw. That is why in our amendment we propose 
accepting Amendment No. 6(b)(i) from the Senate.
<P>
	Let me now talk about those Senate amendments the House 
should continue to oppose. In doing so I will lay out the 
considerations the Senate did give in suggesting these 
amendments. In every case they have some merit and we should 
understand the reasoning.
<P>
	The Senate proposed to eliminate this new clause we have in 
the bill that would give 20 members of the Commons the ability 
to challenge the Speaker's appointments to boundary 
commissions. The Senate did that for a couple of reasons. It was 
concerned about the role of the Speaker. The Speaker is required 
to give rulings every day and his impartiality is an important 
criterion of his effectiveness. The concern was that setting up a 
mechanism in a bill that allowed people to challenge the Speaker 
in and of itself provided a situation where the Speaker's 
authority could be easily undermined not just on this issue but 
on a number of issues.
<P>
<B>(2245) </B>
<P>
	The Senate was concerned about the introduction of fairly 
blatant partisan politics into the process. I would not deny that is 
the case. In supporting this amendment we in the Reform Party 
recognize that it would force the Speaker to consult with all 
three parties and maybe in some cases with representatives of 
other parties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13871"> 13871 </A></B>
<P>
	We did that not because we prefer partisanship but because 
we have come to the conclusion that a certain amount of 
partisanship may enhance the independence of the process. Let 
me explain what I mean by that.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the process we have today is 
independent. If we look at it on paper it is independent. It was 
established in 1964 and nobody has suggested that it leads to 
undue political interference. However, what has the reality been 
since 1964? The reality has been that every time boundary 
commissions have made proposals for change, the House of 
Commons has intervened not to interfere directly in the process 
but to use its power to quash the process completely.
<P>
	In a sense the House of Commons can always interfere, and it 
interfered on a grand scale. In the past the outcome of that 
interference has been a new formula for distribution of seats 
among the provinces under the Constitution. This time that 
particular route was rejected and we made no major changes 
along those lines. That was fairly blatant political interference.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are hoping that the process of 
consultation, which will ensure that the Speaker not only hears 
from the government but hears from all parties, will bind all 
parties and all members into the process so they do not invent 
the kind of wild stories and conspiracy theories that were 
necessary to justify the kind of interference we had in 1994. That 
is what we are hoping and I think the Senate should take that into 
account. There is a dynamic here. The dynamic is partisan. We 
have been unable to secure true independence and we feel this is 
the next best alternative.
<P>
	These appointments are not a ruling by the Speaker and thus 
challenges to his appointments. While they would be 
embarrassing and would certainly undermine the credibility of 
the Speaker were he to propose any kind of commissioner that 
was not accepted on a partisan basis, it is certainly not likely to 
be seen as a non-confidence motion.
<P>
	I would like to continue to analyse some of the amendments. 
The Senate proposed to eliminate the use of the special trigger 
based on population shifts for the very establishment of a 
boundaries commission in the first place. The Senate was 
concerned that we were in effect violating the Constitution by 
not automatically having boundary commissions, and that 
because the boundaries would not be considered in a certain 
province it would easily put the legislation before the courts in 
some kind of a court challenge.
<P>
	Once again the Senate has something which it has a right to 
consider. I believe in this case that the senators are 
fundamentally wrong. Senator Carstairs argued, and I think she 
is correct, that the Constitution requires only interprovincial 
decennial redistribution and not intraprovincial decennial 
redistribution. In other words, the failure to have intraprovincial 
decennial redistribution would not in our view contravene 
section 51 of the Constitution Act.
<P>
	As well, by not changing the boundaries if they are at least 
within 25 per cent we are in effect reasserting boundaries that 
already exist and that presumably have survived any previous 
court challenge.
<P>
	The reason we supported the measure originally was that it 
was a considerable cost saving. In the redistribution that will 
likely recommence after the bill is passed, it will not be 
necessary to re-establish commissions for Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, as well as the Northwest 
Territories. That will save over $1 million in the next process.
<P>
	While the Senate has raised some concerns of a legal nature, I 
believe they are incorrect. I also believe they are dealing largely 
with theory. I believe very few people would challenge a 
redistribution simply because it failed to change a riding that 
already existed.
<P>
<B>(2250) </B>
<P>
	Finally I will comment on the redefinition of community of 
interest the Senate is proposing. Its definition came from the 
Lortie commission which had a number of worthwhile 
recommendations on the electoral redistribution process. We in 
the Reform Party worked hard to provide another definition 
because we fundamentally reject the Lortie commission's 
approach that there basically be affirmative action-racial kinds 
of criteria involved in the drawing of boundary commissions.
<P>
	The Senate and the Lortie commission have some legal 
support in suggesting that there are court decisions. There are 
legal precedents that not only recommend this but, in the case of 
some courts, are actually pushing this kind of approach. 
Whether or not that is the case, it is in our view clearly contrary 
to the best interest of our country and to the idea of a non-racial 
Canada that we support. We feel the Lortie commission and the 
Senate are mistaken in that regard. We were satisfied that all 
three parties in the committee agreed that approach was not 
appropriate.
<P>
	That is the Reform Party's review of the various amendments 
the Senate has proposed. I hope it sheds some light on why it 
proposed them as well as why we accept or reject them.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I wish to thank and commend the hon. 
member for Calgary West for wanting to know more about the 
institutions which will be proposed to Canada by a sovereign 
Quebec. I think he should be reminded, and I want to reassure 
him on this, that the parliamentary assembly, one of the 
institutions provided for in the economic association proposal, 
will be an elected assembly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13872"> 13872 </A></B>
<P>
	The members of this assembly will be elected by the 
Parliament of Quebec and the Parliament of Canada or all 
parliaments in Canada together, depending on the type of 
representation they choose. They will not be appointed 
randomly. This joint assembly will bring together elected 
members from Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	A decision on this economic association proposal will be 
made after the people of Quebec have voted in a referendum to 
take full control of their own development, which means passing 
all legislation, collecting all taxes and making agreements, 
including perhaps an economic partnership agreement with 
Canada. It is very interesting to share views on this proposal. I 
suggest that the hon. member for Calgary West do so at some 
point in time.
<P>
	Quebecers will have to choose between a federal system in 
which they have very few powers and another one in which they 
will have 100 per cent of the powers in the Quebec Parliament, 
which has always been the heart and cradle of the Quebec nation, 
formerly referred to as the French Canadian nation. This nation 
will have the credibility and strength required to negotiate with 
Canada a mutually satisfactory agreement to get us out of the 
constitutional mess we are in.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell us if he would be prepared 
to talk his colleagues into accepting the referendum results if, as 
I suspect, it meant that Quebec achieved sovereignty and took 
full responsibility for its development in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find the 
member's remarks very interesting. I am a bit confused. I think 
Quebecers will be just as confused as I am during the 
referendum campaign.
<P>
	In responding to the member for Bellechasse, the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup talked about the need to have 
only one member in Quebec City and only one level of 
government and the need to eliminate duplication and overlap, 
as members of the Bloc always say.
<P>
<B>(2255) </B>
<P>
	Now, in the agreement signed by the three sovereignist 
leaders, we see a proposal for a new Parliament for an 
independent Quebec and the rest of Canada, and not only a 
Parliament, but also a new cabinet, and we know what will 
happen. There will be public servants, offices, etc. They are also 
proposing a tribunal to solve some problems between the two 
nations.
<P>
	In fact, they are proposing a new level of government with 
independence. I think that it is contrary to the commitment of 
the Parti Quebecois, which is to eliminate a level of government, 
and we must take into consideration the fact that this PQ 
government has already promised to hire all federal public 
servants here, in Hull. I cannot understand this position. It will 
be interesting to see how they will explain to Quebecers the 
creation of a new level of government after independence.
<P>
	Regarding the member's question, he asked me if I would 
accept the result of a referendum. Obviously, we cannot 
recognize Quebec's power to determine the future of all the 
provinces, but the result of a referendum is clear. It is the 
expression of the will of the people. If the result is affirmative, it 
means that the majority really wants to separate, and if the result 
is negative, it means that they want to remain part of Canada. 
What I want to know now is if members of the Bloc will accept a 
negative result this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have thirty seconds left so I will simply say that 
on the issue of civil servants, we now have 18 percent of all civil 
servants and 24 per cent of the population. When federal civil 
servants join the Quebec public service, there will be a 
significant economy of scale for us and we will be better off.
<P>
	As for accepting the results, I will return the question to the 
member. Does he believe that people who form a nation, and 
who have fought for the last 250 or 300 years to obtain the 
complete control of that nation, will stop now? The struggle will 
stop only when Quebec is absolutely sovereign and that is the 
answer of Quebec sovereignists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said many times before, I am 
not a Quebecer, but here is how I understand Quebec's history: 
Quebecers want to form a society within a bigger Canadian 
society. They want to keep both their Canadian identity and their 
Quebec identity and that will only be possible in a federal state.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before giving the floor to the member 
for Chicoutimi, I should perhaps bring to the attention of all 
members Standing Order 18 which states, in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No member shall use offensive words against either House or against amy 
member thereof.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I draw that to the attention of all members and obviously not 
just the member who is about to speak. I remind members that 
the rules bar us from using offensive words against either house 
or any member thereof.
<P>
<B>(2300) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the member for Calgary West, who has been in 
this House for a year and a half now, and has finally realized that 
Bloc Quebecois members are first and foremost sovereignists. 
And of course, this means that what we are seeking is that one 
day there will no longer be any Quebec members in this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13873"> 13873 </A></B>
<P>
	This is the reason why, as long as Quebecers are part of the 
federal experiment, Bloc Quebecois members will oppose any 
change to the present formula for riding distribution. Its effect 
would be to weaken Quebec representation in the House of 
Commons, as long as Quebecers have not made up their minds 
on a new social covenant.
<P>
	The present formula for the distribution of seats is not perfect 
because, historically speaking, during the 126 years of existence 
of this federation, Quebec has never had its rightful share of 
seats in the House of Commons. The six amendments proposed 
by the Senate, far from improving the content of the bill, 
actually make the situation even worse for Quebec. This is like 
the Robin Hood principle in reverse. We take from the poor, 
Quebec, to give to the rich, the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The first amendment would reduce the maximum variation 
from the provincial quota from 25 to 15 per cent. What a nice 
equity exercise on the part of the non-elected members of the 
other place. According to the thinkers of the other House, one of 
the fundamental conditions of democracy is the fair 
mathematical share of regional representation.
<P>
	I must admit that this is a very nice principle, but it does not 
explain the senate clause and the grandfather rights.
<P>
	While the Senate is concerned about a perfect equality within 
the provinces, it seems to forget that there are several ridings in 
English Canada that do not even have 35,000 people. I am 
talking here, among others, about four ridings in Prince Edward 
Island, the riding of Labrador, the riding of Yukon and a few 
others. So, where is the senators' concern for equality for the 
voters in these ridings?
<P>
	This amendment does nothing to improve this bill, and they 
know it very well. Besides, they even ignored what one of their 
peers was telling them. Senator Jean-Claude Rivest, a former 
advisor to Robert Bourassa, was demanding, like us, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, that Quebec be given 25 per cent of the seats in 
Parliament.
<P>
	I would remind you very briefly that, concerning Quebec's 
share of seats, the 1985 Act on Representation is quite clear.
<P>
<B>(2305) </B>
<P>
	In fact, it stipulates that the returning officer must take into 
account, before distributing any other seats, the fact that 25 per 
cent of all seats in the House of Commons must be assigned to 
Quebec.
<P>
	I am taking the liberty of reminding the House, with all of the 
respect it merits and which holds traditions so dear, that since 
the very first parliamentary session, Quebec has always enjoyed 
at least, and I stress at least, 25 per cent of all seats. This is 
neither an acquired right nor a favour that Canada has bestowed 
on Quebec: it is a simple mathematical calculation governed by 
the Constitution Act, 1867, and by clauses 14 and 15 of the  act 
to provide for the readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	It would therefore be a shame, and actually inadmissible, to 
put an end to this tradition which has been handed down from the 
very first Parliament. Why put an end to the tradition? Simply to 
compensate, yes, I said compensate, English Canada for having 
kept its allegiances straight when voting. Do not forget that 
Quebec was the cradle of Canada. Quebec brought it into this 
world, and not the other way around. The first amendment will 
not only reduce the maximum variation from the province's 
quota, but could also wipe certain electoral ridings right off the 
map.
<P>
	Yes, the population of several of Quebec's rural regions has 
been steadily declining over the past several years. The 
government knows it. So, what is it doing about it? With this 
bill, it is ensuring that English Canada will get additional 
ridings, and that Quebec will lose a few. What a great exercise in 
democracy! This is what I would call the Robin Hood principle.
<P>
	The other amendment I find particularly disturbing is 
amendment No. 6 which seeks to redefine the concept of 
community of interest.
<P>
	The senators suggest establishing boundaries based on 
demographic and geographic considerations. I realize that to say 
this amendment totally ignores the human aspect is to say the 
obvious. It is unfortunate, and it makes no sense at all. On paper 
this might work, but theoretically, realistically, practically, on a 
day to day basis, we cannot ignore the human factor because in 
the end it determines how things work.
<P>
	For a riding like mine that borders on several municipalities 
and has a very large territory, this amendment could be a 
disaster. Take the riding of Chicoutimi. Last year, when the 
federal electoral boundaries commission came to the riding, it 
suggested taking the municipalities of Ferland-et-Boileau, 
Saint-Félix-d'Otis, Rivière-Éternité, L'Anse-Saint-Jean and 
Petit-Saguenay away from the riding of Chicoutimi and 
annexing them to the riding of my colleague, the hon. member 
for Jonquière.
<P>
	This problem illustrates the importance of community of 
interest. In fact, these small rural municipalities on the Lower 
Saguenay, those the commission wanted to take away from my 
riding, have always considered La Baie, one of the larger cities 
in the riding of Chicoutimi, as their economic and social centre.
<P>
<B>(2310) </B>
<P>
	Most of the services used by the people in the Lower 
Saguenay are located in La Baie. The closest employment centre 
is there, as is the small business development centre. 
Ferland-et-Boilleau, the municipality closest to the riding of 
Jonquière is 45 km away. This is the community of interest 
proposed by these amendments. It seems rather unreasonable to 
me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13874"> 13874 </A></B>
<P>
	A bill cannot be permitted to push aside-and I mean push 
aside-the human factor without a thought in order to establish 
electoral boundaries. This is a serious mistake, and I find it 
most regrettable. My comment is, simply: ``Stop wasting 
taxpayers' money with useless and pointless bills. Let us get 
down to the real problems of our society, which are growing 
with every passing day''.
<P>
	It is time to deal with the economic slowdown, when statistics 
indicate that for the sixth straight month there has been no net 
job creation in Canada. The government is setting an example by 
its inertia in this area.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is too busy to study a new plan for 
reducing unemployment insurance benefits. Perhaps he thinks it 
will help the growth of employment, which is in a state of 
exhaustion. Let us stop wasting our time and taxpayers' money 
and get down to this country's real problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
for me to make this presentation.
<P>
	I have come to this place with high ideals and really wanting 
to understand the whole Canadian scene. I have been very 
privileged to have my place in Parliament here right next to the 
members of the Bloc and to hear the presentation we just had.
<P>
	I have some questions for the member. One is that he indicates 
that it is somehow fair that the Quebec people should have 25 
per cent of the members of Parliament, irrespective of their 
population. On the other hand, he speaks of the lack of fairness 
when there is not a proportional representation in other parts of 
the country. I would like to ask him how he can defend from a 
fairness point of view that particular model.
<P>
	I certainly have respect for the people of the province of 
Quebec. I have said this before. During our campaign we had 
people there who sported bumper stickers that said ``My Canada 
includes Quebec''. Certainly I have that personal conviction. 
Regardless of what happens politically in that province, we will 
not take a chainsaw and cut them out and float them off into the 
ocean. They will remain physically here, with whatever kind of 
political arrangement we have.
<P>
	I would like to have him explain how he proposes to justify 
that in perpetuity they should have an advantage over other 
Canadians in this particular regard and how he thinks that might 
generate more love and understanding toward them from the rest 
of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(2315) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. With regard to my preamble, I believe I answered his 
question when I said that the present seat distribution formula in 
this place was not perfect. One must remember that historically 
Quebec never had its fair share of seats in the House of 
Commons over the last 125 years.
<P>
	In order to stop the gradual erosion of Quebec's influence in 
our federal institutions and, especially-and I think this is the 
key word-to reaffirm the Canadian duality, members from the 
Bloc demand that Quebec retain 25 per cent of the seats in the 
House of Commons as long as we are part of the federal 
experience.
<P>
	As you know, in the fall, Quebecers will decide their political 
future. The member emphasized this in the preamble to his 
question. It is then that Quebec, depending upon the choice 
made by Quebecers, will be either a province or a country. This 
is the choice Quebecers will have to make. In the meantime, they 
know that if Quebec remains a province in this federal system 
that cannot be renewed, this province will be limited. It will 
remain a colony of English Canada and we will remain a 
minority forever and ever.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Amen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Amen. And we will naturally be ruled by the 
present unitary federal government, whereas we would have a 
new lease on life if we became a country. I hope Quebecers will 
make that choice. I am convinced they will. Then, with new and 
more efficient methods, we will proudly develop this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, it will be a pleasure for me to let 
the member for Elk Island have the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member did not answer my 
question. He simply restated what he said before about the 
history and the present formula which I already know. What I 
want to know is how he defends the premise that the number of 
members of Parliament from the province of Quebec and only 
from the province of Quebec should not be related to the 
population.
<P>
	In the past it has been a fixed number of 75. We know that 
relative to the rest of Canada, Quebec's population has gone 
down. The mathematical fact stands. If it were not for that we 
would not be asking for more members in the House. That 
results when either the population of Quebec goes down or the 
population of the rest of the country goes up. That necessitates 
more members in this House by the present formula.
<P>
	How is it that the Quebec members believe that they and they 
alone do not have to submit to the same rules of representation 
by population that the rest of Canada does? How does he justify 
that?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13875"> 13875 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, here we must refer to the 
notion of the two founding nations. If Quebec had been 
respected when this country was formed, it would not have been 
allowed 25 per cent of seats in this House, but 50 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Yes, fifty per cent of seats. Two equal founding 
nations means a 50:50 sharing. Whereas now we are claiming 
our fair share of seats, that is 25 per cent.
<P>
<B>(2320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to make a short comment. Like my colleague from 
Chicoutimi, I had the opportunity to hear the hon. member for 
Calgary West, who seems to already understand a large part of 
the proposed agreement to be submitted to Quebecers for 
ratification in the fall. We all understand, of course, that the 
Canadian fibre was first woven in Quebec, in Lower Canada, in 
Ontario, and that we in Quebec naturally propose to repatriate 
our own powers, while opening the door to a European-type 
model and proposing economic integration and a certain kind of 
political association with Canada.
<P>
	Since Quebec is about to propose to Canada the free 
movement of goods, people and capital, as well as the 
establishment of some common institutions, does the hon. 
member for Chicoutimi agree that, contrary to what our 
colleague from Calgary West said, a major economic integration 
would prevent any region of Canada from being isolated from 
the others, and that this free movement, this major economic 
integration, would involve some political integration and a 
common political institution to manage the agreement, the 
partnership that would result not from a law imposed by a 
foreign Parliament but from a treaty freely negotiated between 
Canada and Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that, when Quebec 
becomes sovereign in the fall, you will see no boundaries or 
barricades being built between Quebec and Ontario or the other 
provinces. It is therefore in the best interests of Ontario and the 
other provinces to do business with Quebec. Rules can certainly 
be drawn up at the political institutions level, through 
discussions between members from Quebec and Ontario, to 
govern trade. In that case, I feel every Canadian province would 
stand to profit from the birth of this new country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order. The hon. member who has just been speaking continues to 
mislead the House by talking about sovereignty association. He 
is a separatist and he should tell it as it is. He is a separatist and 
he should stop misleading the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is not a point of order, however, 
the hon. member for North Vancouver now has the floor on 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel 
tempted to repeat what I just said and maybe I will as part of my 
speech.
<P>
	Before beginning my remarks on Bill C-69 I would like to 
remind the House that almost two years after the 1993 election 
the debt and deficit has risen by almost $100 billion. That is just 
in the two years since the Liberal government took office.
<P>
	In the past 24 hours the government has spent almost $100 
million more than it took in. That is about $4 million per hour or 
$67,000 per minute in money we simply do not have, money we 
have to borrow. This borrowed money continues to collect 
interest that adds to the more than $550 billion debt burden our 
children and grandchildren will have to carry.
<P>
	Some weeks ago at a public meeting in Vancouver the Liberal 
member for Halifax said that as a traditional tax and spend 
Liberal she had crashed and burned when the Minister of 
Finance announced his budget in March of this year. If serious 
action is not taken very soon to seriously start addressing the 
problem of the debt and deficit, the hon. member is sure going to 
crash and burn again and again and again. It will be to the point 
where the international lenders will stop supporting our 
foolishness.
<P>
<B>(2325) </B>
<P>
	Today we find ourselves debating again Bill C-69, which 
exists simply because of Bill C-18, which we debated earlier in 
1994. I said then that the Liberal government should be ashamed 
of itself because of what it was doing. It was imposing the will of 
unhappy Liberal MPs on the voters of Canada. It was probably 
because they were worried they would not be re-elected to 
collect their gold-plated pensions at the pension trough. They 
were worried that if the boundaries changed they would not be 
able to collect their pensions.
<P>
	They have protected the content of those pork barrel pensions 
with Bill C-85, which they are also ramming through the House 
this next week or so. Now they have brought back the electoral 
boundaries issue in a last ditch attempt to control the shape of 
their ridings. Without regard to the huge investment of time by 
the Electoral Boundaries Commission and without regard to the 
millions of dollars that have already been spent on a 
non-partisan process, the government is still trying to jam 
through ill-conceived and selfish political agendas.
<P>
	Politicians have no business setting their own electoral 
boundaries. Human nature being what it is, some members 
might be tempted to act in their own interests, to trim areas of 
opposition from their ridings or to add little areas of support to 
their ridings. Even if that did not happen, there would be the 
suspicion of course that it was happening.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13876"> 13876 </A></B>
<P>
	The important thing is that the whole process should not only 
be non-partisan but it should be seen to be non-partisan. 
Politicians should have absolutely nothing to do with the 
process.
<P>
	One of the disturbing parts about this whole process is that the 
increase in population in the province of B.C. entitles us to two 
more seats in the House under the present rules. Even if we were 
to hold static the number of seats we presently have, at the very 
least they should be redistributed so that B.C. has a greater 
proportion of the seats.
<P>
	I vigorously oppose Bill C-69.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Fifty per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> My hon. colleagues say we 
should have at least 50 per cent. Sometimes I would agree with 
them. The west obviously has a much more sensible attitude to 
politics than we have seen over on the opposite side of the 
House. We could certainly do with a greater percentage of the 
seats.
<P>
	I am proud that Reform Party members stood against the 
government's attempts to ram through Bill C-18. They tried to 
do it in a clandestine fashion on a Friday afternoon when they 
thought no one would notice. I am proud that my colleagues 
stood and prevented that from happening.
<P>
	Canadians are starting to see time and time again that 
Reformers stand up for democracy while the government 
continues to practice the old line Victorian style of politics. It 
punishes any Liberal MP who dares to represent their 
constituents by voting against a government bill. That method of 
operation is completely outdated. It is not appropriate to the 
information age. It may have been perfect in the olden days 
when the present Prime Minister first came to the House, but it is 
totally inappropriate for the information age. Shame on this 
government.
<P>
	In previous Parliaments the issue of constituency 
representation in the form of free votes was never an issue 
because the three worn out, old style, dictatorial, arrogant, old 
line parties all played the same game of agenda politics. They 
never did want to and still do not want to govern the country 
according to the wishes of the majority of Canadians. They 
simply saw government as an opportunity to enact their own 
political agenda without regard to the concerns of Canadians.
<P>
	The pressure for change is here in this House today and it is 
not going away. At the moment, with the exception of Reform 
MPs and a few independent minded Liberal MPs, most MPs are 
nothing more than voting machines; no matter what their 
constituents say, they follow the orders of the Prime Minister 
when they come into this House to vote. All of the debates, all of 
the questions, all of the committee meetings and hearings, all of 
the witness testimony, all of the travel junkets are nothing more 
than make work projects to keep MPs busy between votes. Those 
votes we already know the  outcome of because the Prime 
Minister had already decided before the first word of debate was 
spoken.
<P>
<B>(2330 ) </B>
<P>
	Last year the government introduced approximately 60 bills. 
We debated them. We questioned them. We commented on them. 
At the end of the term we had passed 60 bills. We may as well 
have piled them up on a table 60 high and come here for one hour 
on one day and voted once. The outcome would have been 
exactly the same.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Vancouver North 
will have 14 minutes left the next time the bill is debated.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
June 1, I asked the Minister of the Environment whether the 
government planned to regulate emissions of dioxins, furans 
and hexachlorobenzenes from incinerators. I also asked whether 
the federal guideline for human exposure to dioxins and dioxin 
related compounds was adequate to protect human health. In 
response the minister stated that the exposure levels for dioxins 
and furans were under review by Health Canada.
<P>
	Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds such as furans are highly 
toxic chemicals produced when various types of waste, 
particularly chlorinated plastics, are burned. Every day 
Canadians are exposed to dioxins and carry this persistent toxic 
compound in their bodies.
<P>
	At present Canada's dioxin guideline is set at 10 picograms 
per kilogram of body weight per day. It has been maintained that 
this level of exposure is safe. However a recently published 
review, which took three years to conduct, in the United States 
by the Environmental Protection Agency pointed to dioxin 
being even more dangerous than was originally thought. The 
Environmental Protection Agency's reassessment found that 
even at extremely low levels dioxin affects human development, 
reproduction capacity and the immune system. The 
Environmental Protection Agency's reassessment of dioxin 
strongly suggests that safe levels of exposure set so far in the 
Canadian guidelines may no longer be safe or acceptable.
<P>
	The time has come to shift the burden of proof so as to protect 
the environment and public health in this respect. The existence 
of safe doses needs to be re-examined because evidence from 
human epidemiological studies, from animal cancer studies and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13877"> 13877 </A></B>
<P>
from biochemical research tells us that dioxin represents a 
cancer hazard to people.
<P>
	The findings of the Environmental Protection Agency suggest 
that the environment and our own bodies are already 
overburdened with dioxin-like compounds. Given the 
persistence and toxicity of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds, 
one must conclude that the prudent course of action would be to 
prevent pollution, coupled most importantly with a reduction in 
our dependence on dioxin producing activities such as 
incineration.
<P>
	In this context I ask the hon. parliamentary secretary to 
inform the House whether the federal government intends to 
take steps to phase out airborne dioxin emissions from 
incinerators across Canada and to reassess the Canadian 
guidelines for exposure to dioxins presently set at 10 picograms 
per kilogram of body weight per day.
<P>
	I am looking forward to hearing the parliamentary secretary's 
reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the major 
source of dioxins and furans identified in Canada today include 
municipal and hazardous waste incinerators, effluents from pulp 
and paper mills, long range atmospheric transport from other 
countries and contaminants in such chemical products as 
pentachlorophenol and PCBs.
<P>
	As a result of Canadian regulatory and guidelines initiatives 
dioxin and furan emissions from municipal solid waste and 
hazardous waste incinerators have decreased by 80 per cent in 
the last four years.
<P>
	Between 1989 and 1994 dioxin and furan emissions from 
bleached kraft pulp mill effluents have decreased by 82 per cent. 
Some dioxin contaminated pesticides are either strictly 
regulated or banned.
<P>
	In addition, the levels of dioxin and furans in the Canadian 
environment have declined significantly. Annual releases from 
pulp and paper mills have dropped from more than 350 grams of 
dioxins and furans to less than 9 grams. Less than 50 grams of 
dioxins and furans are released from municipal solid waste 
incinerators in Canada per year. I am sure the member would 
agree these are good news stories.
<P>
	A federal-provincial task force has been established by 
Environment Canada to identify and characterize additional 
sources of releases of dioxins and furans in Canada. This group 
will prepare and analysis of sectors and areas requiring further 
action to eliminate measurable releases of dioxins and furans 
and will recommend time lines for their virtual elimination from 
the environment. This task force may recommend further 
regulations under CEPA or modifications to existing guidelines.
<P>
	Furthermore, federal guidelines relating to contaminants are 
constantly under review as new scientific findings are reported. 
Health Canada is currently looking at federal guidelines for 
human exposure to dioxins set in 1990 to determine whether it is 
necessary to revise them.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 11.37 p.m.)
