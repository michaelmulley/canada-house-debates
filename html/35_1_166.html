<P>
	There has been great concern not only in my constituency and 
my area but across Canada for dangerous offenders walking our 
streets. These petitioners are asking Parliament to enact 
legislation against serious personal injury crimes being 
committed by high risk offenders by permitting the use of post 
sentence detention orders and specifically by passing Bill

<P>
	The first, certified pursuant to Standing Order 36, is signed by 
residents of Ontario and Saskatchewan, some from the town of 
Wilkie, Saskatchewan, North Battleford, Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The petitioners note that Robert Latimer of Saskatchewan was 
sentenced to life in prison for second degree murder with no 
chance of parole for 10 years. The petitioners believe the law 
should be flexible and based on the individual. They believe that 
his sentence is unfair and out of proportion.

a pardon, conditionally or unconditionally, for his conviction of 
second degree murder in the death of his daughter.

Mr. Speaker, the second petition is signed by many Canadians 
from all parts of the country.
<P>
	The petition collected by members of the Council of 
Canadians notes that the petitioners have a right to health care if 
they are sick, to education if they need training, to a pension if 
they are senior, to insurance against joblessness if they are a 
worker, to assistance if they are poor or homeless, to day care 
services if they are a parent working outside the home and to 
access to cultural institutions.
<P>
	The petitioners note that social programs form the very fabric 
of Canada and that cuts to social programs are not necessary 
since tax breaks and subsidies to wealthy individuals and 
profitable corporations have caused close to half the debt while 
social programs have caused less than 6 per cent.

Question No. 92-<B>Mr. Harper (None):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What will each department or agency spend on television, print or radio 
advertising during the 1994-95 budget year?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister of Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities):</B> The following is the amount spent on or 
committed to advertising for the period April 1, 1994 to 
November 1, 1994 by departments and agencies through the 
Advertising Management Group (AMG).
<P>
	If a department or agency is not listed, it is because there was 
no advertising activity undertaken for them by AMG in the 
stated period. Previously, departments were required to submit 
advertising plans to AMG annually. However, this was not the 
case for fiscal year 1994/95.
<P>
	On May 11, 1994, Public Works and Government Services 
Canada (PWGSC) released new guidelines for advertising and 
public opinion research contracting. AMG retains contracting 
authority for these services, as well as responsibility for 
providing advice and services to departments to ensure 
consistency with overall government priorities. The new system 
is being developed and will be implemented in fiscal year 
1995/96.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from March 1 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government; and the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party will be splitting its time.
<P>
	As this House debates the budget we are discussing the very 
future of this country. We have already mortgaged our children's 
future. They will not be paying for their own social programs. 
They will be paying for ours.
<P>
	How can government members sit here so smugly knowing 
that during the course of this Parliament the amount of money 
that we will have to make in interest payments will increase 
from $38 billion to over $50 billion? This increase of over 30 per 
cent is an additional burden that will continue to grow. Billions 
fewer dollars will be available for social programs and 
government operations.
<P>
	The government says this is good. Liberal members say it is 
all right that one-third of government spending is for 
yesterday's programs. They claim they are at least slowing down 
the rate of growth of interest payments. I do not see how it can be 
considered much of a consolation knowing that the country is 
going bankrupt at a slower rate.
<P>
	All this budget does is delay the inevitable. The fact that this 
budget was viewed as tough is not so much a compliment to this 
budget, rather it is a scathing indictment of previous budgets. If 
previous finance ministers had been sufficiently courageous to 
make the necessary cuts in the past, by today's standards those 
cuts would have been insignificant. Because they chose not to 
make those required cuts, today we have to cut deeper.
<P>
	The current Minister of Finance is now faced with tougher 
choices. He could have and should have made the rights ones. 
Short term pain for long term gain. Instead he took the more 
masochistic route of a little pain this year and even more pain in 
the following years.
<P>
	The latest budget alludes to some of the changes that are 
coming but it does not have the courage to address the problems 
in detail, head on.
<P>
	The city of White Rock in my constituency has one of the 
largest concentrations of seniors in the country. Almost 
one-third of the population is over 65 years of age. The budget 
tells Canadians the government will be releasing a paper later 
this year with changes required to the old age security and 
guaranteed income supplement programs to ensure their 
affordability. These changes are to take effect in 1997.
<P>
	The budget documents make it clear that significant changes 
are coming. While it promises undiminished protection for all 
seniors who are less well off, it gives us no numbers. What does 
this government consider to be well off? Is it $15,000, $20,000 
or $25,000?
<P>
	The Minister of Finance criticized the Reform Party for our 
taxpayers' budget which stated we would reduce the money paid 
to seniors by $3 billion. The minister stated this would affect all 
seniors earning more than $11,000. When we include OAS, GIS 
and the Canada pension plan and the fact the government pays 
out $34 billion a year to seniors, $3 billion accounts for only 8.7 
per cent of this total.
<P>
	Is this Minister of Finance suggesting that 91 per cent of 
Canadian seniors earn less than $11,000? Maybe the $11,000 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10432"> 10432 </A></B>
<P>
figure popped into the minister's head because that is the figure 
he is contemplating in the Liberals' plan.
<P>
	We also note the government's plan to reform the provision of 
old age security benefits on the basis of family income. What a 
great idea. If the government had been listening it would have 
realized the Reform Party made that a part of its zero in three 
package over two years ago. Reformers recognized the 
unfairness of the existing system at that time. Unfortunately it 
has taken the Liberals two years to recognize a good idea. Now it 
will take them another two years to act on it.
<P>
	At this rate by 1997 the Liberals will realize the value of our 
1995 taxpayers' budget. However, we will not have to worry 
about their waiting another two years to act on it because by then 
Canadian voters will have unburdened them of the challenges of 
providing the country with fiscal leadership.
<P>
	In defending the budget the Minister of Finance frequently 
commented on his belief of addressing matters with short term 
goals. This philosophy of short term goals also appears to 
include short sightedness.
<P>
	There is no better example of this than the impending crisis 
with the Canada pension plan. We have heard the plan will be 
bankrupt within 20 years unless rates are doubled. The budget 
states that in 35 years rates will almost have to triple.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	In order to deal with this impending crisis the budget says that 
the government should-actually the budget does not say 
anything. It appears this is too far in the future for the 
government to be concerned. Besides, why should cabinet 
members be concerned about the Canada pension plan when 
they have protected themselves with their own gold plated 
pension plan?
<P>
	What does this impending crisis in the CPP mean to the 
average Canadian? For salaried employees who make 
approximately $35,000, this means their contributions will have 
to jump from $850 a year to almost $2,500 a year. Every 
employee will have $140 less each month to spend.
<P>
	However, it is not just the employees who will suffer, but the 
small business person as well. A small business that employs 10 
employees who each make about $35,000 a year will have to 
come up with an additional $16,000 a year in premiums. For a 
lot of small businesses I would suggest this is a significant 
portion of the profit margin.
<P>
	The time to act on the problems with the Canada pension plan, 
old age security and guaranteed income supplement is now. 
Those people who are entering the job market today are the ones 
who will have to deal with the pension crisis in the year 2030. It 
is incumbent upon us to give them some idea of what they can 
expect for a pension and give them the opportunity to plan their 
lives accordingly.
<P>
	We know the system has to change. We know there has to be 
more individual responsibility for looking after one's 
retirement. Let us be honest with Canadians today and develop 
guidelines for them to plan for themselves in an appropriate 
manner.
<P>
	More important, let us show Canadians some leadership and 
get rid of gold plated MPs pensions. If this government has 
moved as far as it intends to move on MPs pensions, that is okay 
too. My colleagues and I are not too concerned about fighting 
the next election with the slogan: Liberals say the only way to 
get rid of the obscene MP pension plan is to vote Reform.
<P>
	I have a word of caution for those MPs who think they have it 
made because after the next election they will be collecting their 
pensions. A Reform government would make any changes in the 
new MP pension plan retroactive.
<P>
	As the baby boom generation approaches the pension years, it 
is absolutely necessary for us to get Canada's pension plans in 
order. Forget short term objectives. Think long range. As we 
continue to debate this budget we cannot think of today. We have 
to think of our children and their children who will be paying for 
our largesse.
<P>
	It is extremely unfair for our generation to ask future 
generations to pay our bills. The bottom line is simple. If our 
social programs are worth preserving, then they are worth 
paying for. It is a disgrace that the largest expenditure in the 
federal budget is interest payments.
<P>
	While the self-deluded government congratulates itself for a 
booming economy it is criminal that during a period of rapid 
growth the percentage of the budget that is consumed by interest 
payments will increase from 25 per cent to almost 33 per cent. 
This is the same error made by the previous Tory regime. In the 
boom years of the late 1980s it failed to bring the debt and 
deficit under control. When the business cycle took a downturn 
the deficit skyrocketed.
<P>
	What is this government going to do when the economy hits 
the down cycle? The Liberal strategy of maintaining the status 
quo will lead to economic disaster. The government has taken a 
small step in the right direction. Unfortunately what was needed 
was an Olympic distance long jump.
<P>
	I found it somewhat amusing when the Minister of Finance 
announced during his budget speech that he was bringing in the 
fourth largest deficit in Canadian history and his party gave him 
a standing ovation. What would number one have brought him, 
cartwheels in the aisles?
<P>
	There is nothing to be proud of in this budget. Are the Liberals 
really proud of the fact that we now spend more money in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10433"> 10433 </A></B>
<P>
servicing the debt than we do in transfers to individuals for 
social programs? Do they really think this is a good thing?
<P>
	What about our borrowing habits? Are the Liberals really 
happy that foreigners own over $300 billion of Canadian debt? 
Think about it. With this latest budget Canadians will be paying 
more money out of this country each and every year to our 
foreign creditors to pay our interest charges than we will spend 
on our old age security program. Is this something to be proud 
of?
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	The solution is simple. If people do not want budgets that are 
tailored for Bay Street or Wall Street, get rid of the deficit so we 
do not have to keep going back to them for more and more. 
Instead, this government is intent on going back and humbly 
asking for a little less each year.
<P>
	In summation the Liberals say the polls show that Canadians 
are happy with the budget. However they should look closely at 
the results of the Angus Reid poll where 39 per cent of 
Canadians felt that the level of government spending cuts were 
right; 43 per cent believed that the government cuts did not go 
far enough; and 83 per cent of Canadians are expecting further 
cuts.
<P>
	It is time for the government to be up front with Canadians. 
Make the cuts that have to be made, get our budget balanced and 
start making inroads into our obscene debt. Our children can 
expect nothing less.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, before we have 
questions or comments an error was made. In fact it was the 
Liberals' turn to speak. With your permission we will finish the 
questions and comments on the speech of the member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley and then we will go back 
to the side that should have had the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was 
interesting yesterday in question period when I raised the 
question with the Minister of Human Resources Development 
whether he was actually floating a trial balloon with the idea of 
increasing taxes.
<P>
	One of the difficulties we and I think all Canadians have is 
that we do not have any idea what the real intention of the 
government is. It keeps on talking about perhaps we should be 
taxed more or, as the Prime Minister says, perhaps the health act 
has to be completely changed, perhaps it has to be downgraded. 
The health minister says it will not happen and then the Prime 
Minister turns around the next day and says it might. It seems to 
be absolutely unclear as to what the intent of this government 
may be with respect to the health program and tax increases.
<P>
	I have felt the frustrations from people in my constituency. I 
wonder if the hon. member has had the same feelings of 
frustration from her constituents over the fact that the 
government just does not seem to be coming clean with respect 
to tax increases.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are being faced with our 
constituents who are trying to find out what there is in the future 
for them, what they can be planning for.
<P>
	With the concern of health cuts and what not, the situation is 
that the provincial governments are having to reduce services 
because they are unable to go to the people with user fees and 
whatever to provide the same level of services. The concern is 
that the government promised that those services would be 
maintained yet in this budget the government is reducing its 
equalization or transfer payments to the provinces for those 
issues.
<P>
	Constituents hear the government telling them one thing and 
see the government doing something completely different. 
There is concern and very much uncertainty out there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley made an 
interesting comparison between the effect of the Reform 
taxpayers budget and the Liberal budget.
<P>
	The hon. member said that the Reform budget has the motto 
short term pain for long term gain, whereas the Liberal budget 
takes the masochistic approach of short term pain followed by 
long term pain. It is a very interesting statement and I appreciate 
it very much. I know the hon. member explained it in her speech 
but perhaps she could explain it again so that perhaps the 
Liberals will understand why that is and why that comparison 
was made.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> I thank the hon. member for the opportunity to 
remind the government when it talks about making smaller cuts 
that what it is talking about is increasing the interest payments 
in the year 1997 to $50 billion. When the government is 
spending $50 billion on interest payments it means there will be 
less money to spend on social programming.
<P>
	The only alternative the government has is to take the long 
term approach by taking short term pain by making the cuts now, 
making sure that interest payments do not escalate to the level 
they will be escalating.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be speaking for 10 
minutes and will be sharing my time. Thank you very much for 
recognizing my opportunity to speak.

	I believe that the Minister of Finance has done a masterful job 
of calming and appeasing the the bond holders, the people who 
move capital around the world, Wall Street, all the currency 
speculators. He has done a masterful job because it was only-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> With sun glasses on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> It was only about a 
week and a half ago when I was actually inspired by the Reform 
Party's budget.
<P>
	I challenged the Reform members saying they did not put 
enough focus and attention on the human deficit. All they want 
to talk about in this Chamber is the federal deficit. They do not 
seem to communicate their concern enough, in my judgment, 
about the human deficit that is being inflicted not just upon our 
communities and our country but all countries of the world 
because of the monetary system that has evolved which many 
sovereign countries right now do not seem to have a handle on. 
We are one of them.
<P>
	The day I spoke in the House on that issue I received a paper 
from Professor Morris Miller. His paper is entitled: ``Where is 
Global Interdependence Taking Us? Why We Need a New 
Improved Bretton Woods''. I will read directly from the paper:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By early 1994 there was a perceptible rise in the level of concern with the 
focus placed on the business of derivatives that are estimated to be outstanding 
in the amount of about $16 trillion. The size and volatility has provoked a 
congressional committee hearing and prompted <I>The Economist</I> to devote the 
cover and lead editorial of the May 14-20, 1994 issue to the theme ``Your 
financial future'' and to ask what the fuss is all about. The reason given is that</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the industry is new, global and already very big: the telephone number figures for 
the supposed value of outstanding derivatives, $16 billion-plus, make the eyes 
spin-.Lastly, there are fears that the derivatives fuel financial market uncertainty 
by multiplying the leverage, debt based buying power, of hedge funds and other 
speculators, an uncertainty that could, if things went wrong, threaten the whole of 
the world financial system''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to quote from an article which appeared in the Sunday, 
March 5 Toronto <I>Star</I> business classified. It is the cover story 
``Billion-dollar boys'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Royal Bank is Canada's biggest player in international currency trading, 
turning over $20 billion U.S. or more every working day. That translates into 
$325 million a year in revenues and a healthy chunk of the $150 million in profit 
the bank earns from its treasury operations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is a 24-hour a day, 365-day a year floating crap game where the players 
never see each other, rarely talk to each other, yet can often tell by the buying 
patterns on their monitors which bank in which city is offering them the 
business.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I started off by saying that I believe the Minister of Finance 
has done a masterful job in calming and appeasing the bond 
holders. I say that because the reaction from all of these players 
has been extremely positive.
<P>
	However, I share the view of many in this House and even 
members of the opposition who ask the question: What will we 
do 30 months from now when the interest bill on our national 
debt might be $50 billion to $60 billion? What will we do when 
we have sold off federal assets coast to coast? What will we do 
when we have privatized everything that is left to be privatized? 
What will we do when transfers to universities and hospitals 
have been cut back? How will we pay the bill?
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	I suggest to the opposition that what we should do is not 
unlike what world leaders did after the second world war when 
they organized the United Nations conference on monetary and 
trade reform called Bretton Woods. Professor Morris Miller 
talks about that in his paper. That is the challenge for all of us in 
this room.
<P>
	The world monetary system is not working. It is broke. We are 
in a canoe going down the river and all of a sudden we are in the 
rapids. We all want to be responsible. We do not want to tip the 
canoe. That is why I think the Minister of Finance has done a 
masterful job in cooling out these croupiers, these international 
casino operators that move capital and control our currency. 
Exchange rates and interest rates are up and down with no public 
accountability. They are not just doing it to us, they are doing it 
to all sovereign states.
<P>
	Who are the losers? A certain group in our community is 
getting a whole lot richer and another group is getting a whole 
lot poorer. We all know this. How are we going to challenge 
these casino operators? How are we going to get at them? 
Canada cannot do it alone. Canada must have the support, not 
just of the G-7 countries but of all countries, even the new 
countries since Bretton Woods, that got together and said: ``Hey, 
we have a mess on our hands''.
<P>
	I see lots of things in the budget that are very tough for people 
who will lose their jobs. The Minister of Finance has stated that. 
What could he do? This is the best he could do with the situation 
that has evolved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Oh, really.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Absolutely. One thing 
that the Minister of Finance stated in the budget that has not 
received a lot of attention is the responsibility the financial 
institutions in the country have toward small and medium sized 
business. He challenged the financial institutions to become 
more supportive, more compassionate and caring toward the 
small business community. We all agree that in that community 
rests the best hope for putting Canadians back to work.
<P>
	In a couple of weeks we will begin meeting with the banks 
again and challenging them. I for one will be asking them: 
``How is it that you can operate private casinos, most of them in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10435"> 10435 </A></B>
<P>
my city of Toronto, pushing unaccountable billions and billions 
of dollars a day but we cannot seem to figure out a way to deal 
with small  business''. The Minister of Finance has issued that 
challenge.
<P>
	I realize my time is up but I would appeal to all members to let 
us start directing our attention toward a new Bretton Woods.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the comments made by the hon. member 
for Broadview-Greenwood, and I realize that they are not 
different from those made by other hon. members who debated 
the budgets tabled in the last 30 years: reassure investors; 
reassure the big banks; reassure everyone except the Canadian 
voters, taxpayers and workers.
<P>
	We remember their red book slogan. Strangely enough, they 
do not quote the red book as they usually do. Every time we put a 
question to the people opposite, they reply that it was in the red 
book.
<P>
	You will note that, since the budget was tabled, they tend to 
ignore the red book more often than not. Their rallying cry in 
1993 was ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. In Quebec and across Canada the 
Prime Minister repeated one single slogan: ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. I 
saw him do just that in answer to a few questions during the 
leaders' debate. Whether the question had to do with turbot or 
ski slopes, his answer was always the same: ``jobs, jobs, jobs''.
<P>
	What does the famous budget that was tabled recently have to 
say about ``jobs, jobs, jobs''? Nothing at all. They reassured 
everyone. They reassured investors and foreign markets-that is 
very important. However, the 29 million Canadians needing to 
be reassured are never mentioned. Therefore, I wish to ask him 
what he is doing to create jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize 
that I cannot flash the red book around because some people 
would consider it a display. I want to read from it. At page 109 it 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>New multilateral regimes are needed to address many emerging global issues: 
the management of global fish stocks, the protection of the world's atmosphere, 
the maintenance of biodiversity, the control of population growth, the 
resettlement of refugees, and the equitable sharing of global wealth and 
resources. A Liberal government will foster the development of such 
multilateral forums and agreements, including an improved Law of the Sea, a 
new agreement on global warming, an improved international code of human 
rights, and a new agenda for development that matches the Secretary General's 
<I>Agenda for Peace</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to think that when the red book talks about an 
equitable sharing of global wealth and resources, that deals 
directly with my remarks today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
rather surprised, if not disappointed, that the hon. member again 
brought up the issue of the so-called human deficit, as though 
human deficit means that if governments are not prepared to 
make the cuts today they are somehow more compassionate than 
if they make the necessary cuts to be able to protect the ability to 
fund these programs.
<P>
	I submit that the government with this budget has gone further 
to lose the ability to control our currency and we are becoming 
involved in the international currency casinos, as the hon. 
member has stated.
<P>
	Pragmatist that he is, I wonder if he is being realistic in 
suggesting that Canada, as a bit player in the global world 
economy, can actually bring about the kind of restructuring he is 
talking about. Second, what is his position on the so-called 
Tobin tax, that is, trying to recapture some taxes in the actual 
exchange of currency around the world?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I want to deal with Canada's role on the world stage. I had 
the privilege of working for a prime minister who, the history of 
the world will show, was one of the great leaders on the world 
stage and helped move Canada forward on that stage with the 
respect of nearly everyone.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	The popularity of, the current Prime Minister is even greater 
than my former boss'. His relationship with President Clinton is 
extraordinary. I am optimistic that if they get together with a few 
other leaders-the problems are the same for all-we can get the 
process started.
<P>
	In response to the second point on the Tobin tax I say briefly 
that part of a new Bretton Woods would have to look seriously at 
the Tobin tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has been two weeks now since the Minister of Finance 
presented his budget. I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on it 
and to share some of the views of my constituents after having 
two weeks to consider its implications.
<P>
	The people of London-Middlesex have been very 
congratulatory toward the Minister of Finance. Despite the 
remarks of some members in the opposition they are very 
pleased the minister actually met the deficit targets he had set. 
There may be debate about those targets but he announced the 
targets and actually met them. He is the first minister to do so in 
years. This was very positively received by my constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10436"> 10436 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He has exceeded them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> He exceeded those targets. They see this not as 
the ultimate end but as a major step in the right direction, 
contrary to what we have witnessed over the past several years.
<P>
	What the minister has done in the budget is put the Canadian 
family on a diet. We have gained an unhealthy, crushing weight 
which must be lost. We know that. It is the deficit and the debt. 
This weight was not gained suddenly. It was not gained 
overnight. No one party, no one group of our society is at fault 
here, despite the views of some that look for simplistic answers 
and are quick to point the finger. This crushing weight was 
gained as a nation and that is how it must be lost. It must be lost 
gradually. It will not be effectively lost in any sudden 
downsizing or slash and burn approach to the problem.
<P>
	Similarly it is a sensible way for an individual to lose weight. 
Canadians are all too familiar with the problem, many of them 
being overweight, as I confess to be. It is the sensible approach 
to take in trying to deal with the serious economic problems we 
face.
<P>
	In October 1993 two visions were put before the people of 
Canada about this serious problem. There was the gradual, 
determined downsizing approach of our party and the more 
dramatic, sudden effort to downsize put forward by the Reform 
Party. In a democratic way the people of Canada spoke on 
October 25, 1993. They made it very clear with the results by 
passing judgment on the previous government's efforts in this 
regard. They very clearly chose between the two options 
presented by the Liberal Party and the Reform Party.
<P>
	It is clear to me as it is to most Canadians that this nation 
deliberately chose a sensible, gradual approach to downsizing 
and to eliminating the deficit and debt. Given the reception of 
the budget in the two weeks since it was presented, Canadians 
have once again endorsed this approach.
<P>
	Acceptance of this budget is very high. National and 
international financial experts have lauded it as balanced, as 
fair, as a common sense way to deal with our problems. I am not 
necessarily enamoured of experts, frankly. The people I am most 
interested in hearing from are the people of Canada. Roughly 70 
per cent of them-this has varied by a point here or there from 
day to day-have consistently said they are pleased with the 
budget brought in by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	There are those critics that feel the budget was too easy, too 
soft and not tough enough. It is interesting because in consulting 
very widely with my constituents I have not heard that from the 
poor in the country. I have not heard it from the unemployed. I 
have not heard from the disadvantaged that the budget was too 
easy or too soft. I would submit that it certainly was not too easy 
or too soft.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Then we have critics who suggest that the budget is much too 
fair and is draconian in what it is attempting to do. I do not hear 
that from people who are trying to find work and are looking to 
us to help create jobs.
<P>
	The unemployed with whom I have spoken know full well that 
if the government is to help create the climate for jobs and help 
them find meaningful employment, it will be done by putting 
our financial house in order.
<P>
	I was gratified to hear from some of the unemployed in my 
riding that they understand the minister had to make the tough 
choices he made and the road to their personal economic future 
is that the nation's finances must be put back in order.
<P>
	We hear seven or eight provinces claiming to be the hardest 
hit. How seven or eight provinces are hardest hit by the budget is 
beyond me, but that is exactly what we have been hearing.
<P>
	When I hear a cry from one side that it is much too tough and 
from the other side that it is not tough enough, I am inclined to 
say that many of my constituents believe the budget is well 
balanced. It is tough but fair and the minister got it about right.
<P>
	They do not like all of the budget. I do not like each and every 
single thing in the budget. Certainly Canadians do not like the 
pain that is in the budget for them individually, be they farmers 
in western Canada or some of my farm constituents, be they 
business people-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Nothing is perfect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is right. Nothing is perfect and no budget 
is perfect. However Canadians generally accept that the budget 
is tough and fair and that the cuts undertaken were necessary.
<P>
	Let me come to my constructive criticism that I have had the 
opportunity to make personally to the Prime Minister. In certain 
cases we could be selectively tougher. That is the way I would 
put it.
<P>
	I hope future budgets will be a little tougher on wealthy 
individuals and corporations. I applaud the move to be tougher 
with the banks, but perhaps we will have to go further. Quite 
frankly the signal I hear from the minister and from the 
government. There is a message in the budget for the banks, for 
wealthy individuals and for corporations that there are other 
budgets to come and if they are not going to do more to help the 
economy of the country get going tougher measures can be 
brought in. This is something I will be watching closely as a 
Canadian and as a member of Parliament on the government side 
of the House.
<P>
	The specifics of the budget are well known, but let me recall 
for Canadians two or three of the most important points. The key 
interim deficit target, as I said, was met and exceeded as my 
colleagues have pointed out: 3 per cent GDP by 1996-97.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10437"> 10437 </A></B>
<P>
	The debt to GDP ratio, the size of the debt relative to the 
economy, begins to decline in 1996-97. The cartoon many of us 
saw was very appropriate. It was of Canada moving along the 
road, suddenly hitting something called the Martin budget and 
making a significant turn in the road. The budget represents a 
significant turn in the road. We are now on the path to getting out 
of the deficit and debt spiral we have put ourselves in for too 
long as a country.
<P>
	For every dollar in new tax revenues $7 in expenditure 
reductions were made. That is the kind of downsizing Canadians 
are looking for from government.
<P>
	To those who say that the budget was too tough, I say reflect 
on the debt load of the country. We do not want to see a collapse 
of our social programs. The cuts that were undertaken are 
necessary to ensure the social programs put in place by past 
Liberal governments, with I acknowledge many ideas coming 
from the NDP, will be preserved.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	To those who say the budget was not tough enough, I say 
consider the reduced spending, the downsizing of government 
and the hitting of our targets. Indeed it was a job well done. 
Seventy per cent of Canadians support the budget. That is the 
reality.
<P>
	I know it is not politically popular in certain parts of the 
House to acknowledge that fact. I understand that, but the reality 
is that it has been a widely accepted budget. It is one that 
Canadians can look forward to seeing repeated in years to come 
by the minister and the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always enjoy hearing the hon. member for 
London-Middlesex talk about fairness in the country and in the 
budget. I remind him that during the election the government 
promised to keep article XI of the GATT negotiations. It had to 
break that promise. Fairness is fairness; it could not do much 
about it.
<P>
	In the federal budget the government announced a three-year 
withdrawal of funding for genetic evaluation and milk recording 
programs because they were contrary to GATT. It seems to me 
the same week the U.S. government announced an additional 
$600 million of funding toward these programs. Is that fairness? 
Is that the type of protection the government is to give its dairy 
farmers?
<P>
	I know we do not need subsidies, but surely to goodness there 
should be some fairness. Or, are government members trying to 
make sure they have a good supply of chocolate milk from the 
president? We could be running short of fairness and I am 
wondering how he would justify it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from my 
colleague.
<P>
	On article XI, 20 per cent of my constituents are agricultural 
people in rural settings. As the hon. member well knows, one of 
the first issues the government dealt with was article XI. My 
constituents and I submit that most Canadian farmers 
understand, as the member said, we could not do much about it. 
Canada stood alone and voted to maintain article XI. I do not 
know what else the government could have done than to stand 
alone, virtually totally alone in the world on something that 
important.
<P>
	For my colleague's information, my riding of 
London-Middlesex in southwestern Ontario is one of the most 
active dairy farming parts of Canada. Before the budget the 
concern brought to me was that the government would somehow 
give into pressure and suddenly totally end dairy subsidies.
<P>
	Frankly as late as last week some leading dairy farmers in my 
riding advised me that the 15 per cent cut followed by am 
additional 15 per cent cut was the kind of gradual, common 
sense reduction that would allow them to adjust. They were 
relieved that the government had the common sense not to 
suddenly end the subsidy because there were those calling for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member said that he was proud of the government's budget, that 
he was proud it met the deficit target for the first year, and that 
the budget must be balanced slowly.
<P>
	If the budget must be balanced slowly, how will the 
government explain to Canadians in two years when interest 
payments will have increased from $39 billion a year to $51 
billion?
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood asked the question 
a few minutes ago. What will we do when Canada faces federal 
government interest payments of $50 billion to $60 billion a 
year? His answer was that we would hold a world meeting like 
the one held after the second world war to deal with the problem.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member think the problem should be dealt with 
in a world meeting which may or may not happen? Or, should we 
face the reality of government overspending and deal with the 
problem in Canada by setting a definite target for deficit 
elimination, complete elimination, and meeting it, not just 
reducing the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is whether we should 
concentrate on the problems here or have a world meeting, The 
answer is pretty easy and obvious. Of course we should do both. 
Canada does not stand alone in the world. No country, not even 
the greatest economic giants, can isolate itself from the global 
world situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10438"> 10438 </A></B>
<P>
	Obviously we have to do both and the Minister of Finance has 
done just that. That is why the budget is being applauded both at 
home and by international experts throughout the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
inform you that I will be sharing my speaking time with my 
colleague from Manicouagan.
<P>
	On Monday, February 27, the Minister of Finance tabled his 
1995 budget before this House. Make no mistake about where I 
am coming from. I am, of course, in favour of streamlining 
public expenditures. I am also for a fair and efficient method of 
taxation by which the rich pay more and the less fortunate are 
protected.
<P>
	How can this government keep hitting on the same group of 
people time after time, with each new budget measure, 
penalizing middle income taxpayers and digging into their 
pockets for millions and millions of dollars when it would be so 
easy to deal with the real problem and collect substantial 
amounts in a jiffy by making those who can afford it pay their 
share?
<P>
	With its new budget, this government will cut $560 million in 
subsidies paid to railway companies with respect to grain 
transportation. At the same time, milk producers are seeing their 
subsidies cut without any compensation. It will be no news to 
anyone if I tell you that half of milk produced in Canada comes 
from Quebec. Yet, let it be known that our province is not as 
fortunate as Western provinces. No one told us about the rise in 
the price of milk, bread, butter and other dairy products that will 
result from this budget.
<P>
	Who will foot the bill, if not the little people? Stop cutting 
essential public services and social assistance, which are so vital 
in these times we are going through. Why wait until 1999 to 
enforce the 21-year rule with respect to taxing capital gains on 
investments in family trusts? Why not start right now? Can you 
tell me why this four-year delay is necessary? Must I remind 
you that the Liberal government is thereby forfeiting hundreds 
of millions in revenue each year? Can we afford to do without 
such revenue at this time? Not likely.
<P>
	And what about tax havens? There is nothing whatsoever in 
this budget concerning the 16 tax treaties Canada has signed 
with countries considered as tax havens. What are we to make of 
a $100 million temporary tax on the capital of banks, when the 
Royal Bank's net profit for 1994 was $1,169,000,000? The same 
year, it paid its president $2,740,000. I wonder at what rate that 
salary was taxed.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	What is the result of that nice performance? The Royal Bank 
laid off 3,500 employees.
<P>
	Let us recover the unpaid taxes and GST payments. According 
to the auditor general, thousands of companies owe several 
billion dollars in unpaid taxes on their profits. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance put himself in the shoes of an 
ordinary person, who does not share his philosophy and 
certainly not his definition of philanthropy?
<P>
	The speech made by the hon. member is laudable, honourable 
and perhaps justified, but can the same be said of his motives, or 
are those merely related to the referendum?
<P>
	The money saved by making cuts to the UI program and 
transfer payments to the provinces is now used to finance part of 
the provinces' spending on welfare, post-secondary education 
and health.
<P>
	I do not understand why these cuts do not apply to 1995; they 
are being postponed until 1996, 1997 and 1998.
<P>
	Does the minister really think that no one will notice? I am 
convinced that, faced with the same situation, the federal 
government would have noticed.
<P>
	On February 26, it was reported in the media that Quebec was 
deprived of $650 million in the national defence sector. What 
better way to correct that injustice than to eliminate 285 direct 
jobs at the Bagotville military base? The same could be said 
about the Saint-Hubert base. Yes, 285 jobs and, in the process, 
an elementary school with 10 classrooms. The fact is that over 
1,000 people will be affected by these cuts. Once again, a 
decision was made without those affected being consulted. 
Entire families will be uprooted from their community. 
Following these cuts, how many small businesses from my 
region will have to lay off people or even shut down? The local 
population just does not accept that decision. It would be more 
appropriate to refer to my region as the queen of unemployment 
rather than the kingdom of Saguenay.
<P>
	That decision will result in the loss of several million dollars 
for the region. While the province of Quebec is starting to 
recover from a hard recession, our region of 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean is sinking deeper and deeper into an 
inescapable economic slump. Our young people are leaving in 
droves.
<P>
	Just take a look at the most recent data released by Statistics 
Canada. Last month, our unemployment rate jumped by one per 
cent, while it went down by one per cent just about everywhere 
else in the country.
<P>
	The ICI organization in my region summed it up well when it 
stated that, and I quote: ``Our region is a group of distinct 
communities which, as everyone knows, contribute a lot, in their 
own way, to the social, cultural, economic and political 
enrichment of Quebec and Canada''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10439"> 10439 </A></B>
<P>
	What better way to thank that region and its residents for their 
support than to cut over 285 jobs in the military sector?
<P>
	In addition to holding many surprises for the years following 
the referendum, the 1995 budget does not deal with the real 
issue. It does not deal with unemployment.
<P>
	The Liberal government refuses to use the surplus in the UI 
fund to implement concrete job-creating initiatives. The 
government wants to reduce the deficit, but it does not resort to 
concrete measures and prefers to transfer the problem to the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I realize once again that, with its budget, the Liberal 
government is showing all Quebecers that the federal system 
does not work and that it would be much wiser on our part to get 
rid of it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a very simple question for the hon. member for Chicoutimi. He 
referred at length to the budget and to the connection he sees 
with the forthcoming referendum in Quebec.
<P>
	Since he brought this up, I wonder whether the hon. member 
for Chicoutimi is in favour, as his leader seems to be, of 
changing the question for the referendum. The issue is relevant 
to this debate on the Budget, since he mentioned it himself. 
Furthermore, it creates a climate of uncertainty, as Premier 
Parizeau clearly admitted in his various speeches and statements 
on Parti Quebecois policy.
<P>
	Considering the impact of this issue on the economy of the 
country and on the budgetary process, I would like to know 
whether the hon. member for Chicoutimi personally favours 
changing the question, or whether he would agree that this is a 
lot of window dressing, in other words, an attempt to manipulate 
the electorate. The option has not changed. It is still the same. 
The option is independence or federalism, and as far as I know 
that has not changed; but as far as change in the referendum 
question is concerned, we can expect, or at least we have the 
impression that there is some trickery afoot. I would be 
interested to hear the hon. member's position on this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am not so sure the 
question as such has a direct connection with the budget. 
However, I will respond to the issue raised by the hon. member 
for Sherbrooke and tell him that, for the time being, everything 
is on the table.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Sherbrooke had any suggestions for 
the Government of Quebec as to the form and substance of the 
question to be asked in the referendum, he could have 
participated in a democratic exercise in which the National 
Assembly of Quebec gave all residents a chance to be heard. He 
failed to participate in this exercise which would have given him 
a chance to explain his position before the public.
<P>
	I could also mention the outcome of the election in 
Brome-Missisquoi. I think voters made it quite clear to the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke that what he represented was not 
what they wanted. His party came in fourth or fifth.
<P>
	My position is that, with our natural resources, with our 
culture and with everything we have developed in Quebec in 
recent years, the people are ready for this question, and they are 
ready to say yes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, sometimes I wonder 
how much longer we will have to endure this same tiresome line 
from the Bloc, constantly referring everything that happens in 
this House to the specifics of how it will affect Quebec. Never 
mind the country, just Quebec. Frankly, it drives me nuts.
<P>
	He mentioned the milk subsidies and the 30 per cent cut over 
two years. He said the west received a much better deal because 
it received restitution for the cut of the Crow benefit. I wonder if 
he realizes or if he chooses to ignore that the cut to the Crow 
benefit was 100 per cent and immediate. He is talking about a 30 
per cent cut over two years.
<P>
	He also states quite correctly that 50 per cent of fluid milk 
production comes from Quebec. I wonder what he thinks will 
happen to all that subsidized milk production if he gets his 
dream of independence and the Canadian market is cut off, as it 
naturally would be-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think the question is clear.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I must say that Quebec has 
been trying for over 100 years. Quebecers delegated members of 
Parliament to this House to defend their ideas.
<P>
	We realized, at the end of debates, that our very simple 
questions were getting very little response. Whether it is 
agriculture, rail transportation or natural resource development, 
Quebec has always had to fight harder to achieve its goals. 
Today, with what we are offering Quebecers-and rest assured 
that we will be able to sell our dairy products, regardless, 
because they are quality products-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Order, please. Debate resumes with 
the hon. member for Manicouagan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we were promised a tough budget focused on renewal. Tough, it 
was for sure. But it was tough for the disadvantaged, once again, 
with social programs being blithely cut directly and indirectly. 
As for the renewal part of it, it did not quite make it. There was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10440"> 10440 </A></B>
<P>
no provision for job creation. Let us look at a few examples to 
justify my remarks.
<P>
	I represent the riding of Manicouagan. In this riding, social 
programs take on considerable importance because the rate of 
unemployment is higher than the national average and also 
because the distances between villages is a serious impediment 
to the region's economic development.
<P>
	When I say the rate of unemployment is high, it is true. And 
when the minister once again with a vengeance went after the 
most disadvantaged, that is the unemployed, well, the people in 
our area were affected on February 27 by the tabling of this 
budget. Already, in a region like ours, where, east of 
Natashquan, 85 per cent of the population depends on fishing, 
the people had to work 12 weeks in 1994 instead of the previous 
10, in order to qualify for unemployment insurance.
<P>
	In my riding, and more particularly east of Natashquan, 
managing to have six weeks' work was quite an achievement, 
given that the department of fisheries, on the other hand, was 
cutting quotas in order to preserve stocks. I do not question the 
merits of this, but people were losing weeks of work on the sea 
so stocks could be preserved. When you try to relate these two, 
that is, preservation of stocks and therefore fewer weeks of 
fishing, on the one hand, and the need for more weeks of work to 
be eligible for unemployment insurance, on the other, things do 
not add up once again.
<P>
	In his February 27 budget, the Minister of Finance found 
another way to go after the people of Manicouagan. Just like 
that, he said that he was going to cut their unemployment 
insurance cheques by 10 per cent. In a way, he makes no 
distinction between people who live in Manicouagan, 
Saint-Hubert, Laurier-Sainte-Marie or Charlevoix.
<P>
	In addition, my region is affected by the $300 million cuts to 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The 
unemployment rate is very high, as I said, and, consequently, 
many people live in housing managed by the CMHC. For 
unemployed people, and for those who have gone a step further 
and receive social assistance, finding low-rental housing is of 
capital importance. With one stroke of the pen, the minister 
added another hardship to the lives of the needy who, like you 
and me, will always be in need of lodging.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	There are vital needs that the government must not play with 
if it wants to maintain the standard of living, such as food and 
lodging. In one speech, the Minister of Finance went after both 
simultaneously.
<P>
	By skimming 10 per cent from unemployment insurance 
cheques, he took away quality and a good part of the food. By 
cutting the CMHC's funding by $300 million, he deprived many 
households, many families, often single-parent families, might 
I add, according to the statistics, of decent housing. Therefore, 
how much respect can the government really have for the 
population if it is not even committed to keeping just the basic 
elements that make up society's standard of living?  If that is not 
taking it out on the needy, I do not know what is.
<P>
	People in my riding will also be affected by changes to the 
health care and education system, but naturally, in an indirect 
way. Indirect because the minister calls these indirect cuts 
``decentralization''. Allow me to explain. The minister 
anticipates that transfer payments to the provinces will be cut by 
$7 billion. Now, we all know that the provinces use that money 
to provide health care and education to their population. Yes, 
there is duplication, because the provinces are already 
administering these programs. But it is not decentralization, it is 
dumping the deficit in the provinces' backyards.
<P>
	They are offloading the deficit because the provinces will get 
$7 billion less but will still be expected to provide the same 
services. However, the federal government is careful not to 
withdraw completely from health care and education for the 
simple reason that it wants to standardize these areas and raise 
standards so that it will be a little more costly for the provinces 
to operate in these fields.
<P>
	They cut their financial support every year but still manage to 
give just enough to impose standards that end up costing a lot of 
money. They cut financial support without giving the provinces 
any additional decision-making powers. The minister calls this 
``decentralization'', but in truth it amounts to offloading their 
deficit onto the provinces.
<P>
	When people get sick in my riding on the North Shore, where 
the roads are inadequate, they must be transported by plane. We 
must give financial help to some doctors so that they can travel 
to remote areas like the North Shore. One does not choose to get 
sick in Kuujjuaq or Natashquan any more than in downtown 
Toronto.
<P>
	There is also the gasoline tax. Again, the Minister of Finance 
did not discriminate, but that is not necessarily a good thing. Let 
us not forget that unemployed people looking for jobs hope that 
any dollar they put in their gas tanks will yield results. This 
measure will affect them indirectly once again. The budget does 
not say anything about job creation. The Liberal government got 
elected on its red book promises by shouting from the rooftops 
that they would create jobs.
<P>
	In the first year of his mandate, the Minister of Finance and all 
the other Liberal members proclaimed to all and sundry that 
they would address the deficit by creating jobs. Yet, the 
February 27 budget showed us the true face of the Liberal Party, 
which does not do anything to create jobs. Instead, they went 
after the most needy while protecting their friends and being 
careful to keep up appearances and look good, which is 
important to the Liberal Party, of course. When I say that they 
are protecting their friends, I am referring among other things to 
family trusts. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10441"> 10441 </A></B>
<P>
However, I will not elaborate on this, because I do not have 
enough time.
<P>
	This budget is a skilful political juggling act but in fact, there 
is nothing in it which really addresses the real social problems 
by creating jobs.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member talked about the cuts in transfers to provinces under the 
Liberal budget. He talked about them as being downloading, 
which they are.
<P>
	In the Reform taxpayers' budget, the alternative budget 
Reform presented, we also had reductions in transfers to 
provinces. We transferred the tax points along with the 
reductions. We transferred the ability of the provinces to raise 
the revenue to compensate for this reduction in transfers to 
provinces.
<P>
	Let us use the analogy of a chicken and an egg. The 
government now transfers eggs to provinces so they can pay for 
some of their programs, done through transfer payments. 
Instead of transferring individual eggs to the provinces, the 
Liberals transferred a carton of eggs except they removed two. 
Therefore they transferred 10 eggs instead of the dozen. They 
cut the transfers.
<P>
	There are also strings attached because of the regulations 
under the Canada Health Act. Instead of transferring the carton 
with fewer eggs Reform transferred the whole chicken. That is 
the program. We transferred the revenue producing ability to the 
provinces. Instead of transferring individual eggs and keeping 
the chicken as the Liberals have done in their program, Reform 
transferred the whole chicken so that revenue is in the hands of 
the provinces. They can fund these programs.
<P>
	This would be popular in Quebec. Quebecers want more 
control of their future. Quebec generally is in favour of 
decentralization to the provinces.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to respond to what the Liberals 
have done in cutting transfers and not cutting the revenue 
producing ability as compared to what Reform proposed in the 
taxpayers' budget of cutting transfers to provinces but giving 
provinces the power to collect that revenue instead of the federal 
government and therefore giving provinces much more control 
over their own programs and their own resources.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. St-Laurent:</B> You know, Mr. Speaker, each minute the 
House sits is very important and certainly costs taxpayers a lot 
of money. I have great respect for the Reform Party's 
hypothetical budget, but if we start hypothesizing about 
hypothetical budgets in the House of Commons, we better 
change its name to House of Utopia.
<P>
	I think our taxpayers deserve more respect than that. I have 
respect for the Reform Party and its budget, but 
unfortunately-or perhaps fortunately; Canada will decide after 
the referendum-this party is not in power. Let us look at more 
factual matters, matters before us today and that we have to deal 
with. Much as I respect Reform Party members, the fact remains 
that their Party's budget is nothing more than a piece of paper 
for the time being.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of my most rewarding duties as a member of 
Parliament is to visit schools in my riding and meet with 
students.
<P>
	Three weeks ago I participated in such a visit. As usual I 
found the questions asked by the students quite interesting, the 
Quebec referendum, unemployment insurance and the 
environment.
<P>
	I was struck by a very distressing thought. Each of these 
students has a huge debt hanging over their head. Because of the 
size of our national debt, those young students are starting out 
life with a $19,000 mortgage. Unlike past generations that could 
build their hopes and dreams on the solid granite of public 
finances, these young people are building their dreams on 
quicksand.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	I cannot accept that. I entered politics to give a voice to young 
Canadians too often forgotten by past governments. It is 
fundamentally unfair to expect young Canadians to pay a debt 
incurred by past generations. It is particularly irresponsible for 
Canadians who have lived beyond their means for so many 
years.
<P>
	That is why I am so proud to be a member of this government. 
This is a moment of great importance in our history. For the first 
time in many years Canada has a government and a finance 
minister ready to do what must be done in order to control the 
deficit.
<P>
	The minister's budget speech was nothing less than a call to 
arms to all Canadians. We must band together to defeat the 
deficit and the debt. Steadily, silently these two economic forces 
are robbing our government of the strength and sapping it of the 
vitality it needs to foster growth, care for the needy and invest in 
the future.
<P>
	For too long governments have postponed tough decisions. 
For too long governments have been pretending everything was 
fine while borrowing another $30 billion and $40 billion from 
our children. Now we have finally turned the corner.
<P>
	A nation that has been sleep walking toward the precipice of 
bankruptcy has awakened with one foot on the edge of the cliff. 
Our government has the will to do what is necessary. As 
important, it has the support of the Canadian people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10442"> 10442 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians are willing to support this government because 
they have seen the positive results of our financial stewardship. 
In the first year of our mandate 433,000 new jobs were created, 
all of them full time. Canada's economy grew at about 4.5 per 
cent, the fastest of the G-7. Manufacturing output is up over 9 
per cent and inflation is at its lowest rate in 30 years.
<P>
	At the local level the results are as encouraging. In Toronto 
unemployment dropped from 12 per cent to 9 per cent between 
January 1994 and January 1995. In my area of York region 
unemployment insurance claims have dropped from 70,491 to 
13,773 in the same period.
<P>
	When I speak to people in my riding I sense a renewed sense 
of hope, a sense of confidence. Business people are investing 
again, Canadians are working again.
<P>
	Canadians know that our recovery will be threatened unless 
we get our financial house in order. They realize everyone must 
make sacrifices. Canadians must all share the burden of debt 
reduction.
<P>
	Our government will reduce spending but it will also 
rationalize its operations, targeting spending to where it can do 
the most good. For every $1 of new tax revenue there will be $7 
worth of cuts in expenditure.
<P>
	Above and beyond deficit targets, this budget is about 
reinventing government. It clarifies the role of government 
within a new socioeconomic order in which the old rules do not 
apply.
<P>
	To improve Canada's social safety net our government will 
introduce a number of innovative measures. It will establish the 
Canada social transfer. The CST will replaced established 
programs financing and the Canada assistance plan. It will cut 
unnecessary red tape, ensuring that the provinces will have 
maximum flexibility to design the programs that meet their 
needs.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The budget also calls for the creation of a human resources 
investment fund. The fund would involve a broad approach to 
employability issues. The functioning of the Canadian labour 
market would be in congruence with UI reform and the 
consolidated transfer.
<P>
	The human resources investment fund could encompass 
support for a wide range of employment development services 
including assessment, counselling, training, work experience, 
self-employment and community development; the 
development of occupational standards; national labour market 
information; sectoral councils; child care for working parents; a 
national workplace strategy; programs and services responsive 
to the needs of aboriginal Canadians; assistance for persons with 
disabilities; and assistance for students and adult learners.
<P>
	The restructuring and redesigning of programs could be based 
on principles established by the social security reform and 
linked to increased flexibility in the use of the UI fund. These 
principles include tailored programs to individual client needs, 
delivery involving community  partners and the private sector, 
the use of modern technologies, national standards and 
priorities.
<P>
	The government intends to reform the UI system to bring it 
into line with the new economic realities facing the nation. A 
greater emphasis will be placed on helping Canadians acquire 
skills and find work. We will move away from traditional UI and 
focus on investing in people. We will replace despair, 
dependency and defeatism with ambition, autonomy and 
advancement.
<P>
	The government has signalled its intention to protect senior 
citizens. At present old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement cost Canadians over $20 billion a year. It is 
estimated the cost will increase by 60 per cent over the next 15 
years as the population ages. Clearly Canadians would want us 
to do something about it.
<P>
	The 1995 budget sets out the principles that will govern the 
reform of OAS and GIS: undiminished protection for less well 
off seniors, continuation of full indexation of benefits, OAS 
benefits to be provided with reference to family income levels, 
greater progressivity of benefits by income level and control of 
program costs. This will be a very important step toward 
achieving intergenerational equity.
<P>
	These are all positive developments in the evolution of the 
nation. The budget holds the promise of a better tomorrow. It 
says to Canadians that the sacrifices we make today are for a 
greater good. Sound public finances are the bedrock of a 
prosperous future. Freedom from debt is the greatest legacy we 
can leave our children.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
first congratulate the parliamentary secretary on his last phrase. 
He said that freedom from debt was the greatest legacy we could 
leave our children, if I understood correctly. I only wish he had 
said that in the years he was sitting on this side of the House. 
However that is another story.
<P>
	I want to put a question to the parliamentary secretary who I 
know is very much in the loop in terms of what is happening 
within government. I asked him a question about 10 days ago in 
the House relative to pension reform that he talked about in his 
speech. He evoked principles relative to pension reform. I am 
very interested in the issue. It is one that needs to be tackled 
head on. I agree this is something that requires the immediate 
attention of the country if we are to resolve some of the difficult 
issues.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I am assuming the government is not improvising pension 
reform, something so important that the parliamentary secretary 
chose to speak to it. For example, he mentioned a 60 per cent 
increase in expenditures over 15 years. That is not a number he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10443"> 10443 </A></B>
<P>
invented or drew out of a hat. It must have come from 
somewhere.
<P>
	Given the importance of the issue to all Canadians and the 
consequences evoked-and I believe there is a bit of a hidden 
agenda in the budget-I have a very direct and simple question 
for the parliamentary secretary. In fairness to Canadians is the 
government willing to have all Canadians participate in the 
debate so we will all know what the choices are?
<P>
	I guess whether he answers will be an indication of whether 
there is a hidden agenda. Will the government agree to table in 
the House of Commons for all of us to see, read and reflect upon 
the studies the government has undertaken with regard to 
pension reform?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member 
that it is a very important issue. A lot is at stake in the issue of 
social security reform.
<P>
	Unlike past governments that ran away from the challenge of 
discussing major issues such as training, unemployment 
insurance, child care, and reforming and modernizing the 
system, we decided to engage Canadians in the dialogue and to 
consult with Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member can rest assured the government will 
consult Canadians on any measure we take related to the issue of 
pension reform. It will consult all members of the House in the 
same manner and fashion as we engaged in prebudget 
consultations, social security review and many other issues 
ranging from defence to external affairs. The government has 
created many opportunities for Canadians to participate in 
dialogue with the Government of Canada.
<P>
	With reference to the specific question on pension reform, the 
hon. member has clearly read the budget documents. He has read 
the five principles outlined. From the day the Minister of 
Finance tabled the document until today nothing has changed on 
the government's agenda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed the parliamentary secretary's kind words, but 
there is a saying on the farm that kind words and good intentions 
do not feed too many animals.
<P>
	I am just wondering how he can say that the government is 
after financial stewardship. At the research station at Morden, 
one of the most successful research stations in Canada, 40 per 
cent of the jobs were cut. It took away the buckwheat program 
and the potato program. It moved them up north where they 
could all freeze. Is that good financial planning?
<P>
	I see their pension funds have not been cut too drastically. 
However, does he know of a program called the Canadian polar 
commission? The polar commission takes $1,081,000 from the 
government. It employs six people and half the money goes to 
salaries. The commission spends on the dissemination of 
information. The amount of transfers to people looking into this 
matter is $20,000.
<P>
	Is it financial responsibility to spend $20,000 out of 
$1,081,000 on the actual work and the rest on salaries? I would 
like to see some improvements there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, at the expense of sounding 
immodest, we have to look at the record. When we look at job 
creation under the government we see 433,000 new jobs. We 
also see a government that is looking at a number of issues 
including program reviews. It is looking at the programs that are 
working and the ones that are not. It is creating a climate for new 
jobs.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	If the hon. member had listened to the speech of the Minister 
of Finance speech, he would have found that we are hitting all 
the targets we have set. We are moving toward achieving the 
results that Canadians wanted during the election campaign.
<P>
	The red book is being honoured and Canadians seem to be 
extremely happy with the performance of the present 
government. Perhaps the hon. member should join in the 
applause.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am anxious to participate in the debate on the 1995 
budget because I believe it represents an historic occasion in our 
country's evolution.
<P>
	It is not the kind of budget I would normally want for Canada. 
I would rather enhance programs than reduce them. I would 
rather be involved in introducing new programs than analysing 
the effectiveness of existing ones. As Liberals I am sure most of 
us agree that the budget was born of necessity, not ideology.
<P>
	Our social programs are threatened by our cumulative debt 
and our annual deficit. I am not one of those obsessed by debt. 
My banker can attest to that. However, I am very protective of 
our sovereignty as a nation and our ability to design and 
implement public policy and programs that reflect Canada's 
values as a generous and civilized nation.
<P>
	Because we borrowed to finance our programs we have 
allowed foreign lenders to affect domestic policy in a manner 
that simply is unacceptable. We must reclaim our ability to 
pursue a style of governance that reflects Canadian values: 
compassion, equity, tolerance and pluralism. These are 
Canadian values. Many elements of the Canadian way of life 
may be uniquely Canadian. Our responsibility is not only to 
these ideals as they affect us as a nation. Our responsibility is to 
these ideals as a world leader, as a country that others turn to.
<P>
	Another threat our social programs face is much more 
practical. In 1995-96 debt charges will consume $49.5 billion of 
our annual spending. Over the last 15 years interest payments 
have grown from $8.5 billion to $42 billion and have devoured 
over $445 billion of taxpayers' money, dollars I would much 
prefer to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10444"> 10444 </A></B>
<P>
see placed in the hands of Canadians in need, dollars better spent 
on social housing or literacy instruction, dollars we need to 
eradicate child poverty, and dollars we need to meet our  
international obligations as a nation of great wealth and 
advantage. The thought of how much better we might use these 
dollars causes me to accept the need to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	The unproductive nature of interest expenditure is partially 
responsible for the resistance of Canadians to broad tax 
increases. Our citizens pay more but see less in return as we 
finance past expenditure.
<P>
	Even as I speak in favour of deficit reduction, I call on our 
government to exercise compassion and creativity as it 
implements the budget over the next 12 months. All Canadians 
must share in the mission of reclaiming our fiscal and monetary 
autonomy. In return, government has the responsibility to be 
fair, creative, thoughtful and forthright.
<P>
	The approach I endorse contrasts dramatically with that 
outlined by the Reform Party in its recent attempt at a budget 
proposal. While the Reform Party's position does not surprise 
me, I do find shocking that my colleague from Saint John would 
support it. Does the fact that she supports the view we have not 
eliminated the deficit quickly and decisively enough also mean 
that she supports the approach as outlined? The Reform agenda 
would destroy the fragile but real recovery we are experiencing 
in New Brunswick. It is sad its prescribed medicine would only 
push us back into the sick bed of dependency it speaks of so 
often.
<P>
	The government is committed to a balanced but disciplined 
approach to deficit reduction. Canadians have been asked to 
help and I believe there exists an acceptance of the need to bring 
revenue and expenditure closer together.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is committed to seeing social tax 
expenditures scrutinized with the same vigour as has been 
applied to other social spending. He has acknowledged the need 
for more comprehensive tax reforms.
<P>
	The government has spoken of Canada's commitment 
internationally on the need to come to terms with currency 
speculation and sharing more fairly the benefits of new 
technologies.
<P>
	Not only does the government need to balance spending 
reduction with tax fairness, it is also necessary to be prepared to 
do things differently, to be more creative, to consider solutions 
quite outside conventional thinking in the application of the 
budget.
<P>
	Significant change does not come easily in large 
bureaucracies. Through no one's fault inertia is a powerful force 
and change, particularly dramatic change is seldom seen. 
Canadians from all walks of life have been asked to change their 
thinking, to expect less and contribute more.
<P>
	I believe we will meet that challenge but in return, 
government must be prepared to change its thinking, to listen 
seriously and consider outside, sometimes unconventional, 
solutions.
<P>
	As a member of the parliamentary committee on human 
resources development, I can attest to the fact that many 
Canadians believe for example that the federal government 
should show leadership in eliminating overtime and considering 
a shorter work week. This would soften the effect of expenditure 
reduction on our employees while setting an example for other 
governments and the private sector with the view of sharing 
better the jobs that currently exist in this country.
<P>
	A second area where government must show leadership is in 
our approach to economic development. We must carve out 
clearly in a mixed economy the role of government and apply 
available resources and regulatory power toward that end. We 
must be prepared to use our legitimate power to make the market 
work for as many Canadians as possible, whether it is increasing 
the availability of capital to small and medium sized businesses, 
direct financial support for community development, pushing 
more forcefully the need for private sector retraining and 
upgrading, or taking a more vocal stand internationally on 
questions of employment standards or tax fairness.
<P>
	If the government can no longer afford to offer as much 
protection to those for whom the market does not work, it must 
accept a larger role in ensuring that the market works for more 
Canadians.
<P>
	I said at the start that I was anxious to participate in this 
debate because it marks the beginning of a new era for Canada. 
Some Canadians have said we are getting meaner. Others, 
unhappily, say we have not been mean enough. I am an optimist. 
I believe we can find that place where we gradually disentangle 
ourselves from the vulnerable relationship we have with the 
money markets but where we also recognize the vulnerable 
relationship many Canadians have with us.
<P>
	Yes, we can find that balance but ultimately it is not in the 
numbers. The balance we seek and must find lies in the hearts 
and minds of Canadians, in our compassion, our creativity, our 
generosity and ingenuity.
<P>
	As a member of the committee that travelled Canada for the 
social security review, I can assure the House that Canadians 
have ideas, ideas born of a desire to eradicate poverty, to teach 
people to read and offer shelter and jobs. They want us to listen, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10445"> 10445 </A></B>
<P>
to work with them, to be more inclusive both in our policy 
development process and in the results we hope to achieve.
<P>
	Over the coming months the government will be engaged in 
discussions with the provinces among others on the question of 
the social transfers. Much of what Canada will look like in the 
future will be affected by these discussions. They must be driven 
by a vision for the kind of Canada we want and can afford for our 
children.
<P>
	To engage in the exercise without considering affordability 
would be irresponsible and frankly silly. However, to engage in 
the exercise without a national vision would be equally 
irresponsible. What is more, it would be an abdication of our 
responsibility to those whose vision and determination have 
brought us to where we are: the country recognized objectively 
as the best place in the world in which to live.
<P>
	What is better than that? We have to stop beating ourselves 
up. We have to stop beating each other up. All this talk of crisis 
and catastrophe should not cause us to lose sight of the 
comparative credibility and objectivity between the United 
Nations and some analyst with the Wall Street Journal.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	We have a debt and deficit problem. We will fix it. We are a 
wealthy, safe, generous nation with a magnificent future. For 
those who think otherwise I can only turn to the vocabulary of 
my 10-year old son and say get with the program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals constantly talk about the whole issue of cutting slowly.
<P>
	I wonder if the member has had a mortgage on his home. I will 
assume that he has, along with probably 90 per cent of 
Canadians. Let us say it is a $50,000 mortgage and he is paying 
$500 a month. He probably knows that when he first starts 
paying on the mortgage very little goes toward the principal. 
Most of his $500 payment is going toward the interest. I also 
wonder whether the hon. member has had the opportunity 
perhaps through an inheritance or hard work on his part to put 
$10,000 toward the mortgage and seeing that instead of the 
money going toward interest that suddenly he is paying more on 
principal.
<P>
	In other words, going slowly on deficit reduction simply does 
not work. To get the deficit to a point where it is not continuing 
to add to the burden of the debt there must be prompt, aggressive 
action so that we will not be doing away with our ability to fund 
the social programs, so that we will be able to reverse the 
situation that is forecast and planned for by his government of 
increasing interest payments from $38 billion to just under $51 
billion. That $13 billion is eating up the ability to fund social 
programs.
<P>
	Surely there must be some Liberal in this House who has had 
the experience of making an abrupt payment down on the 
principal of a mortgage. Can the hon. member not see that that 
principal might not apply to Canadian finances, therein being 
able to correctly and properly protect social program funding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Kootenay East for his question.
<P>
	I am painfully familiar with mortgages. I was not kidding 
when I said my banker knows I am not obsessed with debt. 
Having said that, I do not think that in the interests of making a 
payment on the principal of my mortgage that I would be 
prepared to feed my family any less or take away from the 
college trust fund or my life insurance.
<P>
	The reality is we have to engage in this exercise in a very 
practical, common sense way. Perhaps it is a regional problem, I 
am not sure but over and over again we hear particularly from 
our Reform Party colleagues that we are not moving quickly 
enough. I can only say as an Atlantic Canadian that to move any 
quicker would place us exactly in the position we are trying to 
escape from in terms of generating economic activity in our 
region. We benefit from social programs. We benefit from 
transfers.
<P>
	To respond to earlier analogies with regard to chickens, the 
fundamental problem with the argument that if we give every 
province the chickens is that not all chickens are the same size. 
Consequently, part of what this nation is about is sharing the 
coop so to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has referred to this government taking control of 
Canada's finances again and the importance of that happening. I 
applaud him for recognizing that.
<P>
	When we look at the Liberal budget and examine where the 
biggest change in transfer payments has taken place, has there 
been an increase in transfers to provinces? No. There has been a 
reduction of at least $4.5 billion in transfers to provinces. Has 
there been an increase in transfers to individuals? No. In fact the 
biggest threat of this Liberal budget is in transfers to individuals 
through social programs. These programs are not sustainable 
because there has been no definite target for elimination of the 
deficit.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	The largest change in transfers of government money in this 
budget is in fact in transfers of money to bankers. When this 
member talks about Canada regaining control of finances, how 
can that possibly be happening when this budget in fact involves 
an increase in transfers of $12 billion to bankers, some of which 
are foreign bankers. More and more are foreign bankers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10446"> 10446 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. member, who happens to be on the social 
programs committee, to explain to me how this budget fits in 
with his stated goal of Canada taking control of its finances. 
Being on the social programs committee, can this member 
explain how social programs will be funded down the road when 
$12 billion more will be spent on interest payments within two 
years, and then ever increasingly more beyond the two years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is merely a question of balance. It would be ridiculous to 
annihilate social programs in the interests of saving them. 
Consequently, we have to find the place in the system where we 
strike the balance that allows the programs to be affordable.
<P>
	I have great faith in the wisdom of Canadians. They were 
presented with the option put forward in this budget of a target 
of 3 per cent at the end of the third year and were also presented 
with the option put forward by the Reform Party. They picked 
our solution. I have some faith in the good judgment of not just 
the Minister of Finance and my colleagues in the government, 
but also the good judgment of Canadians who chose a balanced 
approach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I believe that every 
member should be permitted to speak in this house, particularly 
on issues like this debate.
<P>
	However, I note that in the last House our party had one 
independent member, the hon. member for Beaver River. When 
she was in the House the Conservatives consistently dealt her 
out of being able to enter into debates.
<P>
	I wonder if the Chair might be able to explain to the House 
under what rules the next member is permitted to speak, 
considering that he, as a member of the previous government, 
did everything he could to stop our member from being able to 
speak.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Kootenay East raises 
an important point. There are about 300 members in the House. 
On a mathematical basis, the unrecognized party members are 
entitled to speak about one every 25th slot. We are at that point 
now, approximately. I take the point of the hon. member for 
Kootenay East because I sat in the corner back there, too. I know 
exactly what the member is talking about.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
not pursue the point of order except to say that maybe the hon. 
member for the Reform Party should let go at one point in time. 
When does he think kicking someone around should stop, if that 
is the case? Or does he feel that we have abused our privileges in 
this place? Anyhow, we probably witnessed a new definition of 
what meanness is in this place, but for many reasons, I am a lot 
more interested today in addressing the issues relative to this 
budget.
<P>
	This budget has the advantage of putting things into focus and 
perspective in regard to a few elements that are important to 
Canadians. First is where the Liberals really  stand on these 
issues and what their real agenda is or is not. It puts into 
perspective the previous accomplishments of other 
governments and what their records mean and what do they not 
mean. It also brings into perspective the real issues we have to 
address.
<P>
	I wish to begin by being as frank and straightforward as 
possible. There are things in this budget we agree with. There 
are things in this budget that we think are positive for the 
country. We intend to support those proposals that are positive 
and constructive.
<P>
	I do not think it is very useful for us to enter into any phoney 
indignation on budget night in terms of what the budget is all 
about. It is not useful to stray around with inflated vocabulary 
that only rings false in the ears of the Canadian public when they 
try to look at this budget.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	Frankly, in trying to assess how the government needs to deal 
with this issue, anything I have heard is that Canadians want 
government to succeed. Canadians want the government to do 
well in dealing with the budgetary and fiscal problems facing 
the country. They do not want to see the government face 
another crisis. On the contrary, they hope that it will make the 
right decisions. It is very much in that spirit that I would like to 
offer my thoughts and comments today.
<P>
	The most interesting part-I happen to be one of the few 
members in this place who has a view on this because I happened 
to be in the other Houses-is that this budget also brings into 
perspective the policies and positions of the Liberal Party of 
Canada. That has to be one of the first assessments that we need 
to make about the budget.
<P>
	To be brutally frank, it needs to be said that the budget is a 
denial of the principles espoused by the Liberal Party during its 
nine years in opposition, a repudiation of the policy it placed 
before the Canadian electorate 16 months ago, an abandonment 
of those people whose defenders the Liberal Party pretended to 
be.
<P>
	For nine years Liberals purported to defend old age 
pensioners against any reductions in benefits, to fight for the 
jobless against changes in unemployment insurance, to maintain 
the annual increases in parliamentary grants to VIA Rail, to the 
CBC and to all the cultural agencies. They called for the 
expansion of day care.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary this morning even had the 
temerity to raise day care when if one reads page 40 of the red 
book as Canadians have, one will find there is a clear 
commitment to increase day care spaces by 50,000 a year the 
moment the economy goes beyond 3 per cent.
<P>
	Is there anything about that in the budget now? That was the 
Liberal position. They vowed to stand shoulder to shoulder with 
single mothers, with poor families, with refugees and 
immigrants, with the regionally disadvantaged, with the sick, 
with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10447"> 10447 </A></B>
<P>
needy children here at home or abroad, all of whom were to be 
given more, not less, financial support by a Liberal government.
<P>
	Maybe I am naive but I am still young enough to be 
disheartened by the treachery and old enough to know that in 
time the Liberal Party will pay for this. It is said often enough 
but it bears repeating because it is true: Liberal policies in 
opposition were unrealistic. Their promises were irresponsible, 
their opposition to budgetary restraints of any kind in any 
circumstance at any time over nine years were not principled, 
but dishonest, totally political and wilfully ignorant of the 
national interest.
<P>
	Everywhere they sought to obstruct-I was in that House for 
nine years-systematically and without question any cuts or 
reductions in expenditures. In fact when the government was 
elected in 1984, previous expenditures were growing at a rate of 
about 13.4 per cent a year. Program expenditures under the 
previous Liberal government were brought down to under 4 per 
cent a year. Did Liberals support that? No, not once that I 
remember.
<P>
	What now? Do we congratulate them on having seen the light? 
Is their policy any more principled than the old policy? Is it any 
more credible? Is it any more reliable? That is the real question.
<P>
	Liberals bitterly fought the Canada-U.S. free trade 
agreement. I remember that well. Under the present Prime 
Minister's leadership, they opposed NAFTA, the North 
American free trade agreement, in Parliament and promised on 
the hustings they would not ratify it unless specific amendments 
were agreed to.
<P>
	They opposed the previous government's energy policies. 
They obstructed the changes in pharmaceutical patent 
protection. We are still not sure where they stand on that today. 
They fought the dismantling of the foreign investment review 
agency. They denounced deregulation and privatization. They 
also swore to abolish the GST, to scrap the GST. We even heard 
in their first budget-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> It is coming. Don't be disappointed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> The hon. minister responsible for financial 
institutions says it is coming. Is that not what they said in their 
first budget, that they were going to accelerate reform of the 
GST? Is that not what the Liberal government said in its first 
budget?
<P>
	What has happened since? Nothing, except the vain hope that 
the Deputy Prime Minister will resign if it is not done. That is 
the glimmer of hope they have offered to Canadians with regard 
to changes to the GST.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The vindication of these Tory policies lies not in their dubious 
embrace by today's government but rather in the results now 
being achieved in the country's productivity, its increased 
investment in exports and the new job creation.
<P>
	Our economic growth today and in the foreseeable future is 
based for the most part on these Conservative initiatives so 
mindlessly and vigorously obstructed by the Liberals in 
opposition. It is one thing for the opposition to say that 
everything that is wrong with the country today was the previous 
government's fault. If we were to follow that line of thought, 
then they would have to admit that what is working would also 
be the previous government's fault.
<P>
	Things as trivial as an increase of 40 per cent in trade between 
Canada and the United States, which is the number one reason 
we have job creation in the country today, that they fought 
against vigorously and at every turn. Things like changing the 
GST because it actually changed the federal sales tax for 
manufacturers in Canada. If we ask manufacturers today why 
they are more competitive, it happens to be because of the GST.
<P>
	There is more than one side to this story. Those are things that 
are forgotten. For all of these policies they demonized Prime 
Minister Mulroney. They and their acolytes would not even 
concede the elementary assumption of civilized discourse in a 
democratic society, that their opponents acted in good faith for 
good motives but maybe with a mistaken policy. That usually 
would be the presumption. No.
<P>
	As far as the Liberals were concerned, Tories wanted to sell 
out the country. We were bent on dismantling the federal 
government. We were going to balkanize the country, killing the 
Canadian dream. This was imposing the Thatcher-Reagan 
neo-conservative corporate agenda on Canada. That is what 
they were saying during the nine years in this place.
<P>
	Now the President of the Privy Council is quoted in the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> of March 4 acknowledging that he cannot recall the 
Conservatives cutting anything like the $7 billion the Liberals 
plan to take out of the provincial social programs between 1996 
and 1998. The same minister in the same article is quoted 
invoking the name of the Hon. Erik Nielsen, boasting that this 
budget was a mega-Nielsen exercise.
<P>
	These are the same people who for nine years behaved in a 
way that is totally the contrary of what they are espousing today. 
As far as I know there is only one Liberal member of Parliament 
who has stood by his convictions. Only one Liberal member of 
Parliament has said he is offended by this. That is the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who is quoted in the same 
newspaper article as saying it is a repudiation of everything the 
party stood for in opposition and promised in the 1993 
campaign.
<P>
	This is not the member for Sherbrooke. This is not a member 
from the Reform Party. It is not my colleague from 
Saskatchewan saying this. It is a Liberal member of Parliament 
sitting on that side of the House who was there for the last nine 
years, who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10448"> 10448 </A></B>
<P>
was there before that also and still sits, for now, with the 
government. We  await his vote on the upcoming budget in 
regard to these issues.
<P>
	As for other Liberal MPs, their critical faculties and social 
consciences seem to have been dulled or blunted along with 
their political instincts, lulled by the most insidious narcotic 
known in politics: the polls, the fast results and public opinion 
polls.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance now boasts that his budget policy is 
such good politics that there will be more of the same, more 
again and yet even more as we get closer to the election 
campaign. Let me offer some advice to members in the House. 
Save those quotes. Cut them out. Keep them close. As we 
approach the days of the election campaign you will find them 
very useful.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	We will also find out in the next two or three years that the 
government has an intended raid on the treasuries of other 
governments. That is what the budget is really about. From 1995 
to 1997 there is a series of delayed action bombs which it hopes 
will explode in provincial jurisdictions and take out provincial 
and not federal politicians.
<P>
	Most of all, we should give credit to Canadians. If anyone 
deserves any credit in this country in regard to some of the good 
decisions that are being proposed it is the Canadian people who 
have spoken in a loud voice and with consistency in regard to 
these issues.
<P>
	The bottom line in the budget is that the cost of servicing the 
debt is going up as fast as program expenditures are coming 
down. Fiscal improvement is the product of increased revenue 
from economic growth. That is what we are seeing. So far as 
balancing the budget is concerned it has to take place at some 
unspecified time.
<P>
	The government has made hay of the fact that it has a 3 per 
cent commitment in terms of reducing the deficit to GDP. It even 
has the temerity of adding that this is the standard of the 
European Community. What it forgets to say is that in the 
European Community this standard is applied to national 
governments.
<P>
	In Canada, in the federal system, the provincial governments 
also incur debt. This year alone it is estimated that they will add 
$16 billion to the annual debt of the whole country. This is a 
false standard and the marketplace has recognized it. In fact, if 
we were to speak objectively of the reaction to the budget, at 
first what seemed encouraging has since then soured. The bank 
rate since the budget has gone up. The prime rate has gone up 
and the dollar has fallen. Those are objective facts.
<P>
	I will recognize that there are other factors out there in the 
international marketplace but if the government makes a 
pretence of telling us to look at the numbers because it is on 
course, it reveals to us that it is certainly not on course in terms 
of the provisions it has made.
<P>
	One group of people had it right. One rating agency grasped 
the essence of the budget very quickly. It was the Dominion 
Bond Rating Service. This service looked at what was proposed 
in the budget and then went on to place Ontario's rating under 
negative review because the provinces stand to lose billions of 
dollars in federal transfers. It understood what had just taken 
place. The problem had now been transferred to the provincial 
governments. It then turned to Ontario and saw who was in 
trouble now. It was Ontario that was going to be losing the 
money. It understood the real impact of the budget.
<P>
	Some apologists for the government and some wishful 
thinkers explained the budget as a triumph of pragmatism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us not kid ourselves. When the government says it is 
taking a pragmatic approach, the fact of the matter, what we 
have actually seen, is that it is all improvised, an off-the-cuff, 
ad hoc, last minute approach, which is interestingly enough 
reflected in the decisions that are made, particularly with 
respect to provincial transfers for social programs. It will all 
come out of the same big transfer pot, so to speak, with as little 
connection as possible.
<P>
	In its budget, the government even had the nerve to suggest 
putting the Minister of Human Resources Development in 
charge of negotiating new standards with the provinces. After 
his first mission-which was a flop, a complete fiasco, ending in 
humiliation, and ultimately disowned-he is asked to go and 
consult again with the provinces, while cuts have already been 
announced.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, let us not be naive. We were not born yesterday. 
Just between you and me, what is going to happen when they get 
together with the provinces? How do you think things will go? 
The provinces are going to say: ``Look, you made the decision to 
cut. There is nothing left to negotiate. Give us whatever money 
is left and leave us alone.'' This certainly reflects a lack of 
planning.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This brings me to what I see as the first major weakness of the 
budget: there is no plan. It reflects nothing of what the Liberals 
said, did or stood for in the last nine years in this place. The 
budget reflects nothing of what is written in the red book. All 
promises have been thrown out the window. The red book has 
been scrapped and the government and the country are left with 
no plans and no priorities. What kind of a situation does thatlead to?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10449"> 10449 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	This government is cutting R and D and the granting councils 
14 per cent, the same way it is cutting small craft harbours 
across the country at a time when R and D is important for the 
country. This is a government of one of the only modern 
countries in the world to have closed universities. That is what 
happens when there are no priorities. That will be the first 
weakness of this government.
<P>
	I have already alluded the second, this false objective of 3 per 
cent of GDP which frankly is not good enough and will not last. 
The country needs a very firm commitment to balance the 
budget with a timeframe.
<P>
	The third weakness in the budget is in its approach. The 
budget and its unilateral ways go against the very essence of 
what federalism is about. Rather than setting national objectives 
for deficit and debt reduction, rather than sitting down with the 
provinces to avoid a situation, we are only off-loading debt into 
their yards.
<P>
	How do we know a provincial government will not choose to 
increase taxes as a consequence of the budget? Where does that 
leave the taxpayer, the men and women, individuals who pay 
taxes today? There may be more than one level of government 
but there is still only one taxpayer. The approach is wrong and 
will not work.
<P>
	The fourth area is the hidden agenda. Pension reform is the 
most glaring one. Here is a government that says it wants to 
undertake pension reform but will not share with the House of 
Commons the studies it has done in this regard when we know 
the impact and the consequences of what it is proposing are 
tremendous.
<P>
	Let me give another example of the hidden agenda of this 
government with regard to the budget. The Prime Minister went 
on a TV show with Mike Duffy, stating as a matter of policy the 
government wants to reduce the cost of health care 1 per cent of 
GDP.
<P>
	Mr. Duffy had a guest on his show last week, Dr. Jane Fulton, 
Ph.D., a professor of health policy and ethics at the University of 
Ottawa. I do not remember anything being said in the budget 
about cutting health care in Canada 1 per cent relative to GDP. 
This is not an ordinary member of Parliament who said this. It 
was the Prime Minister.
<P>
	What does this mean? According to Dr. Jane Fulton: ``I think 
if we have to talk between $7 billion and $10 billion, and every 
time we cut $1 billion out of any kind of public funding we cut 
about 10,000 jobs''. I am not quarrelling that there need to be 
serious thinking and reduction of funding in health like in every 
other area of government.
<P>
	What I find objectionable is that the government in this case 
has a hidden agenda. It is not coming clean with Canadians. Why 
did the Prime Minister not say this? Why did the Minister of 
Finance hide this from the House when he came forward with his 
budget? I am assuming the Prime Minister did not think this up. 
Did it  just appear in his mind during an interview that this 
would happen? If that is the case, we all need to be enlightened 
with regard to this.
<P>
	There is one advantage to the budget in terms of what it means 
to all the issues we are confronted with. It certainly puts into 
perspective the real accomplishments and the failures of 
previous governments. If this government likes to blame the 
previous government on anything that went wrong, it would also 
want to acknowledge the strong growth we have in our economy 
today was also because the previous government restructured 
our economy, brought forward the FTA, the NAFTA, the GST, 
privatized, deregulated.
<P>
	These were the main features and the Liberals fought every 
one of them for nine years. Those enabled Canadians today to 
have economic prosperity and see some real job creation as we 
now go on to deal with some of the really tough issues we are 
confronted with.
<P>
	This government has no compass, no plan. The last nine years 
were a complete farce. Whatever it was saying or purporting to 
present as positions were all thrown out the window. The red 
book has been thrown out the window.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I see my colleague here, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs. Foreign affairs took a deep hit in the 
budget, contrary to anything the Liberals purported as being a 
position for ODA in the years they were in opposition. It does 
not resemble it at all.
<P>
	Canadians will now watch very closely as this government 
tries to get its act together and await whether there will be a 
sense of priority and planning in terms of where this country is 
going.

	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Sherbrooke on his fine speech. I 
would say he is quite loquacious.
<P>
	I note that he is attributing the current rise in the interest rate 
to the budget tabled by the Liberals, whereas, about a month 
ago, he attributed it to the political uncertainty in Quebec. I am 
happy that the member for Sherbrooke is making amends and 
recognizing the real source of our difficulties.
<P>
	I find him wordy; I like him; I think he made a fine speech, 
and I would like to ask him this. Why did he not give the same 
speech during the electoral campaign in Brome-Missisquoi 
just before February 13? He never opened his mouth there. He 
said nothing of all that, and yet he knew it to be true. He did not 
say a word. Are we to understand-and this is my question-that 
there was an agreement with the Liberals not to hurt them during 
the electoral campaign in Brome-Missisquoi?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will first comment quickly on my 
colleague's allusion to a comment I allegedly made about 
interest rates. I made no such comment.
<P>
	I will stop immediately here and ask him his source.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest and it sounded like a death bed repentance, 
a true confession, a catharsis for the hon. member.
<P>
	I want to share this time with other members. The member 
talked very seriously about the implications of the reduction of 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	The member well knows the transfers are a combination of tax 
points and cash and that under the existing EPF and CAP 
provisions, in certain provinces the amount of cash would be 
reduced to levels which would eliminate the leverage the federal 
government would have with regard to maintaining national 
standards with regard to education, health and so on.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would admit or agree that the 
consolidation of the programs under one transfer, where there is 
a consolidation of tax points and cash, does assist the federal 
government to ensure appropriate national standards?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Mississauga South 
may be a little confused in what he is saying. If I understood him 
correctly, he was saying the proposed reduction in cash and tax 
point transfers would reduce the leverage to a minimum, the 
leverage of being able to ask for standards. He said how we think 
the government can impose some standards or allude to the fact 
that we should continue to do so.
<P>
	If the government is to act unilaterally in this way and 
announce the cuts in advance I hope he is not naive enough to 
think it will sit down with the provinces and negotiate some sort 
of standard. There is nothing left to negotiate.
<P>
	If the hon. member has ever been to a federal-provincial 
meeting he would find it quite startling to sit down with 
ministers of other provinces who will say to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development: ``There is nothing left to 
discuss. You have made the decision on the cuts. What do you 
want from us?'' That will be the dynamic of the meeting.
<P>
	This points to one of the major weaknesses in this approach. 
During the election campaign our view was that if we were going 
to deal effectively with deficit and debt reduction, given that it 
is all the governments that enter into deficits and debts, it 
required a joint effort by all governments.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	There should have been a formal process, a federal-provincial 
meeting, in which the government should have set joint 
objectives in terms of deficit and debt reduction and as a 
consequence of that, because it would imply reductions in 
transfers to the provinces,  examine line by line areas of joint 
spending where the federal government uses its spending power 
to determine where each level of government should be 
intervening. That was the common sense approach we proposed. 
His government chose instead to act unilaterally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I found 
the speech of the hon. member for Sherbrooke extremely 
interesting, especially considering the member ran for the 
leadership of a party which took the hole the prior Liberal 
government dug $170 billion deep and proceeded to dig it even 
deeper to the tune of $420 billion.
<P>
	I find it interesting how he would, in his first opportunity, 
attack a Liberal budget. In opposition people tend to attack 
government budgets. We did the same thing. There are some 
things about this budget that are worth while commenting on, 
such as the $9 billion in cuts the government has proposed which 
the opposition has been urging for over two years. It is soft, it is 
too slow, but that is another story.
<P>
	I have three specific questions for the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke. When he was part of the Conservative government 
why did it or could it not reduce the deficit? What does he think 
currently is the biggest problem in this country, the debt, the 
interest costs to service the debt or the deficit? Does he agree or 
disagree with the Reform Party solution of a zero deficit in three 
years, working toward a balanced budget and protecting the 
taxpayers from increases by government with a taxpayers' 
protection act?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for Calgary Centre for the question and for the opportunity to set 
the record straight, as the budget offers us an opportunity to put 
things in perspective.
<P>
	He asked me, with respect to the Conservative government, 
what were the things it did or did not accomplish. Let me point 
them out in real, objective terms.
<P>
	When we became the Government of Canada in 1984 program 
expenditure was rising at an annual rate of over 13 per cent. We 
brought that down to below or around 4 per cent. When we took 
over government in 1984 the annual deficit relative to GDP was 
in excess of 8 per cent. We brought that down to somewhere in 
the area of 5 per cent or 6 per cent.
<P>
	I will go further because I know he will be interested in the 
facts and less in the rhetoric. A document was put out by this 
government, ``Agenda, Jobs and Growth: Creating a Healthy 
Fiscal Climate''. I am sure people can write to the Department of 
Finance to obtain a copy.
<P>
	This Liberal document of October last has at page 8 a very 
interesting graph on the federal deficit as a percentage of GDP. 
If we watch the line very closely, as of 1984 when we became the 
government the line started to go down dramatically. That 
reflects the real efforts we brought forward as opposed to the 
inflated demagogy we have heard from time to time. We 
produced a surplus on  the operating budget of the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10451"> 10451 </A></B>
<P>
of $13 billion over the nine years we were the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	Does that mean everything we did was right or perfect? 
Obviously the answer is no. Those are the facts as opposed to the 
fiction proposed by others.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was quite happy to see the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke here because I wanted to discern his party's position 
relative to the budget. I was a little disappointed last week when 
his colleague from Saint John supported the Reform motion 
calling for the elimination of the deficit within the time of this 
Parliament.
<P>
	I did not discern in his speech where he was going in terms of 
whether it was too tough or not tough enough. Before the last 
election he proposed the position that the federal government 
had to work with the provinces to come up with a joint strategy. 
Do I assume that is no longer the position? Certainly that was 
indicated last week.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Does the member for Sherbrooke share his colleague's 
position that the Government of Canada should eliminate the 
deficit inside this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to answer the 
question.
<P>
	There are four things about the budget we think are wrong and 
need to be addressed. There is no plan or priorities for the 
country any more with regard to deficit and debt reduction. That 
means we may run the risk not only of making tough decisions 
but wrong decisions.
<P>
	The objective of reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP is 
not good enough. There should be a clearly enunciated objective 
of balancing the books within a precise timeframe. Three years 
is a reasonable timeframe.
<P>
	Third is its unilateral approach in terms of deficit and debt 
reduction, which is a complete negation of what a federal 
country is and how it operates. That puts us in the situation in 
which we well run the risk of the government's shovelling its 
deficit and debt problem into the yard of New Brunswick. If it 
chooses to increase taxes, if it chooses to cut service, we are not 
going anywhere unless there is a joint effort.
<P>
	The fourth problem is the hidden agenda. Pension reforms, 
reform for health care as announced by the Prime Minister are 
not enunciated in these documents, not clearly laid on the table 
in terms of the agenda of the government in its document.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My apologies to the member for 
Strathcona. I am obliged to go back and forth across the House. 
Therefore I have to go to the government speaker now. I know 
the member for Strathcona has been waiting for a long time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. Minister of Finance has tabled the budget 
Canadians asked for, a budget that is tough but fair, that will 
allow us to gain control of our deficit, one that has been growing 
out of control for decades.
<P>
	We cannot afford to repeat these mistakes. Our government 
has looked to the future. It could be one in which Canadians are 
told which services they can and cannot afford by foreign 
creditors or it can be a future in which Canadians decide their 
priorities and watch them flourish. The government and the 
majority of Canadians have chosen the latter.
<P>
	Our government has taken the necessary measures to ensure 
Canada's future will be bright and prosperous. Tough decisions 
had to be made and they were. Our government has produced a 
plan that is viable and attainable.
<P>
	I would like to quote from the red book which is often used by 
opposition parties. Where our policy on Canada's fiscal 
situation was first outlined it says a Liberal government will 
adopt a two track fiscal policy, matching a drive for jobs and 
growth with a comprehensive approach to controlling debt and 
deficits. That is on page 16.
<P>
	This is exactly what has been done, from our government's 
agenda of jobs and growth to the budget tabled by the Minister 
of Finance.
<P>
	In producing this budget the minister has taken the time to 
solicit views of Canadians and all members of Parliament and 
has reacted to their concerns in delivering a budget that 
re-established its goal to meet the financial commitments and 
obligations, the same commitments made during the election 
campaign and reinforced during the 1994 budget.
<P>
	The plan outlined by the hon. Minister of Finance will break 
the back of the deficit and enable us to reach our goal of 3 per 
cent of gross domestic product by 1997.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Projections indicate that our goal will be exceeded this 
current fiscal year when the deficit is expected to fall as low as 
$38 billion, $1.7 billion below our target of $39.7 billion for the 
end of the fiscal year.
<P>
	As I listened to the Minister of Finance deliver his budget I 
realized that it reflected the message impressed upon me by 
constituents in Carleton-Charlotte. It was the same message 
impressed upon MPs across the country, including the Minister 
of Finance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10452"> 10452 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians want to get their debt under control. They want to 
achieve this through cuts in government spending. The 
government has heard this message loud and clear. For that 
reason we have committed to cutting $7 in expenditures for 
every $1 in increased revenues.
<P>
	To ensure fairness in the tax system, the government has 
closed a number of loopholes that benefit large corporations and 
banks and has avoided increasing the burden on individual and 
middle class Canadians and their families by refusing to 
increase personal income tax.
<P>
	In 1994 a department by department review of all government 
programs was initiated in which every expenditure in each 
department was reviewed. As promised, the results of that 
review were announced in this year's budget.
<P>
	The government has redefined its own role to ensure that 
departments focus on the priorities of Canadians. The new 
government operations will be smaller but more effective and 
more efficient.
<P>
	This government has had the foresight to realise that small 
and medium size businesses are the future of growth in Canada. 
For this reason the $500,000 capital gains exemption has been 
maintained for small business and for farmers. Similarly, only 
minor changes were made to registered retirement savings plan 
contributions which benefit many working in this sector.
<P>
	Government spending has been cut dramatically but in a way 
consistent with the values of Canadians, protecting the most 
vulnerable in society and cutting government first.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the budget also promotes the 
government's agenda for jobs and growth. In 1994 well over 
400,000 new jobs were created, most of which were full time, 
permanent jobs. The economy grew at 4.5 per cent, the largest 
economic growth of all the G-7 countries. This type of growth 
will continue to flourish in 1995 as a result of the measures 
taken in the budget.
<P>
	I quote from an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on March 2:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The boom is back. And, at least temporarily, without inflation. The economy, 
fuelled by exports and consumer and business spending, steamed ahead at a 
robust 4.5 per cent pace last year, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And growth in the final quarter of 1994 was at a torrid annual rate of 5.9 per 
cent, the agency said in its latest report card on the economy, which suggests 
there is more growth to come, the analysts said.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The following quote was also published in the same issue:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, one of the coolest critics of Canada's economic 
policies, has been warmed a few degrees by the new budget. The influential 
business newspaper said in an editorial Wednesday that the finance minister's 
budget ought to be an inspiration to other countries struggling with 
overextended governments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister has obviously listened to Canadians from 
Carleton-Charlotte and from across Canada and delivered a 
budget they wanted; a budget that is tough but fair and will be 
implemented equitably.
<P>
	We can now look forward certainly to a better tomorrow for 
all Canadians in the future as a result of the budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance in the House.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the hon. member who has just 
spoken, that everyone agrees, in fact, that there is a need to 
control federal government spending, which has been out of 
control for a number of years and which has brought us to 
financial disaster.
<P>
	In a world where markets are said to be increasingly dealing 
with internationalization and globalization and where our 
producers need help in research and development to enable them 
to deal with worldwide competition, where, in his opinion, is the 
logic in suddenly stopping all research and development in the 
area of sheep production by deciding to close the one 
experimental farm that worked in this area and that had a 
national mandate across Canada? What message is being sent to 
sheep producers in Canada when they are told they will have no 
more support in research and development?
<P>
	Why was the decision made to take everything away from this 
sector? Is this not what might be called a poor cut, as compared 
with others, which could be made where there would be no direct 
impact on an important sector of agricultural production, such 
as sheep production-a form of production making agricultural 
diversification possible, particularly in Quebec and Alberta? 
What, in his opinion, is the logic behind such a decision?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, I should agree with the hon. 
member across the way in his question. He is quite right. 
Although we take pride in the fact that we must get our debt and 
deficit under control, we are not the first government that has set 
goals for bringing it under control. We certainly will be the first 
government in this century that will meet those goals. The 
Minister of Finance has made that commitment. The Prime 
Minister has made that commitment and the House has made 
that commitment.
<P>
	Research and development is a priority of this government. It 
has been stated time and again. The government also believes 
private enterprise and commercialization can do, as proven in 
the past, the best job out there in business. Whether in research 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10453"> 10453 </A></B>
<P>
and development or small business or industry, they can do it 
much better than any government level can.
<P>
	This government is supporting that. It is supporting a 
partnership with private business and industry. We will continue 
that support in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have witnessed many 
budgets tabled in the House. Usually the next day constituency 
offices' telephones ring off the hook with complaints, support or 
whatever.
<P>
	This year I checked with my constituency office on how many 
calls it received the day after the budget. My assistant in 
Parkdale-High Park told me it received one call. That caller 
said the minister did not go far enough in reducing the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Because the hon. member works very closely with and listens 
to his constituents, what kind of reaction did he have from them 
directly on the budget, positive or negative?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the 
question. To be honest, it was an excellent one. Like he I 
expected my phone to be ringing on the budget. However I can 
honestly say it did not happen.
<P>
	Last week we had an opportunity to be back in our 
constituencies. On Monday I had did an electronic town hall 
meeting specifically on the budget. The headline in the 
newspaper the next day was: ``First attempt on an electronic 
town hall meeting'' because we had done all the others 
personally ``went very smoothly''. There were many questions. 
Every person in the television studio was very positive about 
what the government had done in the budget and how it was done 
fairly and equitably right across Canada for all Canadians.
<P>
	It was quite different from a radio interview I did on Friday 
morning. It was supposed to be on the budget. When I arrived at 
the radio station it was on Bill C-68 or gun control and I was 
facing a lawyer sitting there debating it from another 
perspective.
<P>
	It showed the amount of negative concern there was toward 
the budget. I found out from my constituents exactly what the 
hon. member mentioned he heard from his constituents. It was 
accepted. It was supported. It was tough. It was fair but it was 
equitable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to congratulate the Minister of Finance, for 
delivering a courageous and innovative budget, which, most 
importantly, takes on the deficit yet respects the red book 
commitments. This was no easy task and the minister did agreat job.
<P>
	Having had the honour of sitting on the Standing Committee 
on Finance, I am very happy to see that the minister incorporated 
80 per cent of the committee's recommendations into his 
budget. This means that the minister took into account the 
suggestions and concerns that Canadians expressed during the 
public hearings held nationwide.
<P>
	This budget takes the steps needed to control the deficit. 
These budgetary measures are the most rigorous undertaken by a 
federal government in 50 years. They will permit us to bring the 
deficit down to 3 per cent of the gross domestic product by 
1996-97.
<P>
	This budget also allows us to meet our goals without 
increasing personal income taxes for the second consecutive 
year. The government refuses to reduce the deficit by offloading 
it onto Canadian taxpayers. Like Canadians as a whole, we 
believe that we must strive to balance the budget. We will 
achieve this in a responsible and realistic way without 
jeopardizing the strides we have taken regarding the economy 
and on the job front over the past 16 months and without 
discarding the values and priorities of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We use forecasts that are more prudent than the private sector 
average. The budget anticipates the debt charges in 1995-96 
alone will be $7.5 billion above last year's estimates.
<P>
	This is why we must act now or risk missing our deficit target 
altogether. The budget takes some tough actions to prevent the 
probability of failure. To hit our targets we are implementing 
cumulative savings of some $29 billion over the next three 
years. This is the largest single set of actions in any budget since 
World War II. These actions mean changing the size and the 
shape of government. By 1996-97 program spending will fall 
from $120 billion to just under $108 billion.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	The structural changes we are making will assure that 
significant deficit reduction continues in 1997-98 and, more 
important, beyond. The bottom line benefit will be dramatic. By 
1996-97 the deficit will be lower than that of any G-7 country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have taken measures that will have far-reaching effects 
and are result oriented.
<P>
	We have substantially cut spending while at the same time 
preserving principles that Canadians hold dear, namely 
economic recovery, protection of the disadvantaged and 
government streamlining.
<P>
	If we want our efforts to put our fiscal house in order to be 
efficient and sustainable, it is imperative that we reconsider the 
role and structure of government and focus government 
activities on the priorities set by Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10454"> 10454 </A></B>
<P>
	In this budget, government is brought down to a size we can 
afford. Cuts were not made blindly, contrary to what the 
opposition says. The measures announced by the Minister of 
Finance flow from the comprehensive review of departmental 
programs and activities we had announced in the 1994 budget 
and they will continue to pay dividends in the years to come.
<P>
	Expenditures will be cut by half in some departments. After 
these measures have been implemented, the public service, 
including DND, will be reduced by 45,000 positions, or 14 per 
cent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget reduces the deficit in a way that is consistent with 
the strong Liberal commitment to social programs. We remain 
absolutely committed to a fair and sustainable system of 
protection for seniors who have given so much to the country.
<P>
	The budget states the basic principles of the so-called hidden 
agenda the hon. member for Sherbrooke alluded to before. There 
will be the following: undiminished protection for all seniors 
who are less well off, including those receiving the guaranteed 
income supplement; continuation of full indexation to protect 
seniors from the effects of inflation; provision of old age 
security benefits on the basis of family income, as is currently 
the case with the guaranteed income supplement; greater 
progressivity of the benefits by income level; and, more 
important, control of program costs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The role of the state is to do only what it does best. Therefore, 
some activities should be transferred to other public 
administrations or entrusted to the private sector. If the federal 
government does not have to do something, it should not do it. 
And in the future, this government will not do it.
<P>
	True, this budget is tough, but it is fair. The Minister of 
Finance strove to distribute budget cuts fairly among all 
regions.
<P>
	We will not reduce the deficit without also reducing 
provincial transfers. Nonetheless, the cuts we are asking the 
provinces to absorb are not as deep as the cuts we are facing 
ourselves, that is, 3 cents for every dollar of provincial revenue.
<P>
	This budget constitutes additional proof that federalism is 
dynamic, flexible and not stuck in the status quo. The 
federal-provincial transfer payments will be replaced with a 
new consolidated subsidy called the Canada Social Transfer, 
which will alleviate the constraints that the government may 
impose in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	By giving the provinces two years' notice before introducing 
the Canada Social Transfer, we honoured a red book 
commitment to ``achieve the maximum degree of predictability 
and stability for each level of government''. It is the Quebec 
government that is  deferring all important decisions because of 
the referendum.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition alleges that this budget is unfair 
to Quebec. No region suffered more cuts than any other. Under 
the Canada Social Transfer, transfers to Quebec in 1996-97 will 
decline by only $350 million. That is a 3 per cent cut compared 
with 1994-95.

	Over that same period, we will reduce federal spending by 7.3 
per cent, which is almost double the cuts affecting transfer 
payments to the provinces. It goes without saying that those who 
support separation cannot react positively to a budget which 
demonstrates that Canadian federalism works.
<P>
	Bloc members oppose the reduction of the subsidy to 
industrial milk producers. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition 
himself said that, in an independent Quebec, he would willingly 
abolish that subsidy. Financial markets did not endorse the 
claims made by the Quebec Minister of Finance to the effect that 
the federal budget generates uncertainty. Indeed, all are 
unanimous in saying that the budget measures will help fiscal 
consolidation.
<P>
	Even the editorialists from Quebec recognize that this budget 
paves the way to a federalism respectful of the provincial fields 
of jurisdiction. The budget was designed with the best interests 
of Canada and Canadians in mind, not those of Wall Street. Still, 
we managed to reassure the financial markets. It is now up to the 
Quebec government to put an end to the uncertainty by holding 
its referendum as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the hon. member for Vaudreuil is to be commended for the 
stand he took in his speech on this budget. He is to be 
commended, but I am somewhat critical of his choice of words. I 
think he should check the definitions in the dictionary, and I am 
referring to the fact that he called this a ``courageous budget''.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member for Vaudreuil that 
during the last election campaign, the Deputy Prime Minister 
made the following promise: ``Give me a year, and we will get 
rid of the GST or at least make some changes to improve it. Give 
me a year, and if we do not, I will resign''. Fifteen or sixteen 
months later, nothing has changed. The only suggestion the 
finance committee made was to hide it, to camouflage it and 
make it a little less blatant.
<P>
	The hon. member's leader, the Prime Minister, the leader of 
his own party, the Liberal Party of Canada, said: ``Give me a 
day, and I will make some thorough changes in the pension plan 
for members of Parliament''. Fifteen or sixteen months later, 
nothing has been done yet. And what is on the table is a mere 
shadow of pension reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10455"> 10455 </A></B>
<P>
	The present Prime Minister said during the election 
campaign: ``During our first term, I will not raise taxes or 
personal income tax''. So what did he do in last year's budget? 
They raised $500 million by de-indexing old age security 
pensions. What did they do this year? The hon. member for 
Vaudreuil must know that they raised, or will raise, $500 million 
by taxing every litre of gas an extra 1.5 cents.
<P>
	But this is the question I would like to put to the hon. member 
for Vaudreuil, who has a number of dairy farms in his riding. He 
must be aware of a consensus among dairy farmers in Canada on 
one milk, one price. By removing 15 per cent of the subsidy on 
industrial milk this year and another 15 per cent next year, the 
government is widening the gap. How will he explain to the 
dairy farmers in his riding that the gap is getting even wider?
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	And how can he explain to the farmers in his constituency, and 
I say this in concluding, why in the west, now that the Crow 
subsidy worth $560 million has been abolished, farmers will 
receive $1.6 billion in compensation tax free, when our dairy 
producers will lose 30 per cent of their milk subsidy without 
receiving any compensation whatsoever?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to reply to the hon. 
member, because he started by saying that he did not think this 
was a courageous budget. He gave three examples which, I 
suppose, are his three major concerns, namely the GST, the 
pension plans and personal income tax. The last point raised by 
the member was the impact of the cuts to agricultural subsidies.
<P>
	I am convinced that in the riding of Vaudreuil, and elsewhere 
in Quebec and in Canada, the three points raised by the hon. 
member are not unanimously perceived as the three major 
issues. The main concern is government spending and the lack 
of flexibility resulting from a debt accumulated over many years 
and which is very costly in terms of its financing.
<P>
	As you can see in the budget, in spite of cuts of $29 billion 
over a three-year period, the interest on the debt will increase by 
roughly $7 billion. This is a courageous budget because, for the 
first time, a Minister of Finance meets his own objectives in 
terms of the debt reduction. This is a first in the history of our 
country.
<P>
	For the second year in a row, the government has not 
increased personal income tax. The hon. member forgot to 
mention that point. As for the pension plan, the member is well 
aware that we introduced a bill which will be voted on in April.
<P>
	When it comes to agricultural subsidies, the Bloc Quebecois 
always tries to compare the East to the West for political 
expediency. It must be mentioned that, in the West, the subsidy 
was completely eliminated. The farmers were deprived, without 
notice, of subsidies amounting to $560 million. This is why a 
transition period and a compensation are provided. In Quebec 
and  in the East, we are only talking about an annual reduction of 
15 per cent, over a two-year period. It is better to get 70 per cent 
than nothing at all.
<P>
	In reply to the hon. member's question, I think this is a 
courageous budget because we tried to be fair. We did not ask 
more from the provinces than we were prepared to give. We did 
not ask the small and medium size businesses to do more. We 
tried to be fair and this is why the budget was well received 
across Canada, and even in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this year's 
budget debate.
<P>
	I feel fortunate to be able to have this opportunity to pass on 
the views of my constituents of Edmonton-Strathcona. The 
constituents of Edmonton-Strathcona voted for a Reform 
member of Parliament based primarily on three principles: 
justice reform, parliamentary reform and, most significantly, 
fiscal reform.
<P>
	It is because of the fiscal reform that I became involved in 
politics. I wanted to ensure that the standard of living which I 
have enjoyed will be maintained and passed on to my children 
and to my children's children.
<P>
	This budget presented by the Liberals does nothing to 
seriously address the national debt and deficit problem. It has 
been said that a new government receives only one chance to 
make the necessary changes, one window of opportunity. This 
government has had not one but two chances.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The first was a year ago when the government was more 
concerned about increasing the deficit through increased 
spending and claiming that the deficit was not a problem. It then 
spent the rest of the year producing discussion paper after 
discussion paper while doing nothing.
<P>
	The second and final narrow window of opportunity which the 
government has had to balance the budget passed earlier this 
month when it failed to implement the necessary restructuring in 
its latest budget.
<P>
	It is therefore amazing to me that this government can stand 
before the citizens of Canada and present such a disheartening 
and ineffective budget. It is another example of Liberal smoke 
and mirrors. The Liberals state this budget is exactly what the 
doctor ordered. If this is the prescribed medicine, it not only 
smells bad and tastes bad but it is totally ineffective. Canadians 
have been subjected to a clinical trial where they have received 
nothing but a placebo.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10456"> 10456 </A></B>
<P>
	This budget has cut spending by $12 billion over three years 
with a cut of only $4.1 billion in 1995-96. What the government 
is not telling Canadians is that we are borrowing more money 
this year than we did last year even after these poorly placed 
budget cuts.
<P>
	The reason for this is extremely painful. It is because the 
interest payments on the debt are becoming astronomically high 
because of previous Liberal and Conservative governments and 
this Liberal government's continuation to run deficit after 
deficit.
<P>
	With this Liberal plan Canada will still be running deficits of 
approximately $25 billion annually by 1997. This is a sad 
commentary on the government's unwillingness to listen to 
Canadians. At the end of the day, the national debt will still rise 
by $100 billion and Canadians will have to cough up nearly $50 
billion a year in interest payments. This is a $12 billion increase 
since the Liberal fat pack came to power.
<P>
	The Liberals have also managed to introduce a budget which 
involves short term pain with even longer term pain. What 
Canadians wanted was a budget which not only controlled 
spending but a budget which made a concerted effort to begin 
the process in which the deficit can be eliminated.
<P>
	This is what we introduced in the taxpayers budget. It was a 
budget that could have seen the elimination of our national 
deficit within three years. The Reform Party had its fair share of 
short term pain. However, it had a light at the end of the tunnel. 
It was a budget that reflected hope and prosperity, unlike the 
Liberal budget which reflects doom and despair.
<P>
	The Liberals have merely postponed the tough decisions until 
1997. If they are unwilling to do the right thing now, how can 
they expect Canadians to believe they will be willing to make 
the right decisions down the road when those same problems 
still exist and the tough decisions have become tougher?
<P>
	They should be honest with Canadians. I know we were with 
respect to the Reform alternative budget. The Liberals should 
come clean with Canadians and explain the consequences of 
their fiscal indecision and ineptitude. It took the Liberals 12 
years to add the first $100 billion to the national debt. By the end 
of this mandate, the Liberals will have added a further $100 
billion in only four years. This Liberal fat pack is extremely 
efficient, efficient overspenders.
<P>
	Middle class Canadians are asking the same questions the 
Reformers are. For example, is heating your home a tax 
loophole? Is having electricity in your home a tax loophole? Is 
having water a tax loophole? Is having a car a tax loophole?
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	If the answer to these questions is no, then my constituents, 
Albertans, and for that matter all Canadians would like answers 
to the following: Despite this government's promise to limit tax 
increases to the rich and corporations by closing the so-called 
tax loopholes, why is it that the middle class has ended up with 
the burden of paying the majority of this year's nearly $1 billion 
tax increase in which a $.5 billion gas tax is included?
<P>
	Why does the Liberal Party exploit Alberta to the extent that it 
does? Liberal governments have been notorious for abusing 
Albertans and this government continues the Liberal legacy. 
First we had the national energy program. Now we have the 
termination of the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act 
through which nearly $200 million annually will be taken out of 
the pockets of Albertans.
<P>
	While it is true this government did not raise personal income 
taxes, this government continues to speak out of both sides of its 
mouth. There is only one taxpayer and taxes did in fact rise by $1 
billion this year and will rise by almost another $3 billion by 
1997. Instead of tax increases, the government should have 
looked at the elimination of funding for non-priority items such 
as multiculturalism or regional development programs such as 
ACOA, WED or FORD-Q.
<P>
	The government has taken a step in the right direction in terms 
of privatization. However, it did not go far enough. Every 
ministry has one or more areas in which the government is 
providing a service which is in competition with the private 
sector or could be done more efficiently by the private sector.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is no different. Due to 
time constraints I will focus my comments on the CBC. The 
CBC's primary mandate should be the provision of distinctive, 
culture specific information and drama programming. In an 
increasingly multi-channeled environment the current mandate 
to provide a wide range of programming that informs, 
enlightens and entertains is too broad. It is also clear that the 
mandate of the CBC is to provide Canadians with predominantly 
Canadian programming. However, what Canadians are being 
subjected to is extremely questionable in terms of meeting the 
prescribed mandate.
<P>
	The issue is no longer whether the CBC has adequate funding, 
as that passed long ago, but rather the structure of the CBC. In 
particular, the organization has not adjusted to the realities of 
the marketplace. It is an outdated, highly concentrated and 
expensive organization.
<P>
	We must constantly remind ourselves that the Canadian 
broadcasting environment has changed radically since the 
conception of the CBC. New technologies, new services, 
changing viewer tastes and fundamental changes in advertising 
behaviour 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10457"> 10457 </A></B>
<P>
have transformed the broadcasting environment. We must not  
forget that in a world where the CBC is no longer the only 
national service, does it make sense to use scarce public funds to 
subsidize the provision of commercial television programming?
<P>
	In this new world of broadcasting consisting of many more 
options to television viewers, public broadcasting cannot 
effectively maintain its all things to all people objective. It is 
therefore essential for survival in this multi-channel universe 
that the public broadcaster be willing to reinvent itself. It is 
quite evident that the corporation is unwilling to do just that.
<P>
	When the president of the CBC states that revenues are not its 
mission, we must therefore as parliamentarians address this area 
for it. Since revenues are not the mission of the CBC, what is?
<P>
	How can a private company such as CTV make revenues its 
mission while still adhering to Canadian content legislation? 
Last year, CTV spent $488 million on Canadian content. The 
CBC spends $561 million on Canadian content programming. 
This is not a huge difference considering we spent over $1 
billion for the operation of CBC and nothing on CTV. CTV 
spends close to the same amount as CBC on Canadian 
production. The difference is, one is government owned and one 
is privately owned. One is a drain on the public purse and one 
adds to the public coffers through taxation and profit.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Had the government privatized CBC television, it could have 
saved the taxpayers approximately $800 million. This number 
does not include the revenue which would have been generated 
from the sale of approximately $1.5 billion in assets which the 
CBC currently holds.
<P>
	The government must balance its books, which means all 
areas of public financing must be evaluated for efficiency and 
cost effectiveness. It is for these reasons that the Reform Party 
will not support the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to correct the record. I am sure the hon. member did not 
mean it when he said that it was the Reform Party's objective to 
do away with the debt in three years. I am sure he meant deficit.
<P>
	Before the hon. member becomes overly defensive about fuel 
taxes and the impact on Alberta, he should also remember the 
tax expenditures that go to the oil patch and have gone there over 
many years. I do not have a figure for last year but I know thatin 1990 the tax expenditures to the oil patch totalled about$850 million. It is only fair to put some of these things intoperspective.
<P>
	There has always been an element that would like to privatize 
the CBC. Most people who think that way think of Canada as a 
long narrow strip of land that ends at about 150-200 miles north 
of the American border.
<P>
	Historically the CBC has been one of the ties that have bound 
Canada together. No private investor would put a repeater 
station at Wawa, Ontario, for instance, or be broadcasting to the 
most remote parts of the country. That is what the CBC does.
<P>
	The people of Canada pay for that service through their taxes 
so that every Canadian can feel included and a part of this 
country. If we were to privatize the CBC, what would inevitably 
happen would be those unprofitable areas of broadcasting would 
of necessity have to disappear if station was to show black ink at 
the end of the day.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member the CBC does perform a 
very valuable function. The money can be spent more wisely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has pressed a 
number of issues in my speech. With regard to the oil patch 
expenditures, while I agree that these have been made, they are 
nothing compared to the national energy program that took 
billions and billions of dollars out of Alberta.
<P>
	I would not suggest, however, that we continue funding 
uneconomic programs, whether they be in oil or whatever 
commodity we are dealing with. With regard to the taxes on 
public as opposed to private, when the tax program was in place 
it was refunded directly by the private companies back to the 
consumer. In Alberta we have the majority of privately owned 
gas and electricity organizations. We are giving a tax free 
holiday to the publicly owned companies in Ontario and Quebec 
at the expense of Alberta and I believe Nova Scotia. This is 
grossly unfair to the consumer and to the average citizen in both 
of those provinces.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	With regard to the comment on the CBC, let me deal with the 
historical aspect. I agree the CBC has played a significant role in 
the development of Canadian culture. We must remember that 
was back in the days when we had perhaps two, at most three 
television networks in the country.
<P>
	The heritage committee right now is investigating the role of 
the CBC in a 500 channel universe. If we have a CBC which is 
costing $1.1 billion at a time when the government is rightly 
trying to restrict its expenditures, can we afford, when we are 
cutting back on health, when we are cutting back on education, 
can we afford the luxury-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I sat in the House on 
February 27 I felt I was in a time warp.
<P>
	For 20 years we have been hearing the same biased platitudes 
from Liberal and Conservative finance ministers. The Lib con 
artists I call them, telling us that they have the deficit in hand, 
responsibility reigns and everything is going to be all right if 
people will just be patient and trust them.
<P>
	When the current Prime Minister was finance minister he 
announced with a lot of heavy breathing that significant 
reductions in the deficit can be expected, and then proceeded to 
set a new record for deficit spending.
<P>
	In 1982 Allan MacEachen said the government cannot 
responsibly add to the deficit, and then proceeded to set another 
record.
<P>
	In 1990 Michael Wilson stated: ``We will reduce the deficit to 
$28.5 billion next year. We will cut it in half to $14 billion in 
three more years and we will reduce it further to $10 billion in 
the next year after that''. Plus ça change, plus c'est la même 
chose.
<P>
	The government still lives in the same economic fantasy 
world as its predecessors. It believes it can spend and borrow 
itself into prosperity.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance boldly stated in his budget speech 
that it is time to put our fiscal house in order, a line borrowed 
from a famous 1989 speech by the leader of the Reform Party. 
The minister has finally learned to talk the talk, but he made 
only a feeble attempt to walk the walk. He said that Canadians 
want clear action and then he proceeded to deliver mush.
<P>
	Previous finance ministers were able to play budgetary 
games, sleights of hand for 20 years without making any real 
spending cuts. I acknowledge that the incumbent did make some 
real cuts. Thanks to the magic of compound interest he had no 
luxury of choice. He had to make cuts just to avoid immediate 
disaster. However he did not have the courage to cut as deeply as 
necessary to begin to solve the deficit problem.
<P>
	The proposed $12 billion in cuts are going to hurt but they are 
going to be offset by additional interest payments which will 
continue to rise until they reach more than $50 billion in 1997.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	What is his program after that? Continued half-hearted cuts 
until there is nothing left to reduce while annual interest 
payments continue to rise to $60 billion or $70 billion?
<P>
	The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood mentioned the 
same problem. He said: ``We will solve this. We will have a new 
Bretton Woods agreement. We are going to have this great big 
international conference so we do not have to clean up our act at 
home. We will just bring in the IMF and it will solve all our 
problems for us''.
<P>
	Where does this insanity end? Does the government really 
intend to continue treading water until it drowns in debt? We 
cannot perpetually borrow money to give it away to people or 
entities that do not need it.
<P>
	Speaker after speaker has risen on the other side of the House 
to tell us about their compassion. They ooze compassion. Please 
tell me what is compassionate about destroying the economy of 
the country?
<P>
	Canada is like a patient with a gangrenous leg and a 
tender-hearted but incompetent doctor. That leg should come 
off but the doctor with misdirected kindness amputates only the 
foot. When that does not solve the problem, he cuts off a few 
more inches and then a few inches more, each time subjecting 
the patient to additional trauma. In the end, the poor devil dies 
anyway.
<P>
	The finance minister is fortunate that unlike the incompetent 
physician, he cannot be sued for malpractice. They are so proud 
of their transfer programs over there but thanks to 20 years of 
deficits the biggest single transfer program is now payments to 
money lenders.
<P>
	A lot of the transfer payments do not even stay in Canada but 
are delivered into the hands of financial institutions in Tokyo, 
New York and Zurich. The Liberals and Conservatives, with 
their bread and circus approach to governance, have sold us into 
economic slavery.
<P>
	It is obscene that this most blessed of countries should be 
headed for economic collapse and that foreign money lenders 
are being allowed to continually suck our blood. This is the 
legacy of Lib-Con economic policy.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has refused to face reality in the 
name of compassion and caring. We are going to continue down 
that same steep and narrow path to national bankruptcy. What 
good will his reassuring words do when not too many years from 
now half or more than half of the national revenue must go into 
debt service?
<P>
	What will be his after the fact excuse if the money lenders cut 
us off and we are no longer able to provide even basic 
government services, much less social programs? What will he 
tell the people of Canada when we are unable to help even the 
poorest of the poor, the old, the sick, the infirm, the weak? How 
will he explain it when there is no money left, when there is no 
medicare, when there is no welfare, when there are no old age 
pensions, no UIC, when there is nothing. Because that is the 
direction in which we are headed.
<P>
	The government has again proven through its non-budget that 
it cannot be trusted with a credit card. For the sake of our 
children and our grandchildren, it is time to take that credit card 
away.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
actually, I agree with what the hon. member was saying when he 
described the following rather gloomy prospects for the 
Canadian economy: ``We are headed for an economic collapse, 
and we are going down the steep and narrow path to national 
bankruptcy''.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	National bankruptcy is what we see looming as a result of the 
budget that was brought down this year. This is one of the 
reasons, just one but a major one, why Quebec would like to 
separate from Canada. Canada's budgetary and financial affairs 
are a mess and are leading straight down the road to disaster, to 
bankruptcy. This is more or less what was said by financial 
advisers on Wall Street.
<P>
	Personally, I do not want to see the poor and the elderly in 
Quebec in a position where they cannot count on the support of 
social programs, as the hon. member pointed out. This Budget is 
terribly unfair to people who depend on social programs.
<P>
	This Budget will cut $100 million annually in funding for 
social housing alone, a program that is targeted to the poorest 
members of our society. Single parent families, women, the 
elderly, people who live alone, welfare recipients: they all 
belong to the poorest social group in our society. This group will 
be affected by cuts of $100 million annually, while the banks get 
off scot-free or almost, with very few cuts, in fact $100 million 
over two years, the same Canadian banks that last year made a 
net profit of $4.3 billion. These cuts represent not quite 2 per 
cent of their net profits.
<P>
	I may also add that family trusts will not pay a cent.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to say that I fully sympathize with what 
the hon. member said, and I would like to ask him the following: 
If he were in Quebec, would he not agree that the best solution, 
at least for Quebecers, is sovereignty?
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his

hon. member is an economist, yet in his intervention I detected 
hints of three economic theories all warring in the same breast. I 
heard a bit of Adam Smith. I heard a bit of Engels perhaps and a 
great deal of John Maynard Keynes.
<P>
	As far as his immediate question regarding secession is 
concerned, is the hon. member suggesting that if they bail out 
and leave the sinking ship of state they will not be required to 
man any of the lifeboats? They could get off scot free after 
having benefited from the largess of deficit spending for lo these 
20 years. Now they will leave us holding the bag and take 
nothing. Is this what the hon. member is saying?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the House today in support of the budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The fundamental objective of the 1995 budget is sustained 
growth and job creation. The budget takes far reaching actions 
to reduce spending and to reshape the role of the federal 
government in building a stronger, more dynamic Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	The budget is aimed at restoring fiscal health and refocusing 
government on key priorities and needs. It is about getting 
government right so that Canadians can get the economy right.
<P>
	It is the biggest Canadian budget since post-war 
demobilization. It delivers on the commitment to meet our fiscal 
targets using prudent economic assumptions. It cuts the deficit 
largely through expenditure reductions. It restructures spending 
to keep the deficit on a downward track. It puts the government's 
own house in order to make it smaller, more frugal, better 
managed and innovative.
<P>
	It defines a new role for government in the economy. It 
reforms federal transfers to provinces. It points the way to 
reform of unemployment insurance and the public pension 
system. It distributes the burden of restraint fairly among 
Canadians and the regions of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	The deficit and debt are national problems. The budget 
distributes the burden of restraint fairly across all regions. 
Canadians in every region have strongly urged us to bring 
spending under control. Some individual measures obviously 
affect certain regions more than others, but looked at as a whole 
no region is being hit disproportionately.
<P>
	The budget shows that federalism is flexible and dynamic. 
Although we are cutting the level of transfer payments, we have 
given the provinces ample notice as promised and the cuts are 
less than those we are imposing upon ourselves. The 
government remains committed to the equalization program, a 
pillar of Canadian federalism.
<P>
	The new Canada social transfer will give all provinces greater 
flexibility in designing social programs while the principles of 
the Canada Health Act are maintained. The introduction of the 
Canada social transfer in 1996-97 will deliver funding to the 
provinces, cash and tax points of $26.9 billion. That is a drop of 
about $2.5 billion from what provinces could expect under the 
current system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10460"> 10460 </A></B>
<P>
	That is tough action but let us put it in context. It means that 
the total of all major transfers, including equalization which is 
not affected by the budget, will be 4.4 per cent lower than today. 
By comparison, the cuts in federal spending everywhere else 
will be 7.3 per cent, a much deeper reduction.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer will represent a new approach to 
federal-provincial fiscal relations marked by greater flexibility 
and accountability for provincial governments and more 
sustainable financial arrangements for the federal government. 
By doing so it continues our national evolution toward more 
mature fiscal relations.
<P>
	The government is meeting its fiscal target. In the 1994 
budget we pledged that the deficit would be reduced to 3 per cent 
of GDP or $24.3 billion for 1996-97. In the budget we are taking 
strong measures to ensure that those targets are met even with 
higher than expected interest rates.
<P>
	The budget also looks beyond the two-year target because our 
fiscal reforms will continue to pay off in the years after 
sustaining our progress toward the government's ultimate goal, 
a balanced budget.
<P>
	Our cautious fiscal and economic assumptions make clear the 
need for tough measures. To hit our targets we are implementing 
cumulative savings over the next three years of $29 billion. 
These actions mean changing the size and shape of government. 
By 1996-97 program spending will fall from $120 billion last 
year to just under $108 billion. The structural changes we are 
making will ensure that significant deficit reduction continues 
in 1997-98 and beyond. The bottom line benefit will be 
dramatic.
<P>
	The budget concerns itself with increasing tax fairness. The 
1995 budget takes far reaching action to restore the fiscal health 
that supports a strong and growing economy. The plan also 
reflects the government's determination to puts its own 
financial house in order instead of placing the burden on 
taxpayers.
<P>
	Over the next three years spending reductions will total $25.3 
billion against $3.7 billion in revenue action. That is almost $7 
in spending cuts for each $1 in new tax revenue.
<P>
	Most important, there is no increase in personal income tax 
rates in the budget. Where tax action is taken it centres on 
improving the fairness of the tax system. As the finance minister 
said, the issue of taxes is more than a matter of rates; it is a 
question of equity.
<P>
	The budget reflects the results of the program review that was 
launched a year ago. The budget agenda is not just a plan for 
smaller government. It is a plan for smarter government and for 
reforming the structure of the government and how it spends. 
The size of government will be reduced substantially over the 
next three years. Departmental spending will be cut by almost 
19 per cent from 1994-95 levels. For some departments  
spending will be halved and in total these actions will deliver a 
three-year savings of almost $17 billion.
<P>
	As a result of the sweeping reform of federal programs, the 
public service will be reduced by 20,000 people this year and by 
some 45,000 positions over the next three years. For the first 
time departments will have to prepare three-year business plans 
and submit the plans to the scrutiny of Parliament and the 
public.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The impact of the program review budgetary measures has 
been fairly distributed across all provinces. Some programs 
have been eliminated or significantly reduced. Other programs 
have been redesigned or consolidated. There are some particular 
measures that tend to be concentrated in specific regions.
<P>
	Of concern to the Atlantic region, and more particular to my 
riding of Central Nova, is the Atlantic freight subsidy that is 
being eliminated. However to offset this a five-year, $326 
million transition program is being provided. Dairy subsidies 
will be reduced by 30 per cent over the next two years. Forest 
resource development agreements with the province will be 
discontinued. The public utilities income tax transfer payment 
of $30.4 million to Nova Scotia will be terminated. Regional 
agency funding will decline by $562 million over the next three 
fiscal years. ACOA's share of the reduction is $173.5 million or 
a 31 per cent reduction.
<P>
	The government remains committed to supporting economic 
incentives in Atlantic Canada. ACOA has proven to be the most 
efficient and effective vehicle for delivering on the 
commitment. In terms of the government's commitment to job 
creation as promised in the red book, ACOA has shown itself to 
be part of the solution, having helped to create some 42,000 jobs 
in Atlantic Canada. ACOA will continue to fulfil a vital role as a 
source of capital for the region for growing small and medium 
size business and as a leader for economic development in the 
region.
<P>
	In conclusion, the budget marks the beginning of a new era. It 
underlines the need for an evolving, dynamic, co-operative 
federalism to meet the challenges facing Canada's economy and 
its people in a tough, competitive world. It is a challenging 
budget but also an equitable budget that deserves the support of 
all members of the House.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very attentively to the speech on the budget given by 
our colleague for Central Nova. However, I must confess that I 
detected bias in her comments. This hon. member must be on the 
same team as the Minister of Finance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10461"> 10461 </A></B>
<P>
	She said a few minutes ago that she saw the budget as a source 
of jobs-there is nothing to be seen. There is absolutely nothing 
there, less than nothing for job creation in this country, on the 
contrary. The only good thing the Liberal government has done 
to create jobs was the $2 billion, which became-because it was 
a tripartite program-$6 billion.
<P>
	That was the only good creative thing where jobs could be 
created, and it should be said that the jobs were temporary. 
There was $200 million left, and they were threatening to cut it. 
And the hon. member for Central Nova is telling us that jobs will 
be created out of this budget. On the contrary, there is nothing.
<P>
	She spoke of the deficit and of the debt which had become 
huge, a major problem for the country. This is true. I, however, 
would remind her that, in 1970, when her team was running the 
country, the deficit was almost nil-$1 billion and some. It was 
``improved'' again and again. There were of course Mr. Clark's 
nine months and the preceding government's nine years, but 
today's $550 billion debt, on which we pay $50 billion in 
interest a year, is the child of her own party, except for the nine 
years the Conservatives were in government, before the Liberals 
returned to power.
<P>
	I conclude by asking my colleague how she is going to justify 
to her constituents the fact that they have widened the gap to 
obtain parity in industrial milk and unprocessed milk in Nova 
Scotia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised a number of 
issues.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me set the record straight. I am not biased and I am 
certainly not confused. I have read the budget, I have scrutinized 
it and I am very proud to support the budget.
<P>
	With respect to jobs and job creation we should not overlook 
the numerous job creation strategy programs the Liberals have 
implemented and are continuing with the budget. We have our 
youth service corps initiative and all our human resources 
development programs the people in my riding of Central Nova 
rely on on a very regular basis. They are creating jobs. I am 
proud to say we are now underway in implementing our youth 
service initiative program.
<P>
	With respect to ACOA and its new role in terms of economic 
development in our area, we are very proud and pleased to have 
ACOA involved in economic and regional development and we 
are looking forward to working very closely with that agency.
<P>
	We have our infrastructure program. Although there has been 
some reduction in the funding my riding has benefited 
significantly and created a number of jobs pursuant to this 
program and we are looking forward to future initiatives.
<P>
	We also rely on small business in our area, which creates up to 
85 per cent of the jobs in the country. The Liberals are being very 
active in terms of ensuring small businesses get the venture 
capital they need, ACOA will be taking a roll there, and also the 
measures they have taken in terms of ensuring banks recognize 
small business initiatives.
<P>
	With respect to dairy subsidies, which affect my riding, there 
is only a 30 per cent reduction. There is equity in the budget. 
Every sector, every individual, every business, everyone has 
been affected by the budget. In terms of dairy subsidies for Nova 
Scotia there is only a 30 per cent reduction. It is time it became 
more competitive and cut its costs in terms of management and 
organization. It is not necessary for the 30 per cent reduction to 
be passed on to consumers. I trust it will not be in Central Nova.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the budget handed down by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	The main basis for my support is this was a unique process. 
This was terrific way all Canadians could participate in the 
budget. Volumes and volumes of material and input from 
Canadians across the country were received and distributed 
among parliamentarians and among the general public. The 
information came in a variety of forms and forums. There were 
letters, organized mailings, budget workshops, radio call-ins 
and town hall meetings.
<P>
	People put forward their ideas, their personal views, their 
fears and their projections for the future. Canadians took part in 
the prebudget consultation process and had their voices heard. 
No rebellion was necessary. True democracy worked and the 
budget is a result of that.
<P>
	In Burlington we had a terrific prebudget consultation 
meeting. It was a great example of public participation, 
discussion and debate. We had incredible input and ideas from 
people of all ages, backgrounds and various work experiences. 
We provided information to them beforehand so they could 
make an informed contribution. They could weigh the options. 
They could think about the issues, unlike the Reform Party 
which asked people to simply check off which percentage and 
which columns they would like to have done.
<P>
	Through discussion we reached consensus on many issues and 
we had good debate and the debate continues on some others. 
My constituents thought long and hard about the issues. They 
offered their considered input.
<P>
	They did not want to have tax increases without government 
showing leadership and taking responsible action. They 
indicated, and I certainly support them, constituents give us 
their precious tax dollars and it is our job to make it work. We 
must bring some accountability to the process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10462"> 10462 </A></B>
<P>
	There was clear support among participants that spending 
cuts were inevitable. They asked us to take a good look at our 
existing programs and the funding mechanisms for them.
<P>
	In other areas there was no consensus reached. These are 
complex issues and Canadians are thinking hard about them. 
The budget addressed my constituents' concerns.
<P>
	There are some false perceptions out there and perhaps they 
serve some people's purposes. There is a false perception 
Canadians are excessively burdened by taxes compared with 
citizens of other countries. This is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River is on record as saying we 
are among the highest taxed people in the world. This is wrong. 
Canadian taxes as a percentage of economic activity fall below 
the average for the 24 industrialized nations of the OECD. 
However, that kind of statement does not take into account the 
services Canadians get in return for their hard earned tax 
dollars.
<P>
	We must deliver value for money. One great example is our 
entire medicare program. Even so, Canadians and Burlington 
residents agreed personal income tax rates should not be raised. 
The government listened and there were no tax increases.
<P>
	We are achieving our goals for deficit and debt reduction, but 
not on the backs of individual Canadians. Our solutions are 
focused. They are good, efficient government instead of 
increased taxation.
<P>
	Canadians recognized difficult decisions had to be made 
while at the same time it was critical we make strategic 
investments, that we be smart about where we are going to spend 
money for the future and to balance our budget.
<P>
	The Reform Party is quoted in the Calgary <I>Herald</I>, February 
7: ``Reform for its part would rapidly slash government 
spending as to create a fiscal balance while creating a huge 
social deficit in the form of greater unemployment and social 
polarization''. This is not the Canada we want.
<P>
	Our approach is to cut in a fair manner, to lead by example by 
looking at where to cut in government first. By reducing 
government spending and undertaking a full program review we 
have taken the responsible approach. The budget has a 7:1 ratio 
of spending cuts to revenue increases. These steps will lead the 
country into a brighter economic future. We are redefining the 
role of government.
<P>
	In the area of unemployment Burlington residents are 
concerned about their neighbours, both in our community and in 
the broader Canadian context. People must get back to work. 
The budget continues with our Liberal four-point agenda for 
jobs and growth. New programs are being developed to ensure 
people acquire more skills, the youth internship program, the 
youth  service corps. We must address youth unemployment 
particularly and the school to work transition. We must invest in 
our future generations now.
<P>
	Burlington residents suggested the best way to improve job 
creation is to implement apprenticeship programs, keep pace 
with innovation and with changes in technology, encourage 
education and training, encourage free enterprise, eliminate 
bureaucratic paper work, especially for small businesses. The 
budget is connected to all our initiatives as a government and to 
our policies like the social security review.
<P>
	The area of technology is important. We must be innovative. 
We must be ready for the future. We must spend wisely and work 
within our fiscal means. R and D is encouraged through the 
research and experimental tax incentive, one of the most 
generous tax incentives in the world. However, it is important it 
is not abused, and so we have moved to change that.
<P>
	In the area of small business we must continue to invest in 
people and in growth. The 1994 budget undertook a small 
business policy review, realizing entrepreneurs are responsible 
for creating the majority of new jobs in Canada and for moving 
our economy forward. With consultation and the release of the 
report ``Building a More Innovative Economy'' we have 
received input from Canadians about how to proceed. The 
challenge of access to capital remains.
<P>
	The 1995 budget encourages banks to do a better job of 
lending to small businesses by encouraging government to work 
with the banks to develop appropriate benchmarks. These must 
be achieved.
<P>
	In my riding of Burlington our local economy is vital and 
continues to grow. We have many diverse, successful small and 
medium size businesses such as Colette's Café and Toshiba 
Office Product Centre, employing a small number of people but 
growing.
<P>
	There are many more people, young and old, experienced and 
inexperienced, who have excellent ideas, great initiative and 
full support from their friends and families. All they need is 
financial backing. These are the people who are creating jobs in 
Canada. These are the people whose entrepreneurial spirit we 
must foster. They are creating the environment and the jobs for 
future generations. The government is committed to ensuring 
they do that.
<P>
	We are committed to ensuring Burlington and all Canadian 
businesses are able to succeed, to grow and to add to their 
employee base. We have fine examples like the companies that 
started small, Zenon Environmental, Gennum, 
Thompson-Gordon and Laidlaw. They are leaders in the world 
in their own fields.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="10463"> 10463 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	The 1995 budget also put some things in context for 
Canadians. Our inflation was the lowest of the G-7 nations and 
our economy grew at a rate of 4.25 per cent, the fastest of the 
G-7 nations.
<P>
	Our export growth is strong; 433,000 full time jobs have been 
created since January 1994. The unemployment rate has fallen 
by 1.7 percentage points. Our cost competitiveness is the 
highest in 40 years and yet we remain burdened by high national 
debt and continue to pay off our interest.
<P>
	There is optimism. Canadians know we have a rational plan 
for deficit reduction. We are taking the right steps. We will 
achieve our deficit targets. In the last year we not only achieved 
them, we surpassed them by $4.2 billion. We aspired 
confidence.
<P>
	Now is the time for hard decisions. We must make forward 
thinking investments for the future. Our aim is sustainable jobs 
and growth, with sensitive cuts and responsible spending.
<P>
	The budget shows our commitment to future generations. We 
cannot stand idle by the impact of our decisions or past actions. 
We must not squander limited resources, but use them in an 
intelligent and effective manner.
<P>
	Precious Canadian taxpayers' dollars must be put to work 
effectively. This budget is a terrific step in that plan of action. 
Canadians are the winners in this budget. They made their 
voices heard and this budget is there because of them.
<P>
	I thank the many residents of Burlington who participated in 
this process. We are all winners. We will have a stronger nation. 
We will all have better lives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was overwhelmed by the speech of my colleagues about these 
mean Reformers here. There is a bit of paranoia among the 
government members about the budget.
<P>
	There are a couple of things in particular about her speech that 
are really intriguing to me. The hon. member suggests the 
government is going to meet its targets and Canada will be 
forever thankful when the Liberals meet their targets, three per 
cent of GDP, approximately $25 billion a year. We would really 
like to thank this government at the end of its budget exercise for 
overspending by $25 billion a year. Somehow I am not sure a lot 
of folks out there think much of that.
<P>
	What is the idea of overspending by $25 billion a year? Is that 
is a good idea or a bad idea?
<P>
	Would the hon. member justify how this Liberal government 
can mess around with MPs' pensions and come up with $4 
million on the old plan and $3.16 million in the new plan, like 
the minister of immigration. How can they justify that and cut 
all the other programs back? Maybe they could get rid of the 
paranoia over there.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Like many members, I am interested in 
paranoia. I am going to let the hon. member think about it for a 
bit. She will have the floor when we come after question period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members.

<P>
	As a British Columbian, I urge the members of this House to 
recognize the importance of the mining industry to all 
Canadians. The government's 1995 budget made a first step 
toward improving our mining industry's ability to maintain and 
create jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	Besides providing 400,000 direct and indirect jobs in Canada, 
mining sustains 150 Canadian communities and their one 
million residents, thus having a great impact on their daily lives 
in future.
<P>
	Besides adding $10 billion to our annual trade balance, 
mining contributes $20 billion a year to the Canadian economy 
and accounts for 14.8 per cent of Canada's total exports. Mining 
is therefore a key engine for the export driven economy, jobs and 
growth benefiting all of Canada and not only those who live in 
mining regions.

	The Minister of Canadian Heritage is silently planning to kill 
locally owned radio stations. They already pay royalties to 
authors and composers of music aired on their stations. 
Additional fees to performers and record companies is unjust.
<P>
	Broadcasters maintain that free air play is what creates 
Canadian stars and sells records, not a Liberal government tax 
hidden in a bill of amendments. Canadians are confident that our 
culture can develop and grow without the Liberal government 
intervening with a radio station killer tax.

Speaker, on the afternoon of Thursday, March 16, 1995 the 
Carleton Civic Centre will officially open its doors in 
Woodstock, New Brunswick. It is a wonderful new facility that 
will be enjoyed by the area's citizens for many years to come.
<P>
	While this is wonderful news, the even more important 
component has been the method in which the goal of completing 
this facility has been realized. It is important to note that the 
completion of this project was achieved through true 
partnership. This partnership included groups, organizations,

	This past weekend Mr. Kerry Burtnyk and his team members, 
Keith Fenton, Rob Meakin who is a constituent of mine, and Jeff 
Ryan captured the brier in Halifax. It was Burtnyk's second win. 
He first won the brier 14 years ago. Mr. Burtnyk and his team

championships in Brandon beginning on April 8. We wish him 
and his teammates the very best of luck.
<P>
	I also wish to give my wholehearted congratulations to the 
University of Winnipeg Wesman women's basketball team. 
They won their third consecutive university championship this 
past weekend. The Wesman beat the University of Manitoba 
Bison squad 72 to 61. A healthy rivalry exists between these two 
teams. In fact it was earlier this year that the Bisons ended the 
Wesman's world record setting 88 game winning streak.

Canadian-American treaties with Quebec, including the free

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALDEBT">NATIONAL DEBT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, despite the spending cuts announced in the Budget, 
the government is faced with a substantial increase this year, 
from $42 billion to $50 billion, in the cost of servicing the debt. 
This increase is, of course, a direct consequence of our growing 
cumulative debt. In other words, the debt problem has not been 
addressed, despite the government's commitments.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Finance. Will the 
minister confirm that even with the spending cuts announced in 
the Budget, the government's cumulative debt will total nearly 
$800 billion five years from now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker, I believe the 
estimate given by the Leader of the Opposition is a little too 
pessimistic. We certainly intend to continue our efforts to put 
our fiscal house in order, but we did inherit a very substantial 
debt. In fact, that is why we took some very specific and very 
decisive steps in our latest Budget.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the figure I quoted is based on the data given in the 
Budget, on the minister's own figures over three years, 
projected according to the same parameters. He cannot deny 
those figures.
<P>
	More specifically, I want to ask him whether he would agree 
that the debt problem will not be solved as long as nothing is 
done about the political structures of an ossified federal system 
that has turned Canada into a country that is overgoverned with, 
for instance, 40 per cent of federal spending targeted to areas 
that come under provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, projections like 
those just made by the Leader of the Opposition are based on the 
assumption that the government does not intend to intervene. 
However, we have just made it quite clear that we intend to use 
budget after budget to introduce decisive measures to deal with 
the legacy we received from the previous government.
<P>
	That being said, as far as government structures are 
concerned, we have again made it very clear in the Budget that 
we are capable of taking action in this respect. If anyone is in 
favour of the status quo, it is, unfortunately, the Leader of the 
Opposition and his party.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister was into his usual rhetoric, but I would 
remind him that the figures I just mentioned were computed 
directly on the basis of his own figures, assuming that he meets 
the objectives he has set, however inadequate they may be.
<P>
	I want to ask him how he can deny the federal government's 
very obvious inflexibility, when we consider the $5 billion tax 
on employment, and I am referring to the surplus created by 
excessively high UI premiums, which the government will use 
to fund new incursions into the area of manpower training, 
instead of reducing UI premiums to stimulate job creation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and I have said repeatedly that 
we plan to reduce unemployment insurance premiums. In fact, 
one of the first announcements the minister made a year ago was 
in that vein.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Yes, we are creating a surplus, but I would have thought the 
Leader of the Opposition would welcome that. We inherited an 
incredible deficit, and we are turning it into a surplus. That is 
quite a feat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again, the Minister of Finance has delayed the 
needed reform of the Canadian tax system instead of ensuring 
that all taxpayers and corporations pay their fair share of taxes. 
He chose once again to go after the middle class and the most 
disadvantaged in trying to address his deficit problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10468"> 10468 </A></B>
<P>
	Given the extent of his budget problem, how can the minister 
deliberately spare the banks, which made over $4 billion in 
profits last year, by requiring from them a symbolic, temporary 
effort of only $100 million?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the $100 million 
tax is in addition to the large corporations tax, which we raised 
in our last budget. There is also the corporate tax that the banks 
are paying. I must point out to the hon. member that, if we look 
at government revenues, the fastest growing source of revenue 
is the taxes collected from large corporations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister tells us that he has asked the banks to make 
an effort, so I would remind him that the effort he requires from 
the unemployed is 120 times bigger than for the banks.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> One hundred and twenty times bigger! That is 
his definition of fairness. So the question I am asking him is 
this: How does the minister explain his refusal to honour his 
election commitment, as reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, to 
establish a real minimum tax on corporate profits, when CP, 
with profits of $422 million, did not pay a single cent in tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, there is 
a minimum corporate tax, which, incidentally, we increased in 
our last budget. I must, however, tell you that we did not raise 
personal taxes in our last budget, and I would ask the hon. 
member to tell the chief of the head office in Quebec City, Mr. 
Parizeau, not to raise personal taxes, as he threatened to do a 
couple of days ago.

question is for the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	The current railway labour dispute is now a national lockout. 
West coast ports are also shut down due to a longshoremen's 
strike. Every few years we go through this fiasco where both 
sides know back to work legislation is inevitable. Unfortunately 
Canadian jobs and other industries are at stake.
<P>
	Will the minister put an end to this charade and legislate 
everyone back to work now?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we must look at each work situation from a different 
perspective and not lump airports, harbours and railways all 
together. They are different companies and labour relations vary 
from one to the other.
<P>
	We are keeping abreast of these situations. As you know, Mr. 
Speaker, regarding railways, even CP was able to reach an 
agreement in principle with some workers. The situation which 
is of most concern to me now is that of the port of Vancouver, 
which we are following on an hourly basis, and I hope that the 
parties will go back to the negotiating table.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Labour may have time to wait to sort this out but 
Canadian farmers do not.
<P>
	Present shipments are in danger. They must plan for future 
crops now and should not have to worry about whether the rail 
system will be there when they need it.
<P>
	I ask the minister again. When will the government introduce 
back to work legislation? When?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the Reform member to remain calm 
and to refrain from spreading panic among the parties 
concerned. As we speak, grain is moving in the west, in 
Vancouver this very day.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	We should keep in contact with the parties and keep in mind 
that it is always better to negotiate an agreement than to envision 
legislating these people back to work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
been calm far too long. When is the time to get nervous? It is 
right now. To date there have been 13 work stoppages in 29 
years. Our western grain growers cannot afford to bear the brunt 
of another strike. Canada's transportation system must be 
reliable or our customers will go elsewhere.
<P>
	Once the back to work legislation is passed, will the 
government take steps to ensure the threat of future rail strikes is 
removed once and for all?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr.

the European Union. Yesterday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10469"> 10469 </A></B>

listed a number of diplomatic avenues to reopen discussions 
with EU officials.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs inform us of the outcome 
of the diplomatic initiatives mentioned yesterday and whether 
these initiatives will get things moving again, so that the dispute 
can be settled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, we certainly intend to pursue as far as possible the 
diplomatic initiatives under way. The Canadian government's 
commitment to protect fishery resources threatened by 
overfishing could not be clearer. I can assure the hon. member 
that the Government of Canada will not go back on this 
commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
part of these diplomatic initiatives, is the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs contemplating travelling himself to Brussels to defend 
Canada's position and try to reopen discussions with EU 
countries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I am flattered by the hon. member's suggestion. 
Obviously, should my presence be required to achieve a 
negotiated settlement in this dispute, I will gladly do so. But for 
the time being, I think that the government officials responsible 
for that sort of thing are doing a fine job and will succeed in 
coming to an agreement with our European Union friends.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister. Recently some very serious allegations 
concerning possible conflict of interest in the post office have 
come to our attention. It seems that a Liberal senator and the 
chairman and president of Canada Post are closely linked to the 
Ottawa developer who built the new Canada Post building.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether he will instruct 
the ethics counsellor to investigate this very serious issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question relates to something which occurred 
before this government took office.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to say that the CBC, which made the 
allegation, apologized to the person concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very 
serious allegation. It calls for immediate action. Within weeks 
of winning this lucrative Canada Post contract, the developer, 
Mr. José Perez, was billed $59,000 to finance the racing career 
of the son of the Canada Post chairman. At the same time, the 
Liberal senator was billing Mr. Perez $60,000 per year for 
business advice.
<P>
	I ask again. Will the Prime Minister undertake to ask the 
ethics counsellor to investigate, give a full accounting to the 
House and open up these allegations?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just said that the problem was a problem of 
management of the previous administration. It is not a problem 
that occurred before we formed the government. At that time 
there were no ethics counsellors. I do not know if it is my job to 
get the ethics counsellor to look into the file.
<P>
	If the member has accusations to make, he can make them 
outside the House and face the consequences. The CBC 
apologized because it had a reason to apologize. I do not think it 
was a well founded accusation, but if the member wants to make 
an accusation he can make an accusation and face the 
responsibility of making such accusations.

my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	During this time of government downsizing we have heard a 
lot of talk about fairness and equity. However today we read in 
the papers about an example that does not seem too fair at all. It 
is a special retirement allowance for deputy ministers. On top of 
the regular public service pension, deputy ministers get an extra 
2 per cent per year without paying a cent of their own. That could 
be an extra $30,000 a year for life.

1988 because at the time it wanted to attract more people from 
the private sector to become deputy ministers. The private 
sector said: ``You are not competitive in terms of your salaries''. 
It said: ``We will take the additional pension allowance as being 
part of a total compensation package and will help attract people 
from the private sector into deputy minister positions''. That is 
the reason the government brought in the program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
does sound strangely like MP pension plans.
<P>
	The government actually on that one refused to take its nose 
out of the trough. Now on the deputy minister level we find that 
there is also a two-tier system depending on which level of the 
public service one belongs to.
<P>
	For the sake of morale in the public service and for the sake of 
the fairness and equity the government claims, it should cancel 
the program that gives extra benefits to top executives and make 
it the same for all public servants as it should be.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a number of representatives of the private sector 
advised the government of the day on this matter. They said: ``If 
you really want to attract top people to serve the public of 
Canada you are going to have to be competitive, and your 
salaries are not competitive''.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	We have to look at it from a total compensation package point 
of view. On that basis that is why it has been offered to senior 
deputy ministers.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	In its budget, the government announces a substantial cut in 
international development assistance, in particular food aid to 
the poorest countries on earth. In fact, it is reducing by 16 per 
cent the multilateral and bilateral food aid budget, which will 
fall from $300 million to $250 million this year.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Foreign Affairs reconcile Canada's 
substantial cuts to its international assistance budget with the 
support it gave to increasing development aid to the poorest 
countries at the Copenhagen summit on social development?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question is about the same as 
that asked by one of his colleagues yesterday. In response to that 
question, I said that the Government of Canada had two ways of 
providing food aid: through its multilateral programs and 
through its bilateral programs.
<P>
	The figures quoted by the hon. member refer to only one form 
of food aid. He does not have the total picture on government 
spending in this regard. If he combines expenditures in both 
bilateral and multilateral programs, he will see that our 
contribution remains the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
does the minister justify such a substantial reduction in its direct 
assistance to the poorest countries even before completing the 
reform of CIDA recommended by the Auditor General of 
Canada?
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The Liberals seem to have different rules for Canada's elite. 
Last night it was reported that children of diplomats and senior 
military officials were attending expensive private schools all 
around the world and the taxpayers were footing the bill for this 
extravagance.
<P>
	Will the government commit to immediately bringing this 
benefit in line with similar benefits in the private sector?
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
The answer, Mr. Speaker, is that we do exactly that. It is quite 
clear that the children of those serving abroad have to attend 
schools that follow a curriculum which will allow them to 
continue their classes when they come back to Canada.
<P>
	Canadian diplomats are receiving nothing more than 
diplomats of other countries. If the children of Canadian 
business representatives abroad are going to school, they are 
going to exactly the same schools as the children of our 
diplomats.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. minister for his response. However the foreign 
services directive indicates that there is a double standard. 
Students are given three taxpayer funded flights a year. Students 
are even going to school on the French Riviera. These perks are 
more lucrative than in the private sector.
<P>
	Not only is there a two-tier pension plan but we learn there is 
now a two-tier education plan: one for ordinary Canadians and 
one for the Canadian elite.
<P>
	Does the minister not understand that Canadians will no 
longer tolerate these Liberal double standards for the Canadian 
elite?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the suggestion of the hon. member to 
review the treatment offered to children of our people who are 
abroad.
<P>
	I challenge her to verify the allegations she is making here 
which I think are totally unfounded. It is very nice to take her

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	We have learned that the number of francophones applying to 
become Canadian Forces officers dropped drastically after the 
closure of the military college in Saint-Jean was announced. 
Applications are down to 102 this year from 243 last year, a drop 
of more than 50 per cent.
<P>
	Does the Minister of National Defence recognize that, as we 
had predicted, closing the military college in Saint-Jean will 
have the effect of discouraging francophones from becoming 
Canadian Forces officers because they can no longer train in 
their own environment and in French, as they could in 
Saint-Jean?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to inform the House that recruitment for the armed forces is 
down right across the country. One of the reasons is that the 
economy is buoyant.
<P>
	Historically when times are rough there is obviously less 
competition for the various places. As a result of improvement 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10472"> 10472 </A></B>
<P>
in the economy we find that the normal group of people who 
would be attracted to the armed forces has found other options.
<P>
	With respect to Quebec, recruitment is down about 50 per cent 
overall. It is down 40 per cent in Ontario. It is down about 20 per 
cent in the west. It is about even in the Atlantic region.
<P>
	I should say that part of the problem concerning recruitment 
to the military college was due to the uncertainty as to what 
would happen with young students coming out of high schools in 
Quebec. That uncertainty was created because of the opposition 
tactics by the official opposition and the government in Quebec 
City that refused to accept the agreement originally signed by 
the former Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Now that we have the agreement in place and now that the 
parents of francophone students in Quebec know what is going 
to happen, we believe recruitment will pick up in the next few 
weeks and we will meet our target very shortly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find the minister's answer extraordinary.
<P>
	Does the Minister of National Defence recognize that the 
sharp drop in francophone officer candidate enrolment will 
inevitably aggravate the already serious problem of 
francophone under-representation in the senior ranks of the 
Canadian Armed Forces, thereby compounding the unfair 
treatment of Quebec?

<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it 
extraordinary that the hon. member did not listen to my answer.
<P>
	Because of the uncertainty surrounding the disposition of the 
site of the former College at St-Jean, the advertising for those 
students specifically in Quebec was delayed a number of weeks. 
Now that we have a deal that was signed a few weeks ago we 
know what exactly is available. Those students coming out of 
high schools in Quebec can take the prep year at the new civil 
institution in St-Jean.
<P>
	In the last few days we have been heartened by what we have 
seen. Recruitment is picking up. It was merely delayed.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about the decline in francophones 
overall in the armed forces. That is not borne out by the facts. 
About 27 per cent of members of the armed forces are 
francophone and fully 24 per cent of all senior officers are 
francophone, and that will continue.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a

concluding document of immigration consultations in B.C. in 
which the minister's employees say the following: ``We go 
about congratulating ourselves for our overexuberant 
acceptance of bogus refugees while the rest of the world 
snickers at us for the suckers we are. The lawyers are making a 
circus out of refugee claims''.
<P>
	The minister ignores Canadians, experts and the Reform 
Party. Will he also ignore his own employees or will he make 
change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know where this 
member has been for the last little while, but this government 
has made a number of reforms not only to the immigration 
procedure but also to legislation like Bill C-44. Reforms to the 
IRB were announced last week. He was upset that we announced 
them during the budget process.
<P>
	However, this government has moved on both IRB and 
immigration procedures. We support immigration. Immigration 
is positive for this country regardless of what this member and 
his party stand for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the minister needs more suggestions for change than those we 
have offered already, here is what his own employees have to 
say: ``End inland refugee claims. Limit family reunification. 
End official multiculturalism and make personal suitability the 
key criterion for immigration to Canada''.
<P>
	Why did the minister hide this damning document? Will he 
admit that last summer's consultations were as bogus as the 
refugee system he so ardently defends?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot hide a document I 
have never seen. My department and my government do not 
stand for the comments he has made.
<P>

<P>
	Would he say here in the House today what he is reported to

privatization of CN that may happen in the future, pensions of 
CN pensioners will be guaranteed by the Government of Canada 
and CN pensioners have nothing to fear from privatization? Will 
he put that on the record here today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in dealing with the commercialisation of CN obviously 
we are going to take into account everything important to 
Canadians and the employees of CN. I want to reassure my hon. 
friend that as the process unfolds the interests of everyone 
involved will be protected to the extent that we can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
why is the Minister of Finance not willing to state today on the 
record what he is reported to have said at that meeting in 
Winnipeg, that the pensions of CN pensioners would be 
guaranteed by the Government of Canada?

	Get up and say it so people do not have to worry about their 
pensions. Say what you said in Winnipeg. Never mind him, I 
asked-

	<B>The Speaker:</B> All questions should be put through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I understand the hon. member's frustration because we 
have all read of his experience at a meeting he attended to 
discuss financial matters in the west not very long ago. He only 
lasted, I am told, some five or ten minutes when they asked him 
to leave. It is obvious why one would do that.
<P>
	With respect to the commercialisation of Canadian National, 
we understand the concerns of the pensioners of CN, the 
concerns of the employees. We also understand how important it 
is to taxpayers and to people across the country to have a viable 
enterprise, operating a coast to coast railroad.
<P>
	The difference between what the government will do and what

there is less than a week left to negotiate arrangements for this

which could keep that airline from exploiting this lucrative

the Chamber that paranoia will destroy you, and I am not 
paranoid.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I 
believe it is not proper procedure to note members that are not in 
the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sure the hon. 
member will apologize for having done that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Madam Speaker, I do apologize for that.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	As I was saying earlier it is important that we set clear targets. 
As anybody or any business that has been in a debt situation 
knows you have to set clear targets and meet those targets. That 
is certainly what the government is doing.
<P>
	You do not cut off your nose to spite your face. We still have to 
make investments in the future. We still have to get out from 
underneath the debt and deficit situation. We will do so by 
making strategic investments, by setting clear targets and by 
continuing to meet those targets as we have in the last year and 
actually exceeding them. That is the conclusion of my remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member's time 
has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am speaking in this debate in order to point out a 
number of contradictions in the budget, in the way cuts are 
made, cuts I would describe as bad.
<P>
	The first thing I would like to draw to the attention of this 
House is the cuts in research and development, particularly in 
the agricultural sector. In this period of worldwide change, this 
time of market globalization, it is very surprising for a 
government to be cutting out all research in such a draconian and 
definitive fashion in the area of ovine production-production 
for the development of sheep farming. This type of production is 
both ecological and a source of diversification for a number of 
regions in Canada.
<P>
	The decision was made in the budget to close the experimental 
farm at La Pocatière. This is a federal experimental farm, the 
oldest one in Quebec, which, only two years ago, was given the 
exclusive mandate for research in sheep farming for all of 
eastern Canada and in fact for Canada as a whole. A few years 
ago, a new sheep barn was built there at a cost of $10 
million-money simply forgotten today. We are told that this 
farm will be closed, despite the fact that the sheep industry 
should get the most out of investment in research and 
development.
<P>
	This situation is in blatant contradiction with the Liberal 
Party program and the guidelines of the present government on 
support to the agriculture industry. It is a contradiction, and I 
believe the government should reverse its decision and continue 
to pay the cost of research and development in sheep production 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10476"> 10476 </A></B>
<P>
so that  this industry can receive the support it needs to take its 
rightful place in the Quebec and Canadian market.
<P>
	Another example of bad cuts in the budget is the substantial 
increase in port tariffs planned for the various harbours that 
come under Ports Canada and which are along the St. Lawrence 
River, among other places. They decided to raise port tariffs by 
25 per cent and the ultimate result of this increase will be that a 
certain number of boats which would otherwise have docked in 
these ports will refuse to do so. For example, in Cacouna 
harbour, in my riding, the increase in port tariffs will achieve the 
opposite effect to that intended, which is to increase government 
revenues.
<P>
	The result of the increase in port tariffs will be that fewer 
boats will dock there. This may cause an overall decrease. This 
is the kind of misjudgment of the situation which will have a 
negative impact on all ports, especially on the St. Lawrence, 
where 13 ports can be considered profitable when it comes to 
efficiency. This across-the-board increase in port tariffs will 
make some hitherto profitable ports stop being profitable and 
will make them a drain on the federal budget. I think that it is 
important that the federal government reconsider its decision to 
increase port tariffs by 25 per cent, because all users know that it 
will have an impact.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	People who make calls for tenders, shipowners who entertain 
the idea of docking ships in Cacouna harbour or another could 
very well end up going to the east coast of the United States. We 
are going to eventually end up with even more harbour facilities 
which are not used as they should be and which will be 
increasingly in the red.
<P>
	I think that these are examples where the government sets out 
in good faith to cut spending, but cuts in the wrong places and 
implements cuts which have negative repercussions for the 
economy of certain regions, like the one I represent, the riding 
of Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	Another example is transportation subsidies. Everyone agrees 
that these subsidies, which perhaps created an artificial market, 
must be abolished. The Minister of Transport was favourably 
disposed to recommendations that these subsidies be eliminated 
gradually, so that the impact on the regional economy could be 
evaluated. The Minister of Finance, however, has decided to cut 
them drastically starting July 1, 1995.
<P>
	It is not possible at this time to predict the effect this will have 
on eastern Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. It is not known if 
it will be beneficial or disastrous, or if some businesses will not 
be forced to close their doors during the summer of 1995 
because of this decision.
<P>
	Why did the government not follow the recommendations of 
the industrial commissioners of eastern Quebec, of the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency, of all the stakeholders in this 
sector ultimately, and reduce these subsidies gradually over four 
or five years? That would have allowed the various industries, 
whether in the forestry sector, dairy production, furniture 
manufacturing, or processing, to adapt, to explore new markets 
and to meet the new challenges of competition.
<P>
	I think that a decision such as this one will lead on the short 
term to an increase in unemployment. I need not tell you that our 
economy does not adapt very quickly to change. Some people 
will lose their jobs and will not find others right away because 
the first step will be to rebuild the regional economy, to create an 
industrial fabric corresponding to the new market conditions 
resulting from the abolition of transportation subsidies.
<P>
	This is another example of how, in the budget, the federal 
government has ignored the complex nature of markets and is 
making decisions that will have a major negative impact on the 
short term. This impact could have been reduced by taking into 
account the recommendations made by the various stakeholders 
in the local economy.
<P>
	I would like to give one last example, which I think is even 
more meaningful, namely the Federal Office of Regional 
Development's withdrawal from capital assistance programs for 
small business. Under the pretext of saving, we will kill a very 
lucrative small business start-up market.
<P>
	For example, a small winery like the one in my riding 
obtained a subsidy to build a warehouse, which allowed it to 
expand its market and secure a significant market share. This 
type of assistance will disappear. Consultants will help 
businesses find their way around the bureaucratic maze, but this 
type of assistance will not help launch small businesses. In this 
regard, I think that the federal government made the wrong 
decision.
<P>
	I gave several examples of less than effective cuts which will 
be counter-productive on the long term, so that we will end up 
with an even larger deficit and regions will become even more 
dependent on transfers. The results will be the opposite of what 
the government is trying to achieve.
<P>
	Of course, the government argues that it has to do this in order 
to cut spending. But we have not looked at the other side of the 
coin. For example, why did they decide to give family trusts 
until 1999 before eliminating the tax deferral and preferred 
beneficiary provisions?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10477"> 10477 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	It is a little like coming home one night to find a burglar and 
telling him: ``It is now 11 at night; I will come back tomorrow 
morning around five o'clock, but in the meantime, keep quiet 
and do not steal anything''.
<P>
	We are telling Canada's wealthy families that have taken 
advantage of family trusts that they have five years to empty 
these trusts. At the end of the day, they will still be able to make 
the most of this unacceptable tax dodge.
<P>
	Another way we could have saved money is by eliminating 
duplication in the area of manpower where, in Quebec alone, 
$250 million is wasted every year. I wanted to give these two 
examples to show that, if the government had taken action in the 
right places, it would not have been obliged to resort to such 
senseless measures as cutting Canada's only experimental sheep 
production research farm, which is located in La Pocatière.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to take part in this debate on the 1995-96 budget.
<P>
	First of all, I must say that this budget is very disappointing. It 
is hard on the workers, the disadvantaged and Quebec. It does 
not contain any job creation measures. There is nothing in this 
budget for the 800,000 Quebecers on UI and welfare who want to 
work. In this budget like in his last budget, the Minister of 
Finance is announcing further cuts in unemployment insurance. 
Quebec however will get back less than it will contribute in 
1995. It is clear that federalism does not profit Quebec.
<P>
	This year, Quebec workers and employers will contribute $4.8 
billion to the UI fund, but Quebec claimants will receive about 
$4.7 billion in benefits and various employment-related 
services. This will means a shortfall of approximately $118 
million for Quebec. Just to restore the pre-recession level of 
employment, more than 800,000 jobs would have to be created 
in Canada.
<P>
	In that sense, the budget offers no hope to the 1,200,000 
jobless Canadians, based on Statistics Canada's figures.
<P>
	Instead, the government sets itself a target of 45,000 job cuts 
in the federal public service, the most extensive one-time 
workforce reduction ever made in the public sector. Ottawa, 
Hull, Montreal, Toronto and many smaller cities and local 
economies will be hard hit by such a massive layoff of civil 
servants. I want to show solidarity with the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada and all government employees who will be 
laid off.
<P>
	In addition, seniors' income is threatened by the 
government's announcement of an impending review of old age 
pensions scheduled for 1997 and designed to reduce program 
benefits.
<P>
	In these times of drastic cuts in social programs, the 
government can almost certainly be expected to try and raise 
premiums, reduce benefits and tie pension income to family 
income. Thousands of seniors, UI and welfare recipients are 
very unhappy with this budget, particularly in my riding of 
Bourassa, where they are in great numbers.
<P>
	The federal contribution to social programs, i.e. welfare, 
health and education, will be reduced from $17.3 billion in 
1994-95 to $10.3 billion in 1997-98. This 40 per cent cut over 
three years will force the provinces to make further cuts with 
nothing offsetting these cuts.
<P>
	On the other hand, costly duplication will be allowed to 
continue at the expense of the taxpayers, and so will 
squandering.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Also, the government does not go after the thousands of 
businesses which do not pay taxes, nor does it do anything about 
the tax havens accessible by virtue of tax treaties signed with 
other countries. This budget looks like it was drafted by Wall 
Street financiers. Tax on bank capital is increased, but only for a 
certain period. Consequently, banks will temporarily contribute 
about $100 million, while the Royal Bank alone made profits in 
excess of $1.2 billion in 1994.
<P>
	As for family trusts, which Bloc Quebecois members 
denounced on many occasions, the minister maintains existing 
privileges for another five years. Over the next three years, the 
minister will cut $307 million from CMHC's budget, which is 
responsible for social housing, a very important issue in my 
riding of Bourassa, in Montréal-Nord. This unfair budget also 
reduces by $32 million the amount of subsidies to Quebec dairy 
producers.
<P>
	The government also intends to reduce by $1.3 billion, over a 
three-year period, the budget for international assistance. That 
decision is in full contradiction with the white paper on 
Canada's foreign policy, which was tabled in February. I come 
from a developing country and I care a lot about this issue. It is a 
shame for our country, which will only allocate 0.29 per cent of 
its GNP to international co-operation, while the objective set by 
the UN is 0.7 per cent. This is the lowest level since the sixties. 
Meanwhile, at the recent world summit on social development, 
in Copenhagen, industrial nations, including Canada, just 
pledged to increase official development assistance. How 
hypocritical!
<P>
	I also want to discuss the cuts affecting the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration. Because of drastic increases in 
immigration fees, family reunification will become 
increasingly difficult. The most blatant example is the tax on 
immigration. From now on, all adults who want to immigrate to 
Canada will have to pay $975, in addition to a $500 processing 
fee, which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10478"> 10478 </A></B>
<P>
means they will have to pay $1,475 just for the right to settle in 
Canada.
<P>
	In many countries, this amount is the equivalent of a year's 
wages or even more. A family of four will have to pay about 
$4,000. Many people whose refugee status has been recognized 
cannot afford to pay $500 to obtain permanent residence. Some 
people arrive here without any money at all. How can they deal 
with this increase? It is unacceptable that future immigrants 
who never lived in Canada or visited this country will have to 
pay for the Canadian government's deficit.
<P>
	The government overlooks the fact that the country of origin 
has already invested a lot of money in educating these 
immigrants who are a formidable asset to Canadian and Quebec 
society. Furthermore, people will have to pay $200 instead of 
$80 to obtain citizenship certificates. This is unacceptable. The 
government expects to collect more than $100 million per year 
as a result. This discriminates against workers and poor people 
from developing countries, like the head tax on Chinese 
immigrants in the 19th century, which was intended to 
discourage the Chinese from coming to Canada.
<P>
	The government has shown no compassion at all for people 
who seek the protection of Canada under the Geneva 
Convention. The budget cuts will have a severe impact on the 
IRB. The number of commissioners who deal with refugees will 
drop from 175 to 112. The board's budget will be reduced from 
$82 million to $77 million. On the whole, the budget of the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration is shrinking, 
despite the fact that fees for services rendered have gone up, 
sometimes by 200 or 300 per cent.
<P>
	Because of office closures, staff cuts, the creation of two huge 
processing centres in Vegreville and Mississauga and other 
operating problems, the department is no longer capable of 
carrying out its mandate.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	On top of that, we had the appointment a few days ago of 
Jean-Guy Fleury as executive director of IRB. Mr. Fleury 
formerly held a position with the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service, a fact that was omitted from his biographical notes.
<P>
	Why does the Liberal government want to establish this kind 
of association between immigration and intelligence and 
national security matters?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this is 
by way of a comment because I really cannot let some of hon. 
member's comments go unanswered.
<P>
	With the greatest of respect to the hon. member and his 
background in immigration, his lack of comprehension of the 
policies of the finance minister and the minister of immigration 
and our policy initiatives which have taken place during the last 
several weeks is tragic.
<P>
	The idea that the department of immigration would not reduce 
its moneys is simply ludicrous. Of course it will. We all have to. 
Every single person in this country has to make a sacrifice to 
ensure that the country will continue and that the institutions of 
this country will continue to serve all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I wonder if we could call a 
meteorologist. There appears to be some heavy weather on the 
other side.
<P>
	At any rate, over the sounds of the empty barrels, for the 
edification of the hon. member for Bourassa, for the 3,000th 
time since the announcement was made I want to explain the 
situation with regard to the fee. Very briefly, the $975 will be 
charged to adults on landing. No one will be turned away. 
Government loans will be available. Immigrants and refugees 
have paid back their loans from this country at the rate of 95 per 
cent. To say anything less is insulting to immigrants and 
refugees.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Madam Speaker, I notice a great difference in the 
position taken by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration when she was in opposition, on 
this side of the room, and her speech today, now that her side is 
in power. Why is she not giving the same pro-immigration and 
pro- refugee speech she gave before? Why has she changed so 
much? Today she is defending policies criticized by all of the 
organizations that assist refugees and immigrants. Everybody is 
against this immigration tax. Everyone opposes the $975 fee.
<P>
	She tells us that no one will be denied entry over this fee, but 
she does not tell us that, to qualify for a loan, an individual must 
show that he or she meets the loan repayment conditions. In poor 
countries, few people earn $975 a month; sometimes they do not 
even earn that in a year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wanted to respond to a couple of points the hon. member from 
the Bloc raised.
<P>
	With respect to the reductions of the dairy subsidies in the 
budget, I believe the member may have erroneously left the 
House with the impression that Quebecers and Quebec dairy 
farmers were the only ones who received these kinds of cuts. 
That is not true at all. In fact, I have just received information in 
my office of a Canadian analysis. Each one of the dairy farmers 
across Canada contributed equally to the reductions, in terms of 
those subsidies, to the tune of about $1,000 per farm unit. I can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10479"> 10479 </A></B>
<P>
report to the hon. member that the reductions in Quebec are the 
same type that were received in my constituency of Provencher.
<P>
	With respect to unemployment rates, at the outset of his 
speech the member raised concerns about the inequities in terms 
of contributions in Quebec to the unemployment insurance fund 
and those collecting unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the reason there are not as many people collecting 
unemployment in Quebec as there were last year is the federal 
government's small business initiatives and the federal 
infrastructure program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to point out, for the 
benefit of the hon. member for Halifax, that several members of 
her own party do not agree with the immigration fees.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Yes it is.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Are you going to reply 
to the hon. member for Provencher?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> I would like to give the hon. member an answer. 
Once again, Quebec is hit harder than the rest of the provinces. 
In the dairy sector alone, cuts of $32 million, and dairy 
producers are concentrated in Quebec. For the first time ever, 
this year Quebecers will contribute more to the unemployment 
insurance system than they will receive in benefits. The 
shortfall in unemployment insurance is $118 million. And there 
is nothing in the budget to help job creation. What about the 
promises? What about the Liberals' promise to create jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to participate in the budget 
debate. During all my years in opposition, I heard many finance 
ministers deliver their budget speeches. From one year to the 
next, the same scenario repeated itself. The minister would 
make great forecasts and great promises only to tell us later that 
he had been completely mistaken.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Now the approach is different. This is a new era. For the first 
time Canadians can trust their government's economic 
assumptions.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has restored the confidence of the 
financial markets. He has also done something else of equal 
importance. He is restoring the confidence of Canadians and for 
that I salute him.
<P>
	Today I want to talk about the implications of the budget for 
Canadian women. However let us be very clear. I am not only 
speaking to women; I am also speaking to men. Women's issues 
are everyone's issues. They are societal issues. They touch 
every citizen in the country.
<P>
	Women are our mothers, our spouses and care givers. They are 
also taxpayers, consumers, workers and entrepreneurs. They 
balance the family budget. They manage businesses. They take 
jobs and they create jobs. They educate the next generation.
<P>
	Women are very realistic. They know that as a nation we 
cannot spend more money than we make for a very long time. 
The time to pay back quickly catches up. Women understand 
that our country cannot continue to accumulate huge deficits 
year after year after year.
<P>
	Now the time has come to face reality. The 1995 budget is the 
first step and only the first step. Our goal is to create good jobs 
and maintain our social safety net. We refuse to have decisions 
of prime importance for the nation taken by the bond sellers in 
New York, Tokyo or for that matter on Bay Street.
<P>
	What lies ahead of us is a long journey, too long delayed. At 
the end of the journey we will emerge triumphant with our 
finances in order, a stronger economy, an ensured social safety 
net, and with renewed confidence in our abilities.
<P>
	Before we reach that goal many sacrifices will have to be 
made by all Canadians. We will all have to tighten our belts. 
Everyone shall be called on to do his or her fair share to help 
eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	Women really understand the need for fiscal restraint. They 
are ready to do their fair share but only their fair share, for fiscal 
restraint must never be used as an excuse to roll back the 
advances women have made in the past 20 years. Nor can it be 
given as a reason for delaying or postponing the further progress 
of women's equality.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The first piece of good news for women in this budget is that 
there is no tax increase.
<P>
	We sincerely believe that the tax issue is not only a matter of 
tax rates; it is also a matter of fairness. By eliminating tax 
loopholes, the budget makes our tax system more equitable.
<P>
	Second, the Canadian government wants to give the provinces 
more flexibility in managing programs like health care, 
post-secondary education and social insurance. We will achieve 
this goal through the Canada Social Transfer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The minister stated that flexibility does not mean a 
free-for-all. There are national goals that still must be applied. 
We will combine flexibility with continued fidelity to our 
principles.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10480"> 10480 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is absolutely committed to providing a fair 
and sustainable system of protection for Canadian seniors. This 
is also very important for women as they live longer and are 
often among the poorest in society. In order to ensure the 
sustainability of our pension programs, we will consult with 
seniors and Canadians in general on the nature of the needed 
changes later this year. That is part of open government.
<P>
	Women's groups have a great interest in these consultations 
and I encourage them to make their views known. I have asked 
my department to specifically focus on this issue in the coming 
year because we all have to contribute to the fullest degree 
possible to the design of the program.
<P>
	Women have a major stake in the budget measures, seeking to 
replace dependence with independence. An important element 
of that effort is the new human resource investment fund. We 
have to ensure that women's particular employment situations, 
their training and employment patterns, their incomes, family 
responsibility and life experiences are fully taken into account, 
both in the design of the new fund and the planned changes to 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am also delighted that the Minister of Finance has 
announced several measures to encourage small business.
<P>
	Close to 40 per cent of small businesses in Canada are headed 
by women and their success rate after five years of operation is 
double that for men. That is the truth.
<P>
	We can be proud of this success, which, however, did not 
come easily and without pitfalls. Businesswomen have to face 
what we call financial sexism. This does not come from me but 
from a new study released a few days ago by the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business.
<P>
	This study shows that women applying for business loans at 
financial institutions are turned down 20 per cent more often 
than men. It is a disgrace. And if they are approved, 95 per cent 
of the time, they have to pay higher interest rates on their loans. 
Do you find that fair? We certainly do not. All this, I remind you, 
in spite of the fact that women are very responsible and 
successful in business.
<P>
	No wonder that, according to Pierre Cléroux, Vice-President 
of CFIB, these figures prove beyond any doubt that financial 
institutions are discriminating against women entrepreneurs.
<P>
	Hats off to the Minister of Finance for stating in his budget 
speech, and I quote: ``This government is determined that small 
businesses will have access to the financing they need to 
continue being our number one creator of jobs''.
<P>
	On behalf of all women entrepreneurs, I might say the sooner 
the better.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me turn to the principle of good government. There is no 
doubt in my mind that we have to redesign the role of 
government in the economy to fit the size of our pocketbook and 
the priorities of our people.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Last year, soon after being elected, our government undertook 
an extensive review of all programs and agencies it is 
responsible for. As part of this program review, the role of three 
organizations dedicated to women's equality, namely Status of 
Women Canada, HRD's Women's Program and the Canadian 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The review process found that all three promote women's 
equality and in various degrees they all conduct research, 
consultation and undertake communications. All three also 
work closely with women's organizations.
<P>
	The government concluded that the best way to increase both 
effectiveness and efficiency would be to consolidate its actions 
for women's equality at Status of Women Canada. In this regard 
effective April 1, 1995 the women's program of human resource 
development will be transferred to Status of Women Canada. 
The presence and the role of their local, regional and national 
staff, those offices and their services, will be maintained.
<P>
	As well, effective April 1, 1995 the mandate of the Canadian 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women will end. This will 
result in a streamlining of resources and costs, removing 
duplication and eliminating all order in council appointments.
<P>
	The CACSW's research, consultation and public information 
functions will be consolidated within the overall operations of 
Status of Women Canada.
<P>
	The CACSW will be given the time and support it needs to 
wind up its operations. Once we move the functions to Status of 
Women Canada we hope we will be able to absorb some of the 
advisory council's staff to fulfil these functions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian government is firmly committed to women's 
equality. As a matter of fact, this commitment has motivated all 
our decisions. This consolidation will enable this government to 
further the cause of women's equality in partnership with 
women's groups, the provinces and territories, the private sector 
and volunteer organizations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women 
played a major role in the formative years of Canada's modern 
women's movement. At its inception in 1973 following the Bird 
report, the report of the royal commission, it filled an important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10481"> 10481 </A></B>
<P>
void. The modern Canadian women's movement was in its 
infancy. Women  lacked a strong voice in the public arena. They 
also lacked vehicles through which they could advance equality.
<P>
	Since then Canadian women have made progress in 
government, in education, in business and in the academic 
world. More important, women have formed hundreds of small, 
medium and large organizations throughout the country to 
ensure that their needs and concerns are heard and met.
<P>
	These local, regional and national organizations work in 
many fields like violence against women, child care, the 
treatment of women in the health, justice and immigration 
systems, and the needs of women entrepreneurs among others.
<P>
	As our society evolved the need for some of the functions of 
the council changed. Over the years its role as an interpreter of 
the voices of women has been overtaken by many strong, 
established national, regional and local women's organization.
<P>
	We owe a great deal to the pioneers who worked within the 
advisory council. I salute the years of hard work and dedication 
of the committed women and men who have served the 
advancement of women through the advisory council.
<P>
	I wish good luck to its outgoing president. She has been very 
helpful in my thinking the whole approach through and looking 
at new avenues for creativity and new dimensions of the work 
we are about to undertake.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	The vitality and the strength of today's women's 
organizations and the dedication of their members will ensure 
that the important work done by the advisory council will 
continue. Its independent research capacity and its ability to 
consult and communicate information to women and the general 
public and its documentation centre as well are important 
supports to public policy making.
<P>
	Therefore, these functions and the associated financial 
resources will be maintained. Its initiatives will enhance our 
ability to understand and respond to women's equality issues 
that take shape at the grassroots level and create a new synergy 
between research, policy development and the government's 
programs.
<P>
	The consolidation of these three organizations will, I outline 
and summarize, create a single window operation; eliminate 
confusion and improve access to government; provide the 
government with a critical mass of expertise on women's issues; 
improve research, communications and public information 
services; strengthen links with local, regional and national 
organizations, NGOs and universities; ensure that funding for 
research that is independent of government continues to be 
available; and allow the government to focus its efforts toward 
promoting equality for Canadian women.
<P>
	Since the day the Prime Minister appointed me as Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women, I have been meeting with 
women's organizations across this land. I have been having 
round table discussions with them and with many of the groups 
here in Ottawa. I have listened to their concerns with a great deal 
of interest.
<P>
	In the new structure we will work to reinforce our 
collaborative partnerships and our abilities to network on a 
broad spectrum of issues by ensuring the involvement of these 
many women's organizations with their differing perspectives 
and the voluntary sectors and the universities works well.
<P>
	I also want to explore how we can use the new 
communications technology in this new era of information. I 
would like to see us build an ongoing dialogue with our 
constituency using Internet and E-mail or both, or library net. 
These are all fabulous ways to keep in touch and keep informed 
and we want to do just exactly that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to make sure that women become full-fledged 
partners in our society. As the Prime Minister rightly said 
recently: ``In Canada, women continue to further the cause of 
economic equality. Relying on their own means and abilities, 
women help shape the future of this country. As for the Canadian 
government, it is meeting the challenge. Women's equality is 
not a matter of special interests or rights, but rather a matter of 
social and economic justice, a matter of good government''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will work together and work toward equality in 
partnership with women, men, and the public and private sectors 
to overcome the obstacles that are still blocking our way. It is by 
involving the talents and dedication of every Canadian, all of us, 
that we continue to enhance our prosperity and make this 
country still a better place in which to live. When we involve all 
of its people we are in the best position possible to make things 
work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for her 
convincing speech on the continuous struggle of women towards 
equality. I have two daughters and I do hope that they will live in 
a society where equality will be even more of a reality.
<P>
	My question concerns some measures which seem in 
contradiction with the objectives and arguments stated by the 
hon. member.
<P>
	First, one of the recommendations made by the Liberal 
majority on the human resources development committee 
provides that future UI beneficiaries, that is those who never 
received UI benefits before-this means a majority of young 
people and women-will have to work a greater number of 
weeks than other beneficiaries to be eligible for UI benefits and 
these benefits will be less than those that will be paid to people 
who have  already been in the system for years. This seems to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10482"> 10482 </A></B>
<P>
in contradiction with the principle governing the UI system and 
with your concept of equality.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Second, the same committee recommended that, in the future, 
students will have to run up higher debts, something which will 
affect women even more than men since, in the course of their 
careers, there are times when they are not gainfully employed, 
for example when they decide to stay at home to raise their 
children. Consequently, these women will be burdened with 
larger debts and for a longer period of time. That also seems to 
be a contradictory measure.
<P>
	Finally, there is the plight of women who do not receive any 
welfare or UI cheques and who are not eligible for programs 
such as the assistance program for independent workers, which 
helps people start businesses.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not agree that the government could 
have made an extra effort regarding these three areas, or should 
at least, through the social program reform, ensure that women 
in Canada and Quebec are not adversely affected by 
recommendations which are neither appropriate nor adequate in 
terms of helping them get where they should get in the future?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his questions. As a father of two daughters, his interest is clear 
to me. We are certainly on the same wave length in that both our 
sons and daughters should enjoy equal opportunities and wage 
parity. I certainly agree, and I commend him on his position.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member that he should not be too 
worried about unemployment insurance. So far, no decision has 
been made. It is still hypothetical. The report drafted by the 
people who worked so hard to listen to what the public had to say 
has been tabled, and the final decisions will be made at the 
appropriate time.
<P>
	As for female students, if I am not mistaken, in the last two 
budgets the situation improved, and it is easier for women to get 
bursaries when they want to do a doctorate. There are certain 
situations, and I do not remember the exact circumstances, but I 
will certainly make enquiries and send you the rest of the 
details, but I know that women have been privileged in this 
respect, and if we want equality, I hope that the time will come 
when we no longer have to take this kind of action to ensure that 
women have the opportunities to which they are entitled.
<P>
	On the subject of small business, I dare say that for the first 
time we have, if not threatened, or at least strongly suggested or 
advised, the banks that if they did not give small businesses the 
kind of protection they need and did not give them loans on 
request, we would apply sanctions that would be a little more 
severe than was previously the case. And when we see that 40 
per cent of all businesses started by women have a better success 
rate than those started by men, I think it is because women tend 
to take a more thorough approach. They do not take  as many 
risks, that is true, but in the end they have a better success rate.
<P>
	A study has found that 50.1 per cent of businesses that have 
been in existence for 25 years are run by women, and these are 
incredibly successful businesses with sales that are absolutely 
amazing. I hope that this more or less answers your questions, 
but I can assure you that we have not yet won on all fronts. We 
must take action through partnerships with people like the hon. 
member, and I am counting on the co-operation of everyone, 
especially here in this House.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened to the hon. minister's presentation. I 
appreciate a lot of things she had to say, particularly in the 
opening part of her statement where she said that women have a 
very good understanding of fiscal restraint and what it takes to 
run a business or a household.
<P>
	My wife is a person who does understand. It is a shame my 
wife is not here to hear the comments of the hon. member for 
Halifax. I am sure she would take issue with that. Perhaps she is 
watching this on television. My wife does understand as the 
minister rightly said the need for fiscal restraint. My wife also is 
100 per cent supportive of my opting out of the gold plated MPs 
pension plan. Why? Because like millions of other Canadian 
women who understand the need for belt tightening in these 
times of financial crisis in order to get our country's finances on 
the road she believes that leadership should start right at the top, 
here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	If the women Liberal government members do support 
leadership by example, then why do they still cling so fervently 
to this still gilded MPs pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker. Women know how to 
handle money. They know how to turn a nickel into a dollar. 
They have been very cautious and careful. They have had to be, 
because men have not always been very sharing or very open 
with their wives or their children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10483"> 10483 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to the pension, my husband thinks the pension is 
just right, just fair and he has no objection. Quite frankly we all 
work very hard. I am sorry if the hon. member thinks it is not 
worth being paid or recognized for working many hours a day. 
We do not agree with him. I think our pension system with the 
changes we have brought in is more than fair, more than 
equitable. My husband is not upset and neither am I.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to ask the minister about her 
commitment to child care. The budget eliminated a subsidy that 
allowed for a great deal of transportation funds to be available to 
farmers in western Canada. In the past, rural women have found 
themselves having to find child care when child care was not 
available. With the elimination of the Crow benefit the pressures 
on the financial aspects of farming will be increased. Rural 
women who have in the past called for child care I am sure will 
be asking the minister for her support in the future to see a 
federal commitment to child care in rural areas.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us if she continues to be committed to 
child care, especially in rural Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to assure my hon. 
colleague that I have not changed my mind or my view of 
society. I have met with the Rural Women's Childcare Coalition. 
I have met with the farm women of Canada. I am very much in 
support of measures that will give them the kind of child care 
they want. A universal system is not always what they want.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has been 
working with the provinces. There are propositions out there. I 
can assure the hon. member that our commitment to the increase 
in child support and child care is a well founded commitment. It 
will be met within the term of our red book time. I can also 
assure him we will not change our minds on gun control either.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate in the House, 
although today's topic does leave a lot to be desired.
<P>
	Canadians have a debt of over $550 billion. We have 
continuously overspent our budget, creating annual deficits 
which we add to our debt. In turn, this increases the amount of 
interest we must pay, already over $40 billion.
<P>
	On February 27 the finance minister told us that he, his 
department and the government had balancing the budget in 
mind. He said it was a priority of this administration, but the 
finance minister does not tell us when it will achieve the actual 
balancing of the budget. Instead, each year we have been told of 
one more step in the budget balancing stroll that he and this 
government are leading us on, and that strolling in this manner 
for three years will achieve 3 per cent of GDP, assuming present 
conditions affecting this forecast remain constant and that those 
conditions or situations anticipated actually come to pass.
<P>
	A plan that takes three years to reduce an annual deficit of 
more than $35 billion by $10 billion does seem like a stroll down 
some indeterminate path. It is not suggestive of a plan that 
would be considered a high priority by the people who 
implement it when there is no end in sight.
<P>
	The longer we maintain the need to borrow large sums of 
money from foreign lenders the longer we will continue to add 
to our debt, increasing the amount of interest we will pay. The 
interest money we pay to foreign lenders could be utilized very 
effectively for services or benefits for Canadians at home.
<P>
	It reminds me of the situation with credit cards. When a 
person uses a lot of credit cards to buy certain things and then sit 
them all in front of them and add up the amount of interest they 
are paying, it is taking a huge chunk of their salary. The person 
wonders why they thought buying on credit was a good idea.
<P>
	By the time the government reaches its target of 3 per cent of 
GDP in 1996-97 it is estimated the interest payments on our 
debt will have reached $50 billion. To say it is rather easy for us 
these days, but it is really hard to identify with the reality of a 
billion dollars.
<P>
	I have heard some examples, such as circling the globe at the 
equator with $2 bills, but it is hard to visualize how big the 
equator is as well. One example very easy for me to identify with 
is that if a person made a dollar every second they would be a 
millionaire in 11 days. To get a billion dollars it would take them 
33 years. That puts it into reality for me.
<P>
	Canadians have expressed concerns about most of the 
services provided under the social program umbrella, for 
example, health care, pensions, unemployment insurance, et 
cetera. We know these programs will be cut in the near future. 
However, we will not know until the autumn or maybe even later 
how these cuts will affect our lifestyles.
<P>
	We also know that federal funding for health, post-secondary 
education and welfare will be lumped together and cut by $2.5 
billion in 1996-97, and a further $4.5 billion in 1997-98. These 
cuts will have an effect on us, but it will depend on how the 
provinces allocate the moneys they receive to implement and 
maintain the services. Again, we do not know at this time the 
effect the budget will have on our lifestyles.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10484"> 10484 </A></B>
<P>
	Even though it is a step toward decentralizing or transferring 
the management of these programs to the provinces and 
territories, it is unfavourably implemented when the cash 
cutbacks are not coupled with compensation in the tax credit 
area by increasing it.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	With this budget plan, it is inevitable that health services will 
be cut, if not directly this year certainly next or the year 
following that.
<P>
	This year health services will probably feel some effect from 
the cuts as applied to the medical research council, a 10 per cent 
cut, and the patent medicine prices review board, 15 per cent cut 
and another 15 per cent cut to the hazardous material 
information review commission.
<P>
	Some aspects of the mandates of these departments or 
services certainly contribute toward the quality of our overall 
health program. Reduction in the services from some of these 
sources is bound to influence health care services.
<P>
	I have identified some areas where cuts are to be 
implemented. These plus other cuts in the budget are apparently 
insufficient to prevent the need to continue borrowing possibly 
large sums of money in order to operate within the budget.
<P>
	A possible contributing factor is that this government's 
budget does not apply cuts equitably and fairly across the board, 
but singles out some services to cut while allowing others to 
actually increase. Even though the growth rate is restricted there 
is still an increase taking place. An example of this is the Indian 
health care service program in which the growth rate will be 
restricted to 6 per cent for 1995-96 and 3 per cent for 1996-97 
and again 3 per cent in 1997-98.
<P>
	We need to balance our budget as soon as possible. We need to 
relearn how to live within our means and not continuously 
borrow horrendous amounts of dollars. Once we have achieved a 
balanced budget we can implement a plan systematically and 
consistently to apply funds to our debt and reduce it.
<P>
	The Canadian people are aware that we have a deficit problem 
as well as a debt problem. They are aware we must resolve our 
deficit problem before we can adequately address our debt 
problem.
<P>
	Canadians are looking for leadership, for a plan that will not 
only provide guidance and direction necessary for all Canadians 
to participate in resolving our deficit problem as soon as 
possible, but would also identify what it would mean to our 
lifestyle during the whole process of achieving this.
<P>
	Two plans have been presented. The government's budget 
plan reduces our deficit problem by less than half over a three 
year period, of which one year has already passed, and involves 
cuts in services to some Canadians and not others.
<P>
	The Reform Party taxpayer's budget calls upon all Canadians 
to accept a decrease in services across the board and to 
participate in a nationwide plan to eliminate the deficit in a three 
year period.
<P>
	The Reform Party's taxpayer budget not only achieves the 
position of living within our means in three years, it also 
achieves implementing the decentralizing of some services such 
as health care to their rightful administrative positions, the 
provinces. It also removes the cash payment whip, increasing 
the tax credits in such a manner to allow the provinces to acquire 
the income necessary to meet the standards of the Canadian 
health care program as dictated by the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	There is no need to stroll through the years toward the 
balanced budget target-we do not know when that is-and 
borrow horrendous sums of money along the way, as we are 
being directed by the Liberal government. We do have an 
alternative plan, an action plan complete in three years, not 
some indeterminate time period.
<P>
	We have this in the form of the Reform Party's taxpayer 
budget. We have Reform members in Parliament who, given the 
opportunity, are willing and committed to provide the 
leadership necessary to lead the people of Canada to a balanced 
budget in three years and to eliminate the need to borrow 
horrendous amounts of money from foreigners in order to live 
the lifestyles we wish to enjoy.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, with the taxpayer budget, as the Reform Party 
presented it, how would the member provide assistance to those 
old age people who are receiving OAS at the present time with 
the tremendous cuts they were prescribing for their budget?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Madam Speaker, to precede addressing 
specific issues, the Reform's taxpayer budget illustrates all the 
cuts that would occur over three years. We also look at pensions. 
The government has not actually identified and will not until 
autumn what exactly is going to happen there.
<P>
	We are not suggesting that service will not be there. We are 
looking at a 15 per cent cut in OAS as an across the board of cut.
<P>
	The other thing we are looking at is the RPSP concept. We 
have to look into this and work it out in the business community 
and see how this is going to work. However, that concept is quite 
reasonable and feasible to maybe replace our existing system 
and come up with something that is better in the long run, has a 
little more control from the individual's point of view as to how 
they wish to live their lives and also provide them with a sense of 
responsibility and a sense of security.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I paid 
careful attention to the speech by the hon. member. I have one 
small question. I heard her say she wanted to make the cuts in the 
federal budget over three years. I would like her to tell me how 
they see unemployment insurance in three years' time, what will 
become of unemployment insurance?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his questions.
<P>
	When the idea for unemployment insurance was originally 
conceived it was seen as an insurance program for people 
temporarily out of work. That concept was very valid at the 
time. However, over the years there seems to have been a turn 
around in attitudes.
<P>
	Let us get back to the original concept and make it the 
insurance program it was originally intended to be, directed at 
the people who need it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I compliment my colleague on her 
presentation. The Liberal member opposite asked about the 
Reform Party's cutting OAS payments to seniors.
<P>
	The Liberal members have not read the taxpayers' budget. If 
they had listened to the responses to the question they have 
asked over and over again in this House about how we are going 
to treat OAS, they would have heard us clearly say time and time 
again that seniors who have household incomes over $50,000 a 
year would be the only ones affected by the Reform Party 
budget. It would not be the seniors on lower income, as this 
Liberal member well knows.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Madam Speaker, I may have been a little 
weak in my comment to the hon. member. I thank my colleague 
for clarifying that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak 
today on this budget. I certainly spoke on it a number of times in 
my riding. The many hundreds of constituents who turned out to 
the town hall meetings concerning this budget certainly support 
the Reform position that this budget is as weak kneed as a 
Liberal Party can possibly get.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The budget will ensure that before the next election the 
Liberal government will add another $100 billion to our national 
debt. The budget by the Liberal government will ensure our 
interest payments on the national debt will rise to $50 
billion-plus. All of this will occur before the next election. The 
Liberal budget attempts to put a happy face on a deficit target of 
$25 billion in 1997.
<P>
	In examining all of these factors it is difficult to see how any 
fiscally conscious Canadian could consider this a tough budget 
as the Liberal Party purports it be or a budget that will, as the 
Minister of Finance has said, break the back of the deficit. We 
have heard this break the back of the deficit statement from 
finance ministers for over two decades. Yet somehow the 
government remains committed to a position of spending more 
money than it takes in in a year.
<P>
	Finance ministers have consistently projected deficits which 
in reality turned out to be far higher than their forecasts. I would 
never go so far as to accuse the government and the finance 
minister of creative bookkeeping or even fudging the numbers. 
My confidence in the veracity of the numbers in this 1995 
budget is about the same as my confidence in the Liberals 
reforming social programs before there is a referendum in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Speaking of numbers, this necessarily brings me to this notion 
of targets that the finance minister has been so free with. We 
have listened day in and day out to the Minister of Finance 
emphatically declare: ``We have hit our targets and we will 
continue to hit our targets in the future''.
<P>
	I guess when your target is the ocean and you are standing on 
the end of a pier and jump in, it is easy to say that you hit your 
target. What is meant by that is the target is so broad and so easy 
to hit. You cannot miss when you put your target so low.
<P>
	Simply put, the target is low. This 3 per cent deficit to GDP 
the Liberal government has been so proud of is insufficient. It 
was labelled so by the IMF, the OECD and the entire Canadian 
business community. The Liberals know this. The Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce was arguing for a zero deficit budget by 
1997-98 but the Liberals did not have the political guts to 
commit to a target like that.
<P>
	Therefore it was up to Reformers to address the real concerns 
of the Canadian people. That is exactly what we did in our 
taxpayers budget. That budget was conceived out of input from 
the Canadian people that was listened to. It was a budget 
committed to eliminating the deficit in three years and thereby a 
budget committed to protecting the viability and the core of our 
social programs.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance, despite stating before the finance 
committee that a balanced budget is the ultimate goal, has 
refused to lay out any plan that details when Canadians can 
expect a balanced budget. There are no plans and yet he said it. 
Could it be that like his predecessors, the minister is really not 
sure of what the actual deficits will be in the future?
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	We have heard of targets before and we have continually seen 
them missed before. So let us hear no more pontification from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10486"> 10486 </A></B>
<P>
the government benches about hitting targets. A deficit target of 
$25 billion and a debt  target of $650 billion are certainly 
nothing to be proud of.
<P>
	To demonstrate the effectiveness of prebudget consultations 
held by the Liberal Party, we saw witness after witness in 
committee. Individuals, associations, business groups and the 
like appeared before the committee and testified repeatedly day 
after day, hour after hour against any further tax increases by 
this government.
<P>
	After all this consultation process, which the Minister of 
Finance still is very proud of, which the Liberals also find time 
to pontificate about, what do we discover in this budget? New 
taxation measures.
<P>
	Despite the absence of pro-taxation testimony in the 
hearings, the Liberal majority on the committee concocted a 
dozen more possible tax options. They were obviously very 
good at reading between the lines and listening to what these 
anti-tax people really meant. They said: ``We do not want any 
new taxes,'' but what they really meant was: ``Yes, please hit us 
with another tax''. So much for consultation. So much for 
listening to the views of Canadians.
<P>
	It is shameful that the Minister of Finance, knowing full well 
that much more substantive cuts must come in the future, 
allowed this key budget-and it was a key budget. There was a 
window of opportunity to really break the back of the deficit, but 
the Liberal government and the finance minister missed that 
window of opportunity by a mile. They allowed this key budget 
to be watered down by the soft pedalling socialists in the Liberal 
Party.
<P>
	In all, this budget will snatch $3.7 billion out of the economy 
through taxation in the next three years despite the fact that an 
OECD job study, a C.D. Howe report and a survey by the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce demonstrated clearly that high 
taxes destroy job creation. The Liberals raised taxes despite the 
fact that the Prime Minister in June 1991 when in opposition 
stated, and this is interesting, that taxes on individuals were 
higher in Canada than in any G-7 country. Although he said that 
in 1991, the Liberal government raised taxes.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister when in opposition in 1991 
demonstrated a rare concern for the Canadian taxpayer and 
revealed a suspect sensitive side when it came to their plight. 
She stated that Canadians are paying too much tax. Despite that, 
the Liberal government raised taxes in this budget.
<P>
	That $3.7 billion should have been left alone to create growth 
in the economy, to create jobs, not rip it out of the economy in 
taxation. Now the government will say that these new taxes were 
fair taxation measures. What is fair about a 1.5 cent per litre tax 
increase on gasoline? This is simply a $500 million tax grab to 
offset the revenue the government lost when it lowered the 
cigarette taxes. If the government had the guts to enforce the law 
when all that cigarette smuggling was going on, it  would not 
have to rip another $500 million out of the economy in a 
gasoline tax.
<P>
	I want to wind up by quoting a Liberal. This is really 
something and members will recognize this: ``Once a nation 
parts with the control over its currency and credit, it matters not 
who makes the nation's laws. Usury, once in control will wreck 
any nation. Until the control over currency and credit is restored 
to Parliament and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred 
responsibility, all talk of democracy or freedom is idle and 
futile''.
<P>
	The Liberal government has ensured the control over our 
currency and credit is in the hands of our lenders, not in the 
hands of Parliament and the government where it should be.

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the speech by the hon. member, which 
contained figures, figures and more figures.
<P>
	A year ago, when the members of the Reform Party arrived in 
the House of Commons, I remember their comments in an initial 
newspaper article in which they talked about a club sandwich 
costing less in the parliamentary cafeteria. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois were talking about tax reform. They then went on to 
talk about the shoeshine people; we were talking about tax 
shelters. We were therefore not quite on the same wavelength for 
savings to really be made.
<P>
	The government talks about reducing the deficit to 3 per cent 
of the GDP. Could the hon. member tell us what percentage of 
the GDP he would like the deficit to be at, himself, so the debt 
could be paid back as quickly as possible, but without ever 
losing sight of the most disadvantaged, the unemployed and 
seniors?
<P>
	I am not prepared, politically, to say that we are going to go 
after the most vulnerable in our society, who are unable to 
defend themselves, and that we will leave the rich alone. As I 
have said in the past and will continue to say, the good Lord and 
good common sense must go hand in hand. Therefore there has 
to be a balance between the rich and the poor classes. I do not 
want the poor to get poorer. I want a balance to exist.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to give me an idea of the rate he 
would bring his percentage to without affecting the most 
disadvantaged.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Madam Speaker, for the umpteenth hundredth 
time in the House, it is amazing that so many members have not 
been listening to what we are saying. We have said over and over 
it is not fiscally conscious members of Parliament who are the 
big threat to our social problems in this country. It is not fiscally 
responsible MPs who are the threat to the unemployed, the 
seniors and the needy, as the hon. member said. The  biggest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10487"> 10487 </A></B>
<P>
threat is our $500 billion debt and our some $50 billion interest 
payment on that debt.
<P>
	Imagine if we did not have this huge half a billion dollar debt 
created by the Liberals and the Tories before them. Imagine if 
we did not have this $45 billion or $47 billion interest payment 
what that interest payment could represent in the way of 
providing services and programs for people and Canadians who 
are in need.
<P>
	That is the threat to the social programs in this country, not 
fiscally conscious MPs like the Reform Party. That has to be 
understood.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have also listened to the Canadian people 
throughout much of my term as a member of Parliament. The 
last six years have been very tumultuous times, coming through 
the Mulroney era of putting a lot of pain on the backs of 
Canadians, and now sitting through this Parliament and the 
development of this budget, with taxpayers from coast to coast 
saying they have been taxed enough.
<P>
	The finance minister claims this budget did not raise income 
tax for ordinary Canadians. That is not quite correct. A large 
number of Canadians were receiving and will receive to the end 
of this year the northern tax allowance. This tax allowance 
provides those who live further away from government services 
a benefit which other taxpayers do not enjoy.
<P>
	The hon. member shares a part of the country with me, that is, 
people who currently receive northern tax allowances. Does he 
not believe it is unfair for those taxpayers in the phase out of the 
program this year to have to pay additional taxes?
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Madam Speaker, in answer to my hon. friend 
from The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, this is a time when the 
country is in a financial crisis. It is a time that can be compared 
to a financial crisis in the family home. The time comes when 
the family does not have enough money to live the lifestyle 
which it had grown to like. It is the time to separate the wants 
from the needs.
<P>
	There are so many different areas in which we spend money 
which clearly could be described as needs. There is also a 
tremendous amount of ways in which we spend money that 
clearly could be described as wants. If we are ever going to get 
our financial house in order we have to make a clear distinction 
between our needs and our wants.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway-Human rights; the hon. 
member for St. Albert-The Treasury Board; the hon. member 
for Wetaskiwin-Labour.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak 
in the budget debate, but it is with no joy I say what I feel I have 
to say. I doubt, with the short time available to me, that I will be 
able to properly develop the case I would like to make. I doubt 
whether I will have the time to put on the record the many points 
which I think are essential.
<P>
	There are some positive measures in the budget which I fully 
support. I have in mind the measures for tax fairness, those 
measures which deal with tax deferrals, with family trusts and 
with RRSPs. I also fully support the measures to put additional 
tax on large corporations and the new special tax for banks and 
bank-like institutions.
<P>
	I regret that with respect to the balance of the budget I feel 
there is much that is wrong. Specifically I am opposed to those 
measures which attack our social programs. In the budget it is 
proposed that we cut transfers to the provinces for 
post-secondary education, health care and the Canada 
assistance plan by $7 billion over the next two years. It is also 
proposed that we cut from unemployment insurance a minimum 
of 10 per cent, a program which has already been cut by the last 
budget and cut savagely many times under the previous 
Conservative government.
<P>
	For those Canadians who are not aware of what is covered by 
the Canada assistance plan let me refer to a few items. By 
agreement with the provinces it covers payments for food, 
shelter, clothing, fuel and utilities for disabled people and 
people who are not able to work. It covers rehabilitation for 
needy persons. It covers day care centres. It covers hostels for 
battered women. It covers nursing homes for old people. It 
covers the cost of children in foster homes. It covers 
homemaking and home support services. It covers adoption 
services. That is only a partial list.
<P>
	These cuts are not only wrong in principle, they are contrary 
to the campaign promises which we Liberals made in the red 
book and throughout the last election campaign. They are, first 
of all, wrong in principle because social programs are not the 
cause of the deficit. In answer to a question in the House only a 
few weeks ago the Minister of Finance admitted that the cost of 
social programs as a percentage of gross domestic product was 
exactly the same today as it was 20 years ago in the 
mid-seventies. He admitted that they were not the cause of the 
deficit. If they are not the cause of the deficit why attack them 
and why propose such extreme cuts to them in the budget?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10488"> 10488 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	These cuts are wrong in principle because they will cause 
considerable harm and pain to a segment of the population that 
has already been hit very hard before. I have in mind the 
unemployed, single mothers, older workers, the disabled, the 
mentally ill and others. These provisions will widen the gap 
between the rich and poor, will cause further social unrest and 
will hurt the economy by causing unemployment and reducing 
purchasing power.
<P>
	The cuts are not only wrong in principle but contrary to what 
we said in the red book, contrary to what we said during nine 
years in opposition and contrary to what we did during twenty 
years in government under Mike Pearson and Pierre Elliot 
Trudeau.
<P>
	I have the red book here. I do not have much time so I will just 
read one or two quotes. I could read many. I refer to page 74 of 
the red book. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since 1984, the Tories have systematically weakened the social support 
network that took generations to build. Not only have they taken billions of 
dollars from health care and from programs that support children, seniors, and 
people who have lost their jobs, but they have set us on the path to becoming a 
polarized society, divided into rich and poor, educated and uneducated, with a 
shrinking middle class. This is not the kind of country most Canadians want to 
live in. In a polarized society, crime, violence, intolerance and group hatred 
flourish.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is just one quote from the red book but there are many 
others that are similar.
<P>
	I also have here the complete list of the opposition motions 
that we tabled during the nine years we were in opposition. 
Motion after motion proposes solutions which are contrary to 
what is being put forward in the budget.
<P>
	Again, I do not have time to read them all but I refer to one put 
forward by the member for Hamilton East on an opposition day:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House regrets that almost one million Canadian children are living 
in poverty, that 1.4 million Canadians each year must rely on food banks and 
that the current recession the proposed goods and services tax will make this 
situation worse; and that the House, desiring the elimination of poverty in 
Canada by the year 2000, demands immediate programs to ameliorate the plight 
of the working poor, including a review of the minimum wage, discriminatory 
employment practices, current available children's benefits and other income 
support programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also have the amendments that we tabled to the Tory budgets 
during the nine years in opposition and they state similar sorts of 
things.
<P>
	Some people say that times were better then and we could do 
things when we were in government that we cannot do today. 
That is not completely true. The government was in better 
economic shape then but the country, as the Minister of Finance 
said the other day, is better off today. The gross national product 
is higher today than it was 30 years ago. Canada is producing 
more goods and services. Unfortunately they are not being 
distributed as fairly as they should.
<P>
	Some members have said, in trying to justify the budget, that 
being a Liberal means being flexible. One should be flexible but 
one should be flexible within a framework of principles. To be 
flexible does not mean that one completely junks all the 
principles that one has stood for and it certainly does not mean 
that one throws out the promises that one made in an election 
only a year and a half ago.
<P>
	Yes, the red book and the election were only one and a half 
years ago. As far as I know there has been no significant change 
in Canada or in the world since that time. If the red book policy 
had to be changed due to changed circumstances then the case 
has not been made by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	Those are my specific concerns about the budget but I am also 
troubled by the longer term implications of the budget. There 
are several measures that continue to strip away in my view the 
federal government, to strip away the federal authority, to strip 
away the federal presence in this land, the presence and 
visibility of Canada as a nation.
<P>
	I have in mind cuts to transportation, to communications, to 
the CBC and to social programs. These have always been the 
national glue, the national infrastructure which has bound this 
country together for many years. My concern is that the federal 
authority will be left as a hollow shell once these cuts are made.
<P>
	I support the deficit reduction goal of 3 per cent of gross 
domestic product that we put forward in the red book. I support 
deficit reduction but I support it in the way that we proposed to 
do so in the red book: by cutting waste, by cutting unproductive 
expenditure, by encouraging and promoting economic growth, 
more jobs, more profits for business to bring about more 
revenue for the government and by filling in and closing down 
the unfair tax provisions in the Income Tax Act, not by cutting 
social programs. I support the goal of deficit reduction but not in 
the way in which we are doing it in the budget.
<P>
	Yes, the fiscal deficit is important and I agree that it must be 
addressed. But it must not be addressed at the expense of a social 
deficit where we have more crime, more social unrest, more 
family violence, suicide, alcohol and drug abuse.
<P>
	I saw a very good button the other day on a person. The button 
said: ``If you think education is expensive, try ignorance''.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would certainly like to thank the hon. member 
for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce for his speech, but at the same time 
remind him that we have one thing in common: we both 
represent ridings in the Montreal region. And someone who 
represents a Montreal riding is automatically sensitive, like the 
hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, to the issue of poverty 
and to the hardship that the past two recessions, the last one 
being the 1982 recession, imposed on a good many of our 
constituents.
<P>
	I find the hon. member very courageous, because he belongs 
to the government majority and it is to his honour that he is able 
to rise above the prevailing opinion. However, I told myself that 
he is asking us to remain keepers of the social conscience. He is 
asking us to make sure that we have an interventionist 
government and that we maintain one of the government's 
reasons for being, namely redistribution.
<P>
	However, we have diverging views on the causes of the 
deficit. What I found surprising and very pleasing about the hon. 
member's speech, and I say this without any ulterior motive, 
was that he states that his government has no other choice but to 
cut transfer payments. By doing this, his government could 
destabilize provincial governments and force them to cut 
services which are basic necessities and financed through the 
Canada assistance plan.
<P>
	I would like to hear the hon. member's opinion on the causes 
of the deficit. As far as we on this side of the House are 
concerned, the deficit is caused by the fact that it is impossible 
to maintain a continental country like Canada: Canada is the 
first and last example of a federation with a narrow ecumene 
stretched out between two oceans. We say that one of the causes 
of the deficit-when we analyze how we got into debt-is that 
we have had a strong central government which meddled in 
jurisdictions in which it had no right to. The hon. member will 
recall that he was a member of Parliament when Ottawa created, 
for example, a department for urban affairs and for recreation, 
which, under the constitution, were in no way related to the 
powers granted to the central government.
<P>
	I would like to know if the hon. member will agree with me 
that it would be much simpler for Canada and for its financial 
situation to reorganize the country to give Quebec more power 
and for Quebec to create its own national government and for us 
to begin dialogue on the basis of our status as associated states.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Madam Speaker, The principal causes of the 
deficit are speculation in currencies which cause changes in the 
interest rates and globalization of economies which allows large 
multinational corporations to manipulate and speculate on 
products, derivatives and  currencies. For example, I was told 
yesterday by a prominent member of government that each time 
interest rates go up by 1 per cent it costs us $1.7 billion per year 
in additional payments on our debt. If it goes up by two points it 
is twice that amount. Those are the types of things that cause the 
deficit.
<P>
	In addition, many people are getting away without paying the 
taxes they should be paying. The tax system is not fair. There 
was some movement in the budget to correct it. I applaud that 
and I support that but it did not go far enough.
<P>
	With respect to the other question the member asked 
regarding a new way of arranging Canada, I supported in the 
House and voted for both the Meech Lake accord and the 
Charlottetown accord. Both were eventually defeated. Those 
accords would have rearranged the structures in Canada.
<P>
	I believe in maintaining and even increasing the payments to 
the provinces for social programs, but I also believe that 
national standards should be set by the federal government. The 
federal government can equalize opportunity and care 
throughout the country. That is the humane thing to do.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is pleasure to rise in the House to take the 
opportunity to address the second budget of the government as 
presented by the Minister of Finance on February 27.
<P>
	I expect in the final analysis the budget of February 1995 will 
go down in history. It will be the budget that made a significant 
difference in Canada at a time when Canada was at a crossroads.
<P>
	The budget will be viewed by future historians as a watershed 
budget, a turning point in which the government of the day had 
the courage to make the tough decisions and to make the 
necessary cuts in spending in accordance with responsible 
financial management.
<P>
	While the budget makes drastic and unheard of changes to the 
face of government through spending cuts, it does so with 
fairness and compassion. Programs that are efficient and 
effective in serving Canadians will remain, but programs that 
are obsolete, redundant and dysfunctional will be eliminated. 
The budget prepares us for the inevitable trend of the 21st 
century, which is less involvement by government in the lives of 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10490"> 10490 </A></B>
<P>
	To do this we have implemented a transition process that 
encourages the individual to more self-reliant, more 
entrepreneurial, stronger as a community and less dependent on 
government programs and subsidies.
<P>
	When the constituents of Cumberland-Colchester elected 
me to represent them I knew I would be coming to Ottawa at a 
very crucial time in our history, that I would be part of a 
government with a fiscal policy that would either make or break 
Canada, and that the Liberal Party would be the one to 
ultimately bear the responsibility of piloting the country out of 
deficit financing.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast told the House that reducing the 
deficit and debt must be the number one priority of the 
government. They know how the deficit is like an albatross 
around the neck of each and every one of us and of future 
generations to come.
<P>
	The government accepted the challenge, not only with the 
budget but with several budgets to come in the future, to work 
toward a balanced budget. It is not politically expedient but it is 
the right thing to do.
<P>
	The measures taken in the budget will ensure that Canadians 
can face the economic challenge of international competition 
and that we will be able to do so with growth and confidence. 
The budget is about restoring confidence in government and 
confidence in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Measures that were taken last year in the first budget of the 
government showed positive results in our economy. Economic 
growth is at 4.5 per cent, the strongest of the G-7 nations. The 
most impressive year ever in Canadian exports was 1994. We 
showed a massive trade surplus with the United States. Inflation 
was at its lowest in three decades. There were more improved 
business profits than ever. Some 433,000 full time jobs were 
created last year.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The same implementation that saw the economy grow 
resulted in the annual deficit being reduced by $4.4 billion, 
lower than was budgeted for the fiscal year ending in a couple of 
weeks. That is the reality. That is progress in deficit reduction.
<P>
	If we are to compare ourselves with the G-7 countries on how 
well our economy is doing, it seems only reasonable to compare 
ourselves and our debt situation to those of the G-7 countries.
<P>
	It is sad to say that our net government debt as a nation is over 
84 per cent of GDP second only to Italy of the G-7 counties. In 
comparison the United States has a net public debt of 32 per cent 
of GDP, while Japan's is around 10 per cent. It was therefore 
mandatory that the finance minister demonstrate in the budget 
not only to the nations of the world but to the financial lenders 
that Canada was serious about reducing its deficit and the high 
per cent ratio of debt to GDP.
<P>
	Investors have been satisfied with the budget as have 
Canadians, but I must remind the House that it is only the 
beginning of a series of tough budgets until we have won the war 
on debt.
<P>
	Cuts in government spending mean pain. The budget is about 
pain. However the pain was spread fairly to all regions. In the 
west grain transportation subsidies were eliminated while in the 
east the Atlantic region freight assistance program was 
abolished. However both the west and the east including Quebec 
will receive transitional funding, helping alleviate shipper 
hardship and upgrade transportation infrastructure.
<P>
	Last week when I was in my riding I met with public servants 
whose jobs are being cut because they are classified as surplus 
or because long established forestry agreements were not 
renewed. These people are feeling the pain of the budget. 
However, after looking at options in the transition, one forester 
said to me: ``Even though we are losing our jobs this had to be 
done and I would still vote for your government''.
<P>
	The people of Nova Scotia did not want me to come here to 
whine about the cuts. They wanted me to congratulate the 
finance minister for having the courage to do what he did. The 
people of Nova Scotia have a tradition of self-reliance and a 
grassroots fighting spirit. They have an entrepreneurial spirit 
that goes back to shipbuilding and merchant fleets of the 19th 
century.
<P>
	The people of Nova Scotia know that the backbone of the 
economy is small business and that jobs will come not from 
government but from the private sector. The economy of 
Atlantic Canada is the fastest growing in the country. Atlantic 
Canada ended 1994 with the highest rate of growth per capita. It 
was 2.7 per cent, the highest of all the regions, followed by the 
prairie region with a rate of growth per capita of 2.5 per cent.
<P>
	Dairy farmers in my riding are like dairy farmers across the 
country. They will see their subsidies cut by 30 per cent over two 
years. Public utilities will see the energy subsidy eliminated 
through the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. Alberta 
and Nova Scotia are affected by the change. The Nova Scotia 
Power Corporation has already indicated that higher rates are to 
be expected, which in turn hinders small business development. 
There is pain with the budget, but as the old saying goes no pain, 
no gain. The people of Canada have accepted the pain knowing 
there will be real gain in the months ahead.
<P>
	The women of Canada have a greater appreciation for the 
budget than anyone. Many women have spent their lives living 
within the household budget and living within their means. I 
would bet there is not a woman in the country who has not at one 
time or another in her life watered down the stew and thrown in 
another handful of barley simply to stretch the pot of stew for 
another meal. The money she would save would go to buy a 
dress or a pair of shoes for a child who has a very special 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10491"> 10491 </A></B>
<P>
concert. I have done it many times. Thousands of women across 
the  country managing Canadian households are the financial 
experts, and they too have done so.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	Under the previous government the 1980s were a time of 
greed, surplus and waste. The 1990s under the present 
government are a time of basic need, not greed, a time of high 
efficiency and productivity, and a time of sustainability, not 
waste. It is a time to sustain our finances as well as our 
environment, our resources and our fish stocks.
<P>
	We made a commitment to the women and the men of Canada 
to reduce the deficit while restructuring social policy. We take 
that commitment very seriously. The budget of February 1995 is 
more than a bunch of numbers. It is one part of a very large 
social plan, an economic plan as well as a financial plan that 
maps a prudent, courageous and credible path not only for our 
generation but, more important, for the next generation of young 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully and was quite taken with 
the enthusiasm the member opposite showed for the budget. She 
talked about the budget being fair and talked in terms of 
understanding and knowing how the fairness is applied across 
the country. She talked about the policies of the government that 
were obsolete, dysfunctional or redundant being eliminated.
<P>
	Those two matters have to be applied to the communities that 
I represent in Saskatchewan with the loss of the Western Grain 
Transportation Act subsidy, the Crow benefit, which the 
member mentioned in her remarks. The Crow benefit currently 
represents $560 million. Two years ago it was worth $720 
million, $400 million of which applied to Saskatchewan.
<P>
	How is it that the member can indicate that the Western Grain 
Transportation Act is obsolete, dysfunctional and redundant 
when it is anything but?
<P>
	The loss of the Crow benefit to our communities at the 
delivery points in my riding represents approximately $1 
million to each delivery point. The community of Glaslyn just 
north of where I live has two elevators and is quite similar to 
most communities in my constituency. We calculate that in the 
crop year beginning August 1, 1986 farmers at that delivery 
point will pay $1 million more for grain transportation in the 
coming year than they did in this year.
<P>
	In terms of fairness, what other community in the country has 
been asked to give up $1 million in revenue? Absolutely none. 
Communities that service the world with grain from 
Saskatchewan have to pay extra. I ask the member for the 
evidence she has that these programs are obsolete, dysfunctional 
and redundant and that the budget is fair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Madam Speaker, to the hon. member on his 
question as to what community has suffered pain, most of the 
communities across the country are suffering pain because we 
had to take the prudent steps in frugal fiscal management that we 
took. Canadians asked for it. The communities of Nova Scotia, 
the communities of Quebec and rural communities all have the 
same needs. The diversification and the competitiveness by 
which our farmers must meet the 21st century are parts of the 
budget.
<P>
	Farmers in my riding, whether they are dairy farmers, feed 
producers or cattle producers, have told us to get rid of the 
subsidies. They said they could compete and would compete. 
Furthermore the government has allowed funding for 
transitional development through this period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will try to be brief in my comments. We 
have just heard our hon. colleague tell us that she feels this 
budget is very tough on ordinary people but that it is a necessary 
evil. She used the phrase ``no pain, no gain''. That is what 
Canadians expect, according to her.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Yet, if we look at all the other members of her own 
government, we see that the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, for one, feels that social programs are 
not really the main cause of the debt. Not too long ago, the hon. 
member for York South-Weston said that what the Liberals 
were about to do was what they had denounced when the Tories 
were in office. Our hon. colleague has just read some documents 
reminding us of the comments made by the hon. member for 
Hamilton West, who said the exact same thing.
<P>
	I will close with this: Given that the cuts they are about to 
inflict on ordinary people are due to Canada's debt and that, 
despite these cuts, the debt will continue to grow, does my hon. 
colleague not feel that, in the current situation, there will be 
much pain and no gain at all?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Madam Speaker, no pain no gain is the 
watchword of today. Not only this government, but businesses 
have had to cut back. They have had to make the transition to be 
competitive and now the onus is on government. We have 
accepted the challenge. This is a watershed in budget. This is a 
turning point in financing for the government. That is because 
the people of Canada have asked us to deal with this. It is 
mandatory.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10492"> 10492 </A></B>
<P>
	We are moving into the 21st century. We know we will create 
the jobs not through government, not through subsidization, but 
through the private sector. Small business is the backbone.
<P>
	Nova Scotia is not unlike Quebec. We have so much 
similarity. Historically, we can go back to a time when Quebec 
was known as Nouvelle-Écosse. This is so important to us 
because it is the very backbone. In Nova Scotia with a 
population of 900,000 we have some 90,000 small businesses. 
That is one in ten. That is growing in Atlantic Canada, the 
highest in the country. That is because we are taking the prudent 
steps to deal with the deficit. We will go through the pain but 
there will be gain in the end.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Lévis. The 
show put on these past few weeks reflects how completely 
outdated our parliamentary institutions are when it comes to 
public financial management and economic policy.
<P>
	After the session reopened, when questioned by the official 
opposition, the Minister of Finance systematically refused to 
answer any question dealing with public finance, arguing that 
we would have to wait for the budget to be tabled, a budget 
prepared in the strictest secrecy as budgets are. Yet, once tabled, 
the budget speech has nothing short of force of law, since the 
government majority is forced to support it without debating it 
in detail.
<P>
	In our system, the vote on the budget amounts to a confidence 
vote, as a negative vote would immediately result in the 
government stepping down and general elections being called. It 
follows that any member of the government majority who dares 
to vote against this budget would face immediate expulsion 
from the caucus and would have to sit as an independent member 
thereafter.
<P>
	That is why every Liberal minister and member will stand by 
each and every page, line and word of this budget, although 
many of them would call for major changes were they given the 
choice. The budget preparation and adoption process is getting 
us nowhere fast. It has to change. We will come back to this in 
the coming weeks. That being said, because I have very little 
time, I will get right down to the subject of today's debate.
<P>
	We have talked at great length, these past few days, about the 
impact the budget will have on the various population segments 
that will bear the brunt of the proposed cuts and tax hikes. We 
too, in the official opposition, have seen through the media 
campaign designed to make this budget out to be the beginning 
of a new federalism, when in fact the federal government is 
passing the buck to the provinces, while maintaining 
decision-making power in its own hands.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	After spending shamelessly in fields of provincial 
jurisdiction, the federal government still displays the same 
arrogance by announcing that it will keep on levying taxes, that 
it will no longer pay the bills, and that it will force the provinces 
to make the necessary cuts to put the fiscal house in order. 
Although it may look innovative, this budget uses old recipes 
which are typical of the federal government's approach.
<P>
	The financial markets were quick to figure out the 
government's ploy. After an initial positive reaction which 
lasted about 22 minutes, the value of the dollar started going 
down again, while interest rates resumed their upward trend. 
The financial markets realized that the federal government's 
consolidation was minimal and that true leadership will have to 
come from the provinces.
<P>
	The fact that Ontario's credit rating was put under review the 
day after the tabling of the federal budget is a direct 
consequence of that budget. Its impact on Quebec's public 
finances will also be considerable. However, since this is the 
referendum year, the real consequences will only be felt next 
year.
<P>
	The government's ploy was not any more successful from a 
political point of view. That the Leader of the Quebec Liberal 
Party, who was desperately counting on this budget to prove 
federalism's flexibility, prefers not to comment at all at this 
point is quite revealing. Maybe he realized that although the 
federal government has pulled out financially, the same 
duplication persists, generating the same problems and the same 
inefficiencies.
<P>
	This budget has yet to be fleshed out by a thorough 
restructuring of the federal government. As a society, we have 
not improved our ability to respond to people's needs and to 
meet the challenges of economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the Minister of Finance 
was an ardent supporter of reducing the deficit through 
economic growth and job creation. In a matter of months, he has 
become, at best, a poor accountant. What happened? The present 
Minister of Finance is largely responsible for the mess we are in 
today. After an election campaign full of promises that were 
close to being misleading, he was incapable of doing anything at 
all, starting with his first budget.
<P>
	Remember that during the election campaign, the Leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois proposed a credible plan for reducing 
federal spending by $10 billion, while the Liberals promised to 
deal with the deficit through economic growth.
<P>
	Remember that after the election, the Leader of the 
Opposition urged the government to act quickly by setting up a 
special committee of the House of Commons that would 
determine what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10493"> 10493 </A></B>
<P>
cuts were necessary and make them part of the government's 
first budget. The government refused.
<P>
	I may recall that after this government's first budget was 
brought down, the Prime Minister was telling people 
everywhere in Canada that no new cuts would be necessary to 
meet his objectives for reducing the deficit. And now that we 
know what is in the second budget, we cannot really say that the 
Prime Minister was lying but there is no doubt that he misled 
Canadians about the real challenges they could expect.
<P>
	Today we are paying a very high price for this government's 
refusal to act decisively in its first year. The loss of credibility 
on financial markets is reflected today in the astronomical level 
of real interest rates we have to pay. According to the Minister of 
Finance, in 1995 we can expect interest rates to be 4 per cent 
higher for the short term and 3.6 per cent higher for the long 
term than was forecast in the 1994 budget.
<P>
	If we only consider the cost of servicing the federal debt, 
higher interest rates will an additional $7.5 billion, although the 
deficit is not as high as forecasted in 1994. Unfortunately, there 
are other consequences as well. The level of real interest rates 
forecast in this budget cannot be sustained when we consider 
that the Canadian economy is functioning well below its 
capacity.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Allow me to quote a short sentence from page 21 of the 
government's budget plan, but which the Minister of Finance 
took great care not to quote in his budget speech:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The good economic performance in 1994 and 1995 will substantially reduce, 
but not eliminate, the amount of spare capacity in the economy. Spare capacity 
will persist through 1996 as real growth slows-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what the Minister of Finance hides in his fine 
speeches. He who promised to resolve the deficit problem 
through economic growth and job creation, today predicts that 
Canada will still experience an amount of spare capacity in the 
economy in two years' time. This is the real drama of the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	By refusing to act in the first year of its mandate, the 
government has clearly complicated the essential job of 
ensuring sustained economic growth. If we want to get out of the 
rut in which we find ourselves, the provinces must not be 
content with shouldering the cuts imposed on them by the 
federal government, they must insist on a complete 
reorganization of the way the Canadian economy is managed.
<P>
	Keeping policies on economic innovation and adjustment 
centralized flies in the face of the very different needs of 
Canada's regional economies. What is the federal government 
doing in manpower training, in the area of fishing, for example? 
The complete fiasco in this regard should prompt the federal 
government to hand over responsibility to the coastal provinces 
as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Clearly the systematic review of the roles of the federal 
government must no longer be conducted only in secret by 
federal mandarins. In the case of Quebec, I know we will soon 
have a favourable referendum. I hope the other provinces in 
Canada will take the opportunity to develop a framework that 
suits their needs and those of their people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the words of the hon. member who 
just spoke.
<P>
	I recall back in the early 1980s when the debate around the 
Crow rate, at that time the western grain transportation subsidy, 
was conducted in the House. The farm organizations and the 
people of Quebec were very supportive of the western farmers 
and the desire to maintain a strong transportation link for the 
export of prairie grown grain. That support carried over and a 
good number of changes were prevented from being made 
because of the alliance between western farmers and farmers in 
Quebec.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member has given any thought to the 
current debate brought on by the budget over the Western Grain 
Transportation Act. Can western farmers count on the Bloc 
Quebecois and the farmers of Quebec for support in maintaining 
this transportation subsidy?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, the issue is Quebec's 
support for western grain transportation subsidies. We must 
realize that agricultural organizations in Quebec never opposed 
the measure, as you said, and, on the contrary, supported it for 
years.
<P>
	It is far from certain that the federal government has the 
means to continue subsidizing this area to the same extent. To 
me, one thing is clear: when the federal government 
implemented measures concerning energy, western Canada 
reacted very strongly and demanded changes which eventually 
were made. In my opinion, it is very clear that Canadian regions, 
with each totally different economies, now must work things out 
among themselves and stop waiting for the federal government 
to do it.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The longer we waited for the federal government, the more 
and more centralized the decisions became, even though the 
economies of each of the regions have grown increasingly 
differentiated. The economic space in which we sell our 
products is becoming more and more differentiated. Therefore, 
each region needs its own strategy, and that is what the rest of 
Canada urgently needs to understand. Do not expect the federal 
government to do it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10494"> 10494 </A></B>
<P>
	The mandarins in Ottawa, who like to delude themselves that 
they know the truth, will continue to set the game plan and will 
continue to think that they know what is best for Canada. It is 
time for the regions to wake up: they need to create their own 
transportation policies. They should no longer wait for the 
federal Minister of Transportation to do it. In any case, this is 
Quebec's firm belief, and I think that, after analyzing the 
situation, each region will also see the urgent need to take their 
affairs in hand.
<P>
	I think that the vote planned on the sovereignty of Quebec this 
year, which I predict will be for sovereignty, presents a golden 
opportunity to reorganize economic relations. For example, a 
few years ago, Canada's economy exported 20 per cent of its 
output to the United States. Now, we have far surpassed 30 per 
cent and are even nearing 40 per cent. Therefore, a 
reorganization is urgently needed, but the federal government 
will not initiate it. Regions will have to take their affairs into 
their own hands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is as the 
official opposition critic on training and youth that I rise today 
to speak about the impact of the last federal budget on young 
people.
<P>
	Like most of my official opposition colleagues, my initial 
reaction to this budget is that the federal government wants to 
transfer the blame for its cuts to the provinces.
<P>
	On February 27, the Minister of Finance announced that, 
starting in 1996-97, he would reduce by $2.5 billion transfer 
payments to the provinces for health care, social assistance and 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	By combining these three payments into a single consolidated 
block transfer called the Canada Social Transfer starting in 
1996-97, the minister claims that ``provinces will now be able 
to design more innovative social programs-programs that 
respond to the needs of people today rather than to inflexible 
rules. However, flexibility does not mean a free-for-all. There 
are national goals and principles we-meaning the Minister of 
Finance, of course-believe must still apply, and which the vast 
majority of Canadians support''.
<P>
	Such is the finance minister's flexibility. It involves national 
standards that Quebec does not want and never wanted in the 
first place. In this context, I think it would be a good idea to 
remind you of Bill C-28 respecting financial assistance to 
students, which was passed on June 23. This bill provides among 
other things that, from now on, the Canadian Minister of Human 
Resources Development, instead of the provincial governments 
as was the case before, will designate the appropriate authority 
in each province responsible for choosing educational 
institutions eligible for federal financial assistance.
<P>
	Second, the provincial education ministers wanting the right 
to opt out with full financial compensation must convince the 
Minister of Human Resources Development that their provincial 
programs produce the same results as the federal programs in 
each of the areas targeted by the federal legislation.
<P>
	Great freedom, is it not? You can develop programs, as long as 
they are absolutely identical to those decided on by the Minister 
of Human Resources Development, in an area of jurisdiction 
assigned to the provinces in the Constitution Act, 1867, an area 
of exclusive jurisdiction, not shared jurisdiction. Over the 
years, the federal government has encroached upon this 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction, pleading the right to spend the 
money of Canadians and of Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Coming back to the cuts in transfer payments, it should be 
noted that the $2.5 billion figure quoted for all three categories 
combined in the Canadian social transfer is within $100 million 
of the cuts announced in the green paper with respect to 
post-secondary education. This leads to the conclusion that, 
give or take $100 million, the primary target of government cuts 
is post-secondary education.
<P>
	By giving the provinces the choice while maintaining national 
standards, as it claims to do, the federal government will prompt 
the target groups benefiting from the three elements of the 
Canadian social transfer to turn against their provincial 
governments or fight among themselves to avoid cuts.
<P>
	The federal government will create a situation where students 
will be competing with UI and welfare recipients. Our young 
people are the ones mainly concerned by these three programs.
<P>
	In January 1995, there were 363,000 unemployed youth 
between the ages of 15 and 24 in Canada, over 100,000 of whom 
are in Quebec. If you add to that youth on relief-over 74,000 
young people are on welfare in Quebec alone, but I do not have 
the total number for Canada-it makes for a terrible situation. It 
goes to show how little compassion this government has had for 
young people.
<P>
	In light of a $2.5 billion cut in transfer payments to the 
provinces, combined with an additional 10 per cent cut in the UI 
program, the Minister of Finances was able to save enough last 
year to meet his targets. To meet his deficit reduction target for 
this year, the minister had to use the unemployment insurance 
fund, which now shows a surplus.
<P>
	So to compensate for his improvidence, the Minister of 
Finance made cuts in unemployment insurance. The neediest in 
our society have to compensate for the incompetence of the 
Minister of Finance. This is appalling.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10495"> 10495 </A></B>
<P>
	So what does the minister do to make his budget look good? 
He announces a temporary tax, for two years, that will raise 
$100 million from large deposit-taking institutions. But 
meanwhile, the government also makes cuts totalling $2.5 
billion at the expense of the unemployed.
<P>
	I see members of the Human Resources Development 
Committee who toured Canada with me. Like me, they were met 
by demonstrations in all major cities. Like me, they listened to 
the complaints of young people and the unemployed, especially 
in the Maritimes, about the cuts that will affect them. We will 
not be able to last until spring, was what we heard from the 
victims of seasonal unemployment. We heard them all, 
especially young people.
<P>
	Today, as a result of a reduction in benefit periods, many are 
starting to feel the impact of cuts that were introduced last year. 
However, the $2.5 billion saved were, I repeat, used by the 
Minister of Finance to meet his budget target.
<P>
	This is shocking, especially when we realize that last year, the 
banks made a record profit of $4.1 billion, and some banks 
managed to avoid paying any taxes at all. I am about to finish, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	There are also the tax shelters. What did the minister do? Yes, 
indeed, the response to the official opposition's call for this for 
the past year and a half, was the announcement that 
implementation would take effect in 1999. That is impressive. 
They make the announcement four years ahead of time to the 
people who enjoy the benefit of family trusts, so that they can 
consult experts and find other ways to avoid paying tax. Four 
years ahead of time.
<P>
	When could a Minister of Finance provide a better example, 
when does he tell interested parties four years ahead of time? We 
are not talking about the disadvantaged here. He did not warn the 
disadvantaged last year. He cut $2.5 billion dollars and, again 
this year, he is waiting for his budget speech to take effect and 
another 10 per cent cut is announced. We are supposed to find 
this funny? I do not find this funny at all, because I come from a 
riding where MIL Davie shipyards, among others, is located and 
where 2,000 jobs were lost. These people, who lost their jobs, 
are affected by the cuts to unemployment insurance and are now 
on social assistance. They are not finding this funny.
<P>
	In the proposed reform, 90 per cent of associations, in 
addition to demonstrations, said no to Axworthy's reform and 
said no to the so-called improvements to the system. We know 
that increasing educational costs increases the debt load of 
students, at a time when there have already been 1,000 student 
bankruptcies in Quebec. Over 10 per cent of personal 
bankruptcies in Canada involve students or young people.
<P>
	We ask them to give thought to the future. A fine message. A 
fine message, indeed. As the hon. member for Rosemont said, 
more and more Quebecers are realizing that, with no measures to 
enable people who want to return to the labour market, no active 
measures, a choice will soon have to be made. More and more 
Quebecers are realizing that the choice they have to make in the 
Quebec referendum in order to get out of this system that offers 
them little for the future is to vote ``yes'' in the referendum on 
sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I very much appreciated the words of the hon. 
member whose concern for youth I also share.
<P>
	I was quite taken by the debate which began with the paper on 
social policy and particularly the section that applied to young 
people and tuition fees. The proposal would see additional 
money made available to young people, but the result would be a 
massive increase in tuition fees across the country.
<P>
	Coming from a rural riding I am concerned for a number of 
reasons. The ability of farm families to meet some of the costs 
for post-secondary education are becoming more and more 
difficult with each passing year. I was quite taken with the words 
of the hon. member, especially when he quoted some of the 
figures from the corporations that do not pay any income tax.
<P>
	I will be very brief. At a time when rural Canadian people, 
particularly those on the prairies, are being asked by the 
government to pay, because of the elimination of the Crow 
benefit, perhaps an additional $14,000 to $15,000 a year to ship 
their product to market, how can the government allow 
companies like Canadian Pacific to earn more than $422 million 
in pre-tax profits without paying a single cent in income tax?
<P>
	I ask that question of the government. However, in doing so I 
ask the member who just spoke if he would agree with me that it 
is certainly not fair for corporations to be allowed off the hook 
when ordinary, individual, rural families are being asked to pay 
so much more, thereby compromising the education of their 
children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, my reply will be extremely 
simple. Why are they not changing the system? Because, for the 
most part, and here I must admit that the Reform Party may be an 
exception, Canadian political parties have traditionally been 
financed by big business.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Six of the 10 largest corporations which financed parties in 
power-the Liberal Party now and the Conservative Party in the 
past-were banks. And we should be surprised that banks have a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10496"> 10496 </A></B>
<P>
lot of influence on governments, interest rates, etc.? This 
obviously affects people earning low wages and farmers who 
need to borrow large amounts and it will affect students more  
and more because in the future they will have to borrow at least 
twice the amount that they currently need to pursue graduate 
studies.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the 
speech made by the hon. member for Lévis. First of all, I found it 
most interesting that he was defending the status quo, and 
Canadian federalism, when he indicated that he hoped that there 
would be no social program reforms, that he was a member of 
the parliamentary team which toured Canada, and that he had 
heard various comments regarding the reforms proposed by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The member defended ardently and with great enthusiasm 
Canadian federalism and the status quo while the Liberal 
government has realized that, at the international level, things 
are evolving, and quite naturally so. As Liberals, we want to 
make sure that the future of Canadians, including Quebecers, 
will be much more promising than now.
<P>
	I would also like to mention that Quebecers understand 
perfectly that the changes brought upon by this government are 
necessary to the future well-being of their children. I refer our 
colleague, the member for Lévis to a documentary, a survey 
conducted in Quebec, on the quality of instruction in the 
CEGEPs, which, after all, are the responsibility of the Quebec 
government. The results are not too encouraging for young 
people. I believe, therefore, that we should start putting our own 
house in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for Madawaska-Victoria, especially for her easy victory over 
the former minister of unemployment insurance cuts. We will 
not mention his name, but I want to congratulate her for that. 
However, she does not get so much praise for her inconsistency 
last year, when the first budget of her government was handed 
down and she supported cuts similar to those proposed by the 
member she helped to defeat.
<P>
	However, as far as the status quo goes, we do not want any part 
of it. She misunderstood what I said at the end of my speech. We 
said that the federal government should mind its own business in 
the area of post-secondary education, respect areas of 
jurisdiction and transfer tax points because it is making 
expenditures in other sectors of education in Quebec. It should 
do what all the members of the National Assembly of Quebec are 
asking, even the Liberals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to join in the 
budget debate. The budget was the defining moment in Canada 
to develop a new direction in its financial dealings and also a 
new direction in the way the government does business with its 
people.
<P>
	The budget was coherent. It had integrity and a sense of 
purpose. Every feature presented to us met all three of those 
features, coherence, integrity and purpose.
<P>
	The overriding goal of this government since the day it took 
power has been jobs and growth. We believe good economics 
and good social policy are one and the same thing. In the most 
fundamental way good social policy begins with a good job.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	We believe a country that continues to care for its citizens 
must be a country that can pay its bills. We must respond to the 
challenges of our time. We must adapt to the new economy, the 
new infrastructure based on ideas and innovation. The very 
nature of government must change. We must develop a new 
notion of responsibility. The time has long passed when 
governments can or should do everything.
<P>
	Several major things have happened. The world economy has 
become truly integrated. We must think globally. Trade barriers 
have been brought down. Communications are instant and 
transportation is swift. Markets never sleep. There are no longer 
any islands. Like it or not, there is no place to hide.
<P>
	Since 1984 our debts have risen by three times. Compound 
interest is gobbling us up a second at a time. The government has 
a two track approach, sustained and sustainable economic 
growth. Growing economies produce jobs. Economies that are 
not growing produce no jobs. The key to growth is productivity. 
Productivity is about how well ideas, workers, resources and 
investment are brought together in a country's economy. 
Productivity is about ingenuity, better management and paying 
attention to the common sense of our workers.
<P>
	High productivity growth increases income. How do we do it? 
We must improve our skills. We must have better innovation. 
We must provide a welcoming climate for investment. We must 
remove disincentives that we have created for people and for 
businesses. We must get our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	This budget's plan for action introduces far reaching action to 
restore the fiscal health essential for a strong, growing economy. 
The budget will fundamentally reform what government does 
and how. It will bring permanent change in the way government 
does business. The objective is to get government right so it can 
fill its social and economic mandates and be more effective and 
sustainable will include deep cuts in the level of federal program 
spending, not simply lower spending growth, but substantial 
reduction in actual dollars.
<P>
	One of the things that gives this government integrity is that 
its plans have been prudent and it has met its targets. The budget 
actions have delivered on this government's commitment to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10497"> 10497 </A></B>
<P>
meet its interim deficit targets and the ultimate goal is a 
balanced budget.
<P>
	The interim deficit target is 3 per cent of the gross domestic 
product for 1996-97. We will be achieving the usual prudent 
economic exceptions, incorporating credible fiscal action. The 
deficit could be well below that if economic performance is in 
line with the average private sector estimates. Significant 
reforms will ensure that spending will be restrained beyond 
1996-97 and the deficit will continue to fall.
<P>
	What are the major elements of expenditure reform? This 
budget is the second in a two stage process that began with the 
February 1994 budget. It takes fundamental action certain areas. 
It implements results of the long overdue program review and a 
comprehensive examination of federal department spending. As 
a result the government will focus on what is essential and we 
will do it better.
<P>
	It acts on a new vision of the federal government's role in the 
economy. It includes substantial reductions in business 
subsidies.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	It introduces major changes in transfers to the provinces that 
will renew and modernize the federal-provincial fiscal regime, 
making it more effective, flexible and affordable.
<P>
	The major fiscal actions in the budget total $29 billion over 
the next three years, by far the biggest actions of any Canadian 
budget since the second world war and demobilization. There 
will be about $7 in expenditure reductions for every $1 in new 
tax revenues. This is the most significant event since that era.
<P>
	Three years from now federal spending in programs will be 
$10.4 billion lower than it is today, approximately 8.8 per cent. 
The cumulative expenditure savings in that period will exceed 
$25 billion.
<P>
	A fairer tax system and sharing the burden of debt and deficit 
reduction is the goal of this government. The budget reflects the 
government's awareness and the heavy tax burden borne by 
Canadians and the cost this imposes on the economy. There are 
no increases in personal income taxes in the budget. Tax 
measures are largely directed at removing preferences and 
increasing fairness. To help meet deficit targets the budget 
announces increases in taxes on business and an excise tax on 
gasoline.
<P>
	Significant features in the budget are jobs and growth. 
Economic growth is strong. The Canadian economy is stronger 
than it has been for many years. Real output was about 4.25 per 
cent in 1994, the fastest of the G-7 countries. There have been 
433,000 new jobs created, all of them full time. The 
unemployment rate has fallen 1.7 per cent to 9.7 per cent this 
year. Manufacturing output is up a full 9 per cent. At 1.5 per 
cent, excluding the effects of the tobacco tax, it is the lowest rate 
in three decades.
<P>
	Labour costs have fallen by 1.3 per cent since mid-1993. We 
have a trade surplus. We have a dramatic improvement in the 
current account and the highest business confidence since 1979. 
We have been picked by the OECD to be the fastest growing 
economy in 1995.
<P>
	The budget will meet the targets set out in it and will meet the 
red book projection for jobs and growth for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, after 
listening to the hon. member for Perth-Wellington-Waterloo 
talk about this excellent budget in terms of job creation by the 
business sector, I think that he is probably mistaken. We will 
continue to have an enormous debt and enormous interest 
payments on this debt and we will have to keep borrowing from 
the countries to which we already owe this debt.
<P>
	Some say that the deficit has been reduced, but it has merely 
been passed on to the provinces. For example, in the years to 
come, Quebec will receive $1.5 billion to $2 billion less each 
year. The federal government says that it may return $1.5 billion 
less to the province of Quebec. We all agree with that and we 
would even have preferred that it not return anything to Quebec 
but that it not tax Quebecers any more.
<P>
	Finally, what the federal government is doing is not only to 
continue taxing Quebecers as much as before, but to tax them 
even more. Moreover, the federal government is increasing the 
debt of Quebecers by $7 to $8 billion for next year alone. This 
means that Quebecers will again become poorer and poorer.
<P>
	When the government says that it wants to transfer to the 
provinces the responsibilities that belong to them, it must also 
reduce their tax burden.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	But all the government is doing is transferring to the 
provinces, and especially to Quebec, the burden of the debt and 
the deficit as well as the horrible task to manage the deficit, a 
bigger chunk of which Quebecers will be asked to take upon 
themselves, since the federal government continues to increase 
taxes while reducing transfers to Quebec. This is unfair and 
seems to me like a very clever trick designed by the government. 
I hope Quebecers will see through all this and will understand 
what the federal government is doing to Quebec by reducing 
transfers and increasing taxes for Quebecers.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Longueuil points out the tragic part of our fiscal problem. It will 
be difficult to get our fiscal house in order because of the nature 
of compound interest and the running up of deficits. The plan is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10498"> 10498 </A></B>
<P>
a simple one and is the total purpose of this deficit oriented 
budget.
<P>
	I mentioned it was two track. We will grow with it and out of 
the growth will come jobs and taxes paid back into the treasury. 
At the same time we will continue to reduce government 
operations by cuts and by making it more efficient. It will not be 
easy.
<P>
	We have heard debate in the House over the past four or five 
days saying that we have done too much cutting. Others have 
said that we have not done enough. There is a fine balance and I 
think we have found that fine balance in this budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member in his presentation said that he was quite proud that 
the government has met the deficit reduction target of 3 per cent 
of GDP in three years. The member stated that beyond 1996-97 
the deficit will continue to fall under a Liberal government.
<P>
	If this is the case why does the Liberal government not set a 
definite date for arriving at a balanced budget? Why does it not 
set a definite target? The positive results of setting a definite 
target will be that businesses will expand and new businesses 
will start up. That is what creates jobs. A positive effect would 
be lower interest rates and security for social programs which 
cannot be provided under this continual overspending.
<P>
	Why will the government not commit to a definite date for 
eliminating the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has gained 
integrity. It has set targets. It is hitting the targets. The more we 
bring down the deficit the more the membership in the Reform 
Party goes down. I hope in the four years we keep bringing it 
down. When we get to zero I hope the membership in the Reform 
Party is zero.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first let me congratulate my friend and colleague from 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo.
<P>
	I want to say a few words on the motion of the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. It goes without saying that I do not 
agree with the sentiments in his amendment. If we read what he 
is saying about offloading on the provinces and doing nothing 
for the unemployed and so on, I do not believe even he believes 
that really. It is a nice motion, nicely worded and grammatically 
correct, but factually incorrect, very incorrect, almost to the 
point of being irresponsible.
<P>
	Sure the budget is tough. Is it tough enough? It depends on 
whether we listen to the Bloc or the Reform. The Bloc says it is 
much too tough and the Reform says it is not tough enough. I 
guess that means, as I say to my friend from Lotbinière, that we 
are probably doing something right over here.
<P>
	It is a tough budget but it is not tough for the sake of being 
tough. There are people in this world who get their jollies out of 
doing tough, rough and crude things. This is not a tough budget 
for the sake of being tough. This is tough of necessity. This is the 
way we had to go.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> That is one of the not tough enough people 
who just spoke. It is a good opportunity for the gentleman from 
Vegreville. Does he disown or want to be part of the so-called 
Reform budget? Is he part of that budget? If so, let his 
constituents know that he would slash old age pensions to start 
with. It is not that kind of tough.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> You tell him Roger. Who are these people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I say to my friend from Halifax that it is all 
right. We have just demonstrated that sometimes these people 
sing in tune. From time to time they sing in tune.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, despite the heckling and despite the 
shouting, the government and the Minister of Finance are on the 
right track. Is it a perfect budget? No. We are working at getting 
it right. There are some things in the budget that I do not like. 
There are some things that other people do not like. On balance, 
is it the right approach? Yes.
<P>
	One of my constituents told me-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> That's because you are listening 
to us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The gentleman from Lethbridge has had 30 
years to get it right. I bow to his wisdom on many points.
<P>
	One of my constituents phoned me-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Why aren't you out there looking for ships?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Is the gentleman from Wild Rose not 
interested in what one of my constituents said? Would he deny 
that constituent the right to be heard here through me?
<P>
	One of my constituents called and said, ``Simmons, did you 
really clap for that budget? Did you applaud that budget?'' I 
proceeded to tell him why, indeed, I did clap for the budget. I 
started by saying: ``Is it the best thing in the world? Is it what we 
would really have liked to have done if circumstances were 
absolutely right? No''. Then I put it to him in terms of his family 
budget. I said: ``What a great morning it would be if you could 
get up and say to your wife, `This month I have a plan. We are 
going to buy that Cadillac we have always wanted, the yacht and 
the extra skidoo'''. She would say: ``How are you going to do 
that?'' ``We are just going to borrow more. Whatever we need 
we will borrow.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10499"> 10499 </A></B>
<P>
	Contrary to Reform doctrine there is nothing particularly 
sinful about borrowing. If so, many millions of Canadians sin 
every day on that score. Borrowing is not to sin. Being unable to 
pay back the loan is a sin.
<P>
	The credo that says that somehow it is a great crime to borrow 
is not the issue and that is not what I was saying to my 
constituent. I was saying that it is a sin if we borrow beyond our 
capacity to pay back. As I took him through the example I said: 
``Suppose you say to your wife that you are going to buy the 
Cadillac, the skidoo, et cetera, and she asks how you are going to 
get the money and you say, `We will borrow more. If that is not 
enough we will borrow more after that'''.
<P>
	Eventually, of course, he put the question to me: ``Do you 
have to pay it back?'' I said: ``Forget paying it back, just pay the 
interest on it''. Then he said: ``Does that not get to the point 
where you are using all of your income to pay interest?'' I said: 
``Buddy, you have it. You have exactly the problem that the 
Minister of Finance had''.
<P>
	I told my constituent there was another approach. He could 
say to his wife in the morning: ``Let us pay off all our bills right 
now. Do not buy any groceries. Tell the youngsters they will not 
eat for six months because we are paying off the debt''. He said: 
``Come on, Simmons, what are you giving me?'' I said: 
``Basically the Reform budget''. ``Do not eat now youngsters, 
just hold your breath. Do not get too thirsty or hungry for six 
months because we will be back when all the bills are paid.''
<P>
	We cannot do that. What the Minister of Finance had to do, 
and what I support him in doing, was to present this necessarily 
tough budget that goes down the middle. It tries its best to 
reduce the debt and at the same time tries its best to maintain 
essential programs.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand that some of my 
friends in Reform do not agree with that. It pains me to stand 
here and say something they do not agree with. Sometimes we 
do not agree on every point. One of the things we do not agree on 
is that we need a slash and burn budget, that we have to have a 
budget that destroys essential programs. There is another way.
<P>
	They shake their heads at me. I am just a bumpkin from 
Newfoundland. Let me read for them what some other people are 
saying. I will let them decide whether they are bumpkins and 
where they are from.
<P>
	This is what somebody said: ``Martin's '95 budget chewed 
heavily into spending reductions while taking a relatively light 
tax bite. The result is a budget the Canadian economy should be 
able to digest without an extreme amount of heartburn or acid 
indigestion''. That person was not from Newfoundland.
<P>
	Another person said this.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Have respect. These are legitimate Canadian 
citizens who have a right to speak. A second one said this: 
``Ottawa treats deficit and debt as a serious problem to be dealt 
with prudently. There is no crisis mentality here. Indeed, there is 
ample time to plan orderly change rather than risk the chaos that 
swift and deep cuts can bring''. That was another Canadian.
<P>
	This is one other: ``It's the budget-''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> What institution is he in?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I am glad the member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia asked that question 
because he is going to get the answer in a moment.
<P>
	A third Canadian said the following: ``It's the budget that 
grassroots Canadians said long and loud they wanted from this 
Liberal government. It meets the crucial criteria of leaving 
money in the pockets of those ordinary Canadians. It heeds the 
message that there is simply not time to lose in getting this 
country's deficit and debt under real control in very short 
order''.
<P>
	Three great Canadians. One edits the Calgary <I>Herald</I>.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> One is a Toronto paper and they have written 
off that part of the country. Their views do not count. There goes 
Newfoundland. There goes Toronto. We are up to four million 
people that do not count so far. Let us keep going.
<P>
	Let us let them show their cards on this one. The second 
person who said there is no crisis mentality here and it is a 
matter of orderly change is the editor of the Edmonton <I>Journal</I>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Another colonial paper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The Southam. Now we write off the Southams 
and we write off the colonials. The third great Canadian edits the 
Calgary <I>Sun</I>.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> You are quiet now. No response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I see my time is up unfortunately. We are 
saying that there are viewpoints in western Canada other than 
those brought here by the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. Being a rookie in the House, I am not too 
sure if I am doing the right thing. You can help me if I am not.
<P>
	I seek unanimous consent for a motion that I would like to 
move at this time. Under Standing Order 52 I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House do now adjourn for the purpose of discussing the rail strike.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10500"> 10500 </A></B>
<P>
	The strike now includes the longshoremen. In turn it is having 
a devastating effect on exporters and farmers throughout the 
nation. People are being laid off by the hundreds at this very 
moment. This is an emergency and I ask for unanimous consent 
to debate it at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House has heard the 
motion. Do we have unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Unfortunately the 
member does not have unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Now we know how they feel about the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order I would like 
to say that it disturbs me-
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. I believe this motion is out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to remind 
the hon. member that the motion has not received the unanimous 
consent necessary in order to be debated.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Vegreville has the floor on questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member who just spoke. He talked 
about how the Liberal budget will do a wonderful job and how it 
will solve the problem in terms of the present fiscal situation.
<P>
	How will the hon. member explain to his constituents the loss 
of jobs, increased and continued high interest rates and 
eventually the lost social programs that will result from the 
inactivity of the government?
<P>
	Let me refer to the interest costs on the debt that have 
increased from $39 billion from the time the government took 
office. They will be $51 billion, just the interest payments on the 
federal debt, by the end of the three-year budget period.
<P>
	How will the hon. member explain this to the people in his 
riding who are looking for jobs, looking for relief from high 
interest rates on their mortgages, and looking for security in 
social programs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Vegreville. On the matter of jobs he will know that independent 
statistics show that 433,000 new additional jobs have been 
created in the last year and a half.
<P>
	On the matter of interest rates I would say to him kindly that 
he is less than honest if he gives the impression that a 
government of any stripe controls interest rates. As a 
government we can help create the climate but many elements 
outside the country determine interest rates.
<P>
	Yes, the rates are high through no fault of the government. 
They came down a bit today because of forces outside of our 
control and his control. He mixes a number of items that are 
completely unrelated in my view.
<P>
	If the members wants a yardstick he can look at the Statistics 
Canada figures which show that Canada's unemployment rate is 
the lowest in eight years. We must be doing something right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened with a great deal of interest to the comments on the 
budget made by my colleague from Burin-St. George's. Of 
course, the hon. member found a very simple way of explaining 
the deficit Canada is now facing by using the vivid image of the 
discussions he had with his wife. I could tell him that I too had 
similar discussions at home, but I also went to my constituents 
to sound them out while Parliament was in recess.
<P>
	My constituents often tell me that what they want to see most 
is the federal government setting an example of good 
management. I have a few examples, such as MPs' pensions. It 
is surprising that our old hand from Newfoundland made no 
mention of members' pensions and that his leader said ``give me 
one day and I will solve the problem of MPs' pensions''.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I would like to tell you about the case of the 
windows in the building on the other side of the river. Madam 
Speaker, you are interrupting me. Unfortunately, good 
management is what this government is lacking. There is no 
vision of the future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am not interrupting 
you, but unfortunately your time is up.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Madam Speaker, my friend from Frontenac 
demonstrates that I have difficulty communicating from time to 
time. He misheard me or I misstated it. It was not my wife; it was 
another man's wife.
<P>
	On the matter of pensions there is a basic difference between 
him and me. He does not plan to be in the country long enough to 
draw a pension. I do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a great privilege to set the record straight 
on the budget.
<P>
	Members across the way have spoken about hitting targets. 
All they are going to hit with the budget is a debt wall. They are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10501"> 10501 </A></B>
<P>
talking about hitting the right track. All  the track is going to 
lead to is a catastrophic economic crisis in Canada.
<P>
	I will illustrate where we are, where we were and where we are 
going. We had a $550 billion debt and a $220 billion debt 
provincially which is increasing all the time and has been 
increasing for the last 20 years. We take in about $120 billion 
every year and spend about $160 billion.
<P>
	Last year the government had to borrow $40 billion to meet its 
obligations. In three years time another $100 billion will be 
added to the debt, which will increase the amount of money we 
have to borrow and the interest payment to $50 billion.
<P>
	Furthermore it will decrease the amount of money we have to 
spend on government programs from $120 billion to $102 
billion. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that we 
have a significant shortfall in the amount of available moneys to 
carry out government programs, in particular social programs 
that underprivileged individuals rely on for their well-being.
<P>
	With the shortfall two things will happen. We will either have 
to make it up in an economic growth and/or increase taxes. 
There is no way the economy can possibly make up $18 billion 
in economic growth. The government will be forced to increase 
taxes. Furthermore it will crush the life out of the economy and 
compromise our social programs by having more people 
obligated to use them. That is the reality.
<P>
	I will look at a few specific problems in the country. The 
government disguised its cuts irresponsibly in many ways. First 
and foremost it said it made cuts. It has actually removed money 
from the provinces, over $8.5 billion worth. Where does this 
fall? It will be on the shoulders of the taxpayer, the end point at 
every level. It is completely unfair and unconscionable.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party gave the government a budget in two 
phases. One was in November last year and the other one was 
before its budget came down. We worked through the process 
and indicated the solutions to get our country back on track. The 
government ignored them.
<P>
	We proposed cuts to the provinces but we proposed to give the 
provinces tax points to enable them to raise money to fund the 
programs they want. In effect it is a division of labour and a 
reduction in duplication. We also proposed a reduction in 
duplication at the federal level to effect a net savings to the 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Let me speak about two specific areas that are close to my 
heart and close to the hearts of all Canadians. One is health care 
and the second is post-secondary education. Currently health 
care costs are rising dramatically, far greater than our gross 
domestic product, due to expensive technology and an aging 
population. The situation is not going to get better but is going to 
get worse.
<P>
	Funding on the other hand has been stagnant. The government 
has taken $8.5 billion from the envelope of funding to health 
care costs, further exacerbating a staggering problem. It has in 
effect penalized the provinces to get its own so-called funding 
under control. In the same vein it has said to the provinces that 
they cannot raise any funds because they will be shackled to the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	The government has said that it does not want cash register 
medicine. It does not want to compromise health care. Neither 
do we in the Reform Party. We are obligated to ensuring that 
everybody receives essential health care services in a timely 
fashion, which is not happening right now.
<P>
	We have proposed that the Canada Health Act be amended to 
ensure that the provinces have the power to raise the funding and 
that the government takes it upon itself to ask Canadians to 
define essential health care services. Once we define the 
services we will ensure that everyone in the country regardless 
of income will have the services covered, which is not 
happening currently.
<P>
	I will give a couple of examples. A lady in my riding has 
vertigo, a spinning sensation. She sees things. She probably has 
a brain tumour in the base of her skull. In Victoria she will have 
to wait two months just to get her CT scan and her MRI scan is 
booked on the 12th of never. I ask members to put themselves in 
her shoes and think about how they would feel. The reason this is 
the case is that there is not the money for her to have this 
essential health care service. I could go on and on about many 
other cases but there is not the time.
<P>
	The government has also said that our proposal provides for a 
two-tier health care system. Yes, it does, but we have 
maintained that it is better to have a two-tier health care system 
that provides better services for all people than the same 
two-tier system we have now that is providing progressively 
poorer health care for all people.
<P>
	The other aspects about health care are in the realm of the 
provinces. I do not have the time to discuss them here, but they 
have responsibility for managing them.
<P>
	The most important factor in determining employability in 
the future is post-secondary education. The government has 
pillaged the amount of moneys available to post-secondary 
education, further compromising the ability of students to have 
the skills necessary to compete in the coming economies of the 
future. That is something we will collectively pay for and pay 
for in a large way.
<P>
	We in this party have proposed the income contingent loan 
replacement scheme, ensuring that funding goes to the 
provinces. We would make a small cut but also give them the tax 
points to raise the funds necessary to provide for 
post-secondary education.
<P>

<P>
	I went to Francis Kelsey Secondary School in my riding last 
week that looked into an interesting initiative. It looked into the 
future to determine the economic needs of the country. It is 
telling its students where the jobs of the future will be. The 
government should take it upon itself to direct and advise 
provinces of the economic needs of the country in the future so 
that they will be able to direct their education programs in that 
direction.
<P>
	I would like to make a few points. The budget has added $100 
billion to the debt and has severely compromised our social 
programs much more so than anything that has been done in the 
past five years. Rather than have a slash and burn policy 
economically, which is what the government has proposed, we 
have put forth the only effective solution to save health care, 
social programs and the other essential programs and to help 
those most in need. We are trying to preserve the framework of 
the social net of which we are so proud.
<P>
	We would take the moneys from the upper third of the income 
brackets. We feel the moneys we are borrowing now to pay for 
the debt are in effect being borrowed from future generations.
<P>
	In conclusion I would say that we in this party are more than 
happy to help the government out to have a balanced budget but 
we need to do it within the next three years. Otherwise those who 
will suffer most are those who can least take care of themselves.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.15 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 84(5), it is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to 
dispose of the amendment now before the House. The question 
is on the amendment.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on March 4, 1986 then Minister of Justice, 
John Crosbie, stood in the House and promised to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit discrimination based on 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	Today, almost 10 years later, we are still waiting for that 
promise to be kept. The Prime Minister in 1993 made a firm 
commitment on the eve of a federal election. He stated the 
Liberal Party of Canada is firmly committed to banning 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
<P>
	The Prime Minister went on to say in July 1993: ``I will not 
lie. I will not be a Mulroney who made promises and never kept 
them. I am not that type of politician''.
<P>
	We are still waiting, not for any kind of special rights or 
privileges but for basic equality. I have here a letter written in 
November 1993 by the Minister of Justice: ``The government 
remains committed to amending the Canadian Human Rights 
Act to add sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination. I will introduce this legislation before the House 
rises in December''.
<P>
	This is yet another in a long and sorry string of broken 
promises. What does the Prime Minister have to say now? He 
said in January that they have four more years in their mandate, 
and that it is important these amendments receive the full 
benefit of debate and consultation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What I find incredible is that this amendment to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act to include sexual orientation has already 
been debated for over ten years.
<P>
	In Quebec, it has been in place since 1977. Quebec was the 
first province to eliminate and to prohibit discrimination based 
on sexual orientation. Now, ten years later, there will be a 
referendum and, frankly, I  think that Quebecers must be 
wondering when the government is going to keep its promises. 
Gay and lesbian Quebecers in particular must be wondering 
when the government will follow the example of leadership set 
by Quebec on this fundamental issue.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is essential this amendment be brought into force partly 
because there is still widespread discrimination at the 
workplace, discrimination in extending benefits, the benefits in 
recognition of gay and lesbian relationships, and discrimination 
in recognizing families of gay and lesbian people.
<P>
	I hope the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
will take this opportunity not to tell us, as the Minister of Justice 
does, that we remain committed to the principle of this 
commitment, but that at last this government will move forward 
on the question of basic justice and equal rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway 
asked a question of the Minister of Justice about the 
amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act in the House on 
December 9, 1994.
<P>
	In reply, the Minister of Justice reiterated the commitment of 
the government to amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to 
prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. He 
also said the main point is this principle is undiminished and the 
issue of timing should not be the central concern.
<P>
	On August 6, 1992 in a case brought under the equality 
guarantees of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
Haig and Birch v. Canada, the Court of Appeal for Ontario 
ordered that the Canadian Human Rights Act must be read to 
include that ground as of that date and be administered 
accordingly. The Attorney General did not appeal the order to 
the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	The government views this as the current and correct state of 
the law. Thus, gay and lesbian Canadians can already file 
complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
should they find themselves refused a job or a service because of 
their sexual orientation. Complaints can be filed and the act's 
protection sought on this ground.
<P>
	What is left is the very important symbolic act of making the 
Canadian Human Rights Act reflect the current state of the law. 
The amendment to which the government is committed would 
give Parliament the opportunity of bringing the act up to date. It 
will also bring the federal government into the ranks of the eight 
provinces and territories, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Yukon, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia and 
Saskatchewan, which have already amended their  human rights 
legislation to add the grounds of sexual orientation.
<P>
	This government wants to add the federal laws against 
discrimination to the list of governments that have joined in this 
fight against discrimination and thereby assure Canadians of the 
same high standard of protection at the federal level.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THETREASURYBOARD">THE TREASURY BOARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, a 
week or so ago I asked the President of the Treasury Board to 
explain the increase in the estimates where the budget for the 
Treasury Board was being increased to accommodate 10 
additional executives at a cost of $3.5 million.
<P>
	The reply we received from the President of the Treasury 
Board, from Hansard of March 2, 1995, page 10272, was totally 
inadequate:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that overall the executive ranks in the public 
service have been reduced over the last four years by some 26 per cent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When I asked a supplementary question because it seemed to 
me he did not have the grasp of the question, he responded:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, I do not know from where the hon. member gets those figures. 
There is no increase in the staff at Treasury Board.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I beg to differ. The estimates, part III, page 2-43 under 
activity resource summary quotes management for the Treasury 
Board, 1994-95 forecast, at 75 full time equivalents at a cost of 
$6,294,000. The estimates for 1995-96 are for 85 full time 
equivalents, an increase of 10, at $9,811,000, an increase of 
$3,517,000.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	These quotations are from the estimates prepared by the 
President of the Treasury Board and tabled in this House by the 
President of the Treasury Board. Yet, when we ask him a 
question about his own department, he unfortunately does not 
know the answer.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board is going to be laying off 
45,000 civil servants. These are real people who have families 
and careers. Their futures are being dashed. At the same time, 
while these people who perhaps are at the lower end of the civil 
service scale are being turfed out on the streets, albeit with 
pension plans and severance packages, we now find out that the 
Treasury Board is hiring 10 more people at an average cost of 
$350,000 each.
<P>
	I do not know what the President of the Treasury Board has in 
mind with 10 executives at that price. However, if he has 
anything else in mind other than hiring executives, then there is 
a total distortion of the facts in the way they are presented here. 
If he intends to hire 10 more executives, surely he owes this 
House some justification as to why he intends to pay each of 
them $350,000.
<P>
It is disgraceful that these figures are being presented to us at 
the same time as the government is downsizing  the civil service. 
We as Reformers have said that you start at the top. You cut at 
the top. You have no moral authority to cut at the bottom until 
such time as you have cut at the top.
<P>
	Therefore, I think the President of the Treasury Board should 
cut that out of the estimates now so that there is no increase in 
the executive ranks of the Treasury Board.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10505"> 10505 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
frankly I am very disappointed to hear such an irresponsible 
analysis. The President of the Treasury Board indicated clearly 
to the member for St. Albert that there had been no increase.
<P>
	The president undertook, on March 2, to look into the 
specifics of the matter and to provide him with additional 
information. And that is what I am doing this evening. I would 
like to provide a more detailed answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope there is no attempt on the part of Reform Party 
members to suggest their analysis is accurate. The problem may 
be confusion with the terms executive and management. In the 
context of part III of the estimates the term executive is a 
classification term referring to a specific occupational group. 
The term management is used to refer to an activity, a function 
or planning element which is used for the purposes of resource 
planning.
<P>
	More specifically, reference was made to figure 6 on page 
2-43 of the part III for Treasury Board where there is mention of 
85 FTEs, full-time equivalents. These FTEs are made up of 19 
for the president's office, 16 for the secretary's office, 5 for the 
office of the chief informatics officer, 22 for the planning and 
communications directorate, 10 for legal services support and 
13 for a special reserve. This total only includes four positions 
that are executive or the equivalent. Therefore, it was erroneous 
on the part of the hon. member to draw the conclusion that the 
secretariat was increasing its executives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There was no increase.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to finish off very quickly by saying there has been a 
decrease over four years of about 30 per cent. We expect this 
decrease will continue.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member knows that nobody gets paid $350,000 a 
year.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LABOUR">LABOUR</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
March 3 I asked a question of the Minister of Labour concerning 
what was then an impending strike at CP Rail. I asked what 
action the minister planned to take to ensure a continuation of 
negotiations, thereby avoiding a potentially bitter, long 
labour-management dispute.
<P>
	In his response, the parliamentary secretary to the minister 
stated that his government would simply leave matters to the 
collective bargaining process. However, in the time that has 
passed since I first raised my question, strikes and lockouts have 
occurred throughout Canada escalating to the point yesterday of 
a complete withdrawal of services by the 3,200 member 
Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	So far the work disruptions involve only the members of that 
union. However, the other key player, the 4,000 member 
Canadian Auto Workers union, is prepared to take strike action 
anytime after March 15, which of course is tomorrow.
<P>
	The potential consequences of the ongoing labour dispute 
between the railways and the unions are enormous. To 
complicate the situation, 405 members of the International 
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union in the British 
Columbia ports have walked off the job, paralysing the 
movement of goods in western Canada.
<P>
	It is imperative the government take quick and decisive action 
to halt the further disruption of our transportation routes. The 
fragile Canadian economy simply cannot withstand a blow like 
this. The uninterrupted operation of our transportation system is 
an essential element of our economic recovery. No one can 
dispute that.
<P>
	More important, when examining the economic implications 
of a strike, we have to consider the bottom line. Here nobody 
wins. Too many people are harmed by needless strikes and 
lockouts. It is simply reprehensible to expose Canadians to more 
of this kind of nonsense.
<P>
	Negotiations between CP Rail and the two unions in question 
have been ongoing for some 15 months. It would appear that 
neither side is truly serious about arriving at a new contract. If 
the resolve were there, surely the differences would have been 
settled peacefully and promptly by now.
<P>
	Simply suggesting that the two sides continue the collective 
bargaining process is unsatisfactory. In the meantime, while 
they continue talks for who knows how long, countless numbers 
of people will be hurt by a dispute for which they are not 
responsible.
<P>
	For this reason, the federal government must now step into 
this dispute with back to work legislation. This legislation 
should include a 30-day cooling off period during which 
meaningful negotiations could take place.
<P>
	As the work disruption drags on it appears obvious that the 
government is stalling for time while it drafts anti-scab 
legislation. A cop-out like that is unacceptable.
<P>
	Canada's railways account for close to 40 per cent of all 
freight tonnage moved in the country. Whether they be shippers 
of newsprint, coal or potash, the auto industry or western grain 
farmers, importers, exporters and manufacturers they must be 
assured that they have a  reliable method of getting their 
products to market. Otherwise those markets will dry up. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10506"> 10506 </A></B>
<P>
Foreign buyers need suppliers they can count on. If they cannot 
rely on the Canadian market they will simply go elsewhere.
<P>
	Aside from the direct impact of rail stoppages there is 
immeasurable harm resulting from what is known as the domino 
effect. Industries which cannot obtain parts or ship their goods 
will have to shut down production and lay off employees. The 
longer the government allows this situation to go on, the more 
far reaching the impact will be on Canadians from coast to coast. 
This means less revenue for the cash starved federal treasury.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. Your time 
has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for raising a very 
important issue.
<P>
	As the Minister of Labour reported to this House yesterday, 
CP Rail and three of its unions representing 2,900 workers 
reached a tentative settlement on March 12, 1995 withthe assistance of the Federal Mediation and ConciliationService. The agreements provide for wage increases, modified 
employment security and a variety of benefit improvements. 
The settlements are subject to ratification by the unionmemberships.
<P>
	I understand that CP Rail is meeting with the BMWE today 
and I would encourage them to make every effort to settle their 
collective bargaining differences.
<P>
	I am advised that the impact of the work stoppage at CP Rail 
has been limited and that the railway is continuing to operate its 
core lines.
<P>
	Collective bargaining is continuing in a number of railway 
negotiations. The parties must be given every opportunity to 
settle their disputes in collective bargaining as provided for 
under the terms of the Canada Labour Code. However, the 
parties must accept their responsibility to resume bargaining 
and conclude an agreement not only in the interests of their 
members and shareholders but also for the Canadian public.
<P>
	The railways and the unions have the necessary insight and 
experience to resolve the complex issues in dispute.
<P>
	Any discussion of legislative intervention at this time would 
be premature. The federal mediation and conciliation service 
remains in contact with the parties, available to assist them in 
their negotiations.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.05 p.m.)
<P>
