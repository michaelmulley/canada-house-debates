I commend him for his diligence. As I recollect, he raised this issue in the last Parliament as well. Having moved private members' bills through this House, I appreciate that sometimes it is very difficult and can be frustrating as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members opposite talk frequently about tax fairness. It is a little bit a concept in the eye of the beholder, but at least in terms of the abstract, the members opposite embrace that concept. Indeed, I do not know of any member in the House who does not embrace the concept of tax fairness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I have yet to see from the government any concept of actual enshrinement in legislation of tax fairness, and as we talk about this bill in this chamber, we might keep that concept in mind, because this is a bill that gives preference to a particular category of taxpayer over another very similar category of taxpayer. It is very difficult to see where the tax fairness is for those who are not receiving the particular tax break that the bill contemplates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I continue my remarks on the bill, I want to recount a complicated history with respect to tax treaties between Canada and the U.S. In 1984, in a tax treaty with the United States, Canadians who received social security payments were only required to pay 50% of their social security payments as taxable income in Canada. If they received $100 in the United States, they only had to declare $50 of it for tax purposes. In 1996 the treaty changed, allowing the country of payment, in this case the United States, rather than the country of residence, to tax social security payments that were sent north of the border. A 25.5% withholding tax was instituted at the time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para323972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was good news for pensioners with high incomes, as the 25.5% withholding tax by the United States was higher than their marginal tax rate in Canada. They therefore saved money. For low income Canadians, however, the rate would have been higher than their marginal tax rate. They would have been worse off.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treaty changed again in 1997 when the U.S. stopped the 25.5% withholding tax from social security recipients and taxation power once again returned to the country of residence, namely, in this case, Canada. The Government of Canada agreed at the time to make taxable only 85% of the social security income in the hands of pensioners living here. In other words, there is an arrangement between Canada and the U.S. that the $100 I spoke of would come north, but only $85 of it would be taxed. This bill contemplates that the already preferential $85 in fact be reduced to $50, or in other words, it contemplates a return to the original arrangement of 1984. </div>
    </p><a name="Para323974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a quick summary of the legislative toing and froing with with respect to this bill and how pensioners are treated with respect to receipt of $100 from U.S. social security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to return to the idea of tax fairness by using the example of two neighbours who live side by side. The hon. member is from the Windsor area, where a number of these folks live who already receive the $85 benefit and are now wishing to restore it to the $50 benefit, so there we can see neighbours living side by side. One neighbour would receive a Canadian pension, CPP or QPP as the case may be, and that entire $100 would be included in his or her income. As the present situation exists, the neighbour who is a recipient of U.S. moneys and who is beside the Canadian neighbour would declare only $85 on a similar amount of money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it exists, the entire $100 Canadian pension is taxable, but only $85 is taxable for the neighbour receiving the U.S. pension. This bill does not contemplate moving it up to $100, which would be taxable, but rather moving it down to $50, taxable. We can see that this is a huge advantage for the person who is receiving U.S. social security versus the person who is receiving a Canadian pension.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at neighbour A who receives social security payments. In the 2006 return taxable by country of residence, the Government of Canada allows that person to exempt 15% of those moneys. In other words, neighbour A in effect receives only $85, which would then be taxable. Let us consider the neighbour who receives the Canadian pension. In that case, it is $100 that is entirely taxable. If we are talking about tax fairness, it is pretty difficult to see how those two neighbours with a similar amount of pensionable income should be in any position other than that of paying a similar amount of tax on their government pension plans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this bill proposes, however, is to lower that from $85 to $50. In other words, not only would it recognize the current inequity that exists, but it would exaggerate the inequity. That individual would be paying tax on $50 rather than paying tax on $85, unlike like the person receiving entirely Canadian pension money who would be paying tax entirely on the $100.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where exactly does this 50% exclusion rate come from? Was this just pulled out of the air? Or is it only an attempt to return to the 1980s, when only 50% of the social security payment was counted as taxable income? It would appear that this bill is striving to ensure tax parity between Americans who receive the Canada pension plan and Canadians who receive U.S. social security. It does not seem to have tax fairness between Canadian taxpayers at its heart. What the bill should strive to do is ensure that Canadians in similar circumstances pay similar amounts of tax on their pensions, whether they are on social security or the Canadian pension plan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para323980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I do not have the figures in front of me and would be interested to know if in fact social security recipients are worse off than their CPP counterparts. As a result, I will be voting for this bill and in fact urging our colleagues to do that, not that we are particularly embracing the principle that the bill enunciates, and having given our concerns about the issue of tax fairness, but with a view to getting these numbers during the committee's examination of the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para323981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Finance should be able to provide the committee and, through it, this House with an accurate picture of the difference in tax burdens borne by social security recipients and CPP recipients. If there is an unfairness here and social security recipients are indeed being taxed more, then I would agree that it should be rectified, but it should be rectified by a number that has not been arbitrarily pulled out of the air, such as a 50% exclusion rate. The United States does not even use the system any more, so I am at a loss to understand why it is this particular figure, which appears to have some relevance to the 1984 figure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to again congratulate the hon. member on his persistence in bringing this bill forward. It does have a measure of an attempt to redress an inequity, but as I said earlier, it is very hard to see how there is tax fairness built into this bill. As members of Parliament, we must strive to deliver tax fairness to all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I believe that this bill is in fact worth looking at. I look forward to the hon. member's presentation at the finance committee.</div>

They have crossed the border to earn a living in another country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was first elected in my riding in 1993. In 1994-95, we had to wage a tremendous battle to correct a mistake made by the Liberal government. Those were the years when the government was trying to raise as much money as possible to fight the deficit. The government could find no better solution than to tighten the employment insurance criteria and turn the system into the federal government's cash cow. In addition, in a trade with the Americans, the government introduced a system that made no sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in its first mandate, the Chrétien government decided that, instead of receiving their pensions from the Americans and having them taxed at 50% here in Canada, Canadian citizens would be taxed directly by the Americans. The absurd result was that people never saw their money again. We had to wage an ongoing battle to rectify this situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to see just how many people in the riding I represented at the time, especially people in Témiscouata, needed that income to make ends meet. I remember meetings of 350 to 400 people in Notre-Dame-du-Lac, Cabano and other towns. People wanted the situation to be corrected. I made representations at the time, as did François Langlois, who was the Bloc member for the neighbouring riding of Bellechasse—Etchemins— Montmagny—L'Islet. We succeeded in making a change, not alone, but in collaboration with many members of this House, who represented ridings where people were also living along the border and dealing with the sad new reality approved by the Chrétien government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that Herb Gray, a member of the government at the time, took action and said, “Listen, our decision makes no sense. We have to change things”. When the situation was rectified, part of the reality was forgotten. As I mentioned, the government at the time wanted to raise as much money as possible to fight the deficit, so it agreed to tax at 85% the money received by Canadian citizens who had worked in the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of that time, people receiving American pensions were taxed on 85% of the amount they received, despite being Canadian citizens who paid into those pensions while working in the United States. Those people did not have the option of putting some of that money in a tax shelter, such as an RRSP. The Canadian government collects tax on 85% of every cheque those people get. The bill before us today aims to correct that situation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a Liberal mistake. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78898,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78898&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Essex</A> has introduced the bill before us now. At least it will restore the system we had before the Liberal blunder. It will restore a 50% tax rate, thus creating greater equality between American workers who make contributions to pension plans and Canadian and Quebec workers who work in the United States and make contributions to the same thing. The bill will ensure greater equality in that respect and greater equality for the problem that remains to be corrected. Currently, when people receive their American pension cheques, they are taxed on 85% of the amount, but a fair system would reduce that to 50%, as was the case before the Liberals' big mistake.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sound like very theoretical arguments, but they are not that at all. There are a lot of elderly people who receive the American old age pension, and that is what enables them to make ends meet and to support several regional economies along the border. This is the result of people's very hard work, work that, in my riding, was mainly in the forest industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still a lot of people in my riding today, especially in the Montmagny—L'Islet part, but also in Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, who are in this situation. I am thinking of the people in Saint-Pamphile, the people in all of the towns along the border and the people of Saint-Just-de-Bretenières. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para323993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some towns are located along the U.S. border. Often the people in those towns earn their living in the United States and they are currently victims of the unfairness we still find in this legislation, which should be corrected. We hope this will happen as soon as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Bloc Québécois hopes this bill will pass and be referred to a committee to be considered in greater detail. This is a private member's bill. It should perhaps be tidied up to bring its rules in line with Canada's Income Tax Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, as far as the principle of the bill is concerned, we feel it is important, justified and more equitable to pass this measure. In my opinion, this is the type of gesture that deserves to be supported since our constituents have dedicated their lives to supporting their family by being willing to leave for the United States to work in logging camps and in the tourism industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the places my constituents often go to work is Maine because they are considered to be good workers and are received with open arms by the Americans, who hope these people can continue to work there. However, current inequity in the legislation discourages them from doing so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People do not realize the contribution rates they are paying when they are 25, 30 or 35. They just think there are always a lot of deductions on their paycheque. They really begin to notice when they start getting their pension because the pension cheque is important to people whose sole family income is often only a basic pension. It is this cheque that allows them to stay at home longer. Rather than leaving their home at age 70, 72 or 75, this cheque gives them the means to stay at home and hire someone to help with the housekeeping. This cheque at the end of the month allows them to continue to have a decent life, because it provides the necessary amount of money to cover such expenses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para323998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the Bloc Québécois believes that the gender equality initiative is worthy of our support so that we can correct the mistakes made by the Liberals at the time of the 1995 convention. At that time, it was decided that the Americans would withhold taxes at source. Thus, Quebeckers and Canadians had their taxes withheld by the Americans, with no means of recovering that money. That mistake was partially corrected as a result of the efforts of some of the members of this House, especially some Bloc Québécois members at that time. However, a second part of the reform was not implemented and it is essential that it be addressed by the bill before us here today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para323999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeking recognition for our seniors, for the work they did, and we hope to see them get everything they deserve. As we must all be aware, in the last 25 years, the income of Canadian seniors has improved. However, certain groups in our society—some people living in Canada—are not receiving fair treatment, especially women who become widowed and are living alone. These women must go through a drastic change in their life, in how they manage their budget. Furthermore, a correction would also lead to greater tax equity and give our seniors an income that would allow them to make ends meet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Parliament has an opportunity to give recognition where recognition is due, by ensuring that these Canadians are entitled to tax rates that are as equitable as possible, given that they dedicated their lives to supporting their families and even agreed to work outside Canada. For this reason, the Bloc Québécois will support this motion. </div>

    </p><a name="Para324002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the principles, which have motivated the hon. member to craft this bill, are ones that my constituents and I support. Those principles include tax fairness for all Canadians and special consideration for our seniors who have given this country so much and deserve our full support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians who want to know what Canada's seniors have contributed only need to look around them. The entire fabric of Canadian life was built on foundations that were laid for us by those who are now in their retirement years. An obvious example is the freedom we enjoy, freedom that people in many other parts of the world would dearly love to have. We are free to speak our minds, free to worship as we choose or not at all and free to hold and enjoy property and to participate in institutions that govern us, all because of sacrifices of a generation of Canadians who are now in retirement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe a debt to the senior members of our communities. Indeed, the government does a great deal for seniors right now. Old age security benefits and the guaranteed income supplement ensure that seniors are able to enjoy a basic minimum standard of living. In this fiscal year, these programs will provide over $31.5 billion to over 4.2 million, many of them low income seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors also benefit from a number of tax expenditures and programs that are targeted to their needs and particular circumstances. These range from a newly increased pension income tax credit, which reduces income tax paid by seniors, to the new horizons seniors program which provides financial support to community based projects for seniors. These targeted programs are in addition to the strong retirement income support that is in place: the OAS, the GIS and the financially secure Canada pension plan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results speak for themselves. The number of low income seniors currently is at an all time low. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2202513,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2202513&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-305</A> proposes to extend the exemption from the tax credit to U.S. social security benefits from 15% to 50%. I know this measure would help many seniors in this country who worked in the United States or whose spouses worked in the United States and now qualify for these benefits. However, I also know that the taxation of these benefits has a long and complex history involving lengthy negotiations between the Department of Finance and the U.S. treasury department. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain by providing some background on the taxation of social security benefits as set out in the Canada-U.S. Tax Treaty and why it is that Canada agreed to the 15% exemption. As I have mentioned, this history has been complex and the current state of affairs represents a delicate balance between competing interests. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-U.S. Tax Treaty has included rules for the taxation of social security benefits paid by one country to residents of the other country since 1984. The evolution of these rules has progressed in three distinct phases. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, between 1984 and 1996 the treaty contained a residence based taxation rule; that is, only the country of residence was allowed to tax social security benefits. During this time, a resident of Canada receiving U.S. social security benefits would only pay tax to Canada. There was, however, a 50% deduction in computing taxable income in respect of these benefits because at that time the U.S. only taxed a maximum of 50% of the U.S. social security payments. This represented a tax advantage over Canadian benefits which were fully subject to tax. In addition, U.S. residents receiving Canadian benefits were not subject to Canadian tax and benefited from the 50% maximum inclusion rate in the United States.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125">(1125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One consequence of this was that high income U.S. taxpayers were not subject to the clawback of old age security benefits which applies to Canadian taxpayers with incomes above a certain amount. This residence based rule was seen to be unfair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the public called for the rules to be changed so that all participants of Canadian benefits were taxed in the same way, regardless of residence, and the rules were changed. In 1995, Canada and the United States agreed to replace the residence based rule with a source based rule. In other words, the new rule would allow only the country from which the payment arose to tax that payment. The result was that a Canadian resident receiving U.S. social security benefits was taxed only by the United States. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the maximum inclusion rate under U.S. law had risen over time from 50% to 85%. A U.S. citizen in receipt of a U.S. benefit would be subject to ordinary U.S. rates only on a maximum of 85% of that income. If the recipients were Canadian residents, they would either pay U.S. rates if they were a U.S. citizen or they would be subject to a final withholding tax of 25.5%. This rate was computed at 85% of the standard U.S. withholding rate of 30%. This was a final tax and was non-refundable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For high income Canadians, this tax was usually acceptable since, if they had to pay tax in Canada on this income, their marginal rate of taxation would likely have been higher than 25.5%. However, for low income taxpayers who otherwise rely on the progressive nature of the Canadian tax system to fairly distribute the tax burden, the 25.5% withholding tax constituted excessive taxation and caused, in many cases, severe hardship. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These taxpayers, had they been subject to tax in Canada on this income, would have paid little or no tax. Because they were subject to U.S. taxation, a quarter of their income was lost. Conversely, a U.S. resident receiving Canadian benefits under this rule could choose between a 25% withholding tax or, if they filed a tax return in Canada, a graduated income tax at ordinary rates. For low income U.S. taxpayers, this meant they paid little or no tax. At that time there was a great discrepancy in the taxation of these benefits to the detriment of many low income Canadian seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and the United States recognized this unfair treatment and we came together again to change the rules. To relieve hardship on low income Canadians, we agreed to restore residence only taxation. The current rule provides that social security payments are taxed as if they were payments from the home country's benefit plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Canadian recipient of U.S. social security is treated as if the payment were from CPP, QPP or OAS. U.S. recipients of CPP, QPP or OAS are treated as if they were receiving U.S. society security benefits. This meant that Canadians receiving U.S. benefits could avail themselves of the graduated rate of our taxation system and were no longer subject to the flat 25.5% withholding tax.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, the maximum inclusion rate in the United States had changed from 50% to 85%. That is the history of the taxation of social security benefits between Canada and the United States. As this history reveals, it is a complicated issue that is related to the negotiations of our most important tax treaty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. member for tackling such a complex issue and for working hard to represent the seniors and retired people, not only in his constituency but also in mine, as I have many residents who live in the riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78554,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78554&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burlington</A> who receive both a Canadian pension and a U.S. pension.</div>

As my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78463,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78463&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough—Guildwood</A> pointed out, we in the Liberal Party are certainly very happy that this bill go to committee, as I think we have already agreed. We think that tax fairness is a matter of primary importance. We think that this bill may be appropriate in terms of enhancing tax fairness, but we are not quite sure. We need to have further information which we think the finance department will be able to provide when this bill goes to committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to reiterate the general point about tax fairness that was made by my colleague, I will not repeat the summary of the bill because that has already been done by a number of speakers, but let me spend a few minutes focusing on the fairness issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take the example where there are two neighbours. Neighbour A receives social security payments in 2006 which are taxable by his country of residence, which is Canada. The Government of Canada allows him to exempt 15% of those payments from his taxable income. If neighbour A were to receive a $100 U.S. social security cheque, he would only have to pay tax on $85 of that money. That is fairly clear. Now we can consider his neighbour who is a Canada pension plan recipient with a similar total income. When neighbour B receives his $100 CPP cheque, he has to pay tax on the entire $100.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are talking about tax fairness, it would seem that the two neighbours with a similar amount of income should pay a similar amount of tax on their government pension plans. It is a matter of very simple fairness that two neighbours with like incomes should be treated in a like manner by the tax system. What this bill proposes to do is to lower the amount that neighbour A would count as taxable income from $85 to $50 for every $100 of social security that he receives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does this 50% exclusion rate come from? This is the nub of the matter and the essence of the bill. Was it just pulled out of the air or is there some analytical foundation to it? Is it an attempt to return to the 1980s when only 50% of social security payments were counted as taxable income?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem that this bill is striving to ensure tax parity between Americans who receive a CPP pension and Canadians who receive social security. It does not seem to have tax fairness between Canadian taxpayers at its heart. It would seem to me at least on the surface that what the bill should try to do is ensure that Canadians in like circumstances pay similar amounts of tax on their pensions whether they be social security or the Canada pension plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, that is a simple example and a general point of principle, but I do not have the figures in front of me to give a proper answer to the question. I would certainly be interested to know if in fact social security recipients are worse off than their CPP counterparts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, I will be voting for this bill at second reading, with the view of getting these numbers during the committee's examination of the bill. The Department of Finance has a lot of expertise and should be able to provide the committee and through it this House with an accurate picture of the difference in the tax burden borne by the social security recipients versus the Canada pension plan recipients.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140">(1140)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an unfairness here and social security recipients are indeed being taxed more, then I agree and I am sure my colleagues would agree, that it should be rectified, but it should be rectified by a real number and not a number that appears to be arbitrary. Since it is a round number, 50%, it somewhat raises the suspicion that perhaps this number has been pulled out of the air. Perhaps it does not, but that is why we want to send it to committee, to try to get facts from the Department of Finance. The U.S. does not use that system based on 50% any more. That raises another question about why the number of 50% has been used.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again I would like to congratulate the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78898,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78898&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Essex</A> on his bill. Tax fairness is something we must always strive to deliver for Canadians. It was on the basis of tax fairness that we preferred our income tax cut rather than the government's GST cut. That is another example of tax fairness because the Liberals' income tax cut was only at the lowest income level. The maximum benefit that any Canadian, no matter how rich, could get was in the order of $300, whereas the GST cut, if a person is very rich and buys a yacht or an expensive car, they would receive more than a $300 benefit with that single purchase. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is another example of tax fairness. We on this side of the House argued very strenuously, and ultimately we did not have the votes, but we certainly argued strenuously on the grounds of tax fairness for an income tax cut to the lowest level rate rather than a GST cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all in favour of tax fairness. I am sure the hon. member is in favour of tax fairness in principle too. It is difficult to oppose it in principle. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2202513,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2202513&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-305</A> goes to committee and we find that the member's bill does indeed move in the direction of greater fairness in the tax system, then we on this side of the House would most likely support the bill, but we do not have those facts yet. That is why we are voting to send the bill to committee where it will have greater scrutiny and we will have greater access to the facts of the matter.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has had a number of different opportunities to move forward and has not made it yet. However, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78898,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78898&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Essex</A> has always been pursuing this very important issue not only in terms of fairer taxation as described in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2202513,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2202513&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-305</A> but also as a social justice issue. We have citizens across the country who are being unfairly taxed because laws have changed and have had an impact on their daily income and livelihood. It has created a considerable amount of grief, angst and a number of their plans have changed which has been rather unfortunate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recognize that in the Windsor-Essex County we have many seniors who had previously been paying social security taxes to the United States and work over there on a regular basis even to this day. We have thousands of nurses for example going to the United States from Canada every day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago when this change was enacted in the tax treaty law, it basically usurped the traditional taxation that they had expected to receive when they got their social security upon retirement. It is not just Windsor-Essex County. This affected individuals in British Columbia, the Atlantic provinces and individuals who have worked in the United States from across Canada. It is not just our area, although we do have a significant number there but it is important to all Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that it seems that this bill will go forward with the unanimous consent of the House to the finance committee where any questions about the bill will be resolved. I hope it will be passed quickly by the finance committee and sent back to this Chamber, and finally to the Senate to be ratified.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Canadians are looking at Parliament, they look for opportunities for all parties to work together on issues. We have demonstrated that there is common support for this legislation. The previous administration had problems acting on this which led to some of the current delays that we have today. However, if we can put that behind us and move the bill forward and pass it quickly, Canadians will be rather pleased to see something come from this Chamber that is supported by all and is going to benefit all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bill that will cost Canadians some money, but we need to put the bill in perspective. It may cost perhaps $25 million, but it will go back to seniors who should not have lost that money to begin with and this is a government that had over $13.5 billion to put on the debt unilaterally. There is the financial capability to rectify this injustice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber passed a seniors charter of rights, which was an NDP motion. It called for fairness, equity and respect for seniors when bills come through the Chamber that relate to them. This bill fits that mould. Therefore, I think there is a greater onus on the Chamber to move the bill quickly through the system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had a number of opportunities to talk to constituents and it is important to put a face to the effects of what has happened. They have watched their savings and earnings disappear because of this change and what has been sad is that some of these people have passed away. The original tax treaty that was changed when this problem emerged goes back to 1996 and it has been 10 long painful years for individuals who had expectations eroded and eliminated as the amount of income they would have coming back to them has been affected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from different constituents who have had to change their lifestyles. Some have had to sell their homes or go to a different lifestyle option that they did not want to do or have not been able to support their grandchildren the way that they wanted to because they are literally losing hundreds of dollars per month. This was part of their calculated income which they expected to receive.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are law-abiding citizens who crossed the border for years and worked in the United States and brought those earnings back to Canada. They were very good citizens to the country, have retired here, and are contributing in many different ways. To have this happen has been very frustrating to watch. They have heard a lot of rhetoric over time about this being fixed and their expectations of Parliament are warranted to have this bill move quickly through the process.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to read a letter which encapsulates the debate we have had here today and it is important that Craig Ridsdale does get noted. He has been an outspoken voice on this issue and he wrote a letter called “unfair tax laws burden seniors”:</div>

The New Democratic Party is committed to seeing this bill move forward, not only through the finance committee but as quickly as possible to final ratification, so our seniors are treated with the equity and fairness that they so justly deserve.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the opportunity to speak to the bill put forward by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78898,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78898&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Essex</A>, in that the bill would exempt from taxation 50% of the U.S. social security benefits received by taxpayers here in Canada. Currently, the exemption is only 15%.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2202513,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2202513&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-305</A> would amend subsection 81(1) of the Income Tax Act. This part of the act provides that certain items shall not be included in calculating the income of a senior or a taxpayer for a taxation year. The amendment would add to this category a couple of items and, thus, exempt from income tax 35% of the aggregate of all benefits paid by the United States government as a benefit under U.S. social security legislation. The amendment also makes clear that this 35% exemption would be in addition to the 15% exemption provided by paragraph 5(a) of article XVIII of the treaty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that approximately 90,000 Canadians receive U.S. social security benefits, of whom approximately 53,000 earn sufficient income to be liable for tax. The bill would affect the taxation of certain pension payments and would grant an additional 35% exemption in the case of U.S. social security benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is really about the taxation of retirees in Canada and this is an important subject. This is such an important subject because we owe it to Canadian seniors to provide a coherent and comprehensive approach to how their income is treated. I commend the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78898,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78898&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Essex</A> for bringing this bill forward. I know that the member shares the same strong commitment to Canadian seniors as I do. This commitment to seniors in his riding and throughout our country is certainly to be commended. We owe our seniors a great deal and when we have the opportunity to extend something as simple as tax relief, we have to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate to have a new government that is committed to tax relief. We are committed to tax relief for all Canadians, but especially for seniors and retired Canadians who currently receive a pension.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relief would benefit nearly 2.7 million taxpayers who receive eligible pension income, providing up to $155 per pensioner. I am speaking about Canada's new government's promise to double the pension income amount to $2,000. We would also take about 85,000 of those same pensioners off the tax rolls. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our seniors who would benefit from Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2202513,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2202513&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-305</A> live near our borders, so they, and Canadians, want safer streets. We want to protect Canadian families and communities, to secure our borders, and to increase our preparedness to address public health threats.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as important for seniors to feel safe and secure in their homes and their communities as much as it is for them to feel tax relief. Canada's new government has introduced a number of measures in this House to tackle crime, including mandatory sentencing and house arrest to name a few.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One very important feature of making our streets safer is the commitment made in budget 2006. The budget earmarks funds giving the RCMP the tools and people it needs to strengthen its federal policing role. Budget 2006 includes $26 million to give victims a more effective voice in the federal corrections and justice system, and to give victims greater access to services. In every riding in our country, seniors have been victims in criminal acts. This funding would help ensure that they have a voice in our justice system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an organization called Grand-PARENTING AGAIN Canada which was formed for grandparents across the country who, for one reason or another, become caregivers to their grandchildren. It happens across the country, not always for great reasons but it happens.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155">(1155)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed bill, along with the universal child care supplement, will help grandparents who face the tough issue of bringing up their grandchildren. With over 23,500 seniors in my riding, any time I have the opportunity to stand and promote a bill that has their interests at heart, I will not hesitate to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue dealt with in the bill is an important one, as are all issues that relate to the taxation of retirees. Once again, I commend the hon. member for his commitment to seniors and retired Canadians and certainly wish him every success with the bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to add one final note. If everyone recalls the movie that starred Tom Cruise called <i>Jerry McGuire</i>, at one point actress Renée Zellweger, responded to a long speech by Tom Cruise, said, “You had me at hello”. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78387,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78387&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Markham—Unionville</A> had me at hello, except that he went on to speak against all the tax advantages that were given to seniors with respect to GST and tax credits in the budget, which disappointed me. I am glad he is supporting it, but he only needed to speak about half as long as he did. I think we all would have been happier on this side of the House.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out a few honourable mentions. Of course my colleague, the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78511,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78511&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Chatham-Kent—Essex</A>, is the seconder of the bill. I want to commend the hard work especially by the New Democrat members for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78884,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78884&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor West</A>. Before I came to the House, they took up this battle from the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78865,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78865&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Calgary Southeast</A>, who was one of the original sponsors of the bill in a couple of forms before that. The official opposition today has seen fit to ensure that this at least gets to committee for some study.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of that, I want to move this debate away from the issue of tax fairness, of which we have heard an awful lot, to what this issue really is about, and that is tax justice. In committee we have an opportunity to finally move the debate to this issue. It needs to be started by first acknowledging that an injustice was committed January 1, 1996, when the tax rules changed for a number of Canadian seniors who collected the U.S. social security pension after retirement. That changed their entire retirement assumptions, the money they had available for living out their years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many wound up extremely bitter. To this day, those who survive, fewer in number and many stricken with ailments, are still very bitter about this. They long for the day when all parties acknowledge in the House that an injustice was committed with respect to taxation. Those who retired after the rule changed have not experienced the same injustice. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the bill asks for an across the board lowering of the inclusion rate. I hope the committee will come up with a real solution which would achieve a grandfathering for seniors who were originally affected after retirement. The bill hopes to address that. Perhaps the committee could hear testimony and attain the desired wording for the change to achieve that. This will send a clear signal if we can achieve a result like this in committee and beyond, and that being the fact that the House is concerned with tax justice for seniors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude with a very humble thanks to all hon. members in the House for their support for the bill. This is indeed, as I stated in my opening comments, a great day for Canadian seniors. It will be a better day when the change is finally passed, whether as a budget item, or by this bill or by whatever means, to address the tax injustice. That will indeed be the greatest day for seniors in Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome all who are present today to discuss Canada's clean air act, understanding that our commitment to a better future for all Canadians is unwavering.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment is a sacred trust, bestowed on us by our ancestors to embrace and preserve for our country's future. Canada's new government intends to uphold this responsibility, which is why it is important that consideration of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, Canada's clean air act, begin as soon as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment is a concern to all of us. Greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants transcend borders and affect the health, environment and well-being of all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since taking office, our government has undertaken a number of important environmental initiatives. These include: action to reduce the release of mercury into our surroundings; reductions to the release of toxic substances from base metal smelters; new tax incentives for the banking of environmentally sensitive lands; funding for the development of renewable fuels; and the introduction of new infrastructure funding dedicated to public transit, as well as tax credits for the people who use public transportation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition has criticized Canada's clean air act, but have yet to identify one single clause in the act with which they disagree. Instead, the opposition has introduced two private members' bills that ignore the issue of targeting air pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, after decades of neglecting air pollution, the state of the environment this government has inherited from the newly elected Leader of the Opposition jeopardizes the health of every Canadian, but especially the most vulnerable in our society, our children and seniors, who suffer disproportionately from smog, poor air quality and environmental hazards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government shares the concerns of Canadians about the environment and the quality of the air that we breathe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing only greenhouse gases is not enough. We must also address air pollution. Poor air quality is not a minor irritant to be endured, but a serious health issue that poses an increasing risk to the well-being of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Canada's clean air act is the first legislation to address both air pollution and greenhouse gases in an integrated fashion. Greenhouse gas emissions degrade Canada's natural landscape and pose an imminent threat to our economic prosperity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's clean air act represents real, concrete action to achieve results through mandatory, strict regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sharply focusing our efforts on addressing the greatest threats to the health and well-being of Canadians. We need tough pollution regulations that measurably reduce asthma, chronic bronchitis and lung cancer by improving both indoor and outdoor air quality. This is why our government will take unprecedented action to regulate indoor air pollution, the second highest cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's clean air act is the first legislation to recognize that most sources of air pollutants are also sources of greenhouse gases and they must be addressed together. Canada's clean air act proposes a comprehensive set of amendments to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, to the Energy Efficiency Act and the Motor Vehicle Consumption Standards Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's clean air act contains crucial new provisions that will expand the powers of the federal government to address the existing inefficient voluntary standards and move to strict enforceable regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By strengthening and bringing more accountability to our existing laws, Canada's clean air act requires the Ministers of the Environment and Health to: establish, monitor and report on new national air quality objectives tied to the health of Canadians; report to Parliament on the effectiveness and the progress of our programs; and move from voluntary to mandatory, enforceable regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's clean air act is needed to ensure that renewable fuel requirements can be implemented in an efficient and effective manner to provide cleaner fuels for our cars. A biofuels industry will lead to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and unprecedented economic opportunities for Canada's agricultural industry.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210">(1210)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is also consulting on options surrounding an emissions trading regime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why the government, through Canada's clean air act, is consulting on options that allow trading and that align our compliance regimes to support the implementation of a trading system that results in the lowest cost opportunities for emissions reductions for industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been clear that any trading system must be market driven, not subsidized by taxpayer dollars. Unlike previous governments, our government will not purchase credits or create an artificial trading market subsidized by taxpayer dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second key difference in our approach on clean air lies in our focus on mandatory, strict regulations. Past governments relied on voluntary measures, satisfied that industry could set its own standards. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment commissioner confirmed that this is not acceptable or workable and condemned the former environment minister, the newly elected <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A>, by stating that the measures were “not up to the task of meeting the Kyoto obligations”. She went on to say that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A>'s efforts were inadequate, lacked accountability, and would have never reduced greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324119"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians will be glad to know that those days are over. From now on, all industry sectors, including the auto sector, will have mandatory requirements, and we will enforce those requirements. Our plan puts the health of Canadians and the health of our environment first.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any polluters that go over their air pollution targets will be fined and all money will go toward an environmental damages fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have an ambitious long term target aimed at absolute reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, up to 65% by 2050, as recommended by the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous government signed and ratified the Kyoto protocol without an implementation plan to achieve results. That inaction and those empty promises have left Canadians with a 35% increase in greenhouse gas emissions above the targets set by the Liberals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must move beyond the arbitrary and unattainable targets set by the Liberals and work together at setting achievable targets. We must lead the world by example and show them that through government cooperation with industry we can make vast improvements for the health of Canadians and the health of the planet while still maintaining one of the most robust economies in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By spring 2007, the government will announce short term targets for air pollution and greenhouse gases, and industry will have to meet these regulations within four years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach also encourages technological change. Technology plays an essential role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and provides us with huge economic opportunities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also introduce mechanisms to encourage and facilitate investment in new technology, but we will not use a carbon tax, because the only people who end up paying are Canadian taxpayers and we think that they have paid enough through their health. Under a Conservative government, it will only be the polluter that will pay.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any industry that goes over its greenhouse gas limits will have the option of paying into a Canadian technology fund to comply with the regulation. The money paid into the fund will be reinvested in technology to reduce greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third key difference in our approach on clean air is that we are taking action right here in Canada. Canadians will be able to hold our government and industry accountable for achieving results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be accountable to Canadians by reporting on our progress in a public annual air quality report and we will be held accountable through measurable outcomes linked to the health of Canadians. We will also be accountable to Parliament by mandatory annual reporting to Parliament on our actions and their effectiveness to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest assured that Canada will continue to be a constructive player in global efforts to address climate change, but we need to clean up our own backyard and set an example for the rest of the world. We will set an example by leading here at home and we do not plan to do this by purchasing international climate change credits to meet unachievable targets as a substitute for a concrete regulatory agenda to reduce Canada's own emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has charted a fundamentally new course on the environment. Canada's clean air act and Canada's clean air regulatory agenda will set strict, enforceable regulations that will result in concrete, realistic action to protect the health of Canadians and the environment for generations to come.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the questions, one of the challenges with this particular bill is of course its deliberate confusion between issues concerning air pollution and issues concerning greenhouse gases. The minister used the phrase that “the greatest threat to the health of Canadians is asthma”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I submit that the greatest threat to the health of Canadians is in fact the destruction of the planet by global warming, so my first question to the minister is this: which is the greater threat to the future of humanity, pollution or greenhouse gases global warming? </div>
    </p><a name="Para324135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, why is there no reference to Kyoto in either the bill or the notice of intent to regulate? Why is that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the minister has returned from Nairobi but insists that we will not purchase international credits or be involved in any kind of international mechanisms, and yet she was present for discussions on such things as the international emissions trading system and the clean development mechanism as well. Why is there no recognition of the process she was involved in?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, why is it that we have to deal with where the short term targets for greenhouse gas emissions are? By that I mean, what does she hope to have achieved by 2012?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, if she will not have a carbon tax, will she at least accept a cap and trade system which will create that domestic and international market that will allow polluters of all sorts to improve?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, is it accurate for the minister to say that there were no regulated measures when the large final emitters were going to be forced by regulation to reduce by 2008?</div>

Rona Ambrose</A>: </b><span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1811009"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_left.gif" border="0" alt="previous intervention"></a></span>&nbsp;<span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-1811143"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_right.gif" border="0" alt="next intervention"></a></span></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, all of the hon. member's questions raise exactly the point as to why we should get this bill to a legislative committee as quickly as possible to address these issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would submit to him that we should not have to choose between regulating air pollution and regulating greenhouse gases. What we have learned from other jurisdictions and from the measures put in place by the last government is that it is not enough. We did not go far enough. We definitely did not go far enough when it comes to air pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know now that taking an integrated approach to addressing both of these issues is key to the health of Canadians and key to the health of our environment, because one technology to reduce greenhouse gases may in fact result in increased air pollution, and vice versa, depending on fuel choices and many other related issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of Kyoto, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> is a piece of domestic legislation so that Canada can finally make emissions reductions here at home. Obviously the discussion at the committee will involve whether or not this legislation is going to contribute to our overall Kyoto compliance and how, but what I will say is that we can finally say something positive to the international community, and we did deliver this positive message in Nairobi, which is that because Canada is finally moving toward mandatory, regulated emissions reductions, we will be able to make a contribution to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gases. We also delivered the message to the international community that we will also be reducing air pollution, which is obviously a priority for all of the member countries as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in Nairobi, Canada was one of over 162 countries that led us to a consensus, and the consensus was that the Kyoto protocol needs to undergo a review. Canada supports a review of the Kyoto protocol to make sure that as we move forward to the next compliance period we make sure that we do not make the mistakes that were made previously. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also introduced strong accountability frameworks around some of the international programs that the member raises. Again, the member needs to make a distinction between taxpayer funded programs and programs that are market driven. The Kyoto protocol has some mechanisms that are supposed to be used by the market, but the previous government was using taxpayers' dollars to invest in those projects. We believe that if it is industry led, that is fine. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that under the Liberal plan the taxpayer was paying and under the Conservative plan the polluter will pay. That is the substantial difference. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On short term targets, I welcome input from all parties leading up to January and through our legislative committee to help us set short term targets that are achievable and that will not ruin our economy but will instead encourage our economy to make a transformation into a green economy. I would thank the member for whatever he would like to add to the committee.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is our approach? The role of the official opposition is to be responsible and take action based on principles. Our role is to identify—together with the other opposition parties, the government and the environmental NGOs— practical solutions that will improve this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not insisting on the fact that this bill is a Liberal initiative so that we can take all the credit. That is not how we do things. What we will insist on is that this bill be the best possible bill for the environment, for Canadians, especially with regard to the fight against global warming. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para324151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is at stake here in this bill is nothing less than the greatest challenge facing humanity today, the first order of business: dealing with global warming. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position since the government first introduced the bill has taken the following lines. First, that this bill is not necessary and that the Canadian Environmental Protection Act contained all the necessary power to combat climate change and, indeed, air pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, which I think was demonstrated by the minister's speech, with all respect, that to bring the two elements together is deliberately confusing. Air pollution and climate change are not the same thing. They can be linked and they can be related but they frequently and most often require different strategies and different solutions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change is primary, a precondition for every other policy that any government would want to bring forward. If we do not deal with it first and foremost, we will not get around to the rest of it, whether it is air pollution or anything else that the government might bring forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third criticism is that this bill is not Kyoto compliant nor is it even Kyoto relevant. There is no reference in the bill or the notice of intent to regulate to Kyoto standards. It is important to consider the bill and the notice of intent to regulate as a package.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there are no short term goals for greenhouse gas reductions. We are not talking intensity. We are talking reductions. There is no reference to Kyoto's first implementation period of 2008 to 2012. There are no regulations for greenhouse gases coming into force before 2010, unlike project green which saw regulations, not voluntary measures, coming into place for large final emitters by 2008.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point is that goals for greenhouse gas reductions in the medium and long term are not ambitious enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth point is that the bill, as written, actually weakens the Canadian Environmental Protection Act by creating unnecessary and ambiguous alternate lists for greenhouse gases and air pollutants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point is that the provincial equivalency agreements are not as strong in the proposed bill as they are currently under CEPA.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our original intent was to vote against the bill at second reading since we could not accept its fundamental principles or the accompanying notice of intent to regulate. Our current intention, now that the bill is at first reading and can be amended, is to produce amendments which meet our original criticisms, as I have outlined, and work with the government, opposition parties and environmental groups to produce a serious piece of legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not today speak to the air pollution sections because we can work to improve those sections. However, air pollution is not where the problems lie.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by simply suggesting the key deletions that need to be made to this bill. First, the changes that weaken the provincial equivalency provisions of CEPA and, second, the creation of unnecessary new categories of greenhouse gases and air pollutants and the parallel regulatory authorities created along with those categories that put the federal power to regulate these substances at risk.</div>

Canada's climate policy must be guided by the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada needs to commit to doing its fair share to combat this global problem.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more detail, we need some sectoral amendments. For heavy industry, we need an amendment requiring the governor in council to limit greenhouse gas emissions from heavy industry through regulations that take effect no later than January 1, 2008 for the period 2008 to 2012. The amendment must include a hard cap on emissions that impose a Kyoto target on heavy industry. This means working toward a reduction to 6% below industry's 1990 emission levels for all final emitters. We need an auction of permits with the option of revenue recycling for economic efficiency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need a linkage to other Kyoto compliant emissions trading systems. For vehicles, we need an amendment that would require the governor in council to impose regulated vehicle emission standards set to match or exceed the California vehicle standards, with those regulations coming into force for the 2009 model year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On energy efficiency, a preamble should be added to the Energy Efficiency Act that supports setting continuous economy-wide improvement targets in energy efficiency in Canada, with two new sections to be added to the Energy Efficiency Act. First: the governor in council would be required to prescribe energy efficiency standards for all energy using products that are responsible for significant or growing energy consumption in Canada. Second, the governor in council would be required to review all energy efficiency standards within three years after they were introduced or amended and every third year thereafter. Through this review, every energy efficiency standard must be made to meet or exceed the most stringent levels found in North America.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of governance, we need a budgetary policy that would require the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> to table an analysis of the projected greenhouse gas impacts of the Government of Canada's budgetary policy, disaggregated by measure, at the same time that the minister tables the annual budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we need the creation of an emissions reduction agency that would draw on the model of the California air resources board and create an arm's length agency responsible for climate research, regulation and the development of science based, interim, greenhouse gas targets for Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. First, to suggest that it just sat on the shelf is inaccurate.

    </p><a name="Para324180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole point is that we are using this act by adding in greenhouse gases to the list of toxins, which the previous government did.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been waiting a long time for the Conservative government to tell us what it plans to do to fight climate change and smog. We waited a long time because up to now, the policies of the Conservative Party, a political party on the verge of taking power more than a year ago, had nothing to offer in terms of measures or an effective plan to respect Canada's commitments under the Kyoto protocol signed in that Japanese city in 1997.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us here today is a far cry from what we were expecting. First of all, we were expecting a plan and a bill that would integrate the targets for greenhouse gas reductions set out by the Kyoto protocol, especially during the first phase of reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Similar to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2181701,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2181701&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-288</A>, which is currently in committee, we were expecting this bill to include a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between 2008 and 2012, compared to 1990 rates.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also contains nothing about the second phase of reductions or the government's intentions. The only target the government is proposing here today to fight climate change is a target somewhere between 45% and 65% in greenhouse gas reductions by 2050, as though we can continue to produce greenhouse gases without worrying about short-, medium- and long-term targets for reductions. This is no different than presenting a business plan to a board of directors of a private company—and I wonder what the government would do—with no short- or medium-term goals, but only one objective for 2050.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I think that board of directors would send its managers back to do their homework, so that they could present a realistic plan that respects the international commitments signed by Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does the bill set a target for 2050, but the reference level for this 45% to 65% reduction in emissions is 2003, rather than 1990 as set out by Kyoto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean in reality? It means that we will start calculating the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2003, as if nothing happened in the provinces or certain industrial sectors before 2003. Yet the Province of Quebec—sadly, we are just a province, even though we are now a nation—is one of the first provinces to have tabled a plan to fight climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec is prepared to comply with greenhouse gas reduction targets that use 1990 as the reference year. But the government is proposing 2003 as the reference year, as if it were possible to emit more greenhouse gas before 2003. In addition, this bill does not provide for offsetting credits for industrial sectors that have reduced their emissions in relation to 1990 levels. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill therefore does not comply with the international commitments signed by Canada. In introducing Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, Canada has flip-flopped on its international environmental commitments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has also decided to set aside something that is vital to Quebec: the principle of equity. Past efforts by the provinces and territories and by industries should be recognized under the government's bill, yet there is nothing in the bill that does this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are expecting major efforts in transportation, an important sector in Quebec. What is the government proposing? Essentially, it is telling us that the voluntary approach that the government has agreed on with the auto industry can continue on its merry way until 2011. After 2011, the government will consider regulations based not on the most effective criteria and standards in North America—those in California—but on standards comparable to those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have decided, in terms of automobile manufacturing standards, to use lower benchmarks, and thus lower the standards, when Canada should be using its regulations to raise them. Worse yet, we learned just this morning that the government will have two systems for the industrial sectors: one that will be based on the intensity of emissions and another on the absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been decided in Canada to spare the oil and gas industry at the expense of the industrial sectors that have made some efforts in the past. This is the second unfair factor: after the territorial aspect, or the non-recognition of the efforts made by Quebec since 1990, this is unfair to the industrial sector, in that Canada's oil industry is being spared.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed in favour of referring Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> to committee, but we believe that fundamental improvements need to be made to this bill. Recognition of the Kyoto targets, especially in the first phase, must be seen in the very essence and spirit, the principle and preamble of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need stronger commitments and an immediate plan that will allow us to take action in the second phase of greenhouse gas emissions reduction, a year from now, in Bali, when the international community will begin to reflect on the system that should be applied in this second phase. The only debate we are having in this House is on the reduction objective for 2050.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say again: if executives were to present this plan to a board of directors, they would be sent back to the drawing board to come up with reduction targets for the short, medium and long terms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by addressing a major aspect that we will defend in the parliamentary committee: this principle of acknowledging the territorial approach. We have not, thus far, been able to achieve our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets because the proposed plans require reduction from coast to coast and Canada's economic structure differs from one province to another, while Quebec's energy policy also differs from those of the other provinces. </div>

    </p><a name="Para324213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start, there must be a two-pronged approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. First, there is energy efficiency. The Conservative government's decision to abolish the EnerGuide program makes us realize that it does not believe in energy efficiency as a powerful means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. Second, any program to fight climate change must include a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the source. In my opinion, those are the two components of a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we need a policy to help meet the challenge of adapting to climate change. It is not just developing countries that must adapt to climate change. What is happening in northern Quebec and in the Canadian north will require a strict and vigorous policy in the next few years in order to avoid the small catastrophe of today from becoming a more significant catastrophe tomorrow, and to prevent us from having to invest public money in infrastructure. Thus, we must adapt to climate change starting now. This is becoming increasingly vital.</div>

    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para324220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the David Suzuki Foundation and the Pembina Institute said, climate change is set to become one of the defining issues of the century. I believe that climate change must become the defining issue of this Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, we found ourselves at an impasse on taking action on the environment. Our party proposed a strategy to break through that logjam. As a result, we are now debating the creation of a special and new approach to handling issues in Parliament where there are differences of opinion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an exciting day for this Parliament. It is an opportunity to actually make the House of Commons work for Canadians as its top priority. It is an opportunity to produce results which were frankly not going to be forthcoming. It is an opportunity for us to put forward our best ideas as political parties, to take the knowledge of Canadians, to take the work they have done for years and to bring it forward to the House of Commons into a special place, a special committee, and to work together to craft a way forward on the most fundamental issue of our time. It is vitally important that the House of Commons succeed in this effort and succeed rapidly. It will require a certain new spirit.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para324223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an attitude we are used to seeing here in the House of Commons. We have had all kinds of debates. We are different and we emphasize our differences, but what we must do now is find common ground so that we can reach common goals: a safe and healthy planet, sustainable development and reduction of our currently disastrous impact on the environment.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para324224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us think about the consequences of climate change today. We are literally changing the atmosphere of the planet. As a result of that, we are transforming the flow of energy on a planetary basis not only in the atmosphere but when it comes also to the seas and the oceans. Fundamental changes are happening because of the way in which we are walking on the planet or should I say: tromping on the planet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time we recognized that. The deniers are still there. We still hear them suggesting that indeed there is no problem with greenhouse gas emissions, but I believe that we have achieved, at the level of world science and world public opinion, a level of understanding of this issue which is unprecedented probably for any environmental issue ever to face humankind, maybe for any issue at all, with the possible exception of the devastating consequences of nuclear war. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference here is that we have an opportunity to actually set things right, but we have to move very quickly. We are facing global warming and we are seeing the consequences nowhere more than in Canada's north. We are facing a concept one could call global storming: the increase in devastating, powerful storms around the world. Of course this was predicted. The naysayers said it was just the weather and we should get over it. The fact is that we are transforming the weather of this planet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this book called <i>The Weather Makers</i> was the first book, the first piece of writing, that I gave to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> at our first meeting after the election. I asked him to read it for our children and our grandchildren, and because it sets out in a very powerful way the transformations that are under way. I would like to quote just one of the many examples Professor Flannery, the author of that book, cited. He said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are devastating predictions and they are not the predictions of an individual. They are predictions of the best minds on the planet. The question is: Are we going to listen to them and do something about it? The good news is that even faced with droughts and flooding that are already affecting working families and the record fires that are burning across our country, there is still time to change the course that we are following now, a course that is actually beginning to affect ordinary families today. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about those who are facing the loss of their jobs as a result of forest fires and the impact of new diseases and pests on the forests. Think of those in the far north whose very livelihood, whose way of life, whose fundamentals as a culture and as a society are being undermined by climate change. These are ordinary families. Think of those suffering pollution, having to rely on puffers evermore in our polluted cities. All of our citizens are beginning to experience the impact of climate change and that is why we need to take action and take it now. This Parliament needs to move quickly.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, as we saw from our very own Commissioner of the Environment here in Canada, the results did not match the intentions.

    </p><a name="Para324247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we are also faced with the sad fact that throughout that entire period, the current government's members tended to oppose taking any action at all on climate change, so it really is going to require a sea of change in this place, of all parties, to begin to get it right.</div>

Of course, some of them were ones that for years the NDP called for.

This is a sorry state of affairs, which is only exceeded in the embarrassment by the fact that the United States of America under George Bush was able to do better than us here in Canada under the previous government.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been an increase over the past few decades of certain diseases affecting Canadians. It is a well-known fact that the prevalence of asthma among children has increased over the years. According to the 1996-97 national population health survey, over 2.2 million Canadians have been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease afflict over 3.7 million Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing problems are not the only thing we should be concerned about. Air pollution also affects the heart. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for 40% of all mortality in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particular indoor air pollutant is radon, which occurs naturally in the ground in many areas of Canada, particularly northern Canada. This is an air pollutant for which this government is planning immediate action. Radon is the largest source of radioactive exposure to Canadians. New scientific evidence demonstrates an elevated risk of levels of radon found in many Canadian homes. Exposure to radon accounts for 1,900 lung cancer deaths every year in Canada and is second only to tobacco smoke as the primary cause of lung cancer. </div>

I hope we are not moving against what he is saying. My understanding of the bill and of our government's policy is that we are moving simultaneously to deal with greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution issues at the same time. It will take a number of important new techniques, such as carbon sequestration and other techniques, to deal with the emissions part of the solution.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the hon. member is suggesting that we should move ahead on both fronts simultaneously, I am in absolute agreement with him. It is absolutely important to do both.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said to the hon. member earlier, that is the kind of leadership that Canada can show, that we do not necessarily have to do just one thing, that we can as a nation walk and chew gun at the same time, that we can deal with both issues simultaneously and therefore deliver better results for the quality of health of Canadians.</div>

I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on this issue because Canadians in my riding and around the country realize the urgency and the need to increase our focus in addressing this matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some of my colleagues in the Conservative Party still want to debate the reality of global warming and its impact on our future and the future of the next generations, Canadians recognize the seriousness of global warming and its consequences on our lifestyle, living standards and the health of our planet. Canadians are telling us and the government that we cannot ignore this issue. We cannot just wish that it is not happening. The government has the responsibility to act responsibly and expeditiously in cooperation with countries around the world to manage this disturbing trend of increased greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, as it stands right now, is a disaster and is a miserable failure that has let Canadians down. It reflects a lack of seriousness on behalf of the Conservatives to acknowledge and act upon the real environmental concerns we all have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill proposes unnecessary changes to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, just for the sake of creating a perception that action is being taken while real measures are absent. The existing act actually provides the government with the necessary authority to regulate pollutants and emissions. The new proposals add no substantive power that did not already exist. What is desperately needed is real movement and real caps. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new proposals are consistent with the Conservatives' mode of governing: showcase gimmicks and underestimate the intelligence of Canadians that they will be unable to see through these transparent and cynical moves. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and his Conservative colleagues are allowing ideology to trump science and common sense. Instead of proposing a real actionable plan to address the environmental challenges we are facing, they are undermining most efforts that were implemented over the last few years. Instead of demonstrating true leadership and offering tangible measures, they are risking the health of our planet and its inhabitants through delay tactics and phony slogans.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They abandoned Kyoto, a well respected international treaty that is the product of 160 countries coming together and working together to confront this global problem. Environmental trends and changes do not recognize political borders. They affect everyone who inhabits this planet. It took a lot of energy and commitment to negotiate such a historic treaty and bring countries, with various challenges and political ideologies, together to agree on a set of goals. It was disheartening that one of the first actions the government undertook in its first 100 days in office was to undermine Canada's commitment to Kyoto and its goals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to give the impression that addressing the environmental challenges we are facing is simple or easy. We all know that any plan will require true leadership and tough decisions. That is what Canadians expect of their government. All the minority Conservative government is doing is blaming others, coming up with excuses and trying to distract Canadians from the real issue. If Canadians wanted a government that deflected all responsibilities, blamed others and offered no real vision, they would have been better off with the NDP. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the environment, why is the government following a cut and run strategy? When will the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> accept his responsibilities in outlining and implementing a real and substantive plan for the protection of our environment and the future of Canadians? We want measures that would have an impact on the short, medium and long term, not proposals that start real caps on emissions by 2050. Canadians expect action immediately.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to be thoughtful in any additional measures we implement, but by delaying real caps until 2050, I am worried we are sending the wrong signal. If future governments follow the precedent of delaying targets, it is very likely that in 2050 we will realize that we are still facing the same challenges and are not ready to meet these goals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disheartening thing is that the Conservatives are not only refusing to take quick action, but are dismantling dozens of programs and initiatives that were created by the previous government, which offered incentives and opportunities for real measures. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EnerGuide, for example, was a program that helped more than 70,000 households to be retrofitted, to be energy efficient and to reduce energy consumption. What did the Conservatives do? They cancelled that program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six million Canadians have participated in reducing their energy consumption through the one tonne challenge program. What did the Conservatives do? They cancelled that program. Greenhouse gas intensity was reduced by 13% below 1990 standards and has showed a declining trend since the mid 1990s. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to stand here today, after my party has elected a leader who has shown a real commitment to the environment and the future health of Canada and Canadians. I am confident, under his leadership, that the Liberals will continue to promote what Canadians want to see from their government, real action and a real plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a lot of work ahead of us in examining the bill. It is clear that it needs much work and a lot of improvement, but we are committed to working beyond partisanship with whoever is serious about putting together effective legislation that would offer tangible measures to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions in the short term and set goals for the near and long term future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pledge to the House, on behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Liberal Party, that we will be relentless in ensuring the government is held to account and responds to the needs of Canadians and the future of our planet. We cannot let Canadians down.</div>

Based on our observations, however, these are not new regulatory powers that the government plans to grant itself, because they already exist in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The bill would also amend the Energy Efficiency Act. We find it strange that this amendment is being introduced after the EnerGuide program was eliminated. The third part of the bill would amend the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois currently supports sending this bill to committee before second reading. In our view, the amendments proposed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> are unnecessary. They would only slow down the process of taking concrete action against climate change. This is simply a delay.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is also accompanied by a notice of intent, which lists the regulations the government intends to adopt over the next few years and the deadlines it has set for doing so. This document shows that the government is starting from scratch and beginning a new round of consultations in three phases leading to new standard that would not be mandatory until 2010.</div>

It practically means the end of the Kyoto protocol objectives. The bill would incorporate into the Canadian Environmental Protection Act the statement that respecting Canada's international commitments on the environment is a matter of government discretion. We agree with referring the bill to committee before second reading because that will give us the latitude we need to consider the admissibility of amendments to this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will work in good faith in this committee, but the Bloc Québécois will make no compromises because respecting the Kyoto protocol targets is what is important. We will also present amendments to address the fairness of the polluter-pay rule, Canada's respect for its international commitments and, most of all, the urgent need for action to fight climate change. I want to remind hon. members that the Bloc's priority is still Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2181701,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2181701&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-288</A>, which clearly respects the Kyoto protocol objectives and for which the legislative agenda is controlled by the opposition and not by our government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to past investments by the administrators at Hydro-Québec in the area of hydroelectricity, Quebec has a non-polluting electricity production network. Quebec's plan mainly targets transportation and pollution reduction in certain industries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as transportation is concerned, the bill would amend the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act to create the regulatory power to impose mandatory vehicle consumption standards on the industry by 2011, after the voluntary agreement expires. This does not seem soon enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has announced that Environment Canada and Health Canada also intend to hold detailed consultations with the provinces and industry starting in the fall. This consultation is late. It is planned in three major phases: the first will end in 2007, the second in 2008 and the third in 2010. Therefore, no regulation will come into effect before 2010.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important to the Bloc Québécois is that targets are established. These targets are in our report on the evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335">(1335)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004, production of greenhouse gases in Quebec was about 12 tonnes per person, or half the average rate of production of 24 tonnes per Canadian. As for the other provinces, per capita emissions totalled almost 69 tonnes in Saskatchewan and 73 tonnes in Alberta, or five to six times greater than in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we compare increases between 1990 and 2004, we note that Quebec emissions have risen by 6% since 1990, compared to 39.4% for Alberta and 61.7% for Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying earlier, opting for hydroelectric energy certainly was a significant factor in Quebec's enviable performance. However, the collective choices made by its citizens, industries and the National Assembly also made it possible to achieve these results. The Quebec pulp and paper industry alone reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 18% between 1990 and 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excellent performance of the Quebec manufacturing sector also made a substantial contribution to Quebec's positive results. Between 1990 and 2003, this sector reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 6.8% and emissions arising from industrial processes by more than 15%. These reductions were made possible by significant strategic investments by Quebec companies in innovative technologies allowing them to improve their processes and their energy efficiency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78760,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78760&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A> refuses to acknowledge the efforts made by Quebec or the value of the Quebec plan. It was again obvious in Nairobi, where she failed to mention Quebec's green plan in her official speech to the international community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than revise its international obligations by calling the Kyoto protocol into question, the Conservative government must implement the climate change action plan. That was the Bloc Québécois' proposal, founded on the very important principles of equality and polluter pays. With respect to the polluter pays principle, studies have been done on Canada's emissions and it is generally accepted that responsibility for reducing emissions should be shared non-proportionally based on population or gross domestic product. It should be shared by the provinces and the territories. The Bloc Québécois is proposing a three-part approach to distribute the burden across Canada and give each province quotas to comply with.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Union succeeded in reaching an agreement on distributing greenhouse gas emissions among 15 European countries. The negotiations took two years to achieve concrete results. Each country has its own targets to reach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, negotiations went on for almost five years and were suspended. We have not yet reached a compromise on distributing responsibility among the provinces and territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this three-part approach, Quebec's goal would be 0% relative to 1990 levels. The province could therefore simply address its 6% increase since 1990 to reach its goal: 1990 production levels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other provinces' goals are much higher because of their energy choices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, over the next few weeks, the Bloc Québécois will propose amendments to this bill.</div>

It does not rest with the smaller units. It rests with the larger units. That is what Kyoto was all about: recognizing that we had a problem that was global in nature.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the member across to say that the choices provinces made about their energy systems were choices is somewhat misleading, I think, because mostly in Canada we have set patterns of energy use that go back decades, long before Kyoto was an issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member across not agree that solutions to climate change are global in nature? Second, does he not agree that solving those issues is going to require inspired leadership in all parts of this country, not simply having provinces meeting minimum requirements but taking leadership where they have the ability to do so? As for Quebec, its position with hydroelectric power and the opportunities to provide that leadership, would he not see that as a better role for Quebec in this issue?</div>

    </p><a name="Para324347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did mention that the territorial breakdown must be equitable. The nation of Quebec invested a great deal in the past in hydroelectricity and went into debt, and it now has an appreciable investment in hydro power. It made an investment and is paying off that debt, with the result that Quebeckers may pay slightly more tax than in the other provinces. Equity is therefore important, and so is the polluter-pays principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that a polluter that emits 69 tonnes per person has to invest more to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions than a polluter that produces only 12 tonnes. This is only reasonable: the polluter will pay, especially since the polluter got rich in its province, instead of merely paying off its debt, as I said earlier, like Hydro-Québec, which has to amortize its payments over 20 or 50 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important to say that polluters today have to keep in mind that they also have to pay out of their own pockets for the damage they cause.</div>

It is a bill that is deeply flawed and has been discredited across the environmental sector and in other parts of our communities, because as members in the House join the daily gathering of question period, it speaks to the partisan nature that for far too long has overridden all good and sensible conduct when it comes to our environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians tune in to watch what has become the daily spectacle of question period and the partisan approach that seems necessary to attract attention to any given issue of the day, they despair. They despair because partisan politics have overridden the commonsensical approach, particularly to things like climate change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a necessity to look at the context and the history of what has happened in the debate and in the actions of the Canadian government over the last 15 to 20 years as this issue has grown in importance and context throughout the world. As country after country has taken on this issue with seriousness and determination, why has Canada continued to fall further and further to the back of the field?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw a number of plans under the previous regimes. The Liberals came up with the so-called action plan 2000 that was anything but action. There was a climate change plan for Canada in 2002 that was nothing of the sort, with no plan and still no action. Finally, in 2005 there was project green, which the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development herself said was not enough to get us there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, I believe that Canadians have been out in front of the politicians consistently, year in and year out, demanding more from us, demanding a sense of leadership rather than partisan debate and the small inaccurate steps taken by regime after regime, previously by the Liberals and now by the Conservatives, when it comes to what is now being represented as the most pressing issue, certainly environmentally, and perhaps it is the most pressing issue of all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the NDP and the other opposition parties first looked at the bill the Conservatives proposed, they found it wanting. It lacks principles and is thus impossible to support in principle. For those who are watching and just coming to this debate, I will note that when a bill gets passed through this House on second reading, it means that the House has agreed to the bill in its principles, in its very nature, and then wishes to tweak and alter some of those parts of the bill which can be altered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the process that we New Democrats proposed and which the other parties agreed to was, without any such agreement, to take this bill and to have the opportunity to change its very DNA, to change the very structure of what is being proposed for Canada's environment and Canada's economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said, Kyoto is more an economic pact than an environmental one. It asks the world to consider and bring about changes to the way we earn money, to the way we drive our economies, particularly when it comes to the energy sector, and to look at new ways that are necessary for the very survival of our planet, for continuing a prosperous planet and, in this country, a prosperous national economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have been demanding and expecting leadership on this issue, but in budget after budget and government after government they have seen otherwise. They have seen short term, nearsighted thinking. It is time that Canadians got what they truly deserve, which is leadership when it comes to the environment and leadership when it comes to restructuring our economy and our energy sectors to a place where we can all be proud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I was at the Nairobi summit, the United Nations meeting on climate change. Canada consistently won the fossil award, the award given to the country doing the least to promote global efforts on climate change. We won more fossil awards than all the other countries put together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were consistent in one thing: holding back the talks and holding back progress across our planet. China, India, Australia, France and Britain were all coming forward with solid and credible plans and there we were, the Canadians, once proud of our environmental record, with our delegates scurrying around the halls in Nairobi in shame because we could not bring forward a viable plan. What was suggested in the so-called clean air act was not enough. It was a delayed plan. It was long term. It left too much power in the hands of a few politicians rather than in the will of this Parliament. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many suggestions that New Democrats brought forward was to return the power to the people who are actually elected to represent the will and the intentions of Canadians, because we know that this will and those intentions are to do something serious about climate change, change that we are experiencing already.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, essentially the auditor, is meant to look over Canada's plans and actions for a whole series of environmental initiatives. She looked at what the previous Liberal regime had proposed. Six billion dollars had been announced for this.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At its base, if we do not have the capacity to track, to monitor, to understand what is effective and what is not, how can we possibly make the proposed changes that we claim or hope to make? It simply cannot be done if we do not have the ability to monitor, to track, or to understand what is being done. The elected officials in this place, elected from across the country, do not have the ability to properly or accurately understand the situation until the dust has settled and the confetti has dropped out of the sky. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know for a fact that the actual numbers that matter most on this issue are in regard to the increase in greenhouse gases in our environment. They went up by 27%, but we know that the goal, the stated claim and the signature that we put down on the Kyoto protocol indicated that Canada had the intention of dropping emissions by 6%. Lo and behold, as the numbers have come in and as the tests prove, we failed as Canadians when the Liberal government, year in and year out, failed to deliver. We needed more and Canadians demanded more. They expected leadership. They want leadership. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what is proposed in the Conservative bill. The Conservatives propose a number of measures that have some potential, but they are all delayed measures. They are all put off, and without the ability of parliamentarians, the people elected from all corners of the country, to affect what is happening. Instead, it is left to orders in cabinet, intentions and notices of intent that do not bring the required seriousness to this issue. That seriousness means that this place must be able to mandate, regulate and hit the targets that Canadians expect us and need us to hit.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend from the Western Arctic and I, from northwestern British Columbia, with British Columbians across the entire province, are seeing the effects of climate change now. Canada's forestry council has directly cited climate change as one of the leading factors in the pine beetle infestation that has absolutely devastated our forests and has now hopped over the Rockies and is headed into the boreal, into Alberta, and across to Saskatchewan and Manitoba. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are watching and for those members of Parliament who have not yet seen what devastation truly looks like, let me say to them to hold on, because that pine beetle can absolutely punish the forest and the economies that depend upon those forests. Direct action is needed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development implored the government to take serious action on the environment. She said that “it must take immediate and long-lasting action on many fronts”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said “immediate”, but lo and behold, when the bill came out, all action was delayed. The action is delayed until 2015, 2025 and even 2050 for heaven's sake. That is not action. That is just an excuse for delay. The Conservative government is essentially asking Canadians to trust its ethics on the environment and unfortunately that did not pass the smell test.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do is remove the partisan nature of this debate. We need to finally step beyond that into a place where the issue of the environment, the issue of fighting global climate change, can occupy a place in the Canadian debate that goes beyond partisanship and allows members of Parliament to bring forward their best ideas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By accepting this bill prior to second reading, by accepting it with the option of changing its fundamentals, of making it stronger, of bringing in the best ideas from across the economy and from across the country, we have allowed an opportunity to exist in this place, an opportunity that previously did not exist. I am proud of our actions. I am determined, as are my colleagues, and colleagues in the other caucuses as well, to make the most effective bill--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like him to comment on whether he thinks this was helped at all by the government's cutting of the programs that were cutting greenhouse gases, such as the EnerGuide for the 70,000 houses, the one tonne challenge, and the mandatory emissions standards for large final emitters that were to be effective in 2008. Does the member think those programs helped the situation?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to welcome our incoming leader, who is lauded by the environmental community for having the greatest environmental green plan in history, with a $1 billion green fund, emissions cutting programs for energy emissions, $2 billion in partnerships with thousands of people working on projects for a time, including wind energy, renewable power projects for hydro, and biomass. In all these areas, tens of thousands of greenhouse gases were cut, but because the economy was so good the total went up. We did not have the time to get to our targets, but we were reaching them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324378"></a><p>

It was the very same claim that my hon. colleague just made, which is that since the economy improved of course our emissions had to go up. They said that was the reason for them going up, not the fact that $6 billion was announced and only $1 billion was spent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fundamental belief is the belief that party finally has to change: that the economy increasing somehow means that pollution must increase as well.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodyear workers vow to hold out one day longer than the company to obtain a fair and equitable contract that provides reasonable job security and a fair deal for retirees.

The union members are also fighting to keep employers like Goodyear from discarding North American production facilities in favour of low wage overseas operations. This issue is one that has wide-ranging implications for the whole North American economy and as such demands our attention.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the latest actions by the Fijian military and its ongoing threat of a coup undermine the effort to build a Fiji that is a democratic and prosperous country. We urge a solution to the political crisis in accordance with Fiji's constitution and in an open, peaceful and democratic process.</div>

Last year, Olivia Talbot of Edmonton was shot and killed, and her unborn son, Lane Jr., 27 weeks old, was also killed as a deliberate target. The vast majority of Canadians support a law that protects unborn children from acts of violence against their mothers, acts that also injure or kill the unborn child. The petitioners call upon Parliament to enact legislation that would recognize unborn children as separate victims when they are injured or killed when an attack is also being made on their mother.</div>

The competitiveness of the Canadian economy was also suffering as a result because energy was not being used in the most efficient means, certainly not in respect to our competitors. Lo and behold, even the United States under George Bush was able to make more reductions when it came to greenhouse gas emissions than Canada was able to make as an actual signatory to Kyoto.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might despair looking at the Bloc and the Liberal Party that presented very little in the way of moving this logjam forward. One might despair as upward of 80% of the funding for what few programs were running under the previous regime were cut by the Conservative government. Canadians could be forgiven for thinking that all was lost for this particular Parliament. We moved to find the space within the debate that allowed the most progressive ideas to come forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now major environmental groups operating in all of the provinces are coming forward with their best ideas. They have come to an agreement on what types of principles need to be imbedded in this bill to change its bad structure, the structure of delay, and the structure of allowing cabinet to continue to delay decisions that Canadians are waiting for. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These groups are willing to work with the opposition parties and parliamentarians to make something happen. They are willing to work with us to make what seemed impossible only a few short weeks ago possible. The Canadian government will finally have to act with leadership and responsibility. It will finally have to make the tough decisions. It will finally have to make the decisions that were lauded and claimed by previous regimes but never came to fruition. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Environment Commissioner said, the government was often gone before the confetti hit the ground. That is one of her more memorable quotes, but there were many talking about the $6 billion announced but only $1.3 billion actually spent, talking about programs with no monitoring, no efficacy, and no ability to look at whether money was going in the right place or not. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have stepped into that void, that vacuum, and created something positive. It will now be possible, if the other parties are willing to put partisan interests aside, to make something finally happen for all Canadians and our climate.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmful air emissions continue to affect our environment, our health, as well as our quality of life and economic productivity. Through Canada's clean air act, the Government of Canada is committed to taking action today that will provide the legislative basis for national requirements that will set mandatory targets for emissions that harm Canadians and their environment. The government has a real plan that will not only enable us to set regulations but to monitor the progress of industry and to report to Canadians on the gains that Canada is making on reducing emissions.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para324694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the leading sources of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Canada is transportation. Efforts in this sector will play a significant role in the Canadian air quality regulatory program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of people and goods has serious consequences on our environment and contributes to air and water pollution, in particular. This impact on the environment translates into real socio-economic costs and affects the health and quality of life of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the worst emissions caused by transportation are carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, many of which contribute to smog. Transportation produces 81% of all carbon monoxide emissions in this country and 60% of all nitrogen oxide emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase of emissions in this sector is largely due to our growing population and economy, but is also a result of higher living standards. Population growth and the movements of Canadians are exacerbating transportation activities, especially on our highways and with respect to air traffic. For example, between 1990 and 2003, the movements of Canadians by motor transport increased by 24% and the number of Canadians who own a vehicle increased 8% faster than the population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, increased trade and habits related to freight transportation activities, including the constant dominance of just-in-time delivery models, result in strong increases of activity. Globally, we expect the movement of goods to increase by 60% between 1990 and 2020, with the greatest increase expected to be in the air transport and trucking industries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1995 to 2003, freight moved by trucking, in terms of tonne-kilometres, increased by 63%. Total greenhouse gas emissions for the transportation sector increased by 25%, between 1990 and 2003. These emissions now account for about 26% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. So, this is the biggest source of emissions. About two thirds of greenhouse gases related to transports are emitted in urban centres. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is firmly committed to taking concrete means and measures to improve the health of its citizens and of their environment. This means we must immediately take concrete action.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is serious about improving our air quality and is deeply committed to achieving concrete results. Our approach is national in scope and will help Canadians both in urban and rural settings in breathing cleaner air and as a result living healthier lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clean air regulatory agenda will enable the federal government to implement measures to reduce both the emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases from the transportation sector. The Government of Canada intends to have a consistent approach across all sectors that are major emitters and the government will be using a regulatory approach in all of them. While voluntary agreements provide a certain level of predictability, regulations will provide greater accountability and codify targets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the auto sector, emissions from cars and trucks account for 75% of Canada's transportation greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger travel accounts for about half of that. The government intends to regulate the fuel consumption of road motor vehicles after the expiry of the memorandum of understanding between the auto industry and the Government of Canada.</div>

These regulations will be developed and implemented under the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act as amended by the proposed Canada's clean air act to take effect for the 2011 model year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005 the former government signed a voluntary agreement with the auto industry to reduce greenhouse gases by 5.3 megatonnes by 2010, a standard approximately equivalent to a 25% decrease in fuel consumption. The voluntary agreement provides for interim greenhouse gas emission reduction goals of 2.4 megatonnes in 2007, 3 megatonnes in 2008 and of course 3.9 megatonnes in 2009.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government and industry representatives have worked closely to develop this agreement and to ensure that the industry is on track to achieving real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by target date 2010. The regulatory approach that will apply for the 2011 model year will provide a greater degree of certainty, predictability and accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to establish a regulatory regime with targets that promote concrete environmental improvements that are also consistent with the need for industry to remain competitive in the North American economy. The government will continue to work in cooperation and collaboration with the auto sector stakeholders, including industry, provincial authorities and non-governmental organizations, to ensure significant gains in motor vehicle fuel efficiency while also reducing greenhouse gases.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the shipping industry, the government supports the development of new international standards by the International Maritime Organization, to control emissions produced by ships. The government will ensure that these standards are applied at the national level under this legislation, and it will also support a process under which North American coasts will be designated as zones where ships must reduce their sulphur emissions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2005, the previous government unveiled project green. It is somewhat disingenuous for the Conservatives to suggest that somehow we did nothing for 13 years. It is an absolute farce. Had they read and had they in fact continued on the road with what this government had started, we would be much further ahead today than this hot air plan that we are getting from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first myth we hear from the Conservatives is that we were going to buy hot air credits from Russia. That is nonsense. All the credits were Kyoto compliant. The second myth is that we do not support this because we are not putting any money into this. Last year we had the greenest budget in Canadian history of $10 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is proposing to take action but it has done nothing for the last 10 months. When it unveiled this clean air act, it was recycling some of the things that we had proposed had it not been for the federal election. We do not need to do some of these things because the legislation is already there. I will talk about CEPA in a moment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2005, the previous Liberal government proposed adding six greenhouse gases, GHGs, to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act of 1999. They included carbon dioxide, methane, fluoro carbons and sulphur, but unfortunately an election came. These GHGs were included in the Kyoto protocol. Our government was committed to ensuring that we reached our targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now some people said that those targets were not possible. They are not possible if we do not do anything. We had an aggressive plan. The former minister of the environment, now the leader of the official opposition, went to Montreal to COP 11. I had the privilege of chairing a session of parliamentarians from around the world at the G-8+5. We were able to get an historic agreement. We were able to get countries onside with regard to the post-Kyoto period.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably, the official opposition at the time, the Conservative Party, said that it did not believe in Kyoto. It was because some of those members, I believe, belong to the flat earth society. They do not believe the earth is round. If they do not believe in the science then naturally they would assume that this is not a real issue. They should tell that to the natives of the north. They should tell them about the melting of the polar ice cap or the floes that are now happening. My good friend from the Northwest Territories will certainly attest to the fact that we are finding problems in terms of habitat. Polar bears are now being disoriented because of the melting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be good for some of us not to have to walk in the snow in the south but it is a tragedy for those in the north. I have to say that I believe this is the most important issue facing Canadians and in fact people around the world. We need to deal with this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government proposes this clean air act and yet that is the party that has always opposed Kyoto and always said that we could not do this and we could not do that. The reality is that we did a lot of very positive things. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an agreement in the 14th MOU with the Canadian manufacturers of automobiles. The government claims that this was a voluntary measure. We had 13 MOUs with the auto sector and every one was fulfilled. In fact, in the 14th one, we can measure the trajectory to ensure that the measures to reduce GHGs by 5.3 megatonnes would occur. If this did not happen, we could bring in and use a regulatory back stop, but the reality is that we have not had to. To suggest somehow that there is a problem, when we have already had 13 MOUs that were lived up to, I am not sure what the issue is.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had 700 final emitters, the largest ones in the country, and we made an agreement with the 700 largest final emitters. Again, we hear from the Conservatives that this side did not do anything. Maybe they should talk to some of their friends in the flat Earth society because maybe the doubters over there just do not get it. They do not get it that the environment is extremely important and that we need to take action. What they have proposed under the clean air act is not action. It has a 2050 target. They now want to add things that they opposed back in September 2005, the things that this party proposed. Now they are saying that they are not bad ideas but that they need to change things because they do not have the proper tools. However, they do have the proper tools.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments they are proposing to CEPA are completely and utterly unnecessary. We already have the vehicle but the members across the way said that it does not work so they opposed it. While they were opposing that vehicle, they have not read and do not understand what we already had in place. We do not need more legislation. We already have the legislation that we had adopted but the Conservatives refuse to use it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324740"></a><p>

We were the government that dealt with taking 95% of sulphur out of gasoline. We were the government that was well respected on the international stage because of what we had done. As a member of Globe International, G-8+5, which is global parliamentarians for the environment, when I go to international meetings they now ask me what has happened in Canada when we were making such progress, moving forward, had the legislation and had the people on side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not need to go to court as they did in California with the auto sector. We had an agreement on the reduction of 5.3 megatonnes. While the Conservatives were fiddling over there, we were taking action. While they were complaining, I did not see a plan during the federal election on the environment. I guess that is why we did not see anything until recently in the House called the clean air act or, as I like to say, the hot air act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that we had programs. The present government is the one that gutted programs that we had brought in. In the one tonne challenge program, everyone had a responsibility to participate and to be involved. What did the Conservatives do? They cut it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did environmental audits so people could improve their homes, whether it was insulation for their windows, their doors, new furnaces, et cetera, but suddenly in the middle of the night the program was cancelled. Not only was it cancelled, it was not grandfathered. I, and I am sure others in this House, had constituents phoning and saying that they had just spent the money they thought they would be getting as a rebate and now suddenly they have nothing. We had to investigate this because the government was not clear. It talks about a clean air act but it cannot even come clean in here about the programs it gutted.</div>

It was the Minister of Natural Resources Canada who was the lead spokesperson. That is a travesty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say again that everywhere I go around the world people are asking me what has happened. They want to know what happened to the leadership and the vision of the Liberal government in the past that took the lead and was the lead at the COP 11 in Montreal. I say that the best the Conservatives can up with is a hollow clean air act. I must say that it makes me very sad when they will not even try to embrace the positive things that were done and that because they were done by a previous Liberal government they must be bad.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at our clean air act and compare it to him saying that it does not meet the favour of the international community. He suggested that wherever he goes internationally people say how shameful it is that we in Canada are not actually doing what we said we would do when we signed on to Kyoto, which is that we would reduce emissions by 6%. Instead of that, under the Liberal watch emissions increased by 35%. That is the rhetoric.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality of the situation is that the Liberals signed on to an agreement that they had no intention of complying with, nor were they actually doing anything about it. Now we have legislation that we hope will become law after it is debated in the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can talk about the rhetoric, one side or the other, all we like but we are talking about a substantive bill that actually deals with this in a way where businesses that do business in Canada will need to comply.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering what the member has to say with regard to indoor air pollution, which is also in the clean air act. The government opposite had no kind of vision or ideology on that. I wonder if my hon. colleague would stand in his place now and tell Canadians and the House that he at least will support the indoor air standards that would be provided under this legislation and say something a bit more positive about the environment. Everyone in the House and all Canadians are environmentalists. I would like to get my hon. colleague's consensus at least on that.</div>

I am only going over what actually occurred. The member should not take my word for it. NGOs unanimously have denounced the clean air act. NGOs have all said that this is hollow legislation. In fact, they say that CEPA is already in place and that the government has the broad powers under CEPA to regulate all air pollution, indoor, outdoor, whatever one likes. However, this legislation does not have any short or medium goals and it needs them.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the hon. member is that the legislation already exists. This is another diversionary tactic by the government. Instead of dealing with the issue, it has put before the House a piece of legislation that does not address the needs and in fact which NGOs across the country have unanimously said is simply more hot air and rhetoric from a party that has never had, as a centrepiece of its platform, the issue of the environment, which is the number one concern of Canadians.</div>

Thirty years ago, I started talking about hypersensitivity. I was in fact the first person in Quebec to talk about that. I am therefore pleased to speak to this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in the Bloc Québécois are asking the Conservative government to honour the Kyoto protocol and its 6% reduction target, within a plan that incorporates our international obligations. The Conservative government must also implement the action plan proposed by the Bloc Québécois to combat climate change. That plan is based on the principles of fairness and polluter-pay, it is based on a geographic approach and it includes a financial contribution to be given to the provinces and the Quebec nation by the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal government has rightly made commitments at the international level, but it must not undo that work by handing the bill to the provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservative government says that it does not want to send taxpayers’ money outside Canada. The Bloc Québécois certainly agrees with that. However, in the case of the oil sands, it seems to us that at present, the government is refusing to impose limits on the greenhouse gases produced by the processing of the tar sands into gasoline, into oil. The profits produced by the oil sands appear to find it easy to emigrate to other countries, particularly the United States. We could keep a bit of that money, and capture and bury the CO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore cannot say that this bill and what the government has in mind are for Canadians only. It seems fairly obvious to us that it is also designed with the big corporations in mind. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with this bill, but it needs to be reworked and improved. We will nonetheless harbour a little hope that once this bill has been studied there will be some degree of quality left and there will be clear standards with regard to the Kyoto protocol. At that point, we will be able to say that we are doing our part to reduce greenhouse gases in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, we could look behind us and realize the extent to which nothing has been done, but there is still time to act. Nonetheless, this bill can be considered to be a drop in the ocean. We would not want it to be a smokescreen that will prevent us from joining the Kyoto protocol and adhering to its objectives. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clean air bill seeks to regulate motor vehicles. But what about off-road vehicles, locomotives, pleasure craft or transport vessels? In addition, the Minister of Transportation told us that he wants to reduce sulphur emissions of boats, but he did not say that he wants to reduce GHGs. There are also buses, trucks, road trains and tractors. There are hundreds of thousands of them. Then there are cranes, construction equipment, planes, snowmobiles and ATVs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, this legislation absolutely must include a verification and improvement program covering existing and future motor vehicles for as long as they are in use. Even though some cars do not pollute at first, they might do so eventually if they are not monitored. This has to be an integral part of the legislation. Another verification program is needed for all the other existing combustion engines, otherwise we are improving one aspect and ignoring the rest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There needs to be an integrated system for industry. This is very important because this integrated system could also be a standard for the major oil industries. In accordance with our international commitments and air quality standards, greenhouse gases and air pollution have to be reduced at the same time. Such an industrial directive already exists in Europe and it works quite well. This directive, initiated by Great Britain and adopted by all the European countries, is called Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, or IPPC.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This directive establishes a series of modules including assessment of emissions and local and international impact, and it takes into account global warming, the ozone layer and all waste management provisions. In our society, waste is a major source of pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An integrated system is a must, because the IPPC is a sophisticated tool. It monitors all industrial emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every industry has a code and a potential for reducing pollutants, whether for global warming or garbage or the ozone layer. Even visual pollution, the risk of accidents and noise are taken into account.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to acquire some tools and not reinvent the wheel, which is what this bill does. Clause 46 speaks of reviewing things and holding consultations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to remind hon. members that things have already been done elsewhere and that it would be a good idea to adopt those measures instead of reinventing the wheel and putting off good regulations to 2010.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to have a real impact on the environment, on air quality and on greenhouse gases with measures that will apply only in 40 or 50 years' time? Do we not need interim measures so that we can monitor progress and make adjustments?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were good programs in place. Some people criticized how those programs were run. Would it not have been better to make the necessary changes to those programs and to help industry, Canadians and the provinces achieve the goal that had been set?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must invest in wind energy and especially in green energy, instead of simply cancelling programs. It has to put systems and measures in place for when we are no longer here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about indoor air quality, without having a definition of what that means and without knowing what programs have been put in place. There could be a register of gastric gases, for all I know. Programs must be put in place, though.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is obviously taking the longest way about; that is why I spoke of a smokescreen. I am afraid of having the government throw smoke at us to pollute us and prevent us from seeing what is going on when in fact there is very little going on. We know the issues. We have known them for quite a while and we know what to do. It is true that there were good programs in place. They felt that more changes were required, but we could have made these changes. For instance, EnerGuide was such a good program that Quebec continued it. The reduction in tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> achieved through that program was also excellent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the motor vehicle programs already exist. They are found in California, they are excellent, and we know exactly what standards we could put in place. Given that these standards apply to vehicles in the U.S. anyway, we could ask the companies to take the same time limits used in California and apply them to vehicles sold in Canada. I am also convinced that such standards would work very well and very quickly.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action on climate change must happen now so our families have cleaner air to breathe and cleaner water to use. The average Canadian wants results from us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at greenhouse gas emissions, we know quite well that they are mostly created through the burning of fossil fuels. The fossil fuel industry is large. The energy industry has taken on a great proportion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, over the past 20 years, since the failed national energy program, we have been unable to discuss in a rational fashion a national energy strategy, a way to look at the energy picture of our country. The situation is further exacerbated by the provincial control over resources. It is not laid out very carefully so we can take charge of our future in energy and our environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at alternatives to fossil fuels, not only because they create greenhouse gases but because Canada, as well as the rest of the world, is running out of fossil fuels that are affordable to any economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much discussion about whether the world has reached peak oil production. The U.S. already has and it has moved to a point where it spends an incredible amount of money on defence and foreign relations simply to hold on to its supply of oil.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has reached peak production in conventional oil. We still have to rely on heavy oil from the tar sands to maintain and increase any production in our system. That is the reality of Canada in oil. Are we an energy super power? Not really.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Natural Resources Canada, we will reach peak production of natural gas in 2011, at 6.6 trillion cubic feet. This is a serious issue for all Canadians. Canadian use natural gas in their homes and businesses. This issue really speaks to what we are doing here as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the energy required to support the conventional production of natural gas and crude oil represents between 8% and 15% of the net energy produced. For unconventional production, we are moving with ever increasing speed, whether it is the tar sands, coal bed methane or very difficult to reach sources of energy. The energy required represents more than 30% of the energy required to extract it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about intensity of emissions in the energy industry, we really miss the boat. We do not have a proposition that says we will reduce the intensity of emissions. We will increase it because that is the way the energy industry is moving.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to see the demand for natural gas increasing. We know that probably by 2015 we will have to abrogate the proportionality clause in the NAFTA agreement. We will be unable to keep up the supply of natural gas to the U.S. to the extent that we do now. We simply will not have that supply available. We will be unable to use it in our own homes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the clean air act and setting short term targets for improving energy efficiency and use of energy and for developing alternative energy, we are working to save our economy and moving it forward in a progressive fashion. This is not only about cleaning the air and meeting our Kyoto commitments, it also about taking care of the basics of Canadian life with a good supply of energy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people believe that importing liquefied natural gas into Canada is going solve many of our energy problems. This could not be further from the truth. It is clear that the projects proposed for Quebec, New Brunswick, British Columbia and Nova Scotia are simply meant to feed gas to the United States. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615">(1615)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. currently accounts for 25% of the natural gas consumed in the world every day. It will increase its use of liquefied natural gas, but it is not a solution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To produce liquefied natural gas, tonnes of greenhouse gases are released when the gas is liquefied and then converted back to gas. Thirty per cent or more of the natural gas is needed for this process. What we are doing is exporting pollution to other countries when we take on liquefied natural gas. We are not buying credits in another country. We are simply turning our problem over to another country. It still has the same impact on the atmosphere, which we all share.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realize that fossil fuels will continue for many years as the main fuel for Canada, but that does not mean we should not support the development of alternatives now when they are cheap. For example, on solar power, both the Liberal and Conservative governments have failed to provide the proper support to this industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is ranked at the bottom per capita in its commitment to the development of solar energy. Compare this to China, which has tens of thousands of manufacturers. Canada has a great solar resource, better than western Europe per square metre or however it is measured. Yet in Canada we have failed to move forward with this industry. We need incentives to make it happen. The NDP would have government buildings built so that solar energy would be incorporated into the plans. This would support the development of the solar industry and provide incentives to install 100,000 solar thermal building systems over five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On wind power, again, the Liberals and Conservatives have failed to provide proper support. Wind power in Canada is a great resource. We have a great opportunity linked to hydroelectric power to put a greater percentage of wind power into our system than almost any other country in the world. We need to develop the programs that will make that happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary Doer, the Premier of Manitoba, spoke eloquently about this at our convention. He knows that Manitoba is moving forward in this fashion. Great hydroelectric resource and great wind resource when tied together will give us a beautiful system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would set and meet a target of 10,000 megawatts of wind generation by 2010, place a priority on building turbines in Canada and negotiate with provinces and territories to adopt fixed price strategies for renewable power, which would provide producers with an incentive to invest. We would provide support for local cooperative and renewable power production using wind and other renewable resources. At the local level is where we can really make progress on renewable energy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is hydroelectric power as well and we need to take advantage of that. In the Northwest Territories many communities are examining small scale hydro developments. I have looked at them. We need that incentive. We need the sense to move forward. We can get victory in this. We can do well on hydroelectric power in Canada. We have not gone nearly far enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP would support the development of hydro by helping coal dependent provinces replace polluting power with cleaner alternatives through an east-west electricity grid. This is one of the key concepts that has to take place. We need to link the country together so we can support each other. We need to have that infrastructure in place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to negotiate with the provinces and territories to stop fixed price strategies for renewable power. We need to provide the same level of incentives proposed for wind and solar to assist in the development of small hydro. Energy use has a major role in cleaning our air. We must look at these sources of energy right now. I know renewables are number one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary Canadians have already had to wait under the Liberal government. We have not had to do anything because there has not been the pressure on this issue. There has not been the all party support in the House of Commons that is required to make these things happen. Today we are working on a proposition that will bring us together in the next few months. All these ideas can come together. We can make progress.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the bill because it truly represents an opportunity for me and my constituents, for all Canadians and the rest of the world.</div>

Many of the countries in western Europe have moved very well toward meeting their Kyoto targets. It is my understanding that the required long term targets are going to be negotiated over the next session of the Kyoto accord. We are going to see this expand. It is very positive that Canada has agreed to a long term target. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we really have to do with this legislation right now, and I think we all agree, is set short term targets that can start right away, that deliver results and that move the Canadian economy in a different direction. We need to make these moves now. Setting the required short term targets is the most important thing to do. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural resources committee recently went to Fort McMurray. I think the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79025,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79025&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Western Arctic</A> shares the pride that we all have in the Canadian technology, which is adding tremendous value to economic initiatives in Canada. However, the member has pointed out that prices will be paid for this, prices with respect to the tremendous acceleration in the use of natural gas and the tremendous use of water and the implications of that on surface and subsurface water. There are also implications with respect to the production of CO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that a shortcoming with the clean air act is this. It is not a template for action that would marry together the tremendous technology capacity that Canadians have with the technology to deal with some of those very issues raised by the member. With respect to the actions that will be taken by the special committee, is my colleague suggesting a template for action that will have high value-added technology commercialized and used in production, for example, in the oil sands?</div>

At the same time, the issues in the tar sands with respect to the use of energy have not been addressed. We have not seen movement on the development of technologies for CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living in the area and travelling through the tar sands for the past 20 years, I have seen the air pollution that comes from them. I cannot imagine the kind of situation we will have in northern Alberta and the southern Northwest Territories, if these are five times their size, with that kind of pollution going on. We need to set targets right now for the tar sands as well. If those targets cannot be met with their existing expansion, then we need a moratorium on them to ensure that the technology going into there, the developments taking place there are not going to add to the problem that we have with the tar sands.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This clean air act is an essential tool in this government's commitment to achieving concrete results on both air quality and climate change. This legislation will give us the means to put in place new enforceable regulatory requirements to reduce air emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important element of our approach to climate change is to require the use, by regulation, of renewable fuels in Canadian transportation fuels by 2010. This will be achieved by requiring fuel producers and importers to blend renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel in their petroleum products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By using these renewable fuels in our cars and trucks, we will be burning less of the traditional gasoline and diesel. That will result in fewer greenhouse gases polluting our atmosphere and damaging our environment. The measures we are working toward will achieve greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to pulling almost one million cars off Canada's roads.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the environmental benefits, this requirement will help stimulate the growth of the renewable fuels industry in this country. That means economic benefits for farmers and rural communities across Canada. That is why I am very keen to encourage this viable renewable fuels industry here in our own country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last July I announced the biofuels opportunities for producers initiative, a federal investment of $10 million to help ensure that farmers in rural communities have opportunities to participate in and benefit from increased Canadian biofuels production. This money is already helping agricultural producers develop sound business proposals as well as undertake feasibility or other studies to support the creation and expansion of the biofuel production capacity in the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biofuels opportunities initiative is the first step to enabling farmer participation in the renewable fuels value chain and increasing the benefits to the rural and farm communities. The initiative has been very well received and the studies resulting from the program will help farmers identify winning opportunities and effectively move up the value chain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no question that increased use of renewable fuels could result in increased demand for feedstock and new markets for farmers. It will help farmers diversify use of agricultural commodities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic production of renewable fuels provides an opportunity for farmers to move beyond simply producing commodities to focusing on new ways to add value to biomass produced on farms. Local production and ownership of facilities can help diversify farm and rural incomes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requiring the use of renewable fuels will send a strong signal that a viable market for ethanol and biodiesel will exist in Canada. This signal is an important element in providing a stable investment climate to entice ethanol and biodiesel producers to invest in Canada, with investment in renewable fuels production facilities and technologies that might otherwise flow to the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of a strong renewable fuels industry will provide Canadian farmers with reliable domestic market opportunities for their products and provide them an important opportunity to stabilize their incomes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's clean air act is essential to move forward on implementing this commitment to renewable fuels. The act includes amendments to the part of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 that enables the federal government to regulate fuels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These amendments are being put forward so that this government has the necessary tools to develop an effective and workable national regulation requiring the use of renewable fuels. By doing so, we can maximize the benefits that Canadians enjoy from the use of renewable fuels throughout the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of a brief background, I note that the proposed amendments will put in place changes to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act that address three main points.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, because renewable fuels are normally only blended with traditional fuels after they leave the refinery, we are adding the authority to use the CEPA legislation to regulate the blending of such fuels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, there are no provisions currently in CEPA that would allow us to possibly exempt companies that import very small volumes of traditional fuels, even in cases where this might make sense, for example, in remote hunting lodges or in the far north, where blending the fuel would be very difficult.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, to effectively monitor and enforce the regulation, we need improved ability to require a company to report on the quantities of fuel it exports.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In specific terms, the amendments necessary to effectively regulate renewable fuels are found in clause 20, which adds a condition for exempting very small imports, in subclauses 21(1) and 21(3), which add authority to make regulations regarding the blending of fuels and the obligation to report on that blending, and in subclause 21(5), which adds authority to require reporting on exports of renewable fuels.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630">(1630)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is working to bring forward an integrated strategy to implement our commitment. An integrated approach will not only stimulate the use of renewable fuels in Canada but will also promote domestic production of ethanol and biodiesel and will include measures to help farmers get involved higher up in the value chain in this emerging industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our government moves forward, we will also look at next generation renewable fuel technologies that have the potential to bring even greater economic and environmental benefits to Canada. Technologies that will make ethanol from non-food sources such as agriculture and forestry waste are nearly ready for commercialization already. These technologies have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions even further and turn waste products, or what are now called waste products, into a valuable commodity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, with this legislation I believe we are taking the first step toward the new bioeconomy, in which a range of products are made from renewable biomass. Renewable fuels are a cornerstone of an aggressive strategy by this government to expand opportunities for farmers, for rural communities and for the biofuel industry in the years to come. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to hearing the views of the committee on this legislation, because this legislation, the clean air act, will touch the lives of all Canadians, both rural and urban. I look forward to the questions and comments on this speech. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we are hearing nice rhetoric about protecting the environment and air quality, but I see a problem. His government has been in office for 10 months and it told us that in the fall it would come up with a national program to protect the environment. However, this bill talks about various phases of consultations, discussions or dickering with the industries, so that the regulations would only take effect in 2010. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people are in favour of protecting the environment at the earliest opportunity, and scientists note that it is urgent to take action. Therefore, I am wondering if the government is really aware of this urgency, and if it feels that it is fulfilling the wish of the public, rather than meeting the concerns of the industry—as it seems to be the case right now—which is not yet ready to comply with this legislation. </div>

    </p><a name="Para324860"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, I guess we could come forward with a regulation to say that we are going to change and demand 10% ethanol tomorrow, but the country does not have capacity to produce that much ethanol. We can say that, and we have been hearing that for many years as previous governments have just said, “Let us just make declarations”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to build the industry. If we just declare that we are going to have 5% or 10% ethanol tomorrow, we will just import it from Brazil. That is what will happen. We will import it from Brazil. Farmers will not benefit. There will be no domestic industry created. There will not be any benefits to the environment here in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for building an industry, that is why the first thing we did was to come out with a biofuels opportunities program, which is to help farmers and cooperatives actually get in on the ground floor to plan this. The regulations are in place to make sure that we will hit 5% ethanol targets by 2010. We are at 1% to 1.5% now in the country. This will allow us to build the capacity within the country to create that much ethanol production and biodiesel production.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing it that way, we not only do a good thing for the environment, but we build a domestic industry here in Canada that benefits farmers and rural communities.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want a healthy, cleaner environment. We all share the responsibility to move toward a more sustainable environment. Corporations, households, governments and individuals all have a role to play in combating global warming.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's economic and environmental futures are entwined. There are challenges as well as opportunities in addressing climate change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been hoping that the Conservative government would present an aggressive plan to combat global climate change. I am sadly disappointed with the clean air act that we see before us today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minority Conservative government's clean air act is a step backward for Canada's response to the global climate change crisis. The proposed legislation contains no immediate targets. It does not give the federal government any more power than it already has to fight global warming and air pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the arrival of this Conservative minority government, we have seen Canada fall far behind. We have gone from being a leader of international efforts to fight climate change to our current status, that of an international embarrassment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78760,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78760&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A> who has no interest in participating in an international response to climate change. We have a minority government that slashes effective energy reduction initiatives. The government proposes legislation that simply does nothing to address climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of the Stern report in the United Kingdom suggests that immediate, coordinated international action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is in the best economic interest of the global society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Bank's former chief economist has warned that the world faces a crisis on par with the two world wars and the Great Depression if greenhouse gas emissions are not radically reduced in the next 10 to 15 years. I would point out that if we do the math that is before 2050 as the government's plan would have us look at.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government had it right on the environment. For Canada to regain credibility in the environmental portfolio, we must start meeting our Kyoto targets and commit to medium and long term emission reductions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was proud to be part of the Liberal government when Canada ratified the Kyoto protocol. Canada has a responsibility to live up to its undertakings to the international community on how we as an international player respond to climate change. Our actions on the environment are our legacy for future generations. Good climate change policy will contribute to a better quality of life and better health for Canadians for today and future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians overwhelmingly support actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, they expect all sectors of our economy, governments, industry and consumers, to take an active part in that process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as finding support across the global community, the Kyoto protocol has the support of over 70% of Canadians. These 70% of Canadians get global warming and climate change, but not the Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change represents the worst ecological threat that humanity faces. Climate change is a global problem. As a global problem, international responses are the only way to address it effectively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can think of many examples of the impact of climate change. Winters are growing milder, summers are getting hotter and more severe, there is water where before there used to be ice, and in our far north the permafrost is thawing and releasing methane gas into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change south.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As weather patterns change, farmers are forced to re-evaluate what they can successfully grow and harvest. Storms, forest fires and infestations are already testing our capacity to respond and recover.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2005 Canada, led by our hon. leader of the official opposition, hosted the historic United Nations Climate Change Conference in Montreal. At that meeting, over 180 countries created the Montreal action plan on climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Canadian leadership, this conference decided to launch a dialogue on long term cooperative action to address climate change by enhancing the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and of the convention. This was a major victory for the global community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National governments would now have forums in which to exchange experiences, analyze strategic approaches, and to free our imaginations to find further innovative solutions to this challenge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyoto takes the first step in engaging Canada's efforts to become more efficient and sustainable. Kyoto represents the only international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to reverse climate change. The proposed clean air act ignores our Kyoto commitments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defining clause of climate change is human activity. It is how we produce and use energy. Our economies and our societies cannot sustain our current patterns of consumption. Climate change demands action. That action is not found in this proposed clean air act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smog and climate change are two separate problems. The Conservative government suggests that this legislation, the clean air act, focuses on clean air. However, Canada's clean air strategy 2000 already exists through an umbrella environmental legislation called the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA, that was passed in 1999 by the Liberals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives also say that their plan will talk about bringing in new environmental regulations. Under CEPA, there already exists the flexibility to introduce the required regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed clean air act does not take any action to combat climate change caused by greenhouse gases. We cannot cut corners when it comes to the air that we breathe. Canadians are ready, willing and able to work toward a greener world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, and right across the Waterloo region, the EnerGuide program for houses was extremely successful. It was administered by the residential energy efficiency project. The EnerGuide program led to 2,400 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> reductions annually, with an estimated $700,000 in energy savings every year for participating homeowners, and a further $3 million to $5 million in local spending on building materials and labour; all of this for $535,000 in federal grants to a program for those who participated in the Waterloo region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation does nothing to engage Canadians in environmental action and it does nothing to engage Canada in the international efforts to respond to climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of legislation is being referred to a legislative committee before second reading. I can only hope that it takes a transformative change during this committee process because it falls woefully short and is inadequate to what Canadians expect of their government, and what the international community expects of Canada.</div>

I have great respect for the member opposite but she either has not read the act completely or she has been misguided by her researchers, or perhaps the member does not have the researchers who are available.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did pay attention to a number of her comments. I regret that I was not here for the whole thing, but I heard a lot about the Liberals setting up this meeting in Montreal, that they had this forum for dialogue, that they were going to have these forums for exchanges of experiences, and all this kind of talk. What has that given Canadians?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clean air act, unlike whatever the Liberals think they did in the last 10 years, addresses all industries in all aspects, and it is not voluntary or “please do this by whenever”. It is mandatory and there is action in this plan for those sectors that fail to meet their targets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member is going to say there are no targets but that is not true either. Just a couple of weeks ago we announced the targets for lawnmowers, motorcycles, ATVs and snowmobiles. It is very detailed and very specific.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CEPA was signed in 1999 and what did it do? It did exactly what the country has come to know that the Liberals are famous for: nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member knows very well that the number of smog days 10 years ago in Ontario was about 4. The number of smog days last year in Toronto alone was about 48. The Liberals, by their own admission and by the admission of the Auditor General and the world, have indicated quite clearly that what they were doing, which I would suggest is nothing but let us be fair they were doing something, did not meet these so-called targets. They went over by 35%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, CEPA in 1999, dialogues and conversations in Montreal, and speaking to folks around the world is not what Canadians need. Does the member dispute the facts that under the tenure of the Liberal government, smog days went up? I see that she has a great answer coming back, but what I want to know is, did the smog days not go up? What Canadians want is action. They want to breathe clean air here, not just spend taxpayers' dollars on hot air credits from undeveloped countries.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to my hon. friend that it was his government that cancelled the $338 million flow of revenue that was going to go to Ontario to help it close down its coal-fired electricity plants. It is his government that is contributing to bad habits instead of looking forward with concrete targets that kick in well before 2050, which is its plan, and empowers Canadians and other levels of government to make sure that good environmental policy is good economical policy. To turn our backs on international obligations such as Kyoto is merely making us an embarrassment to the international community and is very regressive.</div>

I will note that these are not new powers, because they exist at present in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin, I will say that, like my party, the Bloc Québécois, I support sending this bill to committee before second reading. Given that we are in the very first stages of consideration of this bill, this will give me an opportunity to inform the minister and the members who will be examining amendments to this bill about the health problems that are associated with certain toxic substances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill is a statement of intent, in which the government sets out details of the regulations that it intends to make in the years to come and the timetables it is adopting for that purpose. I am indeed talking about regulations with timetables. This document shows that the government is wiping the slate, starting over at zero, and initiating a series of consultations in three phases which will, we are told, lead to mandatory standards being put in place by 2010 at the earliest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minister has not told us whether this “clean slate” means a slate clean of all the regulations we may have made since 2000. Regulations made since 1989 have been laid down and brought forward to protect both the environment and health. We do not know whether those regulations will or will not still be in force in 2010. We have no guarantee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill amends the Energy Efficiency Act, and that is why I am speaking today. At first glance, we would assume that the proposed amendments to the Energy Efficiency Act are an improvement, because they cover substances that are not regulated and they raise the standards for other substances that are already regulated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to know whether this is genuine progress or simply an update to the standards that the Agence de l'efficacité énergétique regularly makes. One of the substances already regulated is tetrachloroethylene (TCE)—or perchloroethylene (PERC)—and I would like to talk about that. I will talk about that in a moment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Canadian Environmental Protection Act already provides for the power to limit emissions of toxic substances and to fine those who exceed the limits and even provides for creating a tradeable permit mechanism. Unfortunately, if the past is any indication of the future, there is no guarantee that the new act will truly control greenhouse gases or air pollutants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to come back to the examples I just cited. Perchloroethylene (PERC), also known as tetrachloroethylene (TCE), is used as a degreasing solvent. This means that it is used in garages, but also, and mainly, in dry cleaning establishments. It is estimated that there are over 700 dry cleaners in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PERC is extremely toxic. In 1989, it was one of the 44 substances placed on the Priority Substances List, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, because it destroys ozone. PERC, or tetrachloroethylene, is even the subject of specific rules enacted by the House of Commons on January 1, 2004.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655">(1655)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PERC is toxic to human health and the environment. It is also carcinogenic. It is very volatile. It remains suspended in the environment and causes problems for the liver and the central nervous system. It has been found in the breast milk of women who work in dry cleaning establishments and even in food coming from adjoining restaurants. Studies have been conducted showing, for example, that if there is a dry cleaner in a shopping centre PERC has been found in adjacent businesses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From January 1996 to March 1997, Environment Canada carried out a demonstration project on a wet cleaning process. However, the department did not invest sufficient funds and as a result the project was abandoned. It must be said that the toxicity of PERC or TCE has been known since 1989. In 2001, Environment Canada conducted studies and carried out interviews with people in the industry, including workers in the sector as well as the companies that produced PERC. Following those steps, the department ordered a reduction in the use of PERC. Alternatives procedures and technologies were supposed to be used because they are available. The companies were supposed to provide annual reports on their use of PERC and TCE in vapour degreasing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Environment Canada did not enforce that policy. Instead it came up with a new regulation in 2004, which limited the release of TCE and PERC in all solvent degreasing operations. That decision resulted in additional expense for equipment and operating costs for the big companies and substantial investments for the small businesses. Those small operators were short on resources. They were hard pressed then and they still are now. The new regulations would have required them to use new technology anti-pollution measures. How could they do that when they did not have the money to invest in machines worth more than $100,000? </div>
    </p><a name="Para324922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we find ourselves today with a regulation that is not being enforced. It must also be said that the Department of the Environment did not send out the necessary inspectors to verify whether people in the industry, the big companies as well as the small operators, were complying with the regulations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would remind you that PERC is the odour that you smell on your clothes when you pick them up at the cleaner and that is the smell of degreasing. That is what is toxic and carcinogenic and that is what you should not smell. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an environmentally friendly dry cleaner in my riding. When I pick up my clothes, they do not smell like PERC because they have other ways to dry clean. Currently, businesses and small dry cleaners are not using the right equipment. They dispose of PERC directly into the environment—there is no monitoring. PERC is a greenhouse gas. It is a toxic gas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that it is very nice to start by putting forward ideas and conducting consultations. We know that the industry has been consulted, as have the people. However, those regulations, which were adopted at great cost, were never implemented. I wonder what the government will really do. They have introduced a nice bill. They will conduct consultations and implement it in 2010. Between now and then, people will be aware that they are working in places full of greenhouse gases. They have known since 1989. They are waiting for the government to act. Will the government wait until 2010 to do something?</div>
    </p><a name="Para324926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kyoto protocol covered PERC and TCE. This bill does not. What am I supposed to say to my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Cloutier? Mr. Cloutier has a degenerative nervous system disease because he worked with PERC all his life.</div>

However, I am not one hundred per cent convinced that she has actually read the bill or understands the difference between provincial jurisdictions and municipal jurisdictions, those areas that are covered by industry and the folks who protect those in the industry. The member did allude at some point in her conversation to coal fired plants. The hon. colleague who spoke before she did discussed coal fired plants in Ontario. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that the broken promise by the McGuinty government in Ontario is something they have to deal with. Mr. McGuinty promised to close those coal fired plants. It is my suspicion that was a promise to gain votes because clearly that would not be possible, especially in a province that has had brownouts. Where would we buy the energy? We would end up buying it from Michigan's coal fired plants which pollute far worse than ours do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my colleague not feel it is important to move toward clean coal fired technology which has very limited particulate matter? I would like to know if she understands that particulate matter is not covered under the Kyoto accord, not at all. In this clean air act it is covered, including higher technologies for things such as coal fired plants that produce our energy. I would like the hon. member to comment on that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para324933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I emphasized that it is all well and good to carry out consultations, which we have been doing since 1989, if not before that. The government wants to continue the consultations until 2010, to produce regulations that would not take effect until 2030, 2040 or even 2050. I did not mention coal fired plants. Rather, I discussed the health of people who currently work in the dry cleaning industry or in garages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERC is used to clean your car's engine. Not only does this product have a bad odour, but it can also cause cancer. That is what I talked about.

Do we know what is being done with them? Quite often, they go to the dump, and this is pollution. The government may have appointed 10 inspectors, at most, for all of Canada, and the industry that produces PERC is not even being inspected. Is it mentioned in this bill? On the other hand, in the 2004 regulations, it was provided that the companies that produce it and those that use it had to be inspected. Has anyone looked to see that the containers where the PERC is discarded do not have holes? This has never been looked at. Never in the bill that is now before us—</div>

The impacts of poor air quality continue to be a concern for Canadians. Smog can worsen existing heart and lung problems and contribute to thousands of premature deaths yearly. Acid rain remains a serious threat to biodiversity, the forests and fresh water ecosystems. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levels of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Canada are simply not acceptable. Our new government has introduced Canada's clean air act, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, to strengthen the Government of Canada's ability to take coordinated action to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory regulations will replace the voluntary approaches that have failed in the past. We will ensure the regulations are enforced and their objectives are achieved. We will focus on improving the health of Canadians and their environment. Compliance options are one of four components of our proposed regulatory approach. Emission targets and timelines, monitoring and reporting and equivalency agreements are the others. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is meeting almost every day with industry and the provinces and territories to develop the regulatory framework. By spring 2007, our objective is to have finalized initial discussions on a number of important issues, including short term reduction targets, compliance and reporting options and timelines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations will set realistic emission targets that will reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions across the country for the benefit of the health of Canadians and our planet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimize the cost to industry of complying with regulatory requirements, the Government of Canada is considering a number of compliance options. The objective is to provide industry with the flexibility to choose the most cost effective way to meet its emission targets. These include emissions trading, offsets, opt ins and a technology investment fund. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emissions trading would allow facilities the flexibility to meet their emission reduction target in three ways: by reducing their emissions to the level of their target; by reducing their emissions below their target then sell or bank the surplus emission reductions; or emit more than their target and buy emission reduction credits from the other entities. Emission trading does not replace regulation. It gives facilities more flexibility in how they can meet their regulatory obligations. As a result, emissions trading can reduce the cost of achieving a given target. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an emission trading system the environmental objective is set by regulators, not by the market. The government is consulting on options surrounding an emissions trading regime. That is why the government is proposing, through sections 27, 29 and 30 of Canada's clean air act, to ensure that we can make regulations that are flexible enough to allow trading and that align our compliance regime to support the implementation of trading systems.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any trading system should be self-supporting and not reliant on taxpayer dollars. Our government will not purchase credits or otherwise participate in the emissions trading market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offsets are emission reductions that take place outside the regulated sectors or activities. They are usually verifiable projects that result in emission reductions beyond a baseline and are additional to any other regulatory requirement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure real emission reductions have taken place, Canada's new government will ensure that the requirements for monitoring and reporting emission reductions are rigorous and verifiable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opt ins are entities that are not covered by the regulations, but that choose to voluntarily adopt targets. Entities that exceed targets could earn and sell allowances, but would not be penalized for failing to meet the targets. Opt ins could be a vehicle for municipalities and other non-regulated entities to be a part of our clean air regulatory agenda. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offsets and opt ins will work well within an emissions trading system. Offset emission reductions generate tradeable credits that can be sold by the offset owner to the regulated facilities, which the use of credits can then be used against their regulatory obligations. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715">(1715)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para324960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both offsets and opt ins broaden the scope of emissions trading to otherwise non-covered facilities. By broadening the pool of emission reduction sources, compliance cost can be further lowered. More participants also help to develop a more robust emissions trading market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also considering a mechanism to credit early actions taken before targets enter into effect. One key mechanism to be considered is a means to facilitate industry compliance with the regulatory system that will be the establishment of a technology investment fund. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A technology investment fund is a compliance mechanism where a facility can pay a contribution rate per tonne of emissions to achieve compliance. The emission credits from these payments would not be tradeable or bankable. The funds generated would be used to accelerate technological development within the regulated sectors to promote long term emission reductions, particularly in the development and deployment of technologies that have the potential to achieve the greatest emission reductions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are committed to consultations, negotiations and collaboration to ensure that the most effective regulatory system is developed and implemented. We have and will continue to involve stakeholders throughout the development process to ensure that regulations achieve real results for Canadians, but do so in a way that minimize the cost to Canadian industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to work with the provinces and territories toward a single harmonized system for mandatory reporting of all emissions and related information. This system will underpin the proposed regulations. It will also respond to industrial concerns that multiple measurement methodologies and multiple reporting regimes would cause an unnecessary and costly administrative burden.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, our regulatory framework will be guided by what is needed to protect the health of Canadians and our environment.</div>

We are dealing with both. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous government just dealt with greenhouse gas emissions through Kyoto. The hon. member said very clearly in this House that his government would never be able to reach those targets. He did not support signing on to Kyoto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution levels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the question about intensity. It depends if it is low intensity or high intensity. The former Liberal government had no plan. It did not know the difference between low intensity and high intensity obviously because the emissions were going up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to have realistic targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution levels. We will do what the Liberals could not even dream of doing.</div>

I believe there is no other issue that will have as great an impact on their lives as taking action on climate change, as the motion proposes to do, by sending the bill to an all party committee that would allow every party to bring forward their best ideas for action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I heard a Conservative in a casual conversation say that where he spent the weekend it was 31° below and they did not really much believe in climate change out there. It surprised me. It was obviously said in jest, but it did reflect somewhat the lackadaisical approach the Conservative government has taken in the last nine months, as if climate change was a sidebar issue that required yet more consultation than has occurred since 1989. The Conservatives believe it is something that we should get serious about by 2050 it seems. </div>
    </p><a name="Para324993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognize that for the first time the government did propose some regulatory action. That is encouraging. It gives us something to begin working with in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change is an issue that requires immediate action. On the west coast in British Columbia the department head of the Pacific biological station in Nanaimo was saying that global change and unpredictable fish behaviour could prompt the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to shorten openings and further restrict the number of boats on the fishing grounds. Global warming is prompting salmon to appear in areas where they have not been seen in recent history and to disappear from other areas. It is not only the Mackenzie River that is warming; the Fraser River is also warming. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans uses models based on historical information to predict fish returns and to set restrictions, but the global warming trend is throwing them completely out of whack.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information we are receiving suggests that it is time to show Canadians that Parliament can act in the public interest and to stop the cynicism. Tonight we have the opportunity to roll up our sleeves and get to work on climate change in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP proposed that Parliament rewrite the clean air act. All parties have an opportunity to put forward good ideas and do that work in a special committee expeditiously, urgently. The NDP took this bill out of the impasse that it was in and it now lies within our power to take action, not in a business as usual mode, but urgently, as if our children's lives depended on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has tabled a number of amendments. We are certainly open to other parties' amendments as well. Our amendments would certainly force decisive action, not only on air pollution, which millions of Canadians want to see, but on a clear reduction of greenhouse gas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para324998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our amendments propose a series of changes to ensure that Canada meets its Kyoto protocol commitments in the short term, plus a workable plan to meet internationally recognized medium and long term goals. Our amendments include legislated targets and timelines for greenhouse gas reductions. They represent a chance to transform an inadequate piece of legislation into a real action plan which ordinary Canadians want to see.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have laid out clear science based targets and mandates for immediate action. These would obligate governments to set targets to reduce greenhouse gases within one year. They would obligate government to set out interim targets at five year intervals so that we could see if we were on target. It would legislate a 25% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 below 1990 levels and would legislate 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 below 1990 levels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come to take decisive action, even at the risk of offending the industry insiders that both the Conservatives and the Liberals in the past have tried to protect. It is important to continue to develop our oil and gas, but in a responsible way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking through <i>Oilsands Review</i>, there are hundreds of projects that are being developed at breakneck speed. Hundreds of projects have been approved. Regulatory applications are being finalized. Work is being done on final cost estimates. They are happening in the Cold Lake region, Athabasca region, Lloydminster region, Peace River region and involve Imperial Oil, Husky Energy, Oilsands Quest. There is a race to develop the oil sands. If energy security is to be achieved for all of us, we must plan in the context of long term demand of these scarce fossil fuel resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask for more measured development of oil and gas. There must be aggressive promotion of conservation and renewable energy. There is a project involving a number of entrepreneurs in Victoria who were propose to develop new, large buildings and to equip them with geothermals, but there are few opportunities to get this kind of project off the ground. It would be so simple and it would reduce by orders of magnitude the amount of greenhouse gas the buildings would use over their lifetime. Yet there are no programs that exist either provincially or federally to support this kind of innovation. The same thing applies to solar or wind. We must begin by ending the subsidies to oil and gas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has proposed a five point green agenda for Canada. It focuses on greener homes by cutting emissions and cutting home energy bills. It focuses on greener communities in the way I suggested by giving municipalities the tools to support innovative projects and expand local renewable energies and retrofit infrastructure for greater efficiency. It focuses on greener transportation by cutting dirty emissions through mandatory fuel efficiency standards, not just by adding a percentage of biodiesel, but mandatory fuel efficiency standards, a green car strategy, and an investment in sustainable public transportation, which Canada is still not doing. It is amazing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78359,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78359&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Victoria</A>, the ridership on public transportation has increased enormously in the past few years, but with little funding to match that with the capacity. Numbers of buses continue to pass by customers; there are not enough buses. An innovative program at the federal level would be able to offer this kind of funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, for a greener Canada, the federal government could take a leadership role in retrofitting federal buildings. It could ensure that when federal public properties are sold, that they are sold with a triple bottom line criteria to ensure that these properties and buildings are redeveloped in a way that is sustainable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will end by saying that there has been enough consultation with industry and with the public. The Canadian public is way ahead of us on this subject. Canadians are ready for us to act. If we are not to disappoint them or to create more cynicism, I would ask my colleagues from all sides of the House to take this opportunity very seriously and take action.</div>

I have one simple question for the member. We hear a lot in the House about how this act does nothing. Frankly I think it is partially on purpose and partially from people who do not know, but I believe that this is what the member said. I would like to give the member an opportunity to clarify her statement that this act does nothing until 2050. I am appalled by that statement. It is completely inaccurate. I would like the opportunity to retract that to be offered to the member. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, let us look at meeting these targets, whether it is by 2010 or 2020. From here if we look at the chart, we can see that greenhouse gases have been going up under Liberal governments and they were not going to go down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under our government's bill, the chart goes down from today to 2015. We are acting today. Greenhouse gases will begin to be reduced. Everyone in the House knows that and I think the member deserves the right and the opportunity to stand up and apologize for misleading the House in that way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I want to comment on is the 25% reduction of greenhouse gases based on the 1990 levels by the year 2020. It is wonderful for those members to promise anything when they do not ever have an opportunity to produce.</div>

Unless I misread this bill, that is the date by which absolute reductions are committed.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are proposing is that we need short term and medium term mandatory targets that determine whether we are going in the right direction, because by 2050 I do not know where the member will be, but I know where I will be, and I do not think many of us will be in a position to say, “Oops, we should have done this”. It is important to establish for ourselves short term goals to ensure that we are on the right track. This is what I was trying to say.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My colleague is perfectly correct in referring to greener homes. I also spoke of the need to develop greener communities and buildings. The technology certainly exists here in Canada. For example, the Canada Green Building Council has been established. It has put forward a number of suggestions for building and development that respect the principles of different forms of energy; solar energy, for example.

This of course paid great dividends to Canadians and allowed us huge increases for students, for the biggest environmental budget in Canadian history and for seniors, health care, equalization and transfer payments, foreign aid increases, research and development increases, and increases in funds for the disabled. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course when the economy is so good, it also leads to huge increases in greenhouse gases if there is no action, and of course there were huge developments like the oil sands going on in that period. I am not sure what the exact figure was. It was perhaps 150% or 200% in greenhouse gases being produced by the country, but having this successful and expanding economy also gave us the largest challenge of any nation in the world in trying to reach our Kyoto targets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was why we developed a very aggressive plan. Today I am going to break down the plan into a series of plans. In spite of this increase of 150% or 200% or whatever it was in greenhouse gases at the time of the economy going so well, we still kept it down to roughly 135% of the previous amount. So far, the major and very complex programs that took so long to carefully put in place and negotiate are on the verge of reducing greenhouse gases more substantially toward our targets if they are kept in place, but we see that has not been the modus operandi of the present government. I will outline these plans quickly because if I do not I will be not be able to get them all in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plans are basically two-pronged. First, we have been dramatically cutting emissions in reducing the use of energy. There are a number of programs for that. Second, there is support for renewable technologies. The new technologies do not emit any or as much of the greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of this was achieved by our new Liberal leader when he was environment minister. He got great credit from environmental groups and across the nation for being able to achieve this and overcoming the difficulty of working with finance ministers, which we know is always difficult to achieve.

It was hailed by environmental groups in Canada as the greenest budget.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environmental budget was composed of initiatives that I will break down into about 20 plans. The first one was a $1 billion green fund that would support green projects to reduce greenhouse gases. It was a catalyst for new technologies. We cannot compare that $1 billion to any other programs of that magnitude that have been announced today. Once again, under the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>, it was a huge increase.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second plan was up to $2 billion for partnerships, which would lever up to $4 billion. These numbers are huge in cutting greenhouse gases and reducing pollution. That involved partnerships with other levels of government. This problem is so big it cannot be done by just the federal government. Once again, there is nothing from the new government to match what the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A> achieved in this area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan three provided $200 million for quadrupling the wind power incentive Canada. That was enough for a million programs, which is another under the great stewardship of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan four involved $97 million for renewable power production. Some examples are support for small hydro, for biomass and landfill gases. What is happening in this area now? Nothing new.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan five was incentives for biomass. In that area there were a number of incentives. As members know, we have supported a number of new ethanol plants. Not only do they cut greenhouse gases but they offer big support for our farmers. This gives them another area in which to sell their products, again under the great stewardship of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan six was the quadrupling of the EnerGuide. Another $225 million were provided to improve the energy efficiency of houses. It allowed Canadians to participate. The government itself cannot deal with this huge challenge. Why would it have been recommended that the program be quadrupled if it was not working? There were 500,000 homes in Canada in the program. Some parliamentarians spoke about not hearing of Canadians cutting greenhouse gases, but 500,000 Canadians, half a million of them, were aware of it. In fact, the government has now cut that program, which is incomprehensible to all members in the House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are saying that there is too much greenhouse gas emissions or too much pollution and then they cut the programs that are cutting them. That is like saying that we found starving children with not enough food and we will solve the problem by taking some of their food away.</div>

When research and development are slashed for things such as this in this country, like the last budget did, it will be very critical to the future of our children.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan eight was the green municipal fund. It is a great success story, as everyone in the House knows from their own communities. For over a decade the leader of the NDP was very complimentary of this program. The former prime minister, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard, </A> was a real champion in funding this program for municipalities across the country, as was the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am most proud of, in the tough times when a number of areas had to be cut to put this country back in order, when there were huge deficits, the Liberal government did not cut the green municipal fund. In fact ,it doubled it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para325041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan 10, made in Canada, was to cut greenhouse gases with clean power generation. This has been inspired through tax cuts. Again, we put the capital cost allowance for clean power generation up from 30% to 50% under the inspired leadership of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seven more plans but I see that I will not have time to finish them so I will just mention what they are. Plan 11 was clean coal, plan 12 was biomass, plan 13 was carbon sequestration initiatives, plan 15 was landfill waste projects, plan 16 was east-west grid, plan 17 was EnerGuide for low income Canadians, plan 18 was for large final emitters supporting 5 megatonne cuts, plan 19 was auto emission reduction, plan 20 was the one tonne challenge, plan 21 was Biocap and plan 22 was solar.</div>

Thus, if there were a carbon exchange, the maximum penalty that could be imposed on the industry would never be more than $15 per tonne.

To stay calm, one truly has to live in a cocoon, somewhat the way Howard Hughes cut himself off from the world a number of years ago. To hear the Conservatives I am often under the impression they are completely cut off from the world, that they have stopped watching television and reading newspapers. There is danger in waiting.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regularly receive letters from young boys and girls in elementary and early secondary school, who write in near panic about the images they see on television and who are well aware that we are playing with their future. I imagine that all the members in this House receive such letters. I always try to reassure these young people by reminding them that we live in a democracy and that in a democracy usually the common good prevails. Unfortunately, this does not seem to have been the case for the past nine months. That said, nine months in the history of Quebec and Canada is relatively short and everything can change if common sense ends up prevailing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill, as I was saying, includes a series of regulatory powers that the government is giving itself, powers for which this type of legislation was unnecessary and that could very well have been included in the regulatory changes to the existing Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This bill also has provisions on energy consumption labelling and the authority to make regulations on fuel consumption standards for new motor vehicles sold in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve those ends, the government has introduced a bill that clearly must go through the usual series of steps: first reading, second reading, referral to committee and return to the House for adoption at third reading. Then, we will have to wait for the regulations. This bill, which outlines the government's intentions, details a three-stage consultation process. All that will lead, at best, to the coming into force of mandatory standards in 2010 and the achievement of Kyoto protocol targets in 2050. This is particularly disturbing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen after the next three years? We do not know. As they have done since they came to power in Ottawa, the Conservatives will no doubt find a way to tell us that, unfortunately, it is 2010 and greenhouse gas emissions have increased so much that the targets that had been set are far too strict. Now we have to find ways to reduce these weak requirements again, because we have to demonstrate economic realism. Meanwhile, the problem will grow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I hear the Conservatives say that it is the Liberals' fault, because they did nothing even though they talked a good game when it came to the Kyoto protocol, I think they are right, but that is no excuse to put off making the necessary decisions even longer. Neither is it a reason to throw out all the work the previous government had done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I am convinced that, in a few years, the government is going to invoke economic realism and tell us that we bit off more than we could chew and we are going to have to take smaller bites. Clearly, then, the bill as it stands is unacceptable. We will support referring the bill to committee, because we have reached that stage. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78641,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78641&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</A> and my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78542,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78542&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brossard—La Prairie</A>, in a spirit of openness and helpfulness, will try to bring us closer to the Kyoto protocol targets with this bill.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, we will agree to second reading so that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> can be sent to committee. However, we are extremely concerned about both what is contained in the bill and what is not in the bill, in particular, anything about achieving the Kyoto targets.<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>
    </p><a name="Para325065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the Kyoto protocol, I remind you once again that this government has only one concrete target, the year 2050. Earlier, my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79023,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79023&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brome—Missisquoi</A> was showing a lack of optimism, but that would be understandable if he were 106 years old. He may not be sitting here in this House at that age, but he should at least still be able to enjoy some great years. One never knows with the advances of science. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79023,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79023&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>
    </p><a name="Para325066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is certainly true that when he reaches the age of 106, he will have many more years behind him than in front of him. However, that would also be the case for me. In my opinion, we all have an objective interest in immediately ensuring that Canada not only respects our signature on the Kyoto protocol but that we take measures to reach the objectives of the protocol. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the bill makes no mention of the first phase of reductions from 2008 to 2012 set out in the Kyoto protocol, nor of the second phase that was supposed to begin in 2012. Obviously, this was discussed at Nairobi. In addition, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> contains a provision that gives the government the discretion to respect or not respect Canada’s international commitments in terms of the environment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the facts be any clearer that they are providing themselves with both belt and suspenders in order to avoid our international obligations? </div>
    </p><a name="Para325069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government promised us a made in Canada plan, obviously to gain more time. Nine months after the Conservatives took power, we still have nothing. The Canadian and Quebec public are worried, young people are worried, with good reason, and even older people, like my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79023,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79023&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brome—Missisquoi</A> and myself, are worried. As I said, it is no excuse to say that the Liberals did not implement the measures that were needed to achieve the objectives and that during that time emissions actually increased significantly, by over 25% if I recall correctly. It is the Conservative government that is in power now, and it is the one that must take responsibility and commit itself not only, as I said, to honouring Canada’s signature at the bottom of the Kyoto protocol, but to putting effective measures into motion quickly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this debate, we see that on the government side they are going to think about it. However, they do not seem to be giving any consideration to what has been done in other countries. For example, a number of European countries are on their way to achieving the Kyoto targets and honouring their signatures at the bottom of that international commitment, specifically concerning the use of better technologies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore require industry and industrial sectors to use the best technology now available. Obviously, when there is no better technology that can be used to reduce greenhouse gases below a certain level, we could allow industries to purchase greenhouse gas credits at their own expense. That is the approach that has been taken by the European countries, and it has proved itself. I do not see why we would choose to take a different approach in Canada, particularly when we consider how far behind we have fallen. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, we have to be very clear about this. There are things we can learn from countries that have achieved or are about to achieve the Kyoto objectives, and I believe that we must take our inspiration from them, and also from the territorial approach. This is something that is extremely important, particularly in Quebec, because our manufacturing sector has made significant efforts in recent decades. Those efforts have to be recognized for what they are and so Quebec has to be allowed to actually establish an emissions permit exchange—a carbon exchange, as I was explaining—for North America as a whole. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude, because I do not think that the Conservatives spend a lot of time reading the daily <i>La Presse</i>. Galbraith, the American economist who died not long ago, used to say that “Democrats only read Democrats, but Republicans do not read at all”. I am under the impression that it is somewhat the same situation in this House, in that the Conservatives do not read at all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of Nicholas Stern, a former chief economist of the Wold Bank, was released barely two or three weeks ago, at the request of the British Prime Minister, who is an ally of Canada, particularly in its mission in Afghanistan. He is a traditional ally and the leader of a country which, in the past, has been the source of many of our traditions, including our parliamentary traditions. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study was done and Prime Minister Blair is taking it very seriously. What does that study tell us? It predicts a series of catastrophes if we do not put a stop to global warming, meaning if we do not take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I invite Conservative members to take a look at the Stern report and to inform the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>that the reality of global warming and the effects of greenhouse gases has now been scientifically demonstrated, and even recognized in terms of its disastrous effects on the economy.

I believe this is still in the annals of parliamentary publications. I do not remember whether it was 16 or 17 hours, but it was very long. The thrust of his speech was that global warming did not exist, the Kyoto protocol was useless and there were no greenhouse gases. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Conservatives admit that this exists theoretically or in principle. Our actions to correct the situation, which are part of our international commitments, are not conclusive. They do not alleviate the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find that the Conservatives are out of excuses. According to the report of the commissioner of environment and sustainable development, there were failings in the programs that were put in place. Indeed, these programs were huge. Perhaps there were management problems. I do not dispute this with the commissioner. However, we could have improved these programs, given them special attention, made the changes that were needed and ensured that they were managed in such a way as to achieve their goals. It would have been a step in the right direction with international trading.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he convinced that the Conservative government recognizes global warming as a catastrophe that we must face, as one of the great challenges of humankind? Should it not quickly reinstate these programs? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether I am convinced, well, I am convinced that the people of Canada and Quebec will ultimately make this government see reason, but as long as its interests are as closely linked to the oil sector as they currently are, I seriously doubt that it is really willing to implement all the measures necessary to achieve Kyoto.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By introducing this bill, the government is laying the groundwork for one of the strictest atmospheric pollution and greenhouse gas emissions regulatory regimes in the world. Previous governments focused on voluntary measures. That approach failed. From now on, all industrial sectors will have to comply with strict regulations that we will enforce. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, I would like to demonstrate to my colleagues how Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> can help achieve significant energy savings. Canadians are aware of steps to use energy more wisely. They know they can save money by keeping heat in their homes in winter, or cooling them more efficiently in the summer. And there is a growing awareness that saving energy also helps reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businesses and institutions have saved considerable sums by upgrading or retrofitting their existing buildings to promote energy efficiency. The University of Calgary put energy efficiency upgrades in place in 1999. Since then, it has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by over 1,000 tonnes per year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanhoe Cambridge is one of Canada’s prominent property developers. Since completing energy efficiency upgrades in 2004, it has saved more than a quarter million dollars per year. The Toronto Dominion Centre in Toronto completed energy efficiency upgrades in 2001. It has saved over $4 million per year. These are big savings, Mr. Speaker. They are dramatic. They catch our attention. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other more subtle ways to save energy and reduce emissions. There are ways to lower our energy use on a very small scale. But when you look at the big picture, these efforts quickly add up. They represent a potentially huge contribution to energy efficiency and cleaner air.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every second of every minute of every day, Canadians are using very small amounts of energy called standby power on various devices. We use standby power in home entertainment products, such as home theatre systems, stereos, and DVD players. We use standby power in imaging equipment, such as printers, fax machines and photocopiers. We use standby power in computer equipment, including laptops, desktops, and workstations. We use standby power in cordless phones and battery chargers. And most of us are unaware of using that power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A typical Canadian home has more than 25 devices that constantly use standby power. We use this electricity through standby power when the appliance is switched off or not performing its primary functions. It enables features such as clocks, timers, and remote controls.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standby power consumption for most devices is small. It ranges from as low as half a watt to as much as 20 watts for some home entertainment products. But the number of devices drawing standby power is large. If you take the typical home, with its 25 devices consuming standby power all day and all night, and multiply by the number of homes on a city block, it is starting to add up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you multiply that again by the number of blocks in your community, and the number of communities in Canada, the use of standby power, every second of every day, has become enormous. In Canada, some 5.2 terawatt/hours is used per year by appliances in standby mode.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when you consider the number of countries that have a market for consumer electronics, the problem is very serious indeed. In fact, there has been considerable discussion and action at the international level to reduce the amount of energy that is used on standby power around the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the International Energy Agency proposed a global one-watt strategy. Appliances using standby power would seek a standard of one watt per hour. This one-watt initiative was endorsed by the G-8 leaders at the summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, in July 2005. Canada is a signatory. At least six governments—Japan, Korea, the United States, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand—have enacted or announced plans to regulate some aspect of standby power use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for Canada to join their ranks. Canada's clean air agenda sets in motion a series of initiatives that will meet the commitment we made at the Gleneagle summit. We will move to a one-watt target.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build on some of our recent successes. Natural Resources Canada administers the Energy Star program in Canada. The international Energy Star symbol helps consumers identify products that are among the most energy efficient in the market. Only manufacturers and retailers whose products meet the Energy Star criteria can label their products with the symbol.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820">(1820)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para325105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy Star standards include standby power. Since 2001, Natural Resources Canada has promoted voluntary efforts by manufacturers and retailers on standby power as part of the Energy Star program. We will continue to promote consumer information through Energy Star. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, we will do much more. The revisions to the Energy Efficiency Act included in this bill will enable the government to deal with classes of products that use standby power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the coming months the government will meet with stakeholders who have an interest in standby power, and we will encourage the formation of an interest group to deal with the regulatory framework we want to create. We will develop standards for standby power, and test methods. We will use internationally recognized test procedures. We will evaluate the economic impact of the measures we will take. By 2008, we will have established regulations for a minimum allowable standby loss. These regulations will apply to consumer electronics, external power supplies, and digital television adapters. We will establish these standards to the same level as those implemented in California this year. In other words, they will be the best-in-class in North America. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By January 2010, we will have established regulations for a minimum allowable standby loss of one watt for consumer electronics, with an additional one watt allowance for clock display or other specific auxiliary functions. These standards will be equivalent to the current Energy Star levels. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we are taking the Energy Star standard—which is a tool to help consumers choose the most energy efficient product—and we will apply that standard to all consumer electronics. We will raise the bar on energy efficiency. Today's best practices will very quickly become tomorrow’s minimum requirement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, Canadian home-owners and Canadian businesses are taking important steps to use energy more wisely. You can see the results in their electricity bills and other energy costs. But every day, without realizing it, we are leaking small amounts of energy through standby power. These amounts may seem minuscule, but they add up. Nearly every household and every business uses standby power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can use standby power more efficiently in every appliance, we can have a big impact overall. If all devices that consume standby power met the one-watt target, we could save about 3.9 terawatt-hours or the equivalent of removing over 480,000 households from the grid. Think of it: that is roughly equivalent to taking a city the size of Ottawa off the grid for home electricity use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The regulations under the Energy Efficiency Act are the cornerstone of our proposals on energy efficiency. They will be cost-effective and provide lasting benefits, and they will help Canadian business compete in a global marketplace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me close by saying we are focusing on much more than standby power consumption. More than 30 products now have regulatory standards based on the Energy Efficiency Act. Under the new regulatory agenda, there will be new minimum energy performance standards for another 20 products. These new products range from commercial refrigeration to traffic signals, from commercial clothes washers to battery chargers and from lighting products to industrial heaters. We will also increase the stringency of the existing standards for 10 products, ranging from residential furnaces to dishwashers to air conditioners.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to this legislation, Canada will be a world leader in terms of the number of products that are subject to energy-efficiency standards, and we will regulate 50 products, representing 80% of the energy used in households.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The savings from these standards are enormous and will help lower not only energy costs for Canadians individually, but also energy use on a national scale. And that means cleaner air. I urge hon. members to join me in taking the first steps in achieving this outcome and support a bill that will have such a major impact on energy consumption.</div>

    </p><a name="Para325120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained in my speech, this government's approach is as follows. First, what is the impact on individual Canadians? Individual actions add up. With all the devices Canadians use, standby power for example, it is a waste of energy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem that has to be dealt with now. Instead of setting up incentive programs that do not work or that cost too much for the results they produce, we are proceeding with regulations immediately.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been incentives. But those incentives should have produced results that measured up to a minimum standard. The government has taken a different direction and intends to introduce strict, binding regulations that apply to everyone. An incentive approach to this serious issue that concerns all Canadians is no longer enough. The time has come for a mandatory approach.</div>

I had a number of questions to ask the minister regarding an exchange we had, but unfortunately, the minister has chosen not to respond to me. I would say I am let down by that, but I am not surprised. The minister has pretty much established a reputation as an absentee landlord on most cultural issues since she was appointed to the portfolio.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I had raised was about the minister choosing to go to Charlotte Bell, a key member of the CanWest Global team, to flog tickets for her fundraiser. To refresh everyone's memory, Charlotte Bell is also a key person for broadcasters on the eve of a major broadcast review that is being planned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to be very clear about what we are talking about here. This is not a matter of snooping through the election donations of a member to see who gave money. Certainly, members are going to receive money from all sources, and that is perfectly understandable. What is happening here is an ethical lapse in judgment. This is the question that I had for the minister, and of course she is not here to respond to that lapse in judgment, but the minister did not see anything wrong in asking a broadcast executive who has a mandate to influence government policy to promote a fundraiser at the same time as the same industry is pushing for major regulatory changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we recall in <i>Hansard</i> the response from the minister at the time, she did not think there was anything wrong. She said she did not break any laws. In fact, it was the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Treasury Board president </A> who had to intervene. He stood and said that he would not allow big money to intervene in the political process. Right after that the fundraiser was squashed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question still remains, being that the minister had this lapse in judgment, how is it affecting her decisions on key issues?</div>
    </p><a name="Para325229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question that has to be asked and to which I would like to get a response from the Conservative Party. Were the cheques cashed? </div>
    </p><a name="Para325230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister who has been absent on major issues in terms of her portfolio in fact has, I would say, become pretty much a fireside liquidation specialist for cultural issues. What has she done? </div>
    </p><a name="Para325231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has taken $160 million out of the aboriginal languages fund. Certainly the Cree and the Dogrib are not going to the fundraiser. </div>
    </p><a name="Para325232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shut down 12 out of the 16 status of women centres. Certainly the battered women were not being invited out by Charlotte Bell.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made a 25% cut to the museums assistance program. We understand that the new plan brought forward is that the portrait gallery, our national heritage, will be given to the oil industry to be set up in its boardrooms. There were fundraisers in boardrooms; now national heritage is being put into the boardrooms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no move to renew the Canadian television fund. There has been no move to renew the media fund. There has been no move to renew the independent video fund. There has been no action on a plan for the CBC. Yet, major issues are being brought forward by broadcasters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to sum up by saying the government has made it clear it does not have a hands-off policy with the CRTC. The industry minister has already overturned the CRTC decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end by quoting a statement that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78944,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78944&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage</A> made very clear in a recent hearing with CRTC president Charles Dauphin, that the minister was the captain of the good ship CRTC. He said, “I think we are in agreement that you take direction from the government. The CRTC takes direction from the government, from the minister and from the government overall and your submission says that the commission reports to Parliament through the Minister of Canadian Heritage. That's the way it is”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, why did the minister have such an ethical lapse in judgment in allowing a major television executive to host her fundraiser? Again, why has the minister been dodging a clear answer to the people of the cultural sector and to this House of Parliament?</div>

It really puzzles me why the hon. member cannot take yes for answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, let me start by saying, as I stated earlier, that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78766,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78766&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage</A> is perhaps the most qualified <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78766,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78766&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage</A> that this country has ever seen. She had a distinguished career in the broadcasting industry for some 30 years and has a keen appreciation for Canada's various cultural industries, the important role they play in telling the Canadian story, and their contribution to the economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a well respected figure in the broadcasting industry, the minister has developed many close personal and professional relationships with people in the industry. She is well liked and supported by those people because she is a professional woman who has a wonderful reputation as a decent human being, which is why I deeply resent that member's innuendo.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is well liked. She is well respected, notwithstanding his comments. Her supporters in the broadcast industry support the minister because of who she is and her abilities as a person, not simply as a <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78766,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78766&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage</A>. It is interesting that they supported her when she was a private citizen who planned to run in the next election in 2004. They supported her when she was an opposition MP in 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today they continue to support her for the same reasons they had in 2004 and 2005, but to the surprise of the member, I am sure, she was not a minister at the time. The minister clearly was not selling access to her portfolio in 2004 and 2005 in those events, nor was she doing it in 2006. Rather, she was being supported by those same people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of particular note that what the minister did, because there was an appearance and an appearance only and a perception and a perception only, was to immediately cancel the event, because of the appearance and because of the perception. I recognize that this was not common practice by the Liberals when they were in power, but this minister is a person of great, high personal repute, and therefore she is not going to do anything that is going to be negative to that. This is why I particularly and deeply resent the comments and the innuendo brought forth by this member. I think that is beneath him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear. No one can, and no one needs to, purchase access to this minister, because in fact they cannot. Perhaps the member opposite will appreciate one particular meeting. Canadian Music Creators Coalition and Barenaked Ladies band member Steve Page, who is a high-profile supporter of the member's party, the NDP, wished to meet the minister and express his concerns to her on an issue of importance to them and immediately was given access. She is a minister who is very pleased to permit access. The minister met with them. That is not shocking or unusual, as the minister meets with concerned stakeholders all the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para325245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing tawdry here is the obsession of the member opposite with my minister's performance when she has acted with a level of accountability and ethics that makes me, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and this government proud.</div>

I have no intention of hurting anyone's feelings here. I would also like to make it clear for the record that there is no innuendo here. There was not an appearance of conflict. Charlotte Bell from CanWest Global was handing out on the letterhead of the Conservative Party on the eve of a major television review.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hoping that the parliamentary secretary would be able to rebut many of my charges by giving us some facts, by showing us where the minister stood up and fought for culture, because I cannot find it. I would love to find that she stood up for culture. I had great respect for the minister when she was the parliamentary critic. She spoke out on many cultural issues. She spoke out about needing funding for CBC. I have not seen her do that since she became minister. She talked about how unfair it was that the cultural sector was not getting proper funding. She has not done that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come here hoping that she would be here to defend herself, that she would stand up and tell this House that she is speaking up and fighting for the cultural sector. Instead we have the record: $160 million pulled out of aboriginal languages, the women's centres shut down, and no commitments on television, video, the CBC or any other sector. If we talk to the museums across this country, they are going to tell us that the minister has been absent on key issues where she has been needed. We need a champion of culture and--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an interview with the <i>Hill Times,</i> the member said regarding the 2005 fundraiser that even as an opposition critic, a member of Parliament must keep a distance from stakeholders who could lobby on the prospect that the opposition critic could become the cabinet minister. That is what he said. It is very interesting, because according to the Elections Canada website, he accepted $250 from the Canadian Association of Broadcasters. Clearly, he did not believe that the NDP could possibly form the government or that he could possibly become a cabinet minister. If he had believed he could have become a cabinet minister, why would he have accepted the $250?</div>
