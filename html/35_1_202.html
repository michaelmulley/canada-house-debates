	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-326, an act to amend the 
Canada Post Corporation Act (membership of board of 
management).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is simply to 
ensure that, in the future, Canada Post Corporation will consider 
regional development in fulfilling its mandate. We realized that 
this corporation was very focused on production and did not 
necessarily take into account the development of each part of the 
country.
<P>
	Changing the membership of the board of management would 
ensure representation from every province and territory in 
Canada. This would also prevent the concentration that may 
occur when the people sitting on Canada Post's board of 
management look after their own interests instead of those of 
people from the various provinces. That is the purpose of this 
bill.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move that the second report of the Standing 
Committee on Industry presented to the House on Tuesday, 
October 18, 1994 be concurred in.
<P>
	It is with considerable pleasure that I rise to debate this 
motion. The committee had a very successful time in debating 
various parts of the access to capital for small business. Many of 
the things we talked about had to do with the lending 
institutions, in particular the chartered banks, trust companies, 
credit unions and groups of that sort.
<P>
	The committee came up with 22 distinct recommendations. 
This is what we are talking about. The recommendations that the 
committee came forth with are the ones that ought to be 
concurred in. It is a pleasure for me to say that the banks have 
already moved in some of those directions.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Take for example recommendation No. 3. The committee 
recommends that the joint Industry Canada committee in 
consultation with the Canadian Bankers Association draft a code 
of conduct. It would explain to customers in plain language the 
information a loan applicant must disclose. There would be a 
clear explanation of reasons for refusing a loan, a commitment 
to guide customers to alternative sources of financing, and a 
commitment to provide an internal complaints handling 
mechanism.
<P>
	The Canadian Bankers Association met with the committee in 
the earlier part of this year. It indicated clearly to us that it had 
established that kind of code of conduct. At first the association 
said it would be very difficult if not impossible to bring about 
some kind of standard of behaviour as far as treating the 
customers and the banks were concerned.
<P>
	A lot of information is available now. It has been exchanged 
among the various branches of the banks. In addition to that, 
what is called an ADR which is a dispute resolution mechanism 
has been brought into being. It is an alternate dispute resolution 
mechanism that has been brought into being.
<P>
	The committee also suggested that perhaps this was not good 
enough. It thought that probably there ought to be an 
independent ombudsman established. Recommendation No. 5 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee recommends that the government establish an independent 
office of the bank ombudsman to investigate complaints of breach of duty or 
maladministration by the banks. As in the United Kingdom, the ombudsman 
should have the power to require banks to pay compensation to complainants 
for financial loss, inconvenience and stress.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The experience of the banks in Britain where this independent 
ombudsman has been operating for a number of years has been 
very salutary. It has helped small business people. It has helped 
various other people in the business world to deal with their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12644"> 12644 </A></B>
<P>
banks more successfully. It has also made the banks a little more 
humane in the way they deal with their customers.
<P>
	When we brought this to the attention of the Canadian 
Bankers Association, it thought that perhaps there should not be 
an independent ombudsman who is outside the banking 
community but rather it should appoint its own ombudsman.
<P>
	The Toronto-Dominion Bank has one of those people who 
was the leader in the Canadian chartered banking industry to do 
just that. It is apparently working very well.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce now has this kind of person on a full salary at the 
senior vice-president level. This person deals with complaints 
that various business people have with regard to their loans or 
other operations with regard to the bank.
<P>
	There are other recommendations from the committee as well. 
We need to recognize that the committee proposes to continue 
monitoring small business access to capital by calling one or 
more banks as witnesses every quarter to review their 
performance in lending to small businesses. That process has 
begun.
<P>
	The banks have indicated that indeed their performance with 
regard to lending money to small businesses has improved. At 
least they are prepared to tell the committee what exactly their 
operation is with regard to these activities.
<P>
	We go beyond that. We have asked the superintendent of 
financial institutions together with Statistics Canada and the 
Bank of Canada to develop a new format for the collection, 
compilation and publication of statistics on bank lending to 
small business. These statistics should be based not only on the 
size and type of loan but also on the nature of the borrower, 
including gender, employment, sales, major sector of operations 
and municipality. These statistics should be reported quarterly.
<P>
	It was very interesting to watch the reaction of the banks to 
this recommendation. They first said: ``That is impossible. We 
cannot give you those kinds of numbers. We do not have those 
kinds of numbers. It would be a horrendous expenditure in order 
to give you these kinds of numbers. It cannot be done''.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	It is a great pleasure for me to report that in the quarterly 
review at the end of April the banks not only said they have the 
information, they are prepared to give it to the office of the 
superintendent of financial institutions and to the committee. 
That is a great move forward. It shows the kind of concurrence 
that we see in the industry which the committee had in mind in 
the first place.
<P>
	It is not so much what the government does, it is what industry 
does which makes business run better. In the final analysis 
business makes this country run. Government provides the 
opportunity, the environment and the parameters within which 
business can operate more easily, more fluidly, more efficiently, 
more effectively and more successfully.
<P>
	We need to recognize it is not government that creates 
employment, it is not government that makes the economy grow, 
it is business that makes the economy grow. In particular, it is 
small business that makes the economy grow. In the last five 
years 85 per cent of new jobs created in Canada were created by 
small business. Let us recognize the significance that small 
business has in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	The committee goes on to suggest leasing should be 
encouraged. It urges the government to ensure that tax measures 
and other programs do not discriminate against this method of 
financing. There are situations in which the government through 
its income tax policy has discouraged this form of financing 
small business.
<P>
	Often small businesses do not have the capital resources to 
expend huge amounts of money for the financing of capital 
expenditures. Very often, if they can lease the equipment, it is 
far more salutary and allows them to get on with their business. 
The money would be available for the operation, rather than 
having it tied up in capital expenditures or equity.
<P>
	The committee goes on to recommend that the federal 
government establish a limited working capital guarantee for 
small and medium sized business exporters. Such a program 
should be self-financing and priced in a manner that is 
commensurate with the risk. Too often it seems to have been the 
philosophy or the modus operandi of governments that in order 
to help business they should give them something.
<P>
	The committee does not agree that is what should happen. The 
government should create the environment which we talked 
about a moment ago and allow them to finance their businesses. 
If businesses need seed capital, that should be returned at a rate 
of interest which is commensurate with the risk involved in that 
particular situation.
<P>
	We also need to recognize that the reference is to exporters, 
particularly small business exporters. Today most exports are by 
a very small number of businesses. I believe that approximately 
100 businesses control 85 per cent of the export market. In other 
words, small business has not had as large a portion of the export 
market as it should have. If it did it would help the Canadian 
economy to grow. It would increase the global participation and 
competition of Canadian business in the world marketplace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12645"> 12645 </A></B>
<P>
	The report goes on to suggest that the government review the 
Small Businesses Loans Act. To the credit of the government, 
that is exactly what it has done. It ought to be commended for 
that. It has begun to concur with the recommendations of the 
report. If I remember correctly, the Small Businesses Loans Act 
ceiling was moved from $3 billion to $12 billion. The only 
difficulty is that in the past the government has had to write 
off about $100 million in bad loans. Does that mean that with 
a ceiling of $12 billion the bad loans will increase to four times 
that amount?
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	There have been, from the small business associations and 
also from the bankers, some concern that some of the provisions 
of the new small loans act amendments create an additional 
charge which may discourage some of the small businesses from 
taking advantage of the provisions of the small loans act as it has 
been amended.
<P>
	Therefore we need to be very careful that when one moves to 
concur in these kinds of recommendations that one not move in 
such a way that the operation of implementing that 
recommendation mitigates against the purpose, intent and spirit 
of that recommendation.
<P>
	The committee recommends further that the mandate of the 
Federal Business Development Bank be confirmed and 
refocused as a complementary lender to small and medium sized 
businesses and that it be authorized to use new financial 
instruments to fulfil its mandate.
<P>
	I am sure members of the House noticed that yesterday the 
Minister of Industry introduced Bill C-91. The effect of that bill 
is to do precisely what this recommendation suggests be done. 
That makes a committee feel its work is very significant and has 
not been ignored. The government has recognized the hard work 
of the committee.
<P>
	We need to recognize in detail exactly how the business 
development bank, under the new name of the business 
development bank of Canada, will operate. Will the operations 
of that bank become an extension of the Canadian federal 
treasury or, as the minister implied yesterday, will the capital 
used for loans come from private sources of one kind or another.
<P>
	The new sources of capital that the Business Development 
Bank of Canada needs to look at is that money that exists in the 
private sector today and money that can be patient, particularly 
for new, innovative ventures. It should also include the high tech 
areas where the science and technology involved in those 
businesses is very far reaching, very expensive and does not 
create an immediate return. It requires a lot of seed capital for 
the intellectual background, the experimentation, the building 
of prototypes and things of that sort before it actually goes into 
active and profitable production.
<P>
	The Federal Business Development Bank, or under the new 
name of the business development bank of Canada, could form 
and fill a particular niche in our economy.
<P>
	The difficulty we need to guard against is it not becoming 
another crown corporation that is a drain on the taxpayer. It 
should be a self-sufficient, self-financing organization. To 
date, the operation of the Federal Business Development Bank 
has been a profitable venture and that needs to be continued in 
the future. I hope that the kinds of things that Bill C-91 
envisages will indeed take place in that regard.
<P>
	However, we are not done yet. This committee did a lot of 
very hard work. It dealt not only with the chartered banks which 
it said are doing a reasonably good job. It could do a lot better in 
some places but is that not true of all of us? We can all improve. 
We would like to get the banks to take their responsibilities and 
carry out their mandates a little bit better.
<P>
	I now want to move outside the banks and into the trust and 
loan companies. The committee recommends that the trust and 
loan companies act be amended to remove the arbitrary capital 
requirements for the establishment of a trust company and the 
acquisition of full commercial lending powers. The 
superintendent of financial institutions should instead establish 
guidelines setting out conditions for the establishment of new 
federally chartered trust companies and for the acquisition of 
full commercial lending powers. Institutions meeting these 
guidelines would be able to operate in Canada and make 
commercial loans using the prudent portfolio approach.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	It is precisely on the last phrase ``using the prudent portfolio 
approach'' that I wish to spend a few moments. In the last 
number of years we have seen the collapse of some very major 
financial institutions, one of which was Confederation Life, that 
probably everyone in the House remembers only too well.
<P>
	I remember the appearance before the committee of the 
superintendent of financial institutions and the questions the 
committee members asked this individual. How was it possible 
that a major financial institution like this could collapse in 
Canada? It is very serious when such an institution collapses.
<P>
	The superintendent of financial institutions has come under 
the scrutiny of the auditor general. On Friday of this week he 
was reported as saying in the <I>Financial Post</I>: ``The auditor 
general and Ottawa's financial institutions watchdog are at 
odds''. We have the auditor general on the one hand and the 
superintendent of financial institutions on the other at odds over 
when federal regulators should intervene to deal with troubled 
Canadian trust and insurance companies.
<P>
	The superintendent of financial institutions has been given 
the responsibility by Parliament on behalf of the people of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12646"> 12646 </A></B>
<P>
Canada to assure the financial soundness of  banking 
institutions, insurance companies, credit unions and various 
other financial institutions.
<P>
	The auditor general has been given the responsibility to 
investigate how successfully the office of the superintendent is 
doing its job. The superintendent specifically says: ``I and the 
auditor general do not agree what my job is''. Who is going to do 
the job, the auditor general or the superintendent of financial 
institutions?
<P>
	The article goes on to explain what some of the issues might 
be. For example, the auditor general portrayed OSFI as 
sometimes being too slow to intervene with financial companies 
in trouble. The superintendent of financial institutions, John 
Palmer, who assumed the post last September, disputed the 
regulatory approach and said: ``Your officials appear to favour a 
more mechanical system in which specific regulatory 
intervention would be required when specific numerical 
thresholds are violated. In our view it is essential to preserve the 
role of judgment in determining how and when to intervene''.
<P>
	If the Superintendent of Financial Institutions is to exercise 
judgment without looking at the numbers, there is no question 
that can put us into a lot of potential difficulty. This is a good 
example of where an individual needs a very hard head to 
understand the numbers and to make sure that the balance 
statements, the equity position and the financial situation of 
financial institutions are sound.
<P>
	However, he needs to show a compassion that recognizes 
when situations have developed, when conditions have changed. 
He needs to be somewhat kind and give them some time to 
balance the sheet again if there is an indication a change can take 
place and the institution can become financially solvent if he 
had a little patience. It should never be done without a very hard 
headed look at the dollars and cents and to make sure the 
institution is sound and that management is capable of turning 
the institution around.
<P>
	In the last little while we have seen financial institutions 
which were on the brink of bankruptcy long before anything was 
done to call them to account.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	It is to the credit of some of the other people who are coming 
back now and saying that the confederation life policy holders 
are to get back 70 cents on the dollar and that perhaps in some 
cases they will get back substantially more. It is absolutely 
tremendous that this can happen in Canada. The critical 
situation is that this should never have been be allowed to 
happen in the first place. That is why we need to concur in the 
recommendations this committee has brought forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask my colleague for a point of clarification 
regarding his reference to FBDB.
<P>
	Many times in the House we hear discussions with regard to 
regional development grants from the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, FORD-Quebec, and western economic 
diversification. What is his feeling about the role of these 
regional economic development agencies and that of FBDB? 
Could they be rolled into one or is there a role for each in this 
country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> The whole concept behind regional 
development has evolved to some degree. We need to recognize 
that the implementation of the regional economic development 
agencies has subsidized businesses that could not make it on 
their own. It has created artificial competition between 
businesses that were in existence and new ones created across 
the street so that neither of them could succeed profitably. It has 
given industries an artificial cushion, because it has not required 
that the money that was given to them be paid back.
<P>
	If we are to have regional development it should be done in a 
fair and open marketplace with competition. It ought to be done 
in manner such that all businesses know what is going on and 
they are all on a level playing field and competing fairly with 
one another and whatever money is given ought to be paid back 
with a reasonable rate of return.
<P>
	These are precisely the kinds of things the Federal Business 
Development Bank was supposed to be doing in the past when it 
was the lender of last resort. If that kind of thing continues, if 
regional development agencies develop a flat playing field, 
create competition, and require the money to be paid back, then 
there is no reason they could not be rolled into one. The bankers' 
criteria of lending money could be applied and the whole 
business would run a lot better than it does at the present time. I 
suppose the end result of that statement is they could be rolled 
into one, but under certain conditions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Okanagan Centre for his 
concern about small business and for bringing this to the 
attention of the House, despite the fact that we thought the 
government would be bringing forward debate on Bill C-88, a 
bill that would deal with internal trade barriers and hopefully 
remove some of those.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would expound on whether the report 
deals with the harm caused to small business because of the 
trade barriers we have in Canada between provinces. It has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12647"> 12647 </A></B>
<P>
determined that these trade barriers cost our country $6 billion 
to $8 billion every year, and I suspect the brunt of that cost is 
borne by small business.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to relate to the House what the 
harm of these trade barriers is to small business and whether the 
report does make any recommendations, and also whether Bill 
C-88 does go far enough in bringing an end to these trade 
barriers, which are so harmful to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member certainly knows 
how to ask complicated questions, but they are very significant 
questions.
<P>
	The important thing is that one of the greatest hindrances to 
small businesses developing is the existence of trade barriers 
across Canada. They are a multitude in number. I believe at the 
last count there were somewhere between 500 and 750 of these 
trade barriers.
<P>
	Estimates vary as to how much they actually cost. In some 
cases people argue that it is about $5 billion a year to the 
Canadian economy, in other cases they will say that it is $7 
billion, depending on which set of figures is used. That means 
the average family in Canada spends $1,000 or $3,500 per year 
more than it would pay for the same goods and services if the 
trade barriers did not exist.
<P>
	One of the embarrassing things for us as Canadians and 
parliamentarians is that it is often easier to trade with other 
countries, in particular our neighbour to the south, than it is to 
trade across Canada. How do we bring these kinds of things 
together? It seems so stupid to tell someone it is easier to trade, 
for example, between Vancouver and Spokane. It is wide open. 
There is an organization called Cascadia, which promotes this 
kind of economic development. It is so easy to do, because the 
trade barriers between Canada and the United States have 
virtually been eliminated. And now with NAFTA that goes all 
over the place.
<P>
	There was a principle announced in the red book that states 
that Canada should be unified. By not dealing with the internal 
trade barriers we are in fact disunifying Canada and creating a 
situation where trade is now north and south but not east and 
west.
<P>
	That is one of the great barriers for small business. We would 
like to be strong at home first before we go abroad, but that is not 
an opportunity today. We have to become strong internationally 
and then we can perhaps afford to go over these trade barriers 
within Canada. It is a reverse, backwards kind of thing. It hurts 
our feelings of patriotism. It frustrates our feelings of economic 
unity as well as political unity. It is those kinds of things that we 
have to tear down so that we can help each other and feel 
important as Canadians-as important in Nova Scotia as we are 
in British Columbia, as we are in Ontario, as we are in Quebec, 
as we are in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and so on across 
Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member asked a very good question with regard to 
those things. Does the federal trade agreement that is now before 
the House and is supposed to be implemented through Bill C-88 
do that? It does not.
<P>
	We will hear from various members on this side of the House 
who will say clearly where this trade agreement falls short. It 
does not deal with the very basic issues.
<P>
	The idea is a very good one. Let us recognize this right off the 
top. Recognizing that internal trade barriers in Canada are a 
significant problem is very important. All our premiers have 
now recognized that is a problem. The issue, however, is that 
although they have recognized there is a problem they have not 
solved the problem. When we get to the dispute resolution 
mechanism, what do we get? We get the opportunity that if they 
cannot resolve the conflict then they can retaliate. That is 
exactly where we are today. What have we achieved?
<P>
	The agreement has to have some teeth in it. I submit that it 
does not have those teeth.
<P>
	In answer to my hon. colleague's question of whether the 
trade agreement does those things, it moves in the right 
direction but it does not go anywhere near far enough. Does it 
help build the unity of Canada? No, it does not. Does it hurt 
small business? Yes, it does. It is an embarrassment to many of 
us because we can trade more easily north and south than we can 
east and west.

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (for Minister of Foreign 
Affairs), Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-87, an act to implement the 
convention on the prohibition of the development, production, 
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their 
destruction, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs I am pleased to initiate the debate on Bill 
C-87, an act to implement the convention on the prohibition of 
the development, production,  stockpiling and use of chemical 
weapons and on their destruction.
<P>
	This draft legislation represents the achievement of what has 
been for successive Canadian governments one of our most 
important priorities in the arms control and disarmament field, a 
multilateral agreement on a global and comprehensive ban on 
chemical weapons.
<P>
	Such an agreement is of special importance for Canadians. It 
was almost 80 years ago that Canadian soldiers were among the 
victims of the first gas attack in Ypres Salient in April 1915. 
There are still alive today Canadians who remember with horror 
the effect of such weapons on their friends and comrades, their 
husbands, brothers and fathers.
<P>
	Having let this horrendous genie out of the bottle, the 
international community has ever since sought ways to control 
and suppress it. The Geneva protocol of 1925 was the first such 
attempt but its scope was effectively limited to a ban on the first 
use of chemical weapons and many states, Canada included, felt 
obliged to develop and stockpile such weapons against the 
possibility that they might be necessary to retaliate against 
future attacks with chemical weapons.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth, who will be 
speaking after me, has done a lot of research in that area. Hon. 
members may wish to consult with him for more information.
<P>
	While our troops in subsequent wars were spared the horrors 
of further chemical attacks, neither the Geneva protocol nor 
mounting international condemnation of these weapons 
prevented other states from using them in other wars, most 
recently in the Iran-Iraq war. Even more monstrous, some have 
gone so far as to use chemical weapons against defenceless 
civilians. Who can ever forget the shocking pictures of the 
Iranian and Kurdish victims of Iraqi chemical weapons or the 
terror inflicted on Israeli citizens by Saddam Hussein's threats 
during the gulf war to rain chemical weapons down on Israel.
<P>
	Spurred on by such barbarities, negotiators at the conference 
on disarmament in Geneva redoubled their efforts to conclude a 
multilateral agreement on chemical weapons which would 
forever remove this scourge. Canada is proud to have made a 
major contribution to these efforts, from the days in 1983 when a 
Canadian, Ambassador Donald McPhail, chaired the committee 
that developed the first outline of such a treaty to the successful 
conclusion of negotiations in 1992 when Canada was in the first 
rank of those pressing most strongly for a truly effective ban.
<P>
	The chemical weapons convention resulting from these 
negotiations which opened for signature in January 1993 
represents a major multilateral success. For the first time a 
whole category of what are known as weapons of mass 
destruction is to be eliminated. All stock piles of chemical 
weapons are to be destroyed under international supervision, 
along with the facilities which produced  them. A verification 
regime which is global, comprehensive and effective is to be set 
up to ensure such weapons will never be developed again.
<P>
	The convention is unique in a number of respects. Not only 
does it oblige states parties to destroy all existing stocks of 
chemical weapons and the facilities which produced them 
within a set time frame and under close international 
supervision, it also establishes a system of verification and 
inspection which is by far the most rigorous ever developed in a 
multilateral agreement.
<P>
	Moreover, it does not just ban any future development of 
chemical weapons but seeks to safeguard against clandestine 
chemical weapon production through international monitoring 
and inspection of all facilities which might be used for such 
activity. Again uniquely, it extends this regime into the global 
civilian chemical industry. The basis of this verification regime 
of civilian industry is set out in three schedules or lists of toxic 
chemicals which either have been used as chemical weapons or 
are chemical weapon precursors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12650"> 12650 </A></B>
<P>
	Facilities working with such chemicals will annually report 
on their activities to their governments and through them to the 
international monitoring and inspection organization being set 
up in The Hague, the organization for the prohibition of 
chemical weapons, or OPCW. If their activities exceed certain 
thresholds they will be liable to inspection by international 
inspectors.
<P>
	The convention's overview of industry extends even further 
because certain facilities which produce what are called 
unscheduled discrete organic chemicals, particularly those 
which contain phosphorus, sulphur or fluorine, can be adapted 
to produce chemical weapons.
<P>
	The convention also requires these facilities to report on their 
production activities and provides for the future development of 
a system of random inspections of such facilities. Thus the 
scope of the convention extends beyond chemical and 
pharmaceutical industries and covers facilities producing 
pesticides, fertilizers, paints and coatings, textiles and 
lubricants.
<P>
	Given the confidential nature of some of the information 
being reported by industry, the convention has its own 
provisions for protecting such information and requires states 
parties to abide by those provisions. The convention also 
requires states parties to institute restrictions on the export and 
import of schedule chemicals with states not party to the 
convention.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the most novel element of the convention is the 
provision allowing for states parties to have the right to demand 
short notice or no right of refusal inspections called challenge 
inspections of any place, whether government or civilian, where 
they believe activities are being carried out incompatible with 
the obligations and goals of the convention.
<P>
	In another departure from general practice the convention 
obligates states parties to pass penal  legislation that not only 
encompasses activities on their own territory but also prohibits 
their citizens from undertaking forbidden activities outside their 
territory.
<P>
	The convention has its own sanctions regime, although it also 
recognizes the pre-eminent authority of the United Nations 
security council regarding mandatory sanctions in the case of 
serious violations of the convention.
<P>
	In view of the breadth and complexity of the convention, the 
Canadian government, like many other signatories, has given 
very close consideration to how its obligations shall be 
implemented in Canada.
<P>
	Fortunately whereas the convention is 160-odd pages long, 
the draft legislation resulting from that consideration now 
before us is barely more than one-tenth that length and yet 
encompasses all the obligations that arise out of the convention 
relevant for Canada.
<P>
	As Canada does not possess chemical weapons or chemical 
weapon production facilities, the related provisions of the 
convention do not pertain to Canada. Instead, the main impact 
on Canada arises from those provisions concerned with industry 
activities. The act's central provision is to ban completely 
anyone's activity relating to anything with chemical weapons in 
exactly the same terms as are used in the convention.
<P>
	Also, as provided in the convention, these provisions ban the 
use of riot control agents as a method of warfare. Operationally 
speaking, as required by the convention, the draft legislation 
authorizes the Minister of Foreign Affairs to designate officials 
to act as Canada's national authority which will serve as the 
national focal point for liaison with the organization for the 
prohibition of chemical weapons, OPCW, and other states 
parties, collect the required information for the affected 
industries and transmit it to the OPCW and facilitate 
international inspections of Canadian facilities.
<P>
	The draft legislation then spells out clearly the conditions 
under which the required information will be obtained; the right 
of the international inspection teams to conduct inspections in 
Canada in accordance with the provisions of the convention, and 
the roles and responsibilities of the national authority in 
facilitating such inspections. Because of the need to protect 
confidential information, it contains appropriate provisions to 
do so. It extends existing controls on chemicals by specifying all 
the chemicals on the convention's three schedules will be 
subject to the authority of the Export and Import Permits Act.
<P>
	It institutes penal provisions and applies those to both 
activities on Canadian territory and activities by Canadian 
citizens outside of Canada. It further makes clear the 
enforcement of the proposed act will be conducted under the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	It provides for appropriate regulations to be prepared 
concerning inter alia the collection of the required data and the 
procedures under which the national authority will carry out its 
assigned responsibilities.
<P>
	In considering this draft legislation, the government's first 
concern has been to ensure all of its obligations under the 
convention have been fully met. At the same time, however, the 
government has also paid very close attention to the 
convention's impact on the affected Canadian industries and has 
sought to achieve maximum effectiveness with the minimum 
amount of interference in the legitimate activities of those 
industries.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Fortunately in this regard the government has benefited from 
several years of close consultations with the most affected 
industries both during the course of the negotiation of the 
convention and in the preparations for the convention's 
implementation in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12651"> 12651 </A></B>
<P>
	Throughout, the response from industry has always been 
positive and constructive. It was the Canadian Chemical 
Producers' Association which produced one of the first papers 
submitted to the conference on disarmament concerning the 
issue of confidentiality.
<P>
	In 1990, thanks to the co-operation of the Canadian 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association and Merck Frosst, 
government officials were able to conduct a trial inspection of 
the Merck Frosst facility near Montreal to test the verification 
provisions of the convention. Both associations provided 
representatives to participate in annual industry consultations 
with negotiators in Geneva.
<P>
	In our preparations to implement the convention in Canada, 
we have continued to consult closely with industry on the impact 
of the convention by distributing information brochures, 
briefing industry associations and contributing articles for 
industry publications, conveying information seminars and 
sending questionnaires and information material to some 2,100 
companies across Canada to help determine which companies 
will be affected by the convention.
<P>
	Almost without exception the response from industry has 
continued to be very constructive and encouraging. We 
confidently expect that as we proceed with this draft legislation 
and its associated regulations, this high level of co-operation 
with industry will continue.
<P>
	The government believes the draft legislation before us is not 
only appropriate and necessary but represents the most balanced 
and cost effective means of implementing the convention 
obligations in Canada.
<P>
	We all recoiled with horror some two months ago when in an 
unprecedented act of senseless barbarity, madmen unleashed 
chemical weapons on unsuspecting Tokyo commuters one early 
spring morning. We may not be able to prevent individuals from 
committing such unspeakable acts, but with the successful 
passage of the proposed legislation we can at least hope to 
control and deny them access to the materials for such weapons. 
This  morning I was very pleased to read in the news that the 
police in Japan arrested those responsible for the nerve gas 
attack on Tokyo's subway.
<P>
	With all party co-operation, which we will be getting in 
consulting with the official opposition and the third party, all 
three parties would like to get this legislation through as quickly 
as possible. When we do, hopefully the convention and the 
legislation will prevent the production, stockpiling and use of 
the kind of substance used on the Tokyo subways.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in this House today on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to 
speak on Bill C-87, an act to implement the convention on the 
prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use 
of chemical weapons and on their destruction.
<P>
	We appreciate that the convention is the result of a long and 
complex negotiation process that took nearly 20 years.
<P>
	For more than 100 years, the international community has 
been seeking to outlaw these weapons, or at least their use, 
because they are inhumane and of rather limited military value.
<P>
	We should also rejoice over the fact that the convention is the 
first multilateral disarmament agreement prohibiting an entire 
class of mass destruction weapons. Under this convention, it is 
illegal not only to produce, but also to acquire, stockpile, 
transfer, use or engage in military preparations to use chemical 
weapons or assist anyone in any activity prohibited under the 
convention.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	The prohibition applies not only to chemical agents but also to 
their vectors and any equipment intended for use in relation to 
chemical weapons.
<P>
	We are pretty happy with the wording of the convention, 
which strikes a balance in a mix of areas, such as the protection 
of sensitive activities and ready access for inspection teams.
<P>
	The convention provides for a challenge inspection 
mechanism while at the same time protecting sensitive and 
legitimate activities by putting time limits on the inspections, 
and by providing for restricted access and measures to deter 
abuse.
<P>
	A balance was also struck between the need to maintain 
control over exports to suspect states and the will to liberalize 
the chemical products trade. Members of the Australian group, 
which includes Canada, and which monitors the proliferation of 
chemical weapons and defines the guidelines for controlling 
exports to countries deemed to have chemical weapons, pledged 
to review their policy and eliminate controls in the case of those 
states which fully comply with the convention.
<P>
	Another balance was struck between the requirement to 
destroy chemical weapons within prescribed time  frames and 
the need to take economic implications into account. All those 
states which own chemical weapons will have ten years to 
destroy both the weapons and the production facilities. 
However, the convention allows for an extension of up to ten 
years, under more stringent controls which are tantamount to 
turning over the weapons and facilities to the international 
community.
<P>
	The destruction of a chemical weapons production facility 
costs ten times more than its construction. Consequently, we are 
concerned about the financial implications, for some states, of 
this requirement. The problem is very real, even though the 
convention provides for the temporary conversion of some 
production facilities into destruction facilities, where this is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12652"> 12652 </A></B>
<P>
feasible and cost effective, thus making it possible to declare 
such production facilities as having been converted.
<P>
	Indeed, one of the problems related to the implementation of 
the convention will be the destruction of arsenals, which is a 
complex and extremely costly operation. The cost of destroying 
the American arsenal of these weapons is estimated at $8 
billion. Russia, which does not have the funds, has 40,000 to 
60,000 tonnes of substances to destroy, which is quite the task 
and will undoubtedly take over 10 years and then again, only if 
western countries lend a hand.
<P>
	By the way, we are not entirely satisfied with the verification 
system. However, we realize that they are the fruit of several 
years of negotiation and that they strike a balance between the 
need to have an efficient means of checking whether countries 
are respecting the convention and the legitimate need to 
maintain secrecy in defence and industrial matters which are not 
related to the prohibited chemical weapons.
<P>
	We would have nevertheless preferred much stricter controls. 
The current convention is perhaps the best agreement possible 
under the circumstances. Regardless, we must admit that the 
Convention does contain the most rigorous controls ever 
included in a multilateral agreement. They permit the 
organization to confirm that substances and chemical weapons 
factories have actually been destroyed, to monitor very closely 
all operations authorized to produce certain toxic chemical 
products, to keep a database on the world chemical industry and, 
at the request of the signing states, to make inspections.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	In addition, the on-site challenge inspection will in fact 
permit any signing state to request a universal inspection of a 
suspicious operation in another country by the secretariat of the 
organization and a multilateral inspection team.
<P>
	We have concluded that the text of the convention is to be 
criticized for lacking coherence and logic in certain areas. In 
some cases, for example facilities used to stockpile or to 
manufacture chemical weapons, it goes into the greatest 
descriptive detail, and in others, for  example the clauses 
prohibiting the development of chemical weapons, it fails to go 
into enough detail.
<P>
	Furthermore, the verification system for declared facilities 
seems unnecessarily cumbersome and costly, while the 
so-called challenge inspection system has far less clout.
<P>
	A major drawback is that paradoxically, enforcement 
mechanisms will not be in place when the convention comes into 
force. The director general will still have to be appointed, 
inspectors confirmed and the list of inspection equipment 
approved. In other words, each state party to the convention will 
have the right to request and obtain a challenge inspection, but 
there will be no one to carry it out. This is only one of the 
problems the preliminary commission will have to consider very 
carefully.
<P>
	Surely it would have been more reasonable to wait until the 
organization is in a position to fully exercise its mandate before 
the main obligations set forth in the convention come into force?
<P>
	It is also unfortunate that the sanctions provided under the 
convention are not more specific. Article XII authorizes the 
organization to ask a state party to the convention that does not 
fully comply with it to take corrective action. If the incriminated 
country refuses, the organization can then apply a certain 
number of sanctions and recommend to states parties a number 
of corrective measures in accordance with international law.
<P>
	However, the convention remains silent on the kind of 
sanctions that can be applied. Furthermore, in recognition of the 
ultimate responsibility of the UN Security Council for 
international peace and security, very serious cases may be 
referred to this body for possible further action, in accordance 
with the UN Charter.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to consider the 
consequences for the chemical industry in Quebec and Canada. 
The convention would not appear to have a major impact. Since 
the second world war, Canada has not produced chemical 
weapons and has even destroyed its stockpiles. Under the 
convention, the chemical industry in Quebec and Canada will, 
however, be subject to regular monitoring. The national 
authority, an agency to be designated in each state party to the 
convention, will provide the link with the organization.
<P>
	The signatory states are required to submit statements to the 
organization concerning specifically the possession of chemical 
weapons or the manufacture or export of designated chemicals. 
These statements will subsequently be used in on-site 
inspections.
<P>
	As Canada has neither chemical weapons nor facilities for 
their manufacture, it would appear that the effect of the 
convention will be limited in its case to trade.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	We believe that Canada should assume some leadership with 
respect to this convention. There is good  reason to ask, in fact, 
what role Canada intends to play in encouraging its partners to 
ratify the convention as quickly as possible. Canada should 
assume some leadership in this regard.
<P>
	Until now, nothing has indicated this to be the government's 
intention. If it intends to be consistent, it should announce a 
series of initiatives in this regard in the coming weeks. After all, 
only 28 countries have ratified the convention up to now, and 
there should be 65. Need I mention that neither the United States 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12653"> 12653 </A></B>
<P>
nor Russia has signed yet? Furthermore, other important states 
that have yet to sign include Iraq, Libya and North Korea.
<P>
	In the case of Russia, we realize that the costs of complying 
with this convention will be significant. However, without 
Russia and the United States, the convention will not entirely 
fulfill its role, since Russia and the United States have the 
biggest stockpiles of chemical weapons. Whatever the case, we 
believe that, if we support this bill, Canada will soon carve out a 
prime niche for itself within the various institutions of this new 
international organization.
<P>
	In our opinion, the convention on chemical weapons 
constitutes a fine opportunity to eliminate the threat of chemical 
weapons. The other option would be to continue to take 
measures in isolation, an approach that would have neither the 
generality nor the global legitimacy of the convention. The 
convention gives traditional arms control a universal scope, 
with the added possibility of responding vigorously to 
non-compliance. It also calls for widespread support to 
determine who complies and who does not as well as what 
political action is appropriate.
<P>
	We are therefore happy to support this bill, making Canada 
one of the first to sign the convention. In our view, this is far 
from an ideal document. The Bloc Quebecois appreciates 
however that it is the result of complex and comprehensive 
negotiations, during which several countries had to make 
concessions on issues they considered extremely important 
because they could not get the support of other countries.
<P>
	Canada is probably one of the countries which had to make the 
most concessions in order to come up with this document, 
because it was strongly in favour of an efficient, comprehensive 
and global inspection scheme that would help build confidence. 
The Bloc Quebecois fully agrees with the position taken by 
Canada in the past. In fact, we still consider being able to request 
an inspection anywhere, anytime, and seeing this inspection 
carried out immediately without restrictions being imposed on 
inspectors as the best way of ensuring safety.
<P>
	While, at present, few countries recognize possessing 
chemical weapons, notably the United States, Russia and Iraq, 
we know that many more have the means to use such weapons. 
We were all distressed by the pictures of Iranians and Kurds 
killed by Iraqi chemical weapons in the Gulf War. We also 
feared that chemical weapons  could be used against not only 
troops, but civilian populations. We hope that the 
implementation of the convention will speed up the peace 
process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure and an honour to speak today on Bill 
C-87.
<P>
	It is a very poignant moment to do so, given the fact that a 
little more than a week ago we celebrated the 50th anniversary 
of Victory in Europe Day all across the world.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Today we are moving toward enacting a bill to implement the 
convention on the prohibition of the development, production, 
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The saying goes that 
all is fair in love and war, but there are conventions which 
dictate to us as human beings a minimum level of behaviour 
even in the horrors of war.
<P>
	This basic level of human behaviour is an obligation of those 
who engage in war. The use of chemical weapons contravenes 
that in a most heinous fashion. Terrible acts have been 
committed on fellow human beings. Chemical weapons are one 
example of what has happened.
<P>
	Chemical weapons are weapons of mass destruction. The 
chemical weapons convention was signed by over 130 countries 
in January 1993. It is the first multilateral agreement that abhors 
an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. The act enables 
an organization to look at chemical weapons production 
facilities to ensure that they will be destroyed and that the 
chemical weapons stockpiled by countries will also be 
destroyed.
<P>
	All government and industrial facilities will be monitored and 
the act will be implemented by the countries. It is a powerful act 
but it is necessary. It is important to realize that it does not 
impinge on industries to engage in legitimate industrial 
production of chemicals. It comes down on industries and 
countries manufacturing chemical weapons for aggressive and 
warlike purposes.
<P>
	I reassure industry in Canada that the purpose of the act is not 
to come down on it but to form a broad framework to be applied 
not only in this country but in other countries for the collective 
security of all. I also reassure the industry that its stocks will not 
be destroyed in any way, shape or form.
<P>
	There are three categories of schedules in the act. Schedule 1 
includes such chemicals we are aware of such as sarin, tabun, 
soman, and the mustards that were used with widespread and 
tragic effectiveness in World War I. There are some legitimate 
uses for these chemicals in pharmaceuticals and in cancer 
research. Some of the precursors are used. Therefore one would 
have to obtain permission or a licence in order to use them, and 
that applies to all 130 signatories.
<P>
	Schedule 2 includes such chemicals as amiton, which are key 
precursors for schedule 1 chemical weapons. The individuals 
and companies that make them will be subjected to scrutiny if 
they make over a certain amount.
<P>
	Schedule 3 is the least powerful, the least destructive of all, as 
they are often used in industry but can in large enough quantities 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12654"> 12654 </A></B>
<P>
be used as chemical weapons. We have such chemical weapons 
as hydrogen cyanide and phosgene that have been used before. 
Companies that manufacture these chemicals will be eligible for 
occasional checks and balances as time goes on.
<P>
	In the act is the establishment of national authorities 
responsible for collecting information that they will give to an 
organization that has been set up called the Organization for the 
Prohibition of Conventional Weapons or the OPCW.
<P>
	All signatories are essentially responsible for checking within 
their countries all the industries that will be manufacturing any 
of the chemicals in the three schedules I mentioned.
<P>
	The information will then be given to the OPCW which will 
then decide if it is necessary to take further action. The national 
authorities in conjunction with the OPCW will facilitate the 
inspection. They will also control the export and import of 
chemicals where necessary. The country of origin is responsible 
for enacting Criminal Code legislation that will provide 
penalties, fines and imprisonment if individuals or companies 
are engaging in the production of chemicals for aggressive 
warlike use in the future. Again, we must make the distinction 
that the convention is not to be used against companies engaging 
in the production of chemicals for medicinal or industrial 
purposes.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I caution the government that the cost should not be 
excessive. We must do this within our fiscal constraints. We 
want to ensure that the agency that will be set up will not be 
onerous or develop a morass of bureaucracy in the future. We do 
not have the money to do that, as we all know.
<P>
	Some may argue why this convention is necessary; did 
chemical weapons not go out with the first world war? The 
reality is unfortunately they did not. We have seen more recently 
in Japan the release of chemical weapons that had tragic effects. 
Sarin was released on a civilian population, killing hundreds of 
individuals. Stockpiles have been found in Japan. More recently 
the Iraqis have used chemical weapons for aggressive purposes 
to commit genocide within their own country against Kurdish 
individuals. That is a hot spot which will affect us in the future.
<P>
	The convention was designed to keep good countries in check 
and to come down hard on those countries that would seek to use 
these weapons from Hades in a fashion that is aggressive and 
would cause destabilizing effects.
<P>
	The UN will be the ultimate body that will receive 
information from the OPCW. That brings a larger question, 
which we ought to examine, which is the ability of the United 
Nations to act quickly and effectively in the face of threats to 
regional and international security. We have seen Rwanda, 
Burundi, the former Yugoslavia, Angola, Sierra Leone, and the 
list goes on. In fact there were over 40 major conflicts in the 
world last year. That number is not decreasing; rather, it is 
increasing. In the future we will see countries such as Nigeria, 
the Sudan, possibly Kenya, Kashmir, and a host of other 
countries blowing up-not to belittle those already on the front 
pages of newspapers, showing on a daily basis the tragedies 
civilians are enduring in places like Bosnia, Croatia, Burundi, 
Rwanda, East Timor. The list goes on and on. We have learned 
nothing in over 50 years. We ought to remember that.
<P>
	The OPCW is an example of what is considered to be conflict 
prevention. Even though this is a small but very important act, 
there are many lessons that can be learned as conflicts loom 
ahead. In fact there are many things we can do to prevent future 
conflicts. The United Nations must set in place a list of 
transgressions that are completely unacceptable to the 
international community. It must set a list of transgressions 
down that are threats to regional and international security, 
behaviours that are considered to be patently unacceptable such 
as genocide and gross human rights abuses.
<P>
	I also mention countries engaging in self-destructive 
behaviours. I bring to the attention of the House the 
expenditures occurring in military hardware. Many people 
believe that in the post-cold war era we live in a safer place. We 
are far from it. The world as we know it now is a much more 
dangerous place.
<P>
	While there was a decrease in global arms spending from 
1987 to 1990 of some $240 billion, military spending in many 
parts of the world has actually increased. It is interesting to note 
which countries are increasing their expenditures. Curiously 
enough, it is particularly in the poorest areas of the world. 
Sub-Saharan Africa and east Asia did not have a decline in their 
military expenditures; rather, they were increased.
<P>
	In general when we see violent conflicts occurring the 
military expenditures are increasing also, which means that they 
are taking away from the expenditures necessary in providing 
basic human needs.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	According to the UNDP, in 1990-91 all developing countries 
spent the equivalent of 60 per cent of their combined 
expenditures for education and health on military expenditure, 
compared with 33 per cent in industrialized countries.
<P>
	Let us take a look at who spends the most on military 
hardware. It is very telling. In 1990-91: Somalia, 200 per cent 
military spending compared with health and education 
spending; Ethiopia, 190 per cent; Angola, 208  per cent; Yemen, 
197 per cent; Pakistan, 125 per cent; India, 138 per cent; 
Myanmar, 222 per cent; Iraq, 271 per cent; Sri Lanka, 107 per 
cent; Syria, 373 per cent of its spending for education and health 
was spent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12655"> 12655 </A></B>
<P>
on military expenditures. Clearly these countries are not among 
the richest of the world; rather, they are among the poorest.
<P>
	Along with this list of transgressions we also need to draw up 
a list of responses from the international community. For 
example, early diplomatic initiatives can be employed, along 
with positive propaganda. The former Yugoslavia and Rwanda 
are interesting examples. When the conflicts were first 
beginning, the people who started to stir up and fan the flames of 
ethnic discontent were in part using negative, hateful 
propaganda. The people who were on the ground, NGOs and 
representatives from other countries, saw this and were helpless 
to do anything about it.
<P>
	A lot could be done if a system were set in place by the United 
Nations to immediately put positive propaganda into the theatre 
when negative and hateful propaganda is being spewed forth by 
individuals who are trying to fuel the flames of ethnic discontent 
and trying to stimulate conflict. I think it would do a lot to 
dampen down the hatred and ethnic conflict as it starts. It is an 
interesting area for us to try to convince the United Nations to 
engage in.
<P>
	Another aspect, which is particularly appropriate given the 
fact that the G-7 summit is occurring in Halifax in June, is the 
use of the international financial institutions as non-military 
and inexpensive levers on countries that are engaging in these 
transgressions I mentioned before. It has not really been looked 
at very carefully.
<P>
	We were in Washington not too long ago and I spoke to Mr. 
Fauver, Mr. Clinton's sherpa for the G-7 summit. I asked him if 
we could use the international financial institutions to exert 
pressure on countries or groups who were trying to stimulate a 
conflict by trying to pit one person against the other. He said it 
could be done but that it was difficult. I think this might be an 
inexpensive but effective and eloquent way of trying to defuse 
conflicts before they occur.
<P>
	Something that could be done is not renegotiating the loans of 
countries. They need money to fight a war; if they do not have 
the money then they cannot fight a war. We can decrease 
non-humanitarian aid to countries that are engaging in this 
behaviour. The removal of preferential trade status is another 
example of what can be done. These countries should be 
penalized and brought to task. The international community 
should let these countries or groups know that their behaviour is 
completely unacceptable for this to occur.
<P>
	We can then go ahead and do the traditional form of 
diplomatic initiatives. Something the government has put forth, 
which I think is a very good move, is the construction of a rapid 
deployment force. We are not talking about a standing army but 
rather a force that would be comprised of individual countries 
that would  contribute arms, equipment, or people to go in on 
short notice to areas of conflict in order to dampen down a 
conflict or prevent a conflict from happening. This might be 
another issue that could be brought up at the G-7 summit in 
Halifax. We are not talking about an army that would stay at one 
place at one time; they would stay in their countries of origin.
<P>
	Another useful aspect is that these groups could come 
together on a periodic basis and train. One of the problems the 
United Nations has always found is that when they get soldiers 
and put them into a conflict the left hand does not know what the 
right hand is doing. They do not know the equipment, they do 
not know the commanders, and they do now know how things 
work. This would obviate that, by bringing them together every 
year or so to go through manoeuvres and the motions so that they 
will understand how to engage in a conflict such as this.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	We also have to combine the increased monitoring capability 
of the United Nations. In the UN there exists a crisis monitoring 
group, but to date it has been very ineffective in actually 
informing the United Nations in a timely fashion about conflicts 
that are occurring. Much can be done in this area also. We need 
to incorporate NGOs and groups on the ground to form a 
network of military intelligence that could feed information in 
an expeditious fashion to the UN crisis group, who could then 
process it and give it to the United Nations.
<P>
	What is the rationale for all of this? People will ask why we 
are getting involved in the affairs of other countries. The 
rationale is very clear. Contrary to what has happened in the past 
when armies were killing each other, most casualties that occur 
in conflicts these days are not army personnel but are innocent 
civilians. We saw this in Bosnia and in Rwanda time and time 
again.
<P>
	In 1993 there were over 40 million displaced people in the 
world. The United Nations high commission for refugees 
recognized this as a great tragedy. Where do these refugees go? 
They move within their own countries but they also emigrate to 
other parts of the world. No border is completely intact; borders 
are in fact porous. What happens half a world away will come 
back to affect us. The United Nations also estimates that while 
there are presently 40 million refugees, the number is likely to 
increase to over 100 million by the year 2000.
<P>
	When conflicts do occur, we see the massive and widespread 
destruction of a country. All the aid, development, and hard 
work of decades are washed away in the course of a month or two 
of conflict. It will take decades to rebuild that. Furthermore, the 
seeds of hatred are planted, not only in the people subjected to 
the war but also in the unborn children, because they will be 
subjected to the same hatred and prejudices their families were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12656"> 12656 </A></B>
<P>
subjected to. This is a cancer that starts very early and grows. It 
takes generations to go away, if at all.
<P>
	Also, within our own country when conflicts erupt we are 
forced to engage in peacekeeping, peacemaking, defence 
initiatives, aid and development at a cost of hundreds of 
millions of dollars a year. Is it not better to put in a few dollars 
now and save hundreds of millions in the future, rather than wait 
until everything blows up?
<P>
	There is no need to discuss the humanitarian aspects of those 
who are involved in the conflicts because they are evident. For 
those of you who have seen war situations, as I have, it is not a 
pretty sight. These individuals want nothing more than to live in 
peace and harmony but are forced to engage in activities or have 
heinous crimes meted out to them, which they are powerless to 
deal with.
<P>
	One mistake made in foreign policy is in the global 
community we do not have the backbone to deal with individuals 
who for their own self-interests are stimulating ethnic hatred. 
When we negotiate with these people it is important to realize 
they are not necessarily speaking for their entire populace. They 
may be only be speaking for a very small number of people. 
Their motivations should be questioned at every turn.
<P>
	Few countries in the world have the international recognition 
and capability to form a system to address the pressures and 
conflict we will have in the coming new world order. 
Fortunately, Canada is one of the few that can do this. We must 
persuade our colleagues in the international community to set up 
a framework and a system of responses from the international 
community and identify early on the precursors to conflict. In 
short, we must do what we can, where we can, and when we can, 
given the fiscal constraints that are put upon us.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	The action we have taken with the conventional weapons ban 
is truly admirable and is a shining example of what Canada can 
do. People may not understand that Canada is one of the leaders 
in putting forth this ban. It is something we as a country ought to 
be very proud of.
<P>
	While we have managed to put forth a convention on the ban 
of mines, I suggest Canada take a leadership role in putting forth 
a convention on banning the production, stockpiling and sale of 
land mines and anti-personnel devices because their primary 
target again is civilian.
<P>
	Once a conflict is over these land mines and anti-personnel 
devices stay for decades and I will give some examples. It is also 
important to realize that these weapons are not meant to kill; 
many of them are meant purely to maim and they maim children.
<P>
	Many of the anti-personnel devices are showered from 
helicopters or planes. They are made of plastic and look like 
little toys. Children pick them up and get their arms or their legs 
blown off. I have seen this in Mozambique. Teenagers found 
these things and had body parts blown off. Believe me, it is not 
fun to spend four hours in a hospital operating room debriding 
somebody's leg after taking off the other leg.
<P>
	Worldwide there are over 100 million land mines that have 
been set. It not only affects what we know about Cambodia but 
in Afghanistan 400,000 people have been wounded. The UN is 
now engaging in activities to remove land mines. About 85 
hectares a year are done. It will take 4,300 years to clear 
Afghanistan of mines.
<P>
	In Croatia over 330,000 hectares are completely 
uninhabitable and totally useless for industry. It costs Croatia 
over $230 million a year purely because the area is seeded with 
land mines.
<P>
	Chechnya is another example where hundreds of thousands of 
land mines were sown in a very short period of time. Many areas 
of Chechnya will not be able to become economically 
self-sufficient for a long time because of that. When the civilian 
population tries to plant their fields or go to work, they will 
continue to be subjected to periodic incidents of having their 
limbs blown off or of being maimed.
<P>
	Many of the land mines are plastic, some are metal and many 
are invisible. They cost between $3 and $30 to manufacture and 
up to $1000 to get rid of. Every year there are two million land 
mines seeded and about 85,000 being removed.
<P>
	There is a land mine called the black widow or the PMW, a 10 
centimetre plastic mine with 240 grams of TNT that can rip off a 
leg at the hip. There are about 20 million of these land mines 
deployed all over the world. China and the former Soviet Union 
make them.
<P>
	There is the Valmara 69, also known as the bouncing betty. 
This one leaps up one metre and explodes, showering metal 
fragments for 20 metres. It is made in Italy. It is shocking to see 
the countries that actually make these, from the United States to 
many countries in Europe to China and the former Soviet Union.
<P>
	This is something we need to address and Canada can take a 
leadership role in this. There is no military use whatsoever for 
this weapon which again is primarily used to maim civilians. 
Usually those who are maimed the most are the children and the 
men and women who work in the fields. We must take a 
leadership role on this as we have done on chemical weapons.
<P>
	While we have had the convention on chemical weapons, we 
also need to consider the aspect of conventional non-nuclear 
weapons. The proliferation of non-nuclear conventional 
weapons, particularly small arms, is something that is having a 
huge destabilizing effect on the world stage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12657"> 12657 </A></B>
<P>
	When I worked on the Mozambique border there were 
hundreds of thousands of AK-47 assault rifles pouring into 
South Africa from Mozambique. An AK-47 can be bought for 
$5 to $20. When you have an AK-47, you have a lot of power. 
These people are desperately poor. They have no food and are 
starving and all they can do is sell these weapons. These 
weapons are ubiquitous in the developing world and there is a 
huge destabilizing force in that. It also enables people to engage 
in violent criminal acts which also impedes a country's ability to 
get on its feet economically.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Whether we are looking at west Africa, southern Africa or 
east Asia, crime is one of the largest problems confronting the 
developing world. It is something we need to address.
<P>
	The G-7 summit is coming up. Over 90 per cent of 
conventional weapons are made by G-7 nations. It is 
hypocritical for us to say we are helping countries on the one 
hand with our aid and development, but on the other hand we are 
selling them the arms either through private dealers or by 
government to government sale. We are cutting off our nose to 
spite our face because in the long run conflicts brew. These are 
not things to be taken in isolation. They are to be taken 
collectively in the name of collective security.
<P>
	Bill C-87 shows that Canada can, as it has in the past, show 
leadership in foreign policy. One person not so long ago in the 
celebrations of V-E Day said a poignant and kind thing about 
the people of this country: ``If the Canadian people could look at 
Canadians the way the people in Holland look at Canadians, then 
indeed they would learn a lot and indeed they would be proud''.
<P>
	I ask the government to remember that. I ask the Canadian 
people to remember that in the hope that we can use that esteem 
and respect we have on the international stage to become more 
aggressive in addressing these threats to international security, 
not only for the people who are involved, but also for the people 
in this country.
<P>
	Although we may be far away from areas of conflict and think 
we are immune to it, we are not. People will leave areas of 
conflict, the have not areas to areas that have. Canada is a have 
country. It will put stresses on this country that we are not 
prepared to deal with. It will cost us money that we do not have. 
Above all else, we should do it for humanitarian reasons. 
Although we may be different peoples, we are in fact one people 
on one earth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-87, an act to 
implement the chemical weapons convention. It is appropriate 
at this time to remind the House and all Canadians that Canada 
has much at stake in this piece of legislation. It touches the very 
heart of our military history.
<P>
	I remind the House that on August 15, 1915 Canadian soldiers 
were the first soldiers to be subjected to a systematic gas attack. 
Inexperienced Canadian troops occupied the trenches at Ypres 
in Belgium. At that point in the war there had been a stalemate 
on the western front. It was very difficult for either side to move 
forward using conventional weapons.
<P>
	On that day the Germans released chlorine gas from their 
trenches. The Canadians held the line immediately in front and 
on their right were French colonial troops. What the Canadians 
saw first on that early morning was a white cloud advancing 
slowly toward them. They were filled with curiosity, wondering 
what it was. It was like a low lying mist. As it approached and 
reached their trenches they were suddenly seized at the throat. 
When they breathed they breathed fire and they fell gasping to 
the ground and into the trenches, writhing and suffering.
<P>
	The Canadian troops very quickly realized it was poison gas. 
The French colonial troops on their right broke and ran in a 
panic, but the Canadian troops, those who survived, climbed out 
of the trenches and lay on the parapets while the gas passed. 
Actually, it is a great moment in the annals of Canadian military 
history. Even though many of those young Canadian troops died, 
they held the line and resisted the gas attack.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	After that first attack, gas became very popular on the western 
front. The French discovered it was chlorine and responded with 
their own gas. Then there was an arms race of various types of 
noxious substances. They went to phosgene gas, hydrogen 
cyanide and other variations.
<P>
	One of the most effective gases that was discovered during the 
first world war came to be known as mustard gas. This gas has 
been used in very recent times such as on the Kurds in the 
Iran-Iraq war. When the vapour touches the skin it immediately 
causes huge blisters. It also causes blindness. When it is 
breathed in, it blisters the lung and causes death.
<P>
	As the war progressed it became very common to hear the 
sound of artillery firing gas shells. Instead of the explosion 
afterward, there was a popping and hissing noise. Along the 
western front because both the German troops and our allies 
were using gas, troops on all sides had rattles. When they heard 
the gas attack, they spun the rattles.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12658"> 12658 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to read a few lines from a famous poem by British 
poet Wilfred Owen called ``Dulce et Decorum Est''. He captures 
what it was like during these gas attacks in the first world war. 
He begins:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! An ecstasy of fumbling,<BR>
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;<BR>
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<BR>
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime-.<BR>
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,<BR>
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.<BR>
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<BR>
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It was that kind of horrific experience which captured the 
imaginations of all nations during the war and after its 
conclusion.
<P>
	One of the results was the 1925 Geneva protocol which 
outlawed the use of gas. It was a recognition by states worldwide 
that the use of this weapon actually took the very minimum 
essence of humanity out of warfare. It reduced warfare to a 
matter of exterminating the enemy like vermin. This was felt to 
be, and we still feel it today, unacceptable behaviour on the part 
of people who would be regarded as human beings.
<P>
	Therefore the Geneva protocol in 1925 was passed. Like the 
current chemical warfares convention, it was not ratified by all 
nations. In fact the United States did not ratify it until 1970. It 
had an impact. That impact was to give all nations of the world 
the sense that chemical weapons were an illegal weapon, a 
weapon that was wrong to use.
<P>
	Nevertheless by the time we got into the late 1930s, it became 
very clear that chemical weapons were going to be used again. 
When the Italians occupied Abyssinia, the former Ethiopia, they 
attempted to colonize it by conquest. They used poison gas on 
the helpless civilians as a way of experimenting with chemical 
weapons in the event of another world war. That had an 
immediate impact in Canada.
<P>
	It was at about that time a former chief of staff, General 
Andrew McNaughton, became the head of the National 
Research Council, that lovely stone building at 100 Sussex 
Drive. He felt that as a result of what the Italians were doing 
there was a good chance that gas would be used again in any 
outbreak of hostilities.
<P>
	He initiated research in Canada on protection against the use 
of gas. We started with the development of gas masks and 
charcoal containers. That work went forward at the National 
Research Council.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Then when the war broke out in 1939 we stepped up our 
activities and research on poison gas, particularly defensive 
research which is a very Canadian thing to do.
<P>
	In 1940 with the fall of France, Britain was suddenly 
desperate. When France collapsed Canadian troops were the 
only troops who still had their equipment. The British 
immediately mobilized all their available gas weapons with the 
expectation of soaking the Germans with gas should they 
invade. The weapon the British had at the time was principally 
mustard gas contained in  collapsible drums. It was very 
primitive. They expected to fly over the beaches if the Germans 
invaded and dump this out of the aircraft and hope it would 
injure enough troops to deter the attack. The attack did not 
come, however.
<P>
	The initiative to develop gas weapons went forward very 
rapidly. The British were very concerned the Germans were 
developing the weapons and felt they should as well. Britain is a 
small country and so the United Kingdom turned to Canada for 
assistance in the development of poison gas weapons. This led to 
the opening of the proving grounds at Suffield, very large 
proving grounds near Medicine Hat, where Canada undertook 
experiments with various types of poison gas. Canada expanded 
from mustard gas into research developing out toxins such as 
ricin. During World War II thousands and thousands of animals 
were killed at Suffield during tests on various types of poison 
gas.
<P>
	One direction of the research was to find a poison gas that was 
heavy. During the second world war many of the poison gasses 
were too light and consequently would rise and dissipate. The 
direction of the research was to find a gas that was very heavy 
and would flow along the ground and flow into the trenches and 
would be very deadly.
<P>
	The United States also accelerated its production of poison 
gas. Even before the war with Japan, before the end of World 
War II, the Americans were conscious that gas could be a factor. 
In typical American style they concentrated on mass production. 
By about 1942 the Americans had tens of thousands of tonnes of 
liquid mustard gas and other types of gas and had developed 
bomb casings to deliver these.
<P>
	The Canadians tended to specialize in actual research. We did 
experiments on humans. It was felt that one had to be sure the 
gas was effective. Many Canadian soldiers volunteered to be 
subjects for tests of poison gas. Sometimes these tests were very 
elaborate and I am sorry to say there were injuries to Canadian 
troops from the poison gas tests at Suffield.
<P>
	At McGill University Canadians made the biggest 
breakthrough among the allies in developing poison gas. A team 
at McGill discovered a nerve gas. It had been doing research on 
pesticides and made a connection with between pesticides which 
had caused accidental deaths and developed a nerve gas.
<P>
	The scientists in Britain and the United States rejected the 
Canadian development and it never proceeded to production. It 
is ironic because the Germans were developing gas weapons of 
their own. They had made a major breakthrough by developing 
several types of nerve gas, sarin and tabun, which were many 
times more toxic than the traditional gasses used in the first 
world war, the mustard gasses. Hitler had an enormous stockpile 
of these weapons.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12659"> 12659 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Hitler was influenced by the 1925 Geneva protocol. Although 
he was essentially a mad man in charge of a country who led to 
hundreds of millions of injuries and deaths across the continent, 
for some reason he was affected by the 1925 Geneva protocol 
and did not order the use of gas. Research in German archives 
discloses that Hitler was very much opposed to the use of gas. 
That probably has racial overtones. He probably thought it was 
improper to use it on the British and that kind of thing. We 
cannot get into Hitler's mind but the Geneva protocol did 
prevent this dictator from resorting to this ghastly weapon.
<P>
	The irony is that on the Allied side there was a desire to use 
the weapons; Winston Churchill wanted to use poison gas on the 
Germans. Even as we approached Normandy Churchill was very 
conscious of the fact there would be casualties and he pressed 
his chiefs of staff to do a study to determine whether it would be 
effective to use poison gas during the invasion of Normandy.
<P>
	I will quote from a document of the time. It was written by 
Churchill to his chiefs of staff on July 6, 1944:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want you to think very seriously over this question of using poison gas. I 
would not use it unless it be shown that (a) it was life or death for us, or (b) that it 
would shorten the war by a year. It is absurd to consider morality on this topic 
when everybody used it in the last war without a word of complaint from the 
moralists or the church. On the other hand, the bombing of open cities was 
regarded as forbidden. Now everyone does that as a matter of course. This is 
simply a question of fashion, changing as she does between long and short skirts 
for women. I want a cold blooded calculation made as to how it would pay us to 
use poison gas, by which I mean principally mustard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The chiefs of staff circumvented Churchill and made sure no 
order was ever put forward. Churchill's desire was never 
implemented. They deliberately out foxed the old fox himself. 
At that time the Germans had enormous stockpiles of nerve gas 
and if the British had used mustard gas there would have been an 
incredible retaliation on London and the British would have lost 
more civilians than the Germans.
<P>
	Again we return to the 1925 Geneva protocol by which the 
British chiefs of staff recognized how inappropriate, how wrong 
and how against civilization it would have been to use poison 
gas even when the head of state was pressing for its use.
<P>
	The Americans had an enormous stockpile of mustard gas. 
They had tens of thousands of tonnes of mustard gas. In 1943 
when they attacked the Island of Tarawa in the Pacific, the 
Japanese resisted so fiercely the Americans marines lost 3,000 
and 1,000 were wounded, as against about 4,000 Japanese 
killed. The lesson the Americans took from that was it was to be 
very costly to fight the Japanese in an island hopping war.
<P>
	Therefore the American chemical warfare service proposed to 
secretly use poison gas to suppress the islands in Japan. 
However, the Americans felt they needed the concurrence of 
their allies. They approached Canada, which by that time was in 
a state of co-operation with the Americans in the development 
of these terrible weapons. They approached Canadian scientists 
at the National Research Council and in the military and asked 
them to do a report confirming that poison gas would be an 
effective way to suppress the Japanese islands.
<P>
	What happened is very interesting. There was no doubt 
mustard gas, at no cost in American casualties, would have 
suppressed the garrisons on any island in the Pacific. Mustard 
gas is more effective in the tropics than in temperate climates.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian scientists, when they were asked for this report, 
fudged the figures. They put out a false report which actually 
claimed chemical weapons used in the Pacific theatre would not 
be any more effective than high explosive weapons. A chemical 
warfare service was knocked back a step in that it was trying to 
get the approval of the chiefs of staff and President Roosevelt to 
use gas. It lost the argument when the Canadians refused to get 
onside. That is another reason Canadians have a special place in 
the debate about chemical weapons. During the second world 
war we very positively prevented the use of those weapons by 
the Americans.
<P>
	What is driving this sense of morality is the 1925 Geneva 
protocol. This brings me to the current chemical weapons 
convention. This convention is an enormous improvement over 
the 1925 protocol. It contains various sanctions and rules. No 
law passed by the United Nations can actually prevent the use of 
this terrible technology.
<P>
	The chemical weapons convention is symbolic. It tells 
countries that if they use these weapons they are renegades and 
no longer part of civilized humanity. It causes nations to pause 
when they might be contemplating this action. It gives moral 
limitations to how nations will react to one another.
<P>
	This type of moral sanction is vital in this age, when we move 
into the next century and when we do have wars in which terrible 
phrases like ethnic cleansing are used. The chemical warfare 
convention will not prevent terrorists like those in Japan from 
mixing their own chemical weapons and using them, but it will 
forever outlaw that type of behaviour and make sure at the very 
least the use of chemical weapons is not something resorted to 
by civilized states.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Hamilton-Wentworth for his contribution. I know he gave 
up part of his life to do in depth research into this whole field.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12660"> 12660 </A></B>
<P>
	How did he obtain such detailed information from the U.S., 
Great Britain and Canada? Is that information wide open now or 
is some of this information still under wraps? Do we need to do 
further research?
<P>
	I am very concerned about the stockpiles of mustard gas in 
1943 which the hon. member mentioned. What happened to 
those stockpiles? How did countries get rid of these stockpiles?
<P>
	There may be a lot of work to be done yet but at least this bill 
will go a long way in preventing horror stories in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.
<P>
	Most of the documentation I used for my studies on the 
subject came from the archives here in Canada but only by 
chance. The majority of the original documents had been 
deliberately destroyed around 1970 or thereabouts by persons 
unknown. I was fortunate, however, to find microfilm taken of 
these documents and hidden away in a dusty corner of the 
archives by a civil servant we will never know. That led me to do 
the study.
<P>
	Unfortunately even the documents I had were incomplete and 
consequently I could not determine for sure whether in the 
post-war period Canada did dispose of its considerable 
stockpiles of chemical weapons. We had a mustard gas plant at 
Cornwall, Ontario, which at the end of the war had 2,800 tonnes 
of mustard gas. Most of it was dumped at sea, which raises some 
very serious environmental questions.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	A few years ago the Department of National Defence made a 
concerted effort to get rid of any stockpiles we had. I am 
confident we no longer have them in Canada.
<P>
	One of the problems is verifying what countries have in terms 
of their compliance with legislation. With a chemical warfare 
convention such as this one we rely very heavily on the sincerity 
and the good motivation of countries. There are ways of hiding 
these things. That was why I was saying in my remarks that the 
symbolic part of the chemical warfare convention is just as 
important as its actual practical measures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am eager 
to participate in today's debate on Bill C-87, an act to 
implement the Convention on the Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical 
Weapons and on their Destruction.
<P>
	Today, when they look at the world around them, people in 
Quebec and Canada are concerned. We are concerned because 
we do not know what awaits us in the future. We are worried 
about the nuclear weapons that are still around, about the 
biological and chemical weapons scattered throughout the 
world.
<P>
	By passing this bill, the Canadian government will be among 
the first 65 countries to ratify the convention on chemical 
weapons out of the roughly 135-there are perhaps 132 at this 
time-nations that have signed it. The convention will take 
effect 180 days after the 65th state to ratify this agreement tables 
it. Along with my party, the Bloc Quebecois, I wholeheartedly 
support this convention on chemical weapons, which follows the 
debate on arms control and disarmament.
<P>
	The convention on chemical weapons is the result of more 
than 20 years of negotiations at the conference on disarmament 
and the forums that preceded it.
<P>
	For the first time, we have an instrument that really resulted 
from an actual multilateral negotiation process. The signing 
parties undertake to refrain from various activities in relation to 
chemical weapons, to co-operate in a number of ways so as to 
facilitate the implementation of the convention and to ensure 
that persons also refrain from those activities and provide the 
necessary co-operation.
<P>
	Since the Second World War, the issue of the arms race has 
come up every time the prospects for enduring peace or the 
possibility of war is discussed. Most observers felt that the arms 
race was intrinsically dangerous and ultimately destabilizing. 
Western countries thus found themselves facing a paradox: on 
the one hand, they believed that force deters aggression; on the 
other hand, they were convinced that the arms race alone could 
provoke a global war.
<P>
	The latter shook up our certainty that deterrence is the best 
form of insurance against potential aggression. We could not 
avoid the disturbing realization that the very measures taken to 
ensure our security could bring about our downfall and lead to a 
global conflict.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The debate on arms control is largely based on the 
preconceived notion that any arms race is, by definition, a chain 
reaction which tends to trigger an escalation of the conflict. The 
responses of warring states to the stockpiling of conventional, 
nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, as well as the 
attempts made by each side to gain the upper hand lead to 
destabilization and greater international tension.
<P>
	It is claimed that, if there is another world war, it will be by 
accident, in the sense that it will result from a climate of 
suspicion and crucial errors of judgment made regarding a 
regional conflict. This is why it is essential, for international 
stability, to control the arms race.
<P>
	However, military experts contend that arms control merely 
regulates the arms race, instead of limiting it. Many issues 
remain very timely, even though the cold war is over and these 
issues are no longer related to an east versus west situation. 
There is a new phenomenon on the international scene: regional 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12661"> 12661 </A></B>
<P>
armed conflicts resulting from the emergence of new nations 
and the fact that others are trying to increase their influence.
<P>
	Since most of the objectives of the superpowers' traditional 
arms control program have now been reached, the international 
community is turning its attention to measures designed to 
prevent a wider proliferation of nuclear, bacteriological and 
chemical weapons. That goal is now part of an effort to face 
today's geopolitical realities. Indeed, the time has come to 
carefully reassess existing monitoring mechanisms.
<P>
	Following a resolution passed by the UN general assembly in 
December 1993, it was announced, in March of this year, that the 
delegates at the conference on disarmament had reached a 
consensus on a proposal to set up a special committee to 
negotiate a reduction of fissionable material production for 
nuclear arms. Conference delegates also discussed, among 
numerous other issues, chemical weapons, in the hope of 
developing a convention on such weapons.
<P>
	That was not an easy task, since the participants did not agree 
on the monitoring procedures. The 1990 U.S.-Soviet bilateral 
agreements on the sharing of information and the destruction of 
weapon stockpiles helped further multilateral talks on this issue. 
In June 1992, the conference on disarmament submitted a draft 
treaty to prohibit the development, production and stockpiling 
of chemical weapons. Monitoring activities were delegated to 
an international organization responsible for the prohibition of 
chemical weapons, based in the Netherlands.
<P>
	The long-awaited treaty on chemical weapons was finally 
signed in Paris, on January 13, 1993. The signature and the 
coming into effect of that agreement is undoubtedly an 
historical event. As I see it, this instrument is important for 
three major reasons. First of all, it represents a real step forward 
for international security. Second, it is truly universal in scope, 
since it reflects a number of fundamental balances. Finally, we 
should also consider what the situation would be like if it did not 
exist. The convention is the first multinational disarmament 
agreement that prohibits an entire class of weapons of mass 
destruction.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	It prohibits producing and also acquiring, stockpiling, 
transferring, using or engaging in military preparations to use a 
chemical weapon or assisting anyone to engage in any activities 
prohibited by the convention. The prohibition on chemicals 
covers chemical products as such, their vectors and any 
equipment designed for the use of chemical weapons.
<P>
	Furthermore, any state party to this convention would be 
obliged to destroy all chemical weapons within its territory, 
those it abandoned outside that territory and facilities for the 
production of chemical weapons. This is very important. It 
means this is a truly comprehensive prohibition that affects all 
chemical weapons in the world.
<P>
	The convention constitutes an effective deterrent to 
developing clandestine chemical weapons production systems 
because of its unique inspection system. By setting a common 
standard and giving the international community the means to 
enforce its application, the convention provides the impetus for 
joint action to eradicate weapons of massive destruction.
<P>
	Furthermore, all countries that have chemical weapons will 
have to destroy these, with their facilities for the production of 
chemical weapons, within ten years. Consideration was also 
given to the technical and financial problems that may arise 
when a country must destroy its arsenal of chemical weapons.
<P>
	The convention provides for certain adjustments, including 
an extension of the ten-year deadline, which would, however, 
involve stricter monitoring procedures, tantamount to being 
under the supervision of the international community. The same 
applies to exceptional cases where facilities for the manufacture 
of chemical weapons are converted to civilian use.
<P>
	In the case of chemical weapons abandoned by one state 
within the territory of another state, the convention obliges each 
state to destroy the chemical weapons within its territory while 
at the same time assigning responsibility for destruction to the 
state that abandoned weapons within the territory of another 
state.
<P>
	State parties to this agreement are responsible for meeting 
their commitments at the national level, but how they meet those 
commitments is monitored by the international organization. 
This applies to the destruction of weapons and the facilities to 
manufacture them.
<P>
	If the convention had not been adopted, this would have been 
a signal to those responsible for the proliferation of these 
weapons to continue the production. The security of all 
countries would have been at risk, especially countries in the 
southern hemisphere. The result would have been to reinforce 
unilateral non-proliferation policies which would have 
increased barriers to trade and technology transfers while in 
addition penalizing developing countries that respect their 
commitments.
<P>
	The chemical weapons convention serves the interests of all 
signatory countries and all countries that will sign in the future. 
Contrary to what was said in some quarters, it is not designed to 
serve the sole interests of industrialized countries. On the 
contrary, it is developing countries that will benefit from the 
convention. Indeed, in the past few years, unfortunately, it has 
been the developing countries which have used chemical 
weapons in their conflicts, while industrialized countries have 
found them of no interest strategically or as a deterrent.
<P>
	And understandably, come whatever may, industrialized 
countries will always be better equipped to detect and to protect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12662"> 12662 </A></B>
<P>
against chemical weapons than most developing countries, 
which do not have ready access to such equipment. We have only 
to think of what went on in Japan.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Japan is, nonetheless, better equipped to deal with such 
situations while the same would be more difficult for third world 
countries, where there would probably be more deaths. In fact, it 
is the industrialized countries which will take on the better part 
of the task of industry monitoring by virtue of the fact that their 
chemical industries are more highly developed.
<P>
	However because of the extension of the definition of 
industries considered capable of producing chemical weapons, 
all countries will be affected by monitoring in one way or 
another.
<P>
	Likewise, it is only natural that countries which are willing to 
be monitored and which respect the commitments made under 
the convention will feel that the current restrictions imposed 
under the current non-proliferation agreements are eased up.
<P>
	It is worth noting that the cost of destroying a chemical 
weapons factory is ten times that of building it.
<P>
	Having said this, you will understand our concern with the 
financial burden that the obligation to destroy chemical 
weapons will place on certain states lacking the necessary 
financial means to do so.
<P>
	The convention's provision that some factories may be 
temporarily converted into disposal facilities when this is 
possible and cost-effective, so that they can be considered 
converted, will not relieve such countries of this problem.
<P>
	I would like to add in closing that the convention is an 
historical first, which the conference on disarmament can add to 
its list of accomplishments.
<P>
	This convention proves that, when the conditions are 
favourable, the conference does have the required competence 
and skill to draft agreements which are as politically sensitive as 
they are technically complex, and which contribute to the 
well-being of our respective populations.
<P>
	The question arises as to the role the Government of Canada 
intends to play in encouraging its partners to ratify the chemical 
weapons convention as quickly as possible.
<P>
	To my mind, Canada must play a strong leadership role in this 
regard. To date, we have seen no hint of such an intention. If the 
government wants to act consistently, it should announce a 
series of initiatives in this regard in the coming weeks. After all, 
only 28 countries have ratified the convention up to now.
<P>
	I should perhaps point out that neither the United States nor 
Russia has signed yet. We realize that it will cost Russia 
significantly to comply with the convention.
<P>
	What will the federal government do to help Russia get rid of 
its chemical weapons stockpiles? In my opinion, Canada should 
take a creative approach. For example, should the federal 
government not consider providing technical assistance to 
Russia, as it has in the past? It could, for example, set up a task 
force of technical experts.
<P>
	We know very well that there are competent people in Quebec 
and in the rest of Canada to do this type of work, whose main 
thrust would be the evaluation of how Russia, for example, 
could destroy its manufacturing facilities and its chemical 
weapons at minimal cost.
<P>
	Clearly, signatures and ratification mean little. Accordingly, 
in addition to de facto intentions, the federal government must 
ensure the organization has the intention and the resources to 
make the monitoring system a reality.
<P>
	As you know, both Russia and the United States must 
participate in this convention, if it is to fulfil its role, since they 
have the biggest stockpiles of chemical weapons. As I said 
earlier, neither has yet signed.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois believe that our support for this bill 
will mean that Quebec and Canada will be able to quickly carve 
a choice niche within the various institutions of this new 
international organization.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to be able to speak 
today to Bill C-87, an act to implement the convention on the 
prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use 
of chemical weapons and on their destruction.
<P>
	Questions on chemical and biological weapons were first 
placed on the United Nations agenda in 1969. On September 3, 
1992 the conference on disarmament reached a significant 
milestone in its negotiations with the completion of the draft 
text of the convention on the prohibition of the development, 
production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons for 
presentation to the United Nations.
<P>
	After more than 20 years of long, often difficult discussions 
on negotiations at the conference on disarmament and its 
predecessors in Geneva, the triumph was an agreement finally 
arrived at as a result of genuine, multilateral negotiations.
<P>
	Approval by the United Nations general assembly paved the 
way to the signing ceremony in Paris in January 1993. Canada, a 
strong advocate of multilateral efforts, can take pride in being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12663"> 12663 </A></B>
<P>
one of the 160 signatories of the chemical weapons convention. 
The convention completely outlaws an entire category of 
existing weapons of mass and indiscriminate effect and provides  
for a system of multilateral verification, thus setting a new 
precedent at the global level.
<P>
	As one of the 65 nations that has promised to ratify the treaty 
and bring it into force, Bill C-87 is our commitment to 
implement this convention. Impetus causing responsible nations 
to move toward this agreement was provided by the gulf war 
which provided a heightened awareness of the dangers of 
proliferation.
<P>
	The international community learned important lessons in the 
disarmament of Iraq involving the destruction, removal or 
rendering harmless of chemical, biological and nuclear 
weapons. This poignant lesson played an important part in 
convincing the international community that it was imperative 
for nations to put aside differences and to work together to 
outlaw these terrible weapons of human destruction.
<P>
	When I was a military officer in Germany, I was required for 
several days every month to live and operate in a chemical suit 
with a gas mask close by hand. This was a very traumatic and 
very deeply held experience because while we, the military 
people on the base, had our chemical suits and our gas masks, we 
were fully aware that our dependants did not. Should there be an 
attack, and we were aware that the former Soviet Union 
regularly used this type of weapon in their exercises, our 
dependants would be very vulnerable.
<P>
	There was an evacuation plan but this was a tremendous 
undertaking and would take a tremendous amount of time. Thus, 
we were very much aware of the risk that they were under. As a 
result, I feel as strongly as anyone can feel that we must do our 
utmost to rid the world of chemical weapons.
<P>
	Since they have the greatest number of chemical industries, 
the willingness of the United States and Germany to co-operate 
was vital. Germany ratified the agreement in August last year. 
The United States, with the second largest chemical stockpile in 
the world, is expected to ratify the treaty this year. This will 
hopefully send out a hurry up message to other countries that 
have pledged their support.
<P>
	We too must move without delay to implement Bill C-87, thus 
signifying our commitment to ratify the treaty. In this spirit, I 
support this legislation.
<P>
	During the January 1994 joint summit meeting in Moscow, 
Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton declared their intention to 
promote ratification of the treaty as rapidly as possible, thus 
enabling the convention's entry into force this year.
<P>
	However, the real work lies ahead. Costs of implementation 
will be high. As a rule of thumb, it costs 10 times as much to 
destroy chemical weapon production facilities as it does to build 
them in the first place. With each country bearing individual 
responsibility for the destruction of their chemical weapons, 
undoubtedly there will be financial problems for some 
members, particularly emerging countries and Russia. Both 
financial and technical assistance to those countries  seeking to 
destroy their chemical weapons must be provided by member 
states and this will include Canada.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	A universal system of verification to monitor and ensure the 
destruction of stockpiles will be carried out by the Organization 
for the prohibition of chemical weapons, OPCW. The scope of 
its activities is complex and its mandate is to verify: first, the 
destruction of chemical weapons; second, the destruction of 
chemical weapons production facilities; third, to verify 
non-compliance, ensuring that activities prohibited under the 
convention are detected and traced; fourth, to verify permitted 
production in the chemical industry, to ensure that only 
activities not prohibited under the convention are carried out; 
and fifth, to perform investigations concerning 
non-compliance, that is, challenge inspections, to ensure that 
the cost of cheating will outweigh its benefits.
<P>
	Estimates indicate that the organization for the prohibition of 
chemical weapons will have up to 1,000 staff and will operate 
with an annual budget of $150 million to $180 million. Who will 
pay for this? International inspection expenses will be met by 
Canada and other members, according to a United Nations scale 
of assessment, in addition to the cost of eliminating our own 
chemical weapons and facilities.
<P>
	For emerging member countries, the price of compliance will 
have to be added to the chemicals they export. That will make 
them less competitive.
<P>
	There are other problems, as noted in the book <I>An End to 
Chemical and Biological Weapons?</I> by Richard Latter. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is unclear whether major countries, for example the United States and 
Russia, will be prepared to fund the CWC sufficiently, given their other 
commitments-The U.S., which calculates that incinerating its 30,000 ton 
stockpile would cost $6 to 7 billion, have also agreed to foot part of the bill for 
destroying the 40,000 tons of Russian weapons stock. Even so, the problems of 
getting a destruction program under way means Russia will almost certainly 
have to invoke treaty provisions allowing an extra five years to complete the 
task.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	No doubt Canada will be asked to shoulder some of this 
burden but the overall costs are still largely unclear.
<P>
	In Canada, information from a 1988 survey indicates our 
chemical industry does not use prohibited chemicals listed in 
schedule 1, which includes the toxins sarin and soman, used in 
the war between Iran and Iraq, and the various mustard gases 
used during the first and second world wars. Some of the 
chemicals on the list are used by a few research organizations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12664"> 12664 </A></B>
<P>
	Once Bill C-87 becomes law, such users will be required to 
obtain a licence and be subject to two inspections per year to 
ensure they are following the rules.
<P>
	Chemicals listed in schedule 2A and 2B may not be used to 
any great extent in Canada, but this has yet to be determined. 
Schedule 2 chemicals are used for commercial purposes and if 
production exceeds the listed thresholds, two yearly inspections 
will be required.
<P>
	All substances noted on these lists will be banned for export to 
countries that do not participate in the chemical weapons 
convention.
<P>
	The more commonly used industrial chemicals noted in 
schedule 3 can be produced without inspection under the 30 ton 
threshold. However, amounts exceeding 230 tons will be subject 
to random inspections.
<P>
	Without complete data, the number of companies affected and 
the precise cost for implementation of the new law remains 
unknown. Unquestionably the disposal of chemical weapons, 
facilities and international verification costs to be paid by 
individual member countries will be expensive.
<P>
	In this time of financial constraints the government must 
avoid creating a cumbersome bureaucracy and rather should 
establish a slim, trim and effective agency to inspect and 
monitor the chemical industry. Assumptions are that five full 
time staff will be required for Canada's national authority, plus 
one staff within the foreign affairs department.
<P>
	Using Australia as an example, the bureau of statistics 
gathered data on chemical production relevant to the chemical 
weapons convention which assisted in the determination of 
resources required for its national authority.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The Australian chemical weapons convention office, the 
chemical weapons control organization, as it is called, will be 
closely associated with its safeguards office, also responsible 
for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The director of the 
Australian safeguards office, who is directly responsible to the 
foreign minister, will also be the director of the new chemical 
weapons convention office. This allows for effective use of 
available senior executive and administrative support resources. 
There will be a director, two full time staff with part time 
support drawn as required from experts in other areas of 
government or at times from the private sector. Hopefully our 
government will examine the Australian model for its efficiency 
and application in Canada.
<P>
	Although there is no binding legislation giving government 
authority to demand information, the Department of Foreign 
Affairs has attempted to collect data by initiating a survey of 
2,100 Canadian businesses. About 500 companies have 
responded to the voluntary questionnaire. There is still no clear 
indication as to how many companies will be affected by the 
legislation. Until  government has these data it will be difficult 
to establish projected costs for our clean-up, verification and 
inspection.
<P>
	Bill C-87 closely adheres to the requirements of the chemical 
weapons convention and has the support of the Canadian 
Chemical Producers Association as well as the Canadian 
Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers Association. Officials of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs deserve credit for taking industry 
concerns into consideration during consultations over the past 
eight years.
<P>
	Without Canada's participation in the treaty and industry 
support we would have difficulty competing in the international 
marketplace. Canadian industry imports chemicals for the 
production of many commercial applications and under the 
convention chemicals identified for control will be banned or 
restricted for non-participating countries. Care must be taken to 
ensure regulatory costs do not become so prohibitive that they 
force smaller industries out of business.
<P>
	Additionally we should not impede industry by increasing red 
tape and creating a complex decision making hierarchy. 
Undoubtedly industry will be required to make detailed 
declarations of production and be subject to stringent 
inspections within Canada. These extra costs will have to be 
borne by industry as well as the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	The international secretariat based in The Hague will police 
international compliance. This area was the most controversial 
in achieving a consensus. The general guidelines state the 
inspection teams are to be granted unimpeded access rights. 
They will verify destruction programs, inspect all military 
facilities and civilian plants producing chemicals which could 
be used for armaments in addition to carrying out routine 
monitoring and random checks on other civilian chemical 
installations.
<P>
	Bill C-87, section 13(1)(c) dealing with international 
inspection states: ``Where appropriate, install, use and maintain 
in respect of any place monitoring instruments, systems and 
seals in a manner consistent with the provisions of the 
convention and any facility agreement applicable to the place''.
<P>
	It would seem appropriate or necessary to institute some 
protection to ensure this authority for international inspections 
is not abused.
<P>
	Section 14(1)(b) states: ``Permit the international inspector to 
examine anything in the place being inspected''. Section 
14(1)(c) states: ``Permit the international inspector to make 
copies of any information contained in the records, files, papers 
or electronic information systems kept or used in relation to the 
place being inspected and to remove copies from the place''.

<P>
	Further clarification and expansion would seem to be in order. 
Commercial espionage is a recognized reality and industry 
understandably fears the disclosure of valuable commercial 
information to competitors. Every effort must be made to ensure 
our national security is not put at risk. Some form of checks and 
balances should be put in place as under the current legislation it 
appears Canada would not have the right to restrict inspection 
teams. Reasonable management procedures should be identified 
and implemented so that national security is not jeopardized.
<P>
	Effective implementation of the treaty's provisions will pay 
off in long term world security dividends. It is important these 
national protection issues be addressed now.
<P>
	We stand at a pivotal juncture on the world stage. We can 
succeed or we can fail in this effort to lower the risk of 
inadvertent or impulsive use of chemical weapons.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Our success in this instance will reap great benefits and assist 
by setting the example in the larger task of implementing 
co-operative approaches to problems in other areas, regionally 
or globally.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure today to speak at second reading on Bill C-87 
concerning the prohibition of chemical weapons.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the chemical weapons convention 
which Canada signed in 1993. We will also support this 
legislation allowing us to be among the first groups of countries 
to implement the convention's terms of agreement.
<P>
	As all members of the House are well aware, Canada has been 
a world leader when it comes to the promotion of peace. We have 
given steadfast support to the UN, provided peacekeepers in 
times of need and promoted international agreements and 
regimes to limit the dangers of war.
<P>
	In the case of the chemical weapons convention we are 
dealing with a particularly important issue. Not only is the use 
of chemical weapons highly illegitimate against combatants 
who at least have some protection against them, but the threat of 
their use against civilian populations is an intolerable breach of 
civilized conduct by any nation.
<P>
	Most of us will remember with horror the terrible scenes of 
the Kurdish villages gassed by the Iraqi dictator Saddam 
Hussein in the late 1980s. This is the kind of tragedy that must 
be avoided at all costs in the future. By ratifying Bill C-87 
Canada will be doing its part toward this end.
<P>
	In the news today we see the arrest of the person in Japan 
allegedly responsible for the gas attack in the subway station in 
Japan. I hope Bill C-87 would go a long way to ensure that type 
of terrorist activity is never allowed on any part of the planet.
<P>
	Bill C-87 prohibits the production or use of chemical 
weapons and provides for the regulation of certain chemicals 
that can readily be turned into chemical weapons. As we speak, 
similar pieces of legislation are being prepared throughout the 
world. Hopefully by this fall the convention will come into 
force. As things now stand, a large majority of countries have 
signed on, which is quite promising. The fewer countries outside 
of this convention, the more pressure there will be to adhere 
strictly to its goals and provisions.
<P>
	Unfortunately several middle eastern countries are refusing to 
join the convention. They argue that because Israel is not willing 
to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, they cannot sign on. 
While I hope they will reconsider, I also hope the Government of 
Israel will bring its nuclear program out of the closet and join 
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The chemical weapons 
convention and the NNPT are agreements in the best interest of 
the people and governments of the world. Therefore they should 
not be used for tactical advantage by any government.
<P>
	Moving on to the substance of the bill, while the Reform Party 
supports the bill, we are looking at it closely to see if there are 
constructive amendments that should be made to it during 
debate and in committee. High on the list for Reform are the 
costs to the taxpayer and to Canadian industry. While we 
acknowledge the bill has some legitimate costs, according to our 
preliminary investigation the government does not yet know the 
price tag on Bill C-87.
<P>
	As Bill C-87 works its way through the legislative process, 
we should try to determine how best to improve it so 
implementation will be as cost effective as possible. For 
example, we must avoid the creation of a huge new bureaucracy 
to monitor and regulate the Canadian chemical industry.
<P>
	Officials at foreign affairs have advised us that a full time 
staff of five as a national authority plus one additional staffer at 
foreign affairs might be needed. We should make sure it does not 
go beyond this. At any rate, during committee the question 
should be carefully addressed.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Another key question for the committee will be the inspection 
powers used to monitor the industry. As we have seen in another 
government bill, Bill C-68 on gun control, the government can 
be very heavy handed and intrusive if it is left to its own devices. 
Reform wants to make sure this case is not repeated on Bill 
C-87.
<P>
	More important, Reform has some serious concerns about the 
privacy of businesses which will fall under the auspices of Bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12666"> 12666 </A></B>
<P>
C-87. Industries subject to inspection must fully comply with 
inspectors or be subject to summary conviction or conviction on 
indictment. Under the more serious category persons will be 
subject up to five years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
<P>
	Considering these serious penalties, business people will be 
forced to comply even if they feel their legitimate rights to 
privacy are being violated. Under sections 14(1)(b) and (c) the 
inspectors can examine anything in the place being inspected 
and make copies of any information contained in the records, 
files, papers or electronic information systems kept or used in 
relation to the place being inspected and to remove the copies 
from that place.
<P>
	Although I know the intent of the legislation aims to fulfil the 
obligations of the convention, I am slightly worried these 
investigations could be used as a fishing expedition by the 
government to sift companies through a fine tooth comb.
<P>
	Parliament should be sure such inspections are required to 
directly investigate whether companies are breaching the 
chemical weapons convention. Fishing expeditions should be 
specifically prohibited.
<P>
	Under section 15(3) the bill says search warrants would not be 
required even if an inspector were refused entry to a premises if 
there are exigent circumstances. Although the justice 
department likes the wording and argues it is necessary so 
inspectors can have a freer hand, I am not convinced. As we all 
know, there are no industries in Canada that currently make 
chemical weapons or use them. What circumstances would be so 
pressing that a warrant could not be obtained? If this provision is 
only to be used in extreme emergencies where inspectors must 
take immediate action it should state so explicitly. If on the 
other hand it is intended to be used for the convenience of 
inspectors it should be removed from the bill.
<P>
	Section 20 reminds me of the government's gun control bill. It 
states every person who contravenes any provisions of this act is 
guilty of an offence and is liable to either an indictable or 
summary conviction. Once again I realize the government is 
casting a wide net in order to avoid loopholes. However, this 
means to me that a business which incorrectly reports its 
activities or fills out a form incorrectly would be guilty of an 
offence under the Criminal Code of Canada. If a clerk makes the 
mistake would that employee be convicted? Would the owner? 
What about the board of directors? Would it be the clerk's 
supervisor? Surely this must be cleared up.
<P>
	While I do not have anything against seriously punishing a 
company secretly making or selling chemical weapons, I think 
the bill may be going too far. Just like Bill C-68, we have to 
target the criminals and those who are willfully breaking the 
chemical weapons convention, not ordinary Canadians or 
business people who get caught up in the government's web.
<P>
	Another section which caught my attention is 23(1), which 
talks about how the government can at the discretion of the 
minister in charge dispose of items seized under this act.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	As I looked through the act, however, I did not see exactly 
where the government was given authority to seize property or 
what the limits were on that seizure. I would certainly want this 
point clarified in debate and during committee.
<P>
	As I read through the details of the bill, I eventually came to 
the three schedules of chemicals that are being regulated. All 
prohibited chemical weapons are listed in schedule 1. According 
to my understanding, these chemicals are not used by any 
industry in Canada. However, there are a few research 
organizations that do require them. If Bill C-87 passes, these 
researchers will be required to obtain a licence from the 
government to continue with their activities. They will also be 
subject to two inspections per year to ensure that they are 
following the rules. A fee will be charged for this licence.
<P>
	I do not have a problem with any of this, subject to the 
following two conditions. First, my concerns about privacy and 
the targeting of this legislation should be addressed to ensure 
that we are not whittling away at legitimate freedoms and 
liberties of Canadians. Second, the fee charged for this licence 
should be reasonable. Perhaps a maximum fee could be decided 
on during the committee stage or it should be made explicit that 
the fees would be on a cost recovery basis only.
<P>
	Moving on to the chemicals in schedule 2, these are known as 
precursors and are one step removed from being chemical 
weapons. They are used for some commercial processes but not 
too extensively.
<P>
	Companies producing or using schedule 2 chemicals in 
amounts beyond a certain threshold will be required to report 
this to the government. Beyond a second threshold, those 
companies will also be subject to an inspection of up to two per 
year maximum. While there is no licensing for schedule 2 
chemicals, certain new chemicals will be added to the Export 
Permits Act.
<P>
	In addition, three years after Bill C-87 passes, the export of 
schedule 2 chemicals will be banned to countries that are not 
signatories to the convention. Until then, importers in 
non-signatory countries will be required to produce end use 
certificates for schedule 2 chemicals.
<P>
	As for the schedule 3 chemicals, these are more commonly 
used industrial chemicals. Companies producing schedule 3 
chemicals in amounts beyond a certain threshold will be 
required to report this to the government. Beyond a second 
threshold those producers may be subject to infrequent random 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12667"> 12667 </A></B>
<P>
inspections to ensure compliance with the convention. In 
addition, facilities that work with discrete organic chemicals 
must report this to the government.
<P>
	Export of schedule 3 chemicals to non-signatory countries 
will require end use certificates, and after five years further 
measures may be imposed.
<P>
	Looking at Bill C-87 as a whole, I believe Canadians will 
support this bill strongly. Canadians have always been strong 
supporters of multilateral efforts to promote peace and restrict 
arms proliferation. This is especially true with respect to the 
prohibition of the use of chemical weapons. By asserting 
leadership in this area, Canada is standing up for the extension 
of a rules based multilateral system to defend our interests and 
promote common norms and values with like minded countries.
<P>
	In conclusion, Reform will support this bill, and throughout 
the legislative process we will seek to improve it. These 
improvements will make its implementation as pain free as 
possible for industry while still upholding Canada's 
commitments under the chemical weapons convention.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANDAIRYCOMMISSIONACT">CANADIAN DAIRY COMMISSION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-86, an act to amend the 
Canadian Dairy Commission Act, be read the second time and 
referred to committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
today in support of Bill C-86, an act to amend the Canadian 
Dairy Commission Act, and to urge speedy passage of this 
important bill and the amendments it brings forward to this act.
<P>
	This government is strongly committed to building our vision 
of a growing, competitive, market oriented agriculture and 
agri-food sector. Canada's dairy industry is a key component of 
that sector. Trade and market development, both here at home 
and abroad, are crucial to achieving the sustainable growth 
necessary to allow this vision to materialize for dairy producers, 
processors, and further processors in the industry.
<P>
	In recent years value added exports have grown steadily in 
importance for the dairy sector. I would like to add as well at this 
time that I commend those in the dairy industry for the approach 
and the actions they are taking in meeting the challenges that are 
coming forward, the competition that is there, and the way in 
which they are able to meet that competition and 
competitiveness in the export markets with the use of these 
amendments.
<P>
	Market realities call for changes in the way dairy stakeholders 
do their business. It is essential to facilitate industry driven 
marketing approaches in the new GATT environment. With the 
passage of the amendments before us in this bill, we will enable 
the Canadian dairy sector to meet some of these new challenges. 
These amendments will allow for the maintenance of a 
successful, effective, and equitable framework for the orderly 
marketing of milk and other dairy products in Canada and 
beyond our borders, a framework developed and supported by 
the industry. I repeat that it has been developed and supported by 
the industry itself.
<P>
	Bill C-86, along with this amendment, to the Canadian Dairy 
Commission Act was given first reading here in this place on 
April 28. It will provide the necessary federal legislative 
authority to permit the Canadian Dairy Commission, in close 
co-operation with the provinces, to implement a national milk 
pricing system with the pooling of market returns from different 
classes of milk and use. No cost to government is involved in 
these amendments.
<P>
	This new strategy conforms with Canada's trade 
commitments under NAFTA and the WTO agreements. It will 
provide a mechanism for the Canadian dairy industry to 
continue to supply important export and domestic markets for 
dairy products and products containing dairy ingredients, while 
at the same time maintaining the equity that is inherent in the 
current supply management regime.
<P>
	Under the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, which has been 
incorporated into the North American free trade agreement, or 
NAFTA, as we know it, export subsidies are not permitted on 
bilateral trade in agricultural products. Also, under the World 
Trade Organization agreement, which was implemented on 
January 1, 1995, the definition of export subsidies includes 
producer-financed export assistance. Therefore, as of August 1, 
1995, the current system of using producer levies to finance 
dairy product exports to the United States will be prohibited. 
The ability to use levies to finance dairy product exports to other 
destinations is also gradually being reduced in volume and 
dollar terms under the WTO agreement.
<P>
	Currently, through levies, milk producers across Canada 
share the costs associated with the export of dairy products not 
required for domestic consumption.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	These levies also currently provide the funds that are needed 
to facilitate the payment of rebates to further  processors of 
products containing dairy ingredients. Such rebates have been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12668"> 12668 </A></B>
<P>
necessary to assist further processors using dairy ingredients to 
successfully compete in domestic and export markets and to 
assist exporters of primary dairy products to be competitive on 
the export market.
<P>
	The Canadian Dairy Commission administers these export 
and rebate initiatives on behalf of the dairy industry. These costs 
have always been considered to be a necessary part of managing 
the milk marketing system in Canada as a whole. The issue of 
equity between producers is central to the current milk 
marketing system in Canada and is preserved in the new pricing 
and pooling approach that will be enabled by this bill.
<P>
	Equity is currently maintained through the payment of levies 
on every hectolitre of milk produced in Canada. Each province's 
current levy obligation is calculated by the commission on the 
basis of total fluid and industrial milk production. Levies are 
collected by provincial marketing boards and agencies through 
the deductions from producer milk payments and are remitted to 
the commission.
<P>
	If Bill C-86 is not implemented by August 1, important dairy 
exports to the United States using producer financed levies will 
be in jeopardy. Furthermore, while export subsidies by levies to 
other destinations could continue for now, these subsidized 
shipments will also have to be reduced over time.
<P>
	Canadian further processors, such as Hershey Limited in the 
nearby city of Smith Falls, De Tomasso Limited in Montreal, or 
McCains in New Brunswick, which use dairy inputs and 
products such as condensed milk, butter, and mozzarella in their 
chocolate and pizza products, for example, rely on U.S. exports 
to maintain the competitiveness of their Canadian production 
facilities. These companies, which employ thousands of 
Canadians, must continue to be able to obtain dairy ingredients 
at world price levels if they are to continue to successfully 
compete on the export market and to be competitive with the 
imports on the domestic market.
<P>
	Pricing these dairy inputs at the producer level at U.S. 
competitive prices would eliminate the need for charging levies 
to producers and paying rebates to processors and would thus be 
a GATT-WTO acceptable method of maintaining this U.S. 
export activity. However, without the approach of pooling 
producer returns, which is enabled by this bill, Bill C-86, there 
would be no way of maintaining the producer equity that is 
achieved through the current levy system.
<P>
	Without being able to pool returns on a national basis, milk 
producers in provinces where more Canadian processing and 
further processing activity takes place would be particularly 
impacted by the reduced market returns involved.
<P>
	Under the amendments proposed in this bill, the levy system 
as it applies to milk marketed in interprovincial and export trade 
would be replicated through the creation of special milk classes 
where prices would be set at competitive market of destination 
levels and through pooling of the returns from those markets.
<P>
	To maintain equity among producers across the country, milk 
revenues will be pooled and redistributed to producers through 
the Canadian Dairy Commission and provincial authorities 
according to terms agreed upon by the industry and the 
provincial authorities and set out in federal-provincial 
agreements.
<P>
	In order to enable the Canadian Dairy Commission to 
administer such a pooling system for producers, certain federal 
and provincial administrative powers must be dovetailed 
legislatively. Most provinces currently have legislation 
authorizing pricing and pooling of returns on milk sold within 
their boundaries. The Canadian Dairy Commission requires 
similar pricing and pooling powers for milk sold across 
provincial boundaries and for exports. The commission must 
also be provided with the authority to both delegate and receive 
these new pricing and pooling powers from the provincial 
authorities. Such dovetailing of federal and provincial 
authorities does not involve any encroachment on current 
provincial powers.
<P>
	The principal amendments to the Canadian Dairy 
Commission Act contained in this bill provide the commission 
with the legal administrative authority to calculate the average 
national price level for the milk classes whose returns will be 
pooled. Also it allows them to obtain the returns from sales to 
processors through the provinces and redistribute the returns to 
producers through provincial authorities on an equitable basis as 
per the terms of the formal federal-provincial agreements.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	As I indicated earlier, the same effect is now being achieved 
through the producer levy system which finances such 
initiatives as the Canadian Dairy Commission's dairy product 
export assistance program; the rebate program for further 
processors and the butterfat utilization program.
<P>
	Other amendments contained in Bill C-86 enable the dairy 
commission to recover pooling administration costs from funds 
generated by the pool itself; to establish a special bank account 
to deal solely with the producer moneys entering and leaving the 
pool; allow the commission to return any excess fees or levy 
funds to producers; permit the commission to establish a line of 
credit to ensure continuity of producer payments and strengthen 
the enforcement provisions of the act.
<P>
	The price discrimination and pooling system approach that it 
will enable by Bill C-86 was developed through extensive dairy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12669"> 12669 </A></B>
<P>
stakeholder consultation and negotiations and is supported by 
provincial agriculture and agri-food ministers.
<P>
	I have a number of letters of support from provincial 
governments, milk producers, organizations and provincial 
boards from across the country, from Newfoundland, Prince 
Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, B.C., the Dairy Farmers of 
Canada, the UPA and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. 
They all support this bill and ask us to move it through this place 
and the other place as quickly as possible.
<P>
	For the past two years stakeholders have dedicated extensive 
time and effort to develop a means of keeping in step with and 
responding successfully to all of the changes taking place in the 
domestic and international marketplace. Several working 
groups and committees, including the diary industry strategic 
planning committee, the negotiating subcommittee and the 
policy and all milk pooling committees, have all been 
established under the auspices of the Canadian milk supply 
management committee.
<P>
	The committee oversees the application of a national milk 
marketing plan, the federal-provincial agreement which 
governs milk supply management in Canada. Chaired by the 
Canadian Dairy Commission, the Canadian milk supply 
management committee has representation from producers and 
governments from all provinces except Newfoundland, which is 
not a signatory to the national plan because it does not produce 
significant amounts of milk used in the industrial product sector. 
National processor and consumer groups also participate in the 
nationwide forum.
<P>
	The federal-provincial task force on orderly marketing also 
reviewed the progress made by the dairy sector in defining a new 
framework for sustainable, orderly marketing. Last December 
ministers of agriculture and agri-food were advised of the 
industry's recommendation that national price discrimination 
be endorsed as the only viable option to continue current 
programs designed to export to the United States and maintain 
domestic markets facing import competition, and that the 
preferable method of sharing returns from price discrimination 
at the national level. The method that is equitable and GATT 
acceptable is the pooling of returns from all milk classes.
<P>
	Ministers subsequently supported this approach and directed 
that amendments to the Canadian Dairy Commission Act be 
developed to provide for a national pooling of milk returns to 
delegated administrative functions.
<P>
	The bill before us today is the culmination of this 
comprehensive, consultative process. Through the system 
enabled under Bill C-86, the dairy sector is adapting to a 
changing business environment. I congratulate it for doing that.
<P>
	Dairy stakeholders have developed a flexible and more 
market oriented approach that will set the industry on a viable 
course for the long term. The approach will also encourage 
greater co-operation among provincial milk marketing boards, 
agencies and processors in developing new markets for 
Canadian dairy ingredients and products.
<P>
	I urge all members and all parties in the House to give these 
amendments speedy consideration and passage so that we can 
continue to have a growing and strong dairy industry in this 
country.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before giving the floor to 
our colleague from Frontenac, I wish to advise him that the 
Chair will have to interrupt him to allow oral question period to 
proceed but that he will get to complete his speech afterwards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, for the clarification. I will of course comply.
<P>
	I would like mention right away that five of my colleagues 
will join me in debate on Bill C-86, a bill of major importance 
for Quebecers in our view. I will be supported by the hon. 
members for Champlain, Lotbinière, Québec-Est, 
Matapédia-Matane and Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead 
throughout the day and tomorrow, if need be, as I put across our 
views on Bill C-86, which, I must tell you right away, we will be 
supporting. We do not have any amendment to put forth at this 
time. I can therefore assure the hon. member for Prince 
Edward-Hastings of our full support.
<P>
	The GATT negotiations in Geneva led dairy producers a merry 
dance. Negotiations concerning article XI in particular, as well 
as discussions about maintaining a supply management system 
did not give much comfort to dairy producers.
<P>
	I remember attending, in December 1993, a few weeks after 
this government took office, a large meeting with some dairy 
producers from my riding. The meeting was held in 
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce, in the riding of the independent 
member for Beauce. There were between 500 and 600 farm 
producers in attendance, and they sounded quite worried. This 
meeting was chaired by the chief economist of the UPA in 
Quebec, Yvon Proulx, assisted by two other persons.
<P>
	I must say that three questions were asked over and over by 
our dairy producers. The first question of particular interest to 
them was this: Will supply management with respect to milk be 
maintained?
<P>
	I clearly remember the answer chief economist Proulx gave 
them at the time, as it left me wondering. He said something like 
this: ``My friends, if you want supply management, you can 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12670"> 12670 </A></B>
<P>
have it. If you exercise self-discipline, we can have a 
well-disciplined dairy policy in Quebec and Canada''.
<P>
	He managed to give some reassurances to the producers, who 
feared among other things that producers could decide overnight 
to increase their dairy herd, or that those running a cow-calf 
operation could suddenly decide to start dairy production to 
supplement their income.
<P>
	Another matter of concern to producers was quota value. I 
remember one producer saying: ``I could have sold my farm for 
$1.5 million last fall. Will I be able to sell it for the same price 
with these declining quota values?'' Of course, the question 
remains unanswered. It was not answered in October 1993. Just 
this week, I read in <I>La terre de chez nous</I> an article by none other 
than the president of the union representing agricultural 
producers in the Châteauguay valley, Peter Bienz, who figured 
out that his dairy quota was worth hundreds of thousands of 
dollars and who is most interested in what will happen to the 
value of his quota.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	A milk quota is only a work permit, a piece of paper, a 
certificate which says, for example, that so-and-so has the right 
to produce 12,000 kilos of milk fat per year. Our agricultural 
producers are extremely concerned about the monetary value of 
this piece of paper, which is now so valuable in Quebec, because 
many of them see it as their pension fund. They are not like MPs 
who, after sitting in the House of Commons for six years and 
reaching the age of 55, as provided in the new bill under 
consideration, can receive a pension for life, which, all in all, is 
quite reasonable after spending six years in this House. 
Unfortunately for them, farmers do not enjoy the same perks. 
They equate their pension fund with the value of their quotas, so 
I hope that this value will not be slashed.
<P>
	Finally, another question of concern to farm producers was 
the following: Will the proposed import tariffs ranging from 181 
to 350 per cent remain the same?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see that the time is passing very quickly and, 
with your permission, I would like to stop now and resume my 
speech after Question Period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, my dear colleague, you may resume your 
speech after Question Period. You will be first.
<P>
	It being 2 o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I met 
recently with four high school students from my riding 
representing Street Kids International, an organization which 
raises awareness about human rights abuses perpetrated against 
the most defenceless segment of society, our children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During our meeting, these young students pointed out 
Guatemala's, Brazil's and Colombia's flagrant violations of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. For a government to 
order that homeless children be killed because they are seen as 
harmful to society is totally unacceptable to Canadians.
<P>
	As a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
the Canadian government must make every effort to ensure 
respect for the rights of children whatever their nationality and 
wherever they live. It is a matter of justice and human dignity.

	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, now 
we know what cynicism really is. After relentlessly condemning 
the federal government's interference in the health sector, and 
after strongly criticizing the national standards imposed by that 
same government, the Minister of Labour is now making an 
about face and claiming that Quebecers want national standards.
<P>
	She says that the government must make sure that everyone 
can benefit from the social programs which give Canada its 
distinct character.
<P>
	What irony. After defending the idea of Quebec as a distinct 
society, which implied the rejection of Canada-wide standards, 
the minister now claims to want to protect Canada's distinct 
society with these same standards.
<P>
	This is mind boggling.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
more Ontarians learn about the Liberal gun control bill the more 
they oppose it. They oppose the bill because gun registration has 
never proven to decrease crime. It failed in New Zealand and 
Australia. They oppose the bill because it contains draconian 
search and seizure measures like those of a totalitarian state. 
They oppose the bill because the consultation process was 
non-existent at worst and haphazard at best. They oppose the 
bill because it will cost between $100 million and $500 million 
of scarce taxpayers' money. They oppose the bill because they 
want real reduction in crime and not a made in Ottawa solution 
that will not work.
<P>
	If Ontario MPs fail to represent their constituents and oppose 
Bill C-68, the old saying about safety in numbers will fail to 
apply to Ontario's voice in Ottawa.

recently in an attempt to explore opportunities to enhance 
democracy through the use of new technologies.
<P>
	I have made a personal commitment to consultation in my 
riding and this initiative is another step in refining the process. 
The brainstorming session that took place covered all areas of 
technology with representatives from cable, computer, 
software, hardware, communications and telecommunications 
industries.
<P>
	I anticipate great things as a result of the gathering with more 
access available to the public policy development process and a 
real economic development benefit to the high tech centre of 
Atlantic Canada, Fredericton, New Brunswick.

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is difficult to understand why rBST is needed in 
Canada, a country that produces dairy products of the highest 
international quality.
<P>
	The National Dairy Council of Canada is strongly opposed to 
rBST. It refers to it as being an unneeded and unwanted intrusion 
into its business that offers no benefits whatsoever to consumers 
and processors.
<P>
	Dairy cows injected with rBST are at greater risk of 
developing mastitis, a condition requiring the use of antibiotics. 
This will increase the dumping and waste of milk and potentially 
can lead to increased levels of antibiotic residues in milk for 
antibiotics that escape current detection methods.
<P>
	Some researchers are concerned with the possible link 
between rBST and human health risks. I urge Health Canada to 
extend the moratorium on rBST. By waiting until conclusive 
independent studies have been completed Health Canada will 
have protected the health of Canadians.

pleased to inform the House of the Canadian Advanced 
Technology Association 1995 Award of Distinction being 
awarded to Research in Motion of Waterloo.
<P>
	The CATA award for outstanding product achievement was 
presented to RIM in recognition of its exceptional contribution 
to the growth and competitiveness of Canada's advanced 
technology industry. The award was presented to RIM at the 
Global Connections Conference on May 3 to May 5, 1995 in 
Calgary.
<P>
	Research in Motion represents the best that Canada has to 
offer in the new economy. RIM is a 100 per cent Canadian 
owned, export oriented, high technology company operating in 
the wireless data communications sector.
<P>
	RIM's CATA award is the second award given to a Waterloo 
company in as many years. Mortice Kerns Systems won the 
1994 award for its Internet anywhere software which eases 
access to the Internet.
<P>
	The federal riding of Waterloo is in the heart of Canada's 
technology triangle and is a critical mass for technological 
innovation. Research in Motion is to be congratulated for its 
achievements as a leading edge Canadian company competing 
in a global stadium and bringing home the gold.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
while Ottawa keeps procrastinating regarding the Program for 
Older Worker Adjustment, the Quebec government is taking 
concrete action. Yesterday, Quebec labour minister, Louise 
Harel, announced that her department would help older workers 
who are victims of mass layoffs but are not eligible to POWA.
<P>
	For five years now, the Quebec government has been asking 
that the program be amended, since many older workers are not 
eligible because of criteria which are too restrictive. When they 
were in opposition, the federal Liberals strongly supported 
Quebec's claims. However, now that they are in office, they are 
not following up on their stance.
<P>
	Once again, to ensure fair treatment to all Quebecers, the 
provincial government is forced to go ahead without federal 
financial support, in spite of the fact that Quebecers pay close to 
$30 billion in taxes every year.

113 kilometres of Trans-Canada Highway from Gull Lake,

15 years that

people have been injured.
<P>
	Twinning would cost $35 million. Last fall Saskatchewan had 
its money on the table but Transport Canada would not pony up 
its share.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	Each year the federal government collects $5 billion in road 
fuel taxes and puts only 10 per cent of it back into the national 
highway system. There seems to be no limit to funds for hockey 
rinks, swimming pools and silly bureaucratic projects like 
universal firearms registration but nothing for this long overdue 
investment in essential infrastructure, an investment that would 
save lives.

	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again 
Henri Daviault, the man charged with sexual assault of an 
elderly disabled woman, was acquitted by using drunkenness as 
a defence.
<P>
	After consuming an enormous amount of alcohol this man 
dragged the victim out of her wheelchair and sexually assaulted 
her. Despite the fact that the crime was committed, the courts 
determined that Mr. Daviault was too drunk to know what he was 
doing.
<P>
	His acquittal has rightfully angered many Canadians. I have 
received a petition of several hundred names from the Sexual 
assault crisis centre of Chatham-Kent. Every signature 
demonstrates the frustration with the justice system and proves 
that Bill C-72 is needed and applauded by many.
<P>
	Each time Mr. Daviault was acquitted of this hideous crime 
the dissenting judges commented that Parliament was free to 
deal with the matter of intoxication and criminal fault. That is 
exactly what the government is doing.
<P>
	I rise in support of the bill and hope its passage will help in 
strengthening our justice system.

Speaker, in Etobicoke-Lakeshore many women from diverse 
business backgrounds have come together to establish a network 
to help women in business.
<P>
	The Professional Women's Network will provide a much 
needed forum for local business development and for the needs 
of professional and business women. These women representing 
a broad representation of professions will meet regularly to 
exchange ideas, share information, and work together to create 
opportunities for each other and for our community.
<P>
	The growing prominence of women in professions and other 
sectors has proven to be a major factor in Canada's future 
growth, and the Professional Women's Network in 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore is testament to that fact.
<P>
	The Liberal government recognizes the women of Canada 
have the imagination and determination to participate fully in 
the growing world economy. I support, commend and encourage 
the ingenuity of these and all women across Canada.

Liberal government. I say it is about time.
<P>
	Soon after the campaign started the Lyn McLeod Liberals 
released their plan to get Ontario back on track. York University 
economist Fred Lazar said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have had a chance to review the assumptions and the numbers in the Liberal 
balanced budget plan. This plan to balance Ontario's budget in four years while 
providing stable multi-year funding to the transfer partners in health, education 
and the municipalities is a realistic doable approach to re-establishing fiscal 
responsibility in Ontario. A balanced budget is key to creating a healthy 
economic climate that will in turn stimulate investment and bring jobs to Ontario.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Only a plan that aims to balance a budget within the term of a government can 
be considered to be a balanced budget plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

of Foreign Affairs has announced that Canada is preparing to 
start trading with certain countries regardless of their human 
rights violations. According to the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, the liberalization of trade is the best 
means of promoting the respect of human rights.
<P>
	These words will be of no comfort to those on death row in 
Indonesia, China, Saudi Arabia, Burma and Iraq. The most 
ironic thing about the whole situation is that the Liberal 
government, with the Prime Minister showing the way, is so 
happy with this development that it is actually bragging about it. 
Money has no smell. As for the Liberal government, it has no 
scruples. It has traded them in for several million greenbacks.

<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	Every day another article appears stating that the grand 
schemes proposed by the minister last year have been scrapped. 
His own discussion papers on unemployment insurance state 
that 26 per cent of UI claimants have filed four or more claims in 
the last five years. First he says this is a serious problem that 
needs to be addressed, and now he is saying it is not a problem 
and does not need to be addressed. The minister just cannot seem 
to make up his mind.
<P>
	Today the minister is reported to have said that the social 
reform proposals have had to take a backseat to cutting the 
federal deficit. Reducing the number of repeat users of 
unemployment insurance would help cut the federal deficit, and 
still he will not implement the needed reforms.
<P>
	If the minister cannot make the tough decisions, he should 
turn the administration of UI over to the workers and the 
employers who pay the premiums. The minister flails and fails 
again.

<P>
	Quebecers do not want taxes to go up, no matter who collects 
them. They want a responsible finance minister, someone who, 
like his federal counterpart and those in several provinces across 
Canada, works hard to reduce spending and the deficit without 
raising taxes.
<P>
	The Canadian government has reviewed all government 
programs and proposed measures to reduce spending and the 
deficit. Its approach was logical, involving a great deal of 
consultation and skill and none of this rushing around to close 
down hospitals, for instance.

<P>
	Local authorities in St. Catharines, Thorold, Niagara Falls 
and Niagara-on-the-Lake have been working together toward 
the transfer for quite some time. The national airports policy 
announced by the transport minister last summer provided a 
perfect opportunity to make the transfer a reality.
<P>
	Local control of the airport will provide a more hands on 
approach where local stakeholders can be directly involved in 
airport responsibilities. The transfer will enable the airport to

forever.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has shown he does not understand 
what consultation means with his gun bill. Now we hear that the 
minister of Indian affairs is imitating his colleague and has a

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, at a meeting with his Quebec counterpart who 
came to Ottawa with three bills for a total amount of $333 
million, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs once again 
refused to meet his financial commitments. The minister even 
told Quebec, in no uncertain terms, to take the matter to court.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Are we to 
understand from the arrogant reply of his intergovernmental 
affairs minister that this is the new flexible federalism: asking 
Quebec to sue for payment of accounts in arrears?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the reply the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs gave yesterday was quite satisfactory. One aspect of the 
problem is being checked by the auditor general. Another aspect 
is being checked again. If there were any mistakes, we can 
correct them, but for the time being, we have no information to 
that effect.
<P>
	As for the third matter, when determining payments to the 
provinces, the Minister of Finance does this according to 
formulas that are in the legislation. There is no flexibility, and if 
someone thinks the law was not interpreted as it should be, then 
that person should, and there are precedents for this, ask the 
courts to intervene.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is the same kind of answer we got for months to 
requests for reimbursement of referendum costs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Exactly the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Ottawa has been particularly stubborn in the 
case of the cost of educating young aboriginal people, which 
amounted to $119 million, payment of which has been 
outstanding for eight years. As you know, this amount is payable 
under the James Bay Agreement signed by Ottawa in 1968.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister to explain why, considering 
these delays and dilatory measures, the only offer he will let his 
minister make to his Quebec counterpart is to appoint a new 
committee of officials that will conduct more meetings.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the James Bay Agreement contains a section 
indicating the province and the federal government must agree 
on budgets and their content.
<P>
	In this case, the Province of Quebec refused to fulfil its part of 
the agreement. It did not give the federal government a chance to 
check assets and the number of non-natives among the student 
population. Consequently, we had no way of knowing what the 
federal government's share actually was.
<P>
	During that time we paid $464 million for aboriginal 
education. During that time, and in fact quite recently, we 
offered to review the matter with the Quebec government in an 
attempt to clear up this problem, and the ball is now in the court 
of the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if the minister wanted to know more about the case, 
he could talk to his colleague, the Minister of Labour, who used 
to be the Minister of Education responsible for this matter in 
Quebec City and as such filed claims that have gone unpaid for 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Times have changed. She sold out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not true that the 
Government of Quebec refused to provide the information. The 
fact is, more young aboriginal people are getting an education as 
a result of social measures introduced by the Quebec 
government, and the federal government, which finds this 
surprising, refuses to acknowledge this development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Yes, tell it like it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> My question is directed to the Prime Minister. 
Since the Quebec minister suggested to her federal counterpart 
that they leave their officials at home and sit down like two 
reasonable people and deal with the issue face to face, could the 
Prime Minister instruct his minister to sit down and negotiate 
and settle this immediately?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, it is clear that both the Province of Quebec and the 
federal government will have to review the case and again 
<P>
<HR>

establish what the facts are.  It is clear the Province of Quebec

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Bill C-76, which implements provisions of the budget, 
contains no provision on the human resources investment fund 
announced in the budget. The latest ministerial overview, an 
official document of the Department of Human Resources 
Development, indicates this fund will have a budget of more 
than $4 billion, at least $2 billion of which come from the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister confirm that the human resources 
investment fund will have a budget of $4 billion, financed in 
large part by the unemployment insurance fund, to enable it to 
interfere further with new manpower training, income 
supplement and day care service initiatives?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is becoming more and 
more frequent for the hon. member to confuse numbers. I would 
not suggest she is doing it deliberately.
<P>
	The hon. member knows quite well it has been explained that 
the human resource investment fund has a way of consolidating 
a number of existing expenditures so we can begin to provide a 
much more effective delivery in a decentralized community 
way. It gives our employment centres much more discretion, 
much more accountability to make decisions at the local level, 
working in partnership with their counterparts at the provincial, 
municipal and community levels.
<P>
	To again try to elevate it into another wild attack about 
interventionism misses the whole point. It is really designed to 
give a lot more control in the local and regional community to 
make decisions about how to get back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
central government does not have jurisdiction in these areas.
<P>
	Are we to understand that, with this human resources 
investment fund, the minister is attempting to carry out the 
reform of social programs he has been unable to finalize up to 
now because of nationwide condemnation, and that, far from 
responding to the demands of Quebec, he intends to intervene 
further, thus adding to existing waste and muddle in the area of 
manpower training?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, almost a year ago I made a 
specific set of offers to all the provinces to share a number of our

and invite the provinces to join with us in the planning of 
programs we have in common and that we would transfer 
existing programs.

what is really happening in the military.
<P>
	Ms. Cardinal went on to imply that the suicide rate in the 
armed forces was acceptable because we get our recruits from 
the most susceptible portion of the population and that the 
airborne videos came from ex-soldiers who needed cash 
because they had blown their pay cheques on Camaros. These 
are remarkable statements to be made by the defence 
department's senior mouthpiece.
<P>
	Does the Minister of National Defence agree that these 
comments are completely inappropriate, and does he still have 
full confidence in his director general of public affairs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
certainly the comments that have been publicized on television 
and have come to my attention are disturbing. It is a matter that 
the deputy minister of national defence is looking into at the 
moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Ms. Cardinal was hired for her present position by Bob 
Fowler, the former deputy minister of defence, who has been 
under investigation by the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
	In her speech to the Media Club she went out of her way to 
discredit one of the principal critics of what went on in Somalia, 
Dr. Barry Armstrong, saying that his story did not have credence 
and that he had been proven wrong by an independent group of 
investigators. The validity of Dr. Armstrong's testimony is to be 
independently judged by the Somalia inquiry, not prejudged by a 
DND spin doctor hired by Bob Fowler.

	Why does the Minister of National Defence allow his director 
general of public affairs to make any public statements on the 
Somalia inquiry when she has a potential conflict of interest 
with respect to the issues and the individuals to be judged by that 
inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agreed 
with that very point when it was raised last Friday. Any 
employee of the Department of National Defence should be very 
cautious in what he or she says, publicly or privately, with 
respect to matters which are now before the commission. We do 
not want anything to be said by anyone in a position of authority 
to give the impression that there would be some kind of 
prejudicing of the inquiry.
<P>
	I also note that the individual in question, the director general 
of public affairs, won a public service competition for the post.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is really at issue is the minister's ability or 
inability to manage his department. The minister was the last to 
know about the airborne videos. He was the last to know about 
the high suicide rate at Valcartier. Now we have the 
department's senior mouthpiece attempting to bias media 
coverage of the Somalia inquiry in direct disregard of the 
minister's gag order concerning that inquiry.
<P>
	When will the Minister of National Defence start to exercise 
the leadership of his department which Canadians deserve and 
expect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if there 
was ever a rhetorical question that was it. Considering the 
amount of controversy we have had in the last year and a half, I 
feel quite comfortable in the leadership I have given to the 
department.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> However, I will let other Canadians be the

by the deputy minister. As to any action that may be taken, I will

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister. The government is 
preparing to compensate the firm Agusta. After cancelling the 
contract to purchase nearly $6 billion worth of EH-101 
helicopters, the Prime Minister stated, a few days after his 
election, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The program is cancelled and there isn't any compensation for 
anybody''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	His Minister of Public Works reaffirmed yesterday the 
government's intention to conclude an agreement with Agusta.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister allow his government to pay 
compensation to Agusta from public funds, without any 
investigation into this $6 billion contract to purchase EH-101 
helicopters, when Agusta is currently facing charges of 
corruption and influence peddling in Italy and Belgium?
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the third or 
fourth time that members of the opposition have raised this 
issue. Unfortunately I am going to have to give the same answer 
to the hon. member.
<P>
	The hon. member is making reference to ``no compensation 
for anybody'', a phrase which was used by the Prime Minister. 
However the Prime Minister went on to promise that his 
ministers involved in those talks would ensure that we ``pay not 
a cent more than we are absolutely required to pay''.
<P>
	What we are doing under the contract which we signed with 
that company is paying termination costs, which every 
government must pay. That is not pay for future work, that is 
payment for work which has been completed or which was being 
completed upon termination.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government is clearly going to compensate Agusta. 
Therefore, if he will not refuse to compensate Agusta without an 
investigation first, will the Prime Minister at least guarantee, 
unlike his Minister of Public Works yesterday, that no new 
contracts for the purchase of helicopters are awarded to Agusta 
as a form of compensation for the cancellation of the first 
contract?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the minister has just said is correct. I have said it 
and I repeat it: the government has a contractual obligation for 
expenses incurred up to that point, which we must fulfil. There 
will, however, be no compensation for loss of profit or for future 
work.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	The director general of public affairs, Ms. Cardinal, has left 
the perception that her comments to the Media Club represent 
the views of the Department of National Defence senior 
management team. The problem is greater than one person's 
irresponsible comments and points to the leadership culture at 
the Department of National Defence which shows ignorance of 
Canada's frontline soldiers. There is no respect for the

question Friday. I answered it yesterday and I answered it again

<P>
	Some disturbing comments have come to light as a result of a 
speech given by the director general of public affairs. The 
deputy minister is looking into it. If I have any further 
announcement on any action that may be taken, it will be made 
to the House in due course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, surely the minister must understand it is all well 
and good that the deputy minister is looking into it but the 
Minister of National Defence is responsible for this.
<P>
	The problem is deeper than Ms. Cardinal's speech. These are 
the views of senior management at DND. The director general of 
public affairs does not speak off the record. She is responsible 
for disseminating national defence positions and policies.

supervision with his entire senior management team at DND?

<P>
	All federal public servants have had their wages frozen for 
several years. In his latest report, the auditor general reveals 
that, since 1993, diplomats have been allowed to cash in their 
plane tickets to and from Ottawa to pay for vacations anywhere 
in the world, without even having to submit vouchers.
<P>
	How does the President of the Treasury Board justify this 
1993 directive, which nets Canadian diplomats posted overseas 
$8.4 million a year, or about $5,000 tax free per person?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should understand that the 
auditor general's criticisms had to do with a former procedure 
that has since been completely corrected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite the 
reduction in the number of diplomats posted overseas, the total 
cost of their vacations, paid for by taxpayers, continues to 
increase at the rate of 9 per cent a year.

	Can the President of the Treasury Board tell us why public 
officials posted overseas can enjoy all-expenses-paid vacations 
in an era of budget cuts?
<P>

Mr. Speaker, I would have appreciated it if the hon. member had

for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The auditor general's report reveals that an astonishing 58 per 
cent of public servants are unaware of the federal government's 
conflict of interest policy. The auditor general also noted that 
the best conflict of interest guidelines are useless without 
leadership from the top, the cabinet.

example and prove that he has nothing to hide by appointing an 
independent ethics counsellor?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12678"> 12678 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are some very strict guidelines for conflict of 
interest for everyone in the ministry and in the public service. 
The senior people in the departments are responsible for those 
guidelines. There is an ethics counsellor who is consulted on any 
problem and he reports to me. I am responsible to Parliament for 
any and all mistakes made and I have never run away from my 
responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that 
the ethics counsellor has given an investigation on very, very 
few matters of substantive importance.
<P>
	The Liberal red ink book promises an independent ethics 
counsellor. The Reform Party has repeatedly called for an 
independent ethics counsellor. Seven of ten provinces have 
independent persons in this role. Now Gregory Evans, the 
independent conflict of interest commissioner in Ontario, is 
calling on the federal government to appoint an independent 
ethics counsellor.
<P>
	What is the government hiding? Why does the Prime Minister 
insist on keeping the ethics counsellor totally accountable to 
him?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ethics counsellor will be invited to meet with a 
committee of this House if required. However, in his daily 
operations he has to be responsible to somebody so he is 
responsible to us. One of the reasons we have acted this way is 
because we did not want to have a multiplication of jobs. He has 
other responsibilities and we gave him this new responsibility. 
He is doing a good job.
<P>
	In the end, no Prime Minister can get up in the House and say 
he is not responsible and that somebody else is. In this 
parliamentary system the government is responsible and the 
head of the government is responsible for the actions of all the 
government in front of this House, nobody else.

was not qualified. He did not meet the mandatory requirements. 
He should not even have been considered for the contract.
<P>
	He had an audit done, of course within his own department. 
An independent audit, which is like an independent ethics 
counsellor, something the government has trouble with, should 
be considered when there is this type of contract, an obvious 
conflict of interest.

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the House should 
be aware that the hon. member is basing these allegations on a 
very reputable source he has been able to come up with in the 
last number of weeks. That source, of course, is <I>Frank</I> 
magazine.
<P>
	I want to suggest to the hon. member that my department does 
in excess of 350,000 contracts a year, and at any given time there 
will be a number of individuals who are not very pleased with 
the fact that they have not won a contract. Six proposals were 
submitted and this one was selected based upon the best value 
for the taxpayer's dollar.
<P>
	I think the particular awarding of the contract has been done 
appropriately, and the investigations I have been able to come up 
with confirm that. However, if the hon. member does have 
something substantive, other than references to <I>Frank</I> 
magazine, I suggest he put up, or he knows what he should 
do-shut up.

Mr. Speaker, on January 13, the CRTC issued a new exemption

<P>
	Given the consequences of the exemption order granted to the

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
been told that the Minister of Justice did not consult adequately 
with the governments of the three prairie provinces or the two 
territories regarding Bill C-68 and that he did not adequately 
consult with the James Bay Cree, the Council for Yukon Indians, 
or the Métis. Last night we were told by Chief Mercredi that the 
minister absolutely did not consult with the Assembly of First 
Nations.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice, did he or did he not consult with 
the Assembly of First Nations on Bill C-68?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the last 12 months 
the Department of Justice and in fact this minister personally 
have done little else except consult with respect to firearms 
legislation.
<P>
	The fact is that there are some, perhaps including the hon. 
member, who define consultation as doing exactly what they 
think we ought to do.
<P>
	The legislation we have put before the House reflects the 
broad and careful consultation with the wide variety of interests 
on this topic. The work of the committee, which is now under 
way and to which the member contributes as an active and 
hard-working member, is completing that process of listening 
carefully to the views of Canadians on these important matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know how many times we have to ask the justice minister for a 
straightforward answer to a straightforward question.
<P>
	On November 30, 1994, the Minister of Justice, while tabling 
the proposals to Bill C-68, said ``Let me make it very clear, the 
process of consultation leading to legislation is now over''. That 
was back in November.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice one more time: Inasmuch as he 
has failed to adequately consult the Yukon Indians, the James 
Bay Cree, or the First Nations in the prescribed manner, how can 
he say he has not violated the constitutional rights of these 
people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the very fact that those 
groups are now before the committee expressing their views 
with respect to the proposed legislation is proof positive that 
their perspective is being taken into account.
<P>
	May I say, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member in opposing this 
legislation is merely illustrating the inconsistencies in their 
position. This is the party of law and order that will not do as the 
police chiefs and the police associations want. This is the party 
that wants to reflect the views of the people and will not pay

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister concerning the disgusting and 
irresponsible diversion of public funds by the minister of public 
works for a highway called ``death valley'' where more than 40 
people have died over the last nine years so that he could pave a 
tourist trail in his own riding.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport twice said this was a decision made 
by the provincial government. I have in my hand the agreement 
signed by both governments which says clearly both 
governments must approve any such project or deal. Why is the 
Minister of Transport misrepresenting the facts?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will permit the Minister of Transport to 
answer the question but I remind hon. members we are skirting 
awfully close to unparliamentary language in this question 
period.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I welcome all the members of the fifth party to 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	To make sure the hon. member understands this, the death 
highway he refers to was there during the nine years in which he 
was a member of government travelling to Nova Scotia. It has 
not changed in a year from the condition it was in eight years 
ago, seven years ago, six years ago, five years ago and so on.
<P>
	The one thing we want to make sure of, which the hon. 
member should realize, is that it is quite true that by consensus 
funds are reallocated for highway construction. The difference 
is when the Government of Nova Scotia requested it we did 
consent, we did not hold it up the way he and his colleagues used 
to do when they were in government.

during question period in response to a question I asked of the

heart to shut up. I do not know what the minister expects me to 
do. I have to ask questions of the government. I do not think it is 
very parliamentary to ask another member to shut up.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada

unparliamentary and if the hon. member finds the tone 
somewhat offensive I would gladly apologise to the hon. 
member. Perhaps the next time he might want to select a 
different source.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I suggest, with all respect to all hon. members, 
you give the Chair enough latitude to decide that which is 
parliamentary or unparliamentary.
<P>
	I hope we would think very seriously about the words we are 
using because some of them are inflammatory. Today I found we 
were coming pretty close to the line of unparliamentary 
language. I appeal to you to please be very judicious in your 
choice of words.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
you called into question today my use of the word lapdog. I have 
found we have used this descriptive word in the House 32 times 
already in this Parliament. It is not on the list of unparliamentary 
language.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Earlier in the session the hon. member for 
Winnipeg South raised a point of order about the use of a word in 
Parliament. At that time I explained to the hon. member and to 
the House that there is no word which in and of itself is 
unparliamentary. We cannot use the word ``liar'' in describing 
each other but if we are using it in a sentence sometimes the 
word can be used.
<P>
	The chair is always left with the decision as to what is 
parliamentary and what is unparliamentary many times from the 
tone of the word, many times in the context in which it was used.
<P>
	Again I appeal to all members, as I did in past days, that the 
decisions I make are hopefully for the proper functioning of the 
House. Today I asked the hon. member to withdraw a word he 
used. He was very gracious in doing so and I thank him for it. I 
would like to let that point sit. I found it offensive today and I 
have made the ruling.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANDAIRYCOMMISSIONACT">CANADIAN DAIRY COMMISSION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
at the GATT negotiations in Geneva, dairy producers were taken 
on a roller coaster ride, especially in relation to the talks on 
article XI, and the talks on whether the supply management 
system should be preserved were far from reassuring.
<P>
	The new accord to be implemented following the conclusion 
of this round of GATT negotiations will force the farming sector 
to rapidly adapt to a new economic environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12683"> 12683 </A></B>
<P>
	Dairy producers in particular are facing an enormous 
challenge. By virtue of the GATT's definition of an export 
subsidy, NAFTA will force dairy producers to do away with their 
system of export levies by August 1, 1995, that is, in two and a 
half months.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-86 amends the Canadian Dairy Commission Act in 
order to resolve the problem of export subsidies. I would like to 
mention that the commission's chairman is Mr. Prégent. In 
particular, this bill would implement a national pooling system 
of market returns which would be used to promote the export of 
dairy products.
<P>
	Currently, producers pay a levy of some $3 per hectolitre of 
industrial milk, which is used mostly to make butter and 
powdered skim milk for export. This levy which was labelled 
under the GATT and NAFTA as an export subsidy, even though it 
is paid by the producers and not by the government, is justified 
because the levy is paid at source, like the Rand formula for 
unionized workers, as I was explaining to my colleague from 
Lévis earlier. Union dues are deducted from wages. In this case, 
the Quebec federation of dairy producers takes $3 for each 
hectolitre from the farmer's pay. Because it is a deduction at 
source, NAFTA and the GATT consider it a direct export 
subsidy, and, as of next August 1, it will no longer be permitted.
<P>
	Therefore, the pooling allowed under Bill C-86 will be 
consistent with the international agreements and will permit 
dairy producers to keep the advantages of the existing system. In 
14 and a half months, there will be a single milk pool for all of 
Canada. In other words, on August 1, 1996 all that will matter is 
that it is milk, not that it is unprocessed or industrial milk.
<P>
	The hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi will find that it will 
not matter whether the cows were Holsteins, Ayershires or 
Jerseys. The issue is milk, and milk alone. And to top it all off, 
there will be a single price. No longer will there be two prices, 
one for fluid milk and one for industrial milk.
<P>
	We should, however, be aware that if the United States, which 
is only too ready to challenge, of late, decides to challenge this 
two price policy for milk, one for the domestic market and one 
for the international market, the dairy industry could be accused 
of dumping.
<P>
	However, the United States, or whatever country feels it has 
been adversely affected, would have to prove that Canadian 
exports were prejudicial to its market. Since we do not export a 
lot, and since our exports are increasingly value added 
processed products, this proof could be very elusive.
<P>
	Bill C-86 is the response of producers to the impact of new 
international rules on the dairy industry. Dairy producers have 
rolled up their sleeves and found ingenious solutions to their 
predicament. We in the Bloc Quebecois support Bill C-86 
because it allows producers to adapt to the requirements of 
international trade agreements signed by Canada.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	The main purpose of the bill is to replace export levies going 
into an export subsidization fund with the pooling of returns 
from the marketing of dairy products.
<P>
	Since some provinces-such as Quebec-export more dairy 
products than others, the commission will ensure that each 
province's contribution to the export fund matches its 
percentage of quotas. That is fair. If Quebec produces 47.5 per 
cent of industrial milk, it will pay 47.5 per cent of the export 
fund. If Prince Edward Island produces 6 per cent, it will pay 6 
per cent.
<P>
	For once in this country, we will have ensured a process that is 
fair. It will be different from the research and development 
funding system, in which Quebec receives barely 17 or 18 per 
cent of the funds allocated to R and D every year. In this case, 
each province will pay according to its percentage of dairy 
production.
<P>
	The pooling of revenues from the marketing of dairy products 
from every province will allow domestic producers to continue 
to share market risks equitably and to balance the costs of the 
system, as the levy system often did. For example, if Quebec 
produces 48 per cent, it will pay 48 per cent; if Prince Edward 
Island produces 12 per cent, it will pay 12 per cent, and so on.
<P>
	As you can imagine, I am pleased to point out that this bill will 
also allow the commission to delegate its powers to provincial 
marketing boards and to receive in return any similar powers 
granted to provincial boards, since fluid milk presently comes 
under the provinces while the Canadian Dairy Commission's 
authority is restricted to industrial milk.
<P>
	The bill provides for a delegation of powers between the 
commission and the provinces for the purpose of managing the 
pooled fund. In the absence of a signed agreement, the 
commission would administer the pool only for industrial milk.
<P>
	I look at the Liberal members opposite and I think that they, as 
well as the Minister of Agriculture, who is here this afternoon, 
will understand. How can this be in a federal system variously 
described as renewed federalism, courtroom federalism or 
flexible federalism? Those who talk about courtroom federalism 
probably worked for the Barreau du Québec or some such 
organization and see in this an opportunity to line their pockets. 
As the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs told us again this 
afternoon: ``If you are not happy, all you have to do is sue''.
<P>
	In a normal country, do we go to court every day, one part of 
the country suing the rest? That is this government's vision of 
Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12684"> 12684 </A></B>
<P>
	Fluid milk, the type we drink every day, comes under 
provincial jurisdiction, while industrial milk comes under 
federal jurisdiction, that is to say our jurisdiction, here, in 
Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	That is federalism for you: the same cow has to have two sets 
of udders, with the federal government drawing from the left 
side and the provincial government from the right. This 
agreement will help a little bit in correcting this distortion. I can 
see Liberal members laughing. They are laughing because they 
did not even know that industrial milk fell within their 
jurisdiction. One of them just woke up, poor him. He finally 
realized that reality in the legal world is quite different from the 
reality of agriculture.
<P>
	These are the technical changes introduced by Bill C-86 
regarding the Canadian Dairy Commission. It is interesting to 
note that the bill is put forward in a context where six provinces, 
namely Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, have signed an agreement in 
principle to pool their whole milk supply system.
<P>
	I must say that, among the ten provinces, there is one 
exception and that is Newfoundland, because it has only fifty of 
so dairy producers, producing mainly fluid milk, which comes 
under provincial jurisdiction. So, Newfoundland is not a 
member of this consortium, leaving nine potential members.
<P>
	The three Western provinces-Alberta, Saskatchewan and 
British Columbia-have not joined the other six yet. Should 
they be called sovereignist provinces? Or secessionist, 
indépendantiste or even, as the Prime Minister says, separatist? 
I do not think so. These are elected people who want to properly 
manage government affairs, adequately represent their 
constituents, and also check with them to see if this is a good 
solution. I must say that, regardless of what happens, the six 
other provinces account for over 82 per cent of Canada's milk 
production.
<P>
	Even if all the provinces keep their current quotas, there will 
only be one milk. There will no longer be any distinction made 
between industrial milk and fluid milk. Consequently, only one 
price will apply to milk across the country. The provinces will 
split the increases in quotas among themselves, and producers 
will be able to buy quotas from other provinces, which is a nice 
change.
<P>
	A Quebec producer will be able to buy a quota in Ontario or in 
New Brunswick, and vice versa. Of course, there could be an 
increase in consumption if we help each other, if this 
government stops reducing subsidies to industrial milk 
producers, as it just did. The hon. member said that the Minister 
of Finance was not increasing taxes. What a naive statement on 
his part, given that the federal tax on gas has gone up half a cent 
per litre. And the member claims this is not a tax. Oh no, this is 
not a tax.
<P>
	The government reduced its industrial milk subsidies by 30 
per cent. This is not a tax. However, the cost of milk will 
increase and the government reduces its subsidies. But this is 
not a tax. Oh no. It is not a tax. Go and ask producers. Go to 
Lafaille's for example. I did go last Monday to the Lafaille and 
Sons' auction, in the riding of my friend, the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, and I talked with some of my 
fellow farmers. Let me tell you that the minister should stay 
away, because if he went there-but he would not dare do that, 
of course-he would find out what farmers think of his budget.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Admittedly, it took some doing to conclude this agreement. It 
is the result of lengthy negotiations in which Quebec 
demonstrated commendable leadership. When the topic of grain 
and cereals comes up in the House, the West takes the lead role. 
But in this case, where for once a bill affects Quebec, I am sure 
you will not mind if I take a minute this afternoon to 
congratulate some of our own experts on their tireless efforts. I 
am thinking of the Quebec federation of dairy producers, its 
president, Claude Rivard, and its vice president, Jean Grégoire, 
as well as economist Guylaine Gosselin, the UPA milk expert.
<P>
	I would also like to pay tribute to officials of the Quebec 
federation of dairy producers for their unremitting efforts 
throughout these negotiations. There is no doubt that our milk 
producers in Quebec are very well represented by their elected 
officials and by their union, the UPA.
<P>
	I invite my Liberal colleagues to occasionally take a look at 
<I>La terre de chez nous.</I> They would find this weekly newspaper 
very instructive regarding the views of Quebec farmers and 
other questions. Speaking of the West, <I>La Terre de chez nous</I> 
carried an article this week about the Canadian milk pool, which 
threw out an invitation to Western indépendantistes, the three 
provinces that have not yet signed up: British Columbia, 
Saskatchewan and Alberta. Despite their hesitation, the 
repercussions of this historic agreement may well be greater 
than first thought.
<P>
	From a practical point of view, we need only mention that in 
1996, Quebec dairy producers should see their income rise by 60 
to 70 cents per hectolitre. Of course, 60 or 70 cents is not a 
fortune. It is an increase of a little over half a cent a litre, which 
has nothing to do with the increase they should have received, 
given the rise in the cost of living and the cut of the 30 per cent 
subsidy that the federal government is getting ready to 
implement on July 1. This increase of 60 to 70 cents per 
hectolitre results from the realignment of prices for industrial 
milk and unprocessed milk in Quebec and the prices of milk in 
the other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12685"> 12685 </A></B>
<P>
provinces, since by 1996, there will be one national price for 
milk in Canada.
<P>
	Because of the GATT, Canada will have to allow butter to be 
imported this year, which will probably affect quotas. But, with 
the pooling of all returns, the six provinces will share the impact 
of market fluctuations on all milk prices and no one province 
will be hit harder than any other.
<P>
	What must be stressed is that this kind of agreement is based 
on the economy. It is the kind of agreement which maximizes the 
strong points of each and every member, who are all working 
together. Even with a referendum around the corner, producers 
from various provinces did not hesitate to collaborate with 
Quebec because it was in their best interests to do so. When we 
get down to reality, not hypothetical disaster scenarios, we see 
that the voice of reason prevails over political considerations.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	In a document written by The Council for Canadian Unity, 
largely funded by the taxes paid by all Canadians, and in 
particular by Quebecers who are forced to pay for this kick in the 
behind, the council strongly suggests that the word 
``separation'' be used, although the explanation it gives of the 
term in the glossary simply refers the reader to the definition of 
sovereignty.
<P>
	And a few weeks ago, I saw that, regarding the separation of 
Quebec, the Prime Minister once again uttered the sentence that 
he just loves to repeat: ``Does Quebec want to separate or not?'' 
He knows very well that his only way of convincing people is by 
fearmongering.
<P>
	Last week, when I was doing the rounds in my riding, I made a 
point of visiting-and I hope you did too, Madam Speaker, 
because I know you have a very special relationship with seniors 
and as you know, last week was national seniors homes' 
week-so I made a point of visiting the homes in my riding, and 
to my surprise, I found that more and more seniors support 
sovereignty for Quebec.
<P>
	When I read in <I>La Presse</I> that the Premier of Quebec went to 
the Lower St. Lawrence, in the riding of the Quebec minister of 
agriculture, where at a home for seniors, he renewed the 
membership card of the oldest member of the Parti Quebecois on 
that member's one hundred and first birthday, I thought that was 
splendid.
<P>
	This always reminds me of my elderly mother-unfortunately 
she passed away three years ago-who said she was going to 
vote for sovereignty because all her children were in favour of 
sovereignty. But she always added that this was the only weapon 
we have against their scare tactics. In fact, in a document the 
Council for Canadian Unity recommends using the term 
``separation'', but they have a nerve, it is not even in the 
dictionary.
<P>
	According to them, with sovereignty Quebec would 
immediately lose-and this is just to scare our farmers-all its 
market quotas in Canada. According to them, it is unlikely that 
farmers in other provinces would agree to maintain those 
quotas. When I say them, I am referring to the Council for 
Canadian Unity, led by a bunch of dyed in the wool federalists 
who are biased and misrepresent the facts.
<P>
	Does this mean that after making substantial changes in their 
operating procedures during this referendum year, producers 
outside Quebec would be so inconsistent as to drop the whole 
thing this fall? Madam Speaker, let us be reasonable. In business 
matters, farmers know which side their bread is buttered.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> As they say: ``Money talks''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Indeed. This single milk pool 
which, as I said earlier, represents 82 per cent of milk 
production, was created not for the sake of any one group but 
because it makes sense, and the six provinces that are part of this 
agreement are in it because it works for them. And who knows, 
maybe this agreement will be the first of many to be negotiated 
between Canada and Quebec, after a positive response by 
Quebecers to the referendum this fall.
<P>
	At a time when we must adjust to the new environment created 
by the GATT agreements, we should welcome this agreement 
wholeheartedly.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	As the president of the Union des producteurs agricoles du 
Québec, Laurent Pellerin, pointed out: ``The day after the GATT 
agreements, the government reiterated its support for supply 
management on the condition that producers, and dairy 
producers in particular, collectively adapt their marketing 
tools''. The ball is now in the federal government's court. Let us 
see whether it keeps its word on this.
<P>
	Let us now take a closer look at Bill C-86, which was made 
necessary. As usual, the present federal government waits until 
the last minute before acting. This bill must pass all stages, 
receive Senate approval and be in force by August 1, 1995. If we 
do not count May, only June and July remain. Therefore we have 
to get on with it.
<P>
	The aim of this bill is to adjust the famous $3 currently 
deducted on every hectolitre of industrial milk produced by 
dairy producers. This $3 levy, known as the export costs in the 
industry, will be illegal under international agreements as of 
August 1. This levy is vital, however, because, without this 
assistance to industrial milk processors, our exports would no 
longer be competitive, and we would not be able to compete with 
products from outside the country, which could flood the 
markets in Canada and Quebec, because our prices would be too 
high.

<P>
	I have 40 minutes, Madam Speaker. Yes. I wonder if time does 
not go by faster on your watch than on mine.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You had 30 minutes left 
when you started.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, if I have only a 
minute left, I would like to remind you that, here in Ottawa, on 
May 2, 3 and 4 the representatives of nine provinces discussed 
matters in detail. Six of them subsequently made a three-point 
proposal to Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. If you 
permit me, I will read it to you.
<P>
	The proposal to British Columbia was to pool industrial milk 
revenues on August 1, 1996. Fluid milk revenues would be 
added the following year, on August 1, 1997. The province 
would keep much of the future increases in fluid milk, because 
the population in British Columbia is the fastest growing in 
Canada.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for your attention. As 
I indicated to the Speaker before you, five of my colleagues will 
help me with Bill C-86. They are the hon. members for 
Champlain, Lotbinière-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would remind the hon. 
member that I have the list of his colleagues who will take part 
in the debate.
<P>
	Debate continues with the hon. member for Vegreville.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with enthusiasm and some trepidation that I lead the debate for 
the Reform Party on the future of supply management and the 
dairy industry in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The enthusiasm comes from my belief that there could be and 
should be a bright future for supply management and 
particularly the dairy industry in Canada.
<P>
	The trepidation I feel is for two reasons. First, if the changes 
in the dairy industry are handled poorly or badly everyone 
involved in the industry will suffer. Second, I have less of an 
understanding of the dairy industry than I do of many other areas 
of agriculture. I have been working hard with the help of dairy 
farmers and groups that deal with dairy farmers to improve my 
understanding and I will certainly continue to work on this.
<P>
	Today we are debating Bill C-86, an act to amend the dairy 
commission act, but our debate must go beyond the bill to a 
discussion on the very future of supply management and the 
dairy industry.
<P>
	I will debate the bill by summarizing it and how it will affect 
the dairy industry and discussing the future of the dairy business 
in Canada as I see it with input from farmers and groups I have 
talked to. I will do this by discussing Liberal policy on supply 
management from the red book and later added to the red book in 
an appendix. I will discuss it by talking about the Liberal 
position as presented from two other sources. I will refer to 
these sources later.
<P>
	Bill C-86 is an act to amend the Canadian Dairy Commission 
Act. It was given first reading on April 28, 1995. The purpose of 
the bill is to amend the Canadian Dairy Commission Act to 
provide for a replacement of the existing system of levies with a 
system of pooling market returns from different classes of milk.
<P>
	The government claims the switch to a pooling system will 
maintain equity among producers and is consistent with 
Canada's international trade agreement.
<P>
	I have some background information. As part of Canada's 
system of supply management, the Canadian milk supply 
management committee, chaired by the Canadian Dairy 
Commission, oversees the application of the national milk 
marketing plan.
<P>
	The CMSMC sets national production targets, establishes 
each province's share of the national quota and exports any 
surplus milk through planned marketing programs. The orderly 
export of surplus production is an essential element for ensuring 
the integrity of the supply managed system. Without it the 
system would falter.
<P>
	Currently producers assume the cost of exporting dairy 
products not consumed in Canada through a system of levies 
collected by provincial marketing boards and agencies as 
deductions from payments to milk producers. Once remitted to 
the commission these levies are used to finance special 
programs intended to increase the domestic use of dairy 
products and to cover the commission's administrative costs.
<P>
	During the 1993-94 year a total of $141.5 million was 
collected from the industrial and fluid milk sectors. Such levies, 
however, are now considered to be a form of export subsidy 
under the new GATT deal and must be reduced or modified.
<P>
	Through the bill Canada's dairy industry would abandon this 
established system of producer levies on industrial milk. The 
levies will be replaced with a system of national pooling which 
allows all stakeholders, including farmers, processors and the 
commission, to equitably share the costs and benefits of pooling 
revenues and the effects of fluctuations in market size for both 
fluid and industrial milk.
<P>
	Through a system of pooling the producers who export milk 
into the U.S. would receive smaller returns for their milk but the 
burden would still be shared by all dairy farmers. Basically 
instead of a levy taken off farmers' cheques to subsidize 
exports, the national pool would achieve the same ends since the 
net return to farmers would be in theory identical.
<P>
	For its part the processing industry would still pay lower 
prices for its industrial milk. These amendments to the Canadian 
Dairy Commission Act add a certain amount of new pricing and 
funding distribution authority to the Canadian Dairy 
Commission. The new pricing and pooling approach for milk 
has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12687"> 12687 </A></B>
<P>
received agreement from all provinces in principle. However, 
negotiations are ongoing as to whether there will be one national 
pool, which at the moment appears very unlikely, or two  
separate pools. There would possibly be one for B.C., Alberta 
and Saskatchewan, and we do not know about Newfoundland, 
and another for the other six provinces.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Ontario dairy farmers supply most of the industrial milk to 
further processors and Quebec dairy farmers are the biggest 
exporters. They would receive less than other dairy farmers 
unless there is some form of national pooling. On the other hand, 
under a national pooling system producers in the other 
non-exporting provinces subsidize those who are exporting. It 
really amounts to a form of equalization payment from one 
sector of the industry to another or from one province to another. 
This is perhaps the biggest obstacle to achieving agreement on 
establishing one national pooling regime for all classes of milk.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the Reform Party's policy and 
position relating to Bill C-86. Reform policy in this area has 
four main points.
<P>
	First, all processors will be able to structure and manage their 
organizations in any manner they believe will best serve their 
interests. The matter of regulating production and setting prices 
for products under the organization's jurisdiction is a producer 
issue and should be dealt with by producers.
<P>
	Second, Reformers acknowledge that the agriculture industry, 
including supply managed sectors, is moving toward a more 
competitive market driven system.
<P>
	Third, we have proposed tough positive measures to ensure 
fair competition. These are measures such as a tougher 
anti-combines legislation. That would lead to lower input prices 
and fair trade policies which would help protect against 
dumping from other countries particularly from the United 
States. It would help to protect Canada from the effects of high 
subsidization in other countries in particular the United States.
<P>
	Fourth, Reformers propose general changes which will reduce 
government overspending in a general way but through that will 
reduce input costs to farmers and indeed to other business 
people.
<P>
	We presented these measures before the election campaign, 
during the election campaign and most recently in the taxpayers 
budget which would lead to a balanced budget over a three year 
period if implemented. It would be good for all businesses, 
including the dairy industry.
<P>
	In February I visited with farmers in the Niagara peninsula. 
They spoke of three options. These three options have been 
presented many times since from a variety of groups. For 
example, a group of dairy farmers and veterinarians who were in 
Ottawa a couple of weeks ago wanted to discuss the issue of the 
BST, but also other dairy issues. These options were presented 
from dairy farmers in my constituency and across the country 
both in person and by letter.
<P>
	The three options concern the future of supply management in 
the dairy industry. The first option is to end supply management 
now. I do not believe that this is a widely accepted option within 
the dairy industry. The second option is to start preparing. 
Recognize the reality and start a transition process which will 
allow a healthy dairy industry to continue down the road. The 
third option is to keep supply management as it is.
<P>
	The third option clearly is not a reality. Unfortunately it is the 
position this government presents at least in public. It chooses to 
go down the avenue of least resistance. It would be appropriate 
now to look at what happened to grain farmers in western 
Canada because past governments have chosen to go down the 
road of least resistance.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	I am talking about the elimination overnight of the Western 
Grain Transportation Act subsidy, the old Crow benefit. Due to 
the lack of openness, honesty and action on the part of previous 
Conservative and Liberal governments, no phase-out period 
was provided. There is no clear direction on how farmers will 
deal with the loss of the freight subsidy. There are no changes in 
place or proposed by government which would allow 
efficiencies to be put in place within the grain handling and 
grain movement system. There are no changes which would 
allow lower input costs in other areas. Many grain farmers in 
western Canada will go out of business over the next few years 
because of the loss of this subsidy, particularly the loss without a 
transition period for crops which are now being seeded in 
western Canada.
<P>
	Governments have talked a lot over the past several years 
about stabilizing the agriculture industry, but their moves have 
led to chaos, not stability.
<P>
	Of these three options, the second option is the option which 
the Reform Party supports and believes is most realistic. Use 
what time there is left before we move to open competition in 
the dairy industry to help prepare for the changes which will 
come in a supply managed industry. Let us not take the bury your 
head in the sand approach which has been taken by the 
government.
<P>
	Let us look at the reality of the situation in supply 
management. First, let us look at the GATT and what it does to 
supply management in the future. After the year 2000 new 
negotiations will begin regarding supply management through 
the GATT. In the new negotiations there will be a rapid reduction 
in tariffs. Those tariffs are presently high and protect the supply 
managed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12688"> 12688 </A></B>
<P>
industry quite well. There will be more access to imported dairy 
products in this country.
<P>
	The changes to the GATT starting a short five years from now 
will have a huge impact on dairy farmers. That leaves precious 
little time for farmers to prepare for these changes.
<P>
	I believe that the real open borders, particularly between the 
United States and Canada in supply managed products and in 
dairy products, will come through new NAFTA negotiations. A 
lawyer for the Dairy Farmers of Canada, which of course is 
arguing that the GATT supersedes NAFTA in guiding supply 
managed industries in the Canada-U.S. trade agreement, said in 
a <I>Western Producer</I> article: ``The Americans have a strong case 
in arguing that NAFTA supersedes and that dairy farmers should 
be preparing for this possibility''.
<P>
	Further, a very significant event happened when our Prime 
Minister and U.S. President Bill Clinton announced a few 
months ago that Chile would be a part of the NAFTA deal within 
four years. Why is that significant? It is significant because the 
Americans, who are looking for and pushing Canada in every 
way they can for more access to our supply managed markets 
will not sign a new NAFTA deal until they have much more 
access to the Canadian market in milk and dairy products. That 
will mean that in less than four years the supply managed 
industry in Canada will have to move to a much more 
competitive environment.
<P>
	The government can pretend that it will protect supply 
management through this process but it cannot. I will 
demonstrate this with quotes from three sources, from the red 
book first. I will quote all of the agriculture policy in the red 
book; it will not take very long. This is how important 
agriculture is and was to the Liberals when they drafted the red 
book. This is their complete agriculture policy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian agri-food sector has a unique opportunity for growth. An 
overall policy for the agri-food sector must build upon three component 
strategies: developing new domestic and international markets for Canadian 
food products; reducing input costs to make farming more viable; and 
introducing a new ``whole farm'' income stabilization program. Liberals 
believe that farm families need long term programs to assist them in securing 
their future, so that they can continue to provide Canadians with the best quality 
food in the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The red book goes on for one more whole paragraph to 
conclude the Liberals' agriculture policy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada's agri-food industry needs policies and programs such as supply 
management, the Canadian Wheat Board, and stabilization programs to 
minimize the impact of market price fluctuations; government support in 
developing new commercial markets for commodities in which the agri-food 
industry has a competitive advantage; sustainable agriculture practices to 
maintain and improve the quality of our land and water; and mission oriented 
research to increase productivity and create quality products to meet market 
demand.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the entire agriculture policy that was included in the 
Liberal red book.
<P>
	There was a very secret appendix that was even more difficult 
to get than the red book itself during the campaign and since. It 
was quite difficult to get. The appendix goes on for three more 
paragraphs regarding supply management. Three whole 
paragraphs. That is the extent of the Liberal policy on 
agriculture and on supply management.
<P>
	I will go next to some quotes from the parliamentary secretary 
to the agriculture minister. I will read from a publication put out 
by the Independent Dairymen's Association Committee of 
British Columbia which is made up of the Mainland Dairymen's 
Association and the Southern Interior Dairymen's Association:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Following are some public quotes from Lyle Vanclief, parliamentary secretary 
to the federal minister of agriculture, member of Parliament for Prince 
Edward-Hastings, and owner of a cash crop and market garden farm in Ontario:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``It is more than definite that the future of supply management in Canada will 
be `uncertain after the year 2001'. The United States insists that the earlier signed 
NAFTA supersedes GATT rules. The Americans expect tariff levels to be reduced 
at a quicker NAFTA rate and be completely gone to zero by 1998''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are three or four more paragraphs but for the sake of 
brevity I will end the quote from the parliamentary secretary 
with that.
<P>
	It is interesting to note the difference between what the 
Liberals said in the red book and what the parliamentary 
secretary to the agriculture minister is now finally starting to 
say in public. Until now this Liberal government has pretended 
it can protect supply management. It seems to have refused to 
acknowledge that NAFTA and the GATT and changes that will 
come to both agreements will bring about quick change to the 
supply managed industry, including the dairy industry.
<P>
	It is encouraging that the parliamentary secretary is finally 
starting to talk publicly about some of the changes that will 
come about. This will give the industry some time, a bit of a 
transition period, to get from where it is to a competitive system 
which will be in place some time over the next few years.
<P>
	The third source is an article from the May 4 <I>Western 
Producer</I>. The headline is: ``Grits didn't support supply 
management''. The lengthy quote is from Michelle Comeau, 
former assistant deputy minister for agriculture: ``Supply 
management has proven useful in stabilizing farm income but 
has generated costs to consumers and to the economy in 
general''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12689"> 12689 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Barry Wilson leads in by saying: ``The Liberals wanted the 
end of supply management long before GATT, say internal 
documents''. This is totally different from what the Liberals 
have been saying publicly.
<P>
	Part of this article states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Long before the December 1993 world trade deal ``forced'' Canada to 
abandon the legal basis for supply management, the government had decided the 
system had to go, according to an Agriculture Canada planning document.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Memos issued in 1993, obtained from government files under access to 
information legislation, show a government publicly proclaiming support for 
supply management, while privately drawing up plans to manage its weakening.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to a memo written in late 1993 by then assistant deputy agriculture 
minister Michelle Comeau to then deputy minister Rob Wright, the system was 
too rigid and too farmer-dominated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In any reform, the power of the provinces would have to be reduced and the 
``excessive producer control over decision making'' would have to be 
counter-balanced by a greater role for processors, retailers and consumers who 
want lower prices.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Supply management has proven useful in stabilizing farm income but has 
generated costs to consumers and to the economy in general'', she wrote. 
``Reform is required.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Point out how different this is from what the Liberals were 
acknowledging at the time. If the Liberals did not agree with 
what the bureaucrats were saying, they should have said so then. 
They chose not to. It is clear from this article the Liberals are 
saying one thing in public and another thing privately.
<P>
	I continue with this article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Comeau's memo was part of a plan devised by the bureaucracy to handle 
fall-out from the decision to sign a new world trade deal, even though it 
excluded the rule which had allowed Canada to control imports of dairy, poultry 
and egg products governed by supply-managed rules.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For years, the government had been criticizing the rigidity of the 
decision-making process while praising supply management as a way to help 
farmers make their living from the market.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Privately, the bureaucrats were agreeing with consumer and processing 
lobbyists that supply management was bad for the country and the economy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The planning documents laid out a strategy for dismantling the traditional 
rules of supply management-controlling the communications, stressing that 
the system could survive under new rules, injecting more voices into the 
decision-making, stressing that trade deals and competition made change 
inevitable and making sure the provinces accepted some of the responsibility 
for deciding to tear the old system down.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This, released through access to information, is much 
different from what the Liberals have been saying publicly.
<P>
	Reform has chosen the more direct and honest approach, even 
if it means taking some heat in the short term. Which is kinder 
and gentler, as the Liberals like to always say, to pretend that 
major changes are not coming and ending up with the pain and 
hardships that grain farmers in western Canada will feel over the 
next years as  they deal with subsidies that were removed 
overnight, or being open and honest and allowing dairymen and 
others involved in the industry to make the transitions that are 
necessary?
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	It would be kinder and gentler to lay the cards on the table and 
allow farmers and processors the time they need to make the 
transition from this protected industry to a more competitive 
industry.
<P>
	The change is coming. Reformers have chosen to be up front 
and honest in dealing with changes to supply management. I 
encourage dairy farmers across Canada to choose the approach 
they prefer and to choose the people they prefer to help them 
with the transition they must make over the next few years.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member 
for Vaudreuil.
<P>
	I am pleased to contribute to the debate on Bill C-86, an act to 
amend the Canadian Dairy Commission Act. It offers a new, 
more competitive marketing approach for the Canadian dairy 
industry, which is required to allow Canada to honour its 
international trade commitment while preserving the fairness 
and equity for Canadian milk producers of the present system.
<P>
	While market opportunities will flow from both the North 
American free trade agreement and the World Trade 
Organization agreement, certain changes to our domestic 
structure must be made. Effective August 1, 1995, under 
NAFTA Canada will not be permitted to export dairy products to 
the United States where the price of the product has been 
supported by a producer funded levy. This relatively immediate 
export restraint will be accompanied by a more gradually 
implemented WTO restriction on our ability to use levies to 
finance dairy product exports to other market destinations.
<P>
	The importance of maintaining current export and domestic 
markets for dairy products and for products containing dairy 
ingredients in a manner that still allows all dairy producers to 
share the cost of supplying milk to these markets cannot be 
overstated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12690"> 12690 </A></B>
<P>
	Over 300 dairy plants in Canada employ almost 25,000 
Canadians to process milk used as table cream and milk or in 
products such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. Thousands 
of other jobs are provided in the further processing sector for 
items containing dairy ingredients such as cookies, pizza, and 
chocolate, as well as in areas of dairy product transportation, 
packaging, storage, and marketing.
<P>
	Under the rebate program for further processors in dairy 
product export assistance programs, initiatives currently funded 
by the producer levies and administered by the Canadian Dairy 
Commission, export assistance was provided to facilitate the 
export of over 10 million kilograms of cheese in 1993-94 and to 
support processor purchases of dairy ingredients used in the 
production of over 2,000 finished food products.
<P>
	In 1993-94 dairy exports to the United States involved about 
0.7 million hectolitres of milk, about 1.7 per cent of the entire 
Canadian milk quota set for that period.
<P>
	Canada's dairy processing industry is largely centred in the 
provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The 1992 census data 
indicated that 105 plants processing fluid and or industrial milk 
were located in Ontario, while the 83 plants situated in Quebec 
had the highest value of shipments, at $3 billion. Alberta 
follows with 31 processing establishments. B.C. has 25, 
Manitoba 18, Nova Scotia 14, Saskatchewan 12, P.E.I. 9, New 
Brunswick 6, and Newfoundland has 5 such processing 
facilities.
<P>
	Without price discrimination and pooling of returns, dairy 
and further processors would not be able to access milk at price 
levels that would enable them to compete on the U.S. market and 
be competitive against imports on the domestic market. 
Furthermore, the current level playing field provided to 
producers by the current levy system would be eliminated.
<P>
	The largest volumes of the lower priced milk needed by 
processors and further processors for certain export and 
domestic products are produced in the more industrial provinces 
of Ontario and Quebec. Some smaller provinces are also greatly 
affected in terms of the proportion of their total milk marketing 
that is sold at reduced prices.
<P>
	Without a workable alternative to the current levy system 
such as that offered by price discrimination, the loss of the U.S. 
market for Canadian dairy products and products containing 
dairy ingredients would lead to reduced competitiveness and 
would place in jeopardy the domestic further processing sector 
for such products.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Without pooling of the market returns, there would be an 
inequitable sharing among producers of the cost of maintaining 
exports to the United States and for domestic competitive 
markets. This could lead to their abandonment. Should these 
markets not be maintained, the domestic further processing 
industry would be less viable due to the diminished economies 
of scale. Pressure on further processors to relocate their 
operations to the United States would result. The job loss 
ramifications of such relocations would be significant.
<P>
	There is a potential additional reduction in the industry side of 
almost two per cent resulting from the growing restrictions 
agreed to under the WTO agreement of the allowable quantity of 
subsidized exports and the export subsidy paid annually for each 
product class up to the year 2000-2001. A price discrimination 
system with pooling of market returns as facilitated by Bill 
C-86 would address this issue.
<P>
	Everyone in the Canadian dairy sector is becoming clearly 
aware of the need to adapt to the new North American and global 
trade conditions in competition. To illustrate Canadian dairy 
producers' awareness of this need to adapt, I quote from a May 4 
letter written to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and 
copied to me by my constituent, Mr. John Core, chairman of the 
Ontario milk marketing board.
<P>
	Mr. Core writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is extremely important that Bill C-86 be passed by the House. We have 
negotiated long and hard to arrive at a system to replace levies effective August 1. 
The changes to the CDC Act are critical to special class pricing and the required 
pooling that follows from that new pricing method. Your directive to not use 
levies for exports to the U.S. cannot be adhered to without the necessary 
amendments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We met the challenge given to us by the federal and provincial agricultural 
ministers to find the solution. We require the legislative changes now to 
implement the necessary changes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Core, I am proud to say, is one of my constituents.
<P>
	The dairy industry leaders who have developed and 
negotiated the approach facilitated by these amendments fully 
understand that while tariff protection is in place between now 
and the year 2001, the only way to reduce uncertainty and 
concern about what happens after this period is to meet the new 
trade challenges head on. Bill C-86 will allow the industry to do 
so.
<P>
	I urge my fellow members to support these amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened with great interest the hon. member's speech on Bill 
C-86. There was a point I found particularly interesting, and I 
would like the hon. member to clarify, because I know very well 
that the farmers' problem is not producing milk but producing 
just enough to fill their quota.
<P>
	If farmers were told to raise their quota by 5 per cent this year, 
they would be very happy. The problem is that they have to 
produce, say, 10 000 hectolitres of milk, but if they produce 
more than that they are fined, and if they produce less their quota 
will be reduced in the following years because-bad boys, bad 
girls-they cannot fulfil their commitments. So much so that 
people often joke and compare cows, as the hon. member for 
Lotbinière did yesterday, to gas pumps that have not been fixed.  
With gasoline, once the exact number of hectolitres has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12691"> 12691 </A></B>
<P>
pumped into the tank, the pump is turned off, and the customer 
waits until tomorrow or the next year. But one can hardly do that 
with cows.
<P>
	Therefore our problem is not to produce more, because milk 
production could easily be increased by 5 per cent a year. What I 
want to ask about is the 1.7 per cent of our milk production 
which was exported to the United States last year or in 1993-94. 
I would like the hon. member to tell the House what province 
this 1.7 per cent came from and in what form it was exported.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	In his statement he said that the dairy farmers do not wish to 
produce more milk. Bill C-86 is not about producing more milk. 
It is about providing a proper environment for the new export 
rules that will be implemented in August of this year. Bill C-86 
will open those avenues to the dairy farmers so they can adjust.
<P>
	Dairy farmers are well aware of the adjustments they have had 
to make since the Uruguay round of discussions. It is not 
something that was thrust on them at the last minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
agree with the hon. member for Frontenac that Canadian dairy 
farmers could increase production very rapidly. If Quebec were 
to become independent and leave Canada I believe that the rest 
of the country could take up the production that Canada would 
lose very quickly. Alberta and western Canada would love to be 
able to improve dairy production.
<P>
	They do not want Quebec to leave so that will happen. They 
have other plans for allowing for the increase in dairy 
production.
<P>
	There is an understanding that the present system of levies is 
not GATT friendly. I ask the hon. member if she is completely 
confident that this bill cannot be challenged successfully by the 
World Trade Organization?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	We certainly have top priority with our dairy people. I feel the 
government has moved in a fashion that will protect the whole 
dairy industry.
<P>
	I realize that six provinces have signed on and other provinces 
agree with portions of Bill C-86. The bill is in the best interest 
of Canada and its export markets and pertains to the reduction 
and changeovers that will be happening in August of this year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Frontenac has 30 seconds left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Do we not have 
ten minutes for questions and comments?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> No. It is five minutes 
because there was an agreement to share time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Then 30 seconds will 
not be enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to speak in favour of Bill C-86, an act to 
amend the Canadian Dairy Commission Act. The proposed 
amendments will permit the strengthening of the partnership 
between the commission, provincial milk marketing authorities 
and the dairy industry, through the joint administration of the 
new pricing system and the pooling of market returns.
<P>
	This approach will allow Canada to comply with the new trade 
conditions under the North American Free Trade Agreement and 
the World Trade Organization agreement. Milk used for 
exported products or for products on domestic competitive 
markets will continue to be made available to processors at 
competitive prices. At the same time, we will maintain the 
producer equity that is so essential to the current milk marketing 
system.
<P>
	Even though Bill C-86 gives new powers to the Canadian 
Dairy Commission, it has no effect on provincial jurisdiction. 
An interface between current provincial and federal powers on 
pricing is necessary so that all milk marketing can be regulated, 
whether the milk is sold beyond provincial borders or on export 
markets.
<P>
	The pricing and pooling approach, authorized by the 
amendments in Bill C-86, was proposed by the dairy industry 
itself and represents only administrative changes to the mandate 
already given to the Canadian Dairy Commission and the 
provincial milk marketing authorities.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Since its creation as a Crown corporation in 1966, the 
commission has assumed a key role in the development and 
implementation of the federal dairy policy. It is working in close 
collaboration with important national organizations such as the 
Dairy Farmers of Canada, the National Dairy Council of Canada 
and others working under them.
<P>
	The Canadian Dairy Commission is also facilitating the 
essential work of the Canadian Milk Supply Management 
Committee through the chairman of this committee responsible 
for controlling the implementation of the national milk 
marketing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12692"> 12692 </A></B>
<P>
plan, the  federal-provincial agreement governing the 
management of milk supplies in Canada.
<P>
	After detailed consultation with the industry, the commission 
sets the target price of industrial milk-the milk used in dairy 
products such as cheese and yogurt-and the support price of 
butter and skim milk powder.
<P>
	The Canadian Dairy Commission is also authorized to collect 
levies from producers remitted by the provincial milk marketing 
authorities. This is to cover exportation costs and finance 
special programs aimed at increasing domestic consumption of 
dairy products.
<P>
	Provincial milk marketing authorities are authorized to set the 
prices and pool market returns within their respective borders. 
The new legal provisions contained in Bill C-86 will place the 
commission on equal footing with provincial authorities as far 
as price setting is concerned and authorize it to operate the 
pooling system agreed on by the provinces for milk earmarked 
for interprovincial or international trade.
<P>
	In order for the Canadian Dairy Commission to be able to 
manage this new price setting and pooling approach in the 
interest of producers, legislation must give certain powers to 
provincial dairy authorities and, as required, provide that they 
give up certain responsibilities. In the new system, provincial 
authorities will grade milk for export or sale on competitive 
domestic markets and set prices depending on end use.
<P>
	Under the terms of the amendments before us, the Canadian 
Dairy Commission would be able to delegate to provincial 
authorities its present responsibility with respect to the pricing 
of milk traded interprovincially while being granted the power 
to pool revenues from the sale of milk sold interprovincially by 
provincial authorities.
<P>
	On a regular basis, boards and milk marketing boards would 
report to the commission the sales volumes and going prices for 
each grade of milk sold during a given month. The Canadian 
Dairy Commission would then be asked by provincial 
authorities to average nationally the price for each component 
included in the pool. Sufficient amounts would be included from 
each province to ensure fair distribution of the proceeds from 
the sale of milk for the lowest priced classes.
<P>
	We must bear in mind that not all provinces contribute to the 
same degree to processing activities. The quantity of milk for 
special classes of products, that is to say, dairy products for 
export such as cheese, or further processed products such as 
chocolate and pizza, varies widely across the country.
<P>
	Most of the inexpensive milk in these classes will be sold to 
processors in the most industrialized provinces, namely Ontario 
and Quebec. Some smaller provinces, however, are greatly 
affected as to their proportion of the total volume of milk sold at 
reduced prices.
<P>
	To ensure that the cost of maintaining these industries and the 
essential export markets is shared equitably among producers, 
each province will be required to inject a minimum percentage 
of its total monthly sales of milk into the pooled fund.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	This is how national average prices for the different classes of 
milk products would be calculated. This percentage is being 
negotiated by provincial authorities.
<P>
	Returns from the agreed upon percentage of milk sales would 
then be pooled and redistributed to producers through provincial 
authorities on an equitable basis negotiated by the industry and 
provincial authorities and set out in official federal-provincial 
agreements.
<P>
	The industry has concluded that creating special classes of 
milk sold at competitive prices on the destination market would 
be a good way of maintaining our share of the dairy export 
market without resorting to production levies.
<P>
	The importance of finding an equitable way of maintaining 
our share of the export market in dairy products and products 
with dairy ingredients was the main force behind the intense 
negotiations and hard work undertaken by the provinces through 
the various committees and working groups in the past year.
<P>
	Just before Christmas, the hon. Ralph Goodale and his 
provincial and territorial counterparts responsible for 
agriculture and agri-food confirmed their support of the 
industry's consensus that some pooling of market returns from 
dairy products was urgently needed so that the industry could 
meet Canada's international obligations and maintain an orderly 
marketing system.
<P>
	By passing Bill C-86, the House can finally take an active part 
in the development of this essential sector of the Canadian 
economy, which successfully faces the modern challenges of the 
emerging global market.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member for Vaudreuil talked about the target price for 
industrial milk, which is essential to producers of powdered 
milk, for example, or frozen pizzas with cheese; this class of 
milk is sold at a lower price. He talked about the targeted price 
for that milk. I would like him to elaborate on that.
<P>
	Secondly he spoke about NAFTA and GATT. I often ask 
Liberal Party members as well as Reformers which of the two 
agreements should take precedence. Would the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil not agree that his government should seek to 
determine which should take precedence?
<P>
	For example, the three dollar levy per hectolitre of milk was 
partly consistent with GATT. It could have been reduced each 
year by 15 per cent, while, according to NAFTA, it will have to 
be totally eliminated by August 1, 1995. Which one is right? Is it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12693"> 12693 </A></B>
<P>
GATT or NAFTA? If the hon. member for Vaudreuil does not 
know, would he not be tempted to suggest to his minister of 
agriculture that  he seek a determination of whether GATT or 
NAFTA takes precedence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Madam Speaker, first, the hon. member for 
Frontenac will surely agree that the bill was drafted in 
consultation with Quebec's dairy industry, which is very 
supportive of this legislation.
<P>
	I do not want to get into a debate as to which agreement takes 
precedence over the other. Rather, I want to congratulate the 
hon. member for Frontenac, who is the opposition's critic on 
agriculture, for his very positive comments, in this House, on 
April 4, 1995, regarding the development of the memorandum 
of understanding which integrates the marketing of industrial 
milk. Indeed, the hon. member was very pleased with this 
change.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, I wonder what the opposition is now up to. The 
fact is that, if the amendments to the act do not come into effect 
by August 1, 1995, there is a risk that producers' contributions 
could no longer be used to finance exports to the U.S.
<P>
	Considering that Quebec accounts for over 47 per cent of the 
industrial milk production, and that most of this production is 
exported to the U.S., it only makes sense to pass this bill as 
quickly as possible, so that producers in Quebec and in the rest 
of Canada can benefit from it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: The 
hon. member for Davenport, World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund; the hon. member for Richmond-Wolfe, 
internal trade; the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden, gasoline 
prices.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very happy to rise and speak today to further the interests of 
farmers in Quebec and Canada, and more particularly in my 
riding of Champlain.
<P>
	It is all the more pleasant to do so since Bill C-86, an act to 
amend the Canadian Dairy Commission, shows that, for once, 
the government has understood how important it is for our 
agricultural producers to adjust to the new international trade 
rules.
<P>
	We all know that agriculture is an industry that cannot be 
compared with any other, especially in Quebec. For example, 
virtually all farm production in Quebec comes from family 
farms. Agricultural performance depends on the weather and, 
for most products, marketing is done jointly by producers. 
Those few points illustrate the distinctive features of this local 
industry that has to compete on world markets.
<P>
	With GATT and NAFTA, farmers are thrown onto a free 
market and have no other choice but to succeed. To do so, they 
must prepare, and we must set up systems that are allowed under 
those agreements and provide independent producers with a 
framework that is both flexible and competitive.
<P>
	Bill C-86 is a step in the right direction, but the government 
should keep in mind that producers must constantly adjust and 
keep their production costs as low as possible, to be able to meet 
the challenge of world competition. Farmers have realized as 
much in the last few years, and they do whatever is needed to 
succeed. In Quebec, let us just mention the establishment, in 
1992, of the Quebec dairy industry recovery fund, which has, as 
one of its prime missions, the funding of research projects on 
dairy products or of marketing projects aimed to increase sales.
<P>
	This recovery fund is partially financed through a levy on 
each hectolitre of milk produced and on processed products. The 
fund was set up by the Quebec milk producers federation, 
Agropur and its subsidiaries, the Lactel Group and a number of 
associated co-operatives, as well as a company belonging to 
private manufacturers members of the Dairy Council.
<P>
	This example shows the innovative spirit of producers and 
others involved in the Quebec agri-food system and, in addition, 
it reflects their capacity and willingness to work together to face 
common challenges. It is no longer possible to ask producers 
alone to constantly reduce their production costs without asking 
the other people involved in the agri-food system to do the 
same.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	This reality is the basis of our collective approach and 
competitiveness on the world markets. Emphasis is now put on 
total quality and the implementation of research results not only 
throughout the Quebec and Canadian agri-food systems, but 
also by all the stakeholders involved, including the federal 
government.
<P>
	As for the government, it must make the legislative 
framework more flexible and maintain the assistance measures 
allowed under the international trade agreements, as requested 
by the president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture 
during the last general assembly of his organization. The 
government and the Minister of Agriculture must constantly 
ensure that their action does not harm the agricultural industry.
<P>
	The budget recently tabled by the Minister of Finance took 
away some of the basic resources our farmers need and 
undermined the growth of our agricultural industry. Under the 
February budget, Agriculture Canada stands to lose 2,000 jobs, 
including 900 in the research sector, one of the most important 
sectors in agriculture, and the farm support programs will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12694"> 12694 </A></B>
<P>
reduced by 30 per cent. More specifically, milk producers will 
sustain over a two-year period a 30 per cent cut in the subsidies 
for industrial milk. These producers live for the most part in 
eastern Canada, which includes Quebec, and the  government 
has made no provision to compensate these producers, although 
it plans to compensate western farmers for the elimination of the 
Crow benefit. The producers will have no other choice but to 
pass part of the bill on to consumers. And producers will again 
be accused of having increased the price of dairy products.
<P>
	As the president of a farmers association, Laurent Pellerin, 
said in an article which appeared in the weekly <I>La terre de chez 
nous</I>: ``The Martin budget singles out rural regions''.
<P>
	The government cannot, on the one hand, change the rules 
applying to the dairy industry and, on the other, gradually 
withdraw its support. I would hope that both measures are 
carried out with the same outlook on our agricultural future and 
that the Minister of Finance has consulted the Minister of 
Agriculture before proceeding with these cuts. I would also hope 
that they have assessed the impact because it would be a shame 
for the farmers to see the efforts of the Minister of Agriculture 
wiped out by his colleague, the Minister of Finance, year after 
year, budget after budget.
<P>
	Bill C-86 is a very praiseworthy initiative of the Minister of 
Agriculture, who wishes to establish a national pooling system 
of market returns which will help sustain dairy product exports. 
This new system is consistent with international trade 
agreements and gives producers the same advantages as a 
deduction system. However, I hope that the minister has thought 
of a reply for the American government, which has the habit of 
challenging Canadian agricultural policy and could be tempted 
to accuse Canada of dumping, since this system favours a lower 
price for milk used in export products.
<P>
	We must not forget that the bill before us has been introduced 
right after six provinces, including Quebec, signed an 
agreement in principle on the pooling of their milk supply 
systems. That means that, in these six provinces, producers will 
get the same price for their milk and that the provinces will 
administer a common quota. Put together, these six provinces 
account for 85 per cent of all the industrial milk produced in 
Canada. That consolidation will allow them to implement a 
single milk marketing system under which interprovincial 
barriers to milk supply will be phased out in the medium term.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, the consolidation of the milk supply system will 
help these provinces make the adjustment to competition from 
further-processed foreign dairy products. The agreement is the 
culmination of lengthy negotiations in which Quebec played a 
leadership role.
<P>
	Quebec is the main stakeholder in the dairy products supply 
management system. Without Quebec, the Canadian dairy 
policy collapses. The Canadian dairy producers understood that. 
This agreement proves indeed that, even in the middle of a 
referendum campaign, dairy producers from the other provinces 
have recognized the importance of economically integrating 
their industry with that of Quebec in order to protect their 
interests.
<P>
	By their actions, dairy producers have shown that economic 
reality prevails over emotional debates. This is proof once again 
that all the dire scenarios that federalists spread about will 
simply not materialize once Quebec becomes sovereign.
<P>
	Quebec will not lose its present share of quotas. On the 
contrary, like the other provinces, it will maintain the supply 
management system in the interest of all dairy producers in 
Quebec and in Canada. Quebec's success in dairy production is 
an economic reality hard won by producers, not a gift from 
Canadian federalism.
<P>
	I wanted to mention these facts because they are important in 
order to explain the role of each player, to understand fully the 
economic dynamics of the dairy industry and to clarify the role 
of the government, which must follow suit and work with 
producers toward a shared vision of tomorrow's agriculture and 
the actions needed to get there.
<P>
	The government's contribution to the development of our 
agricultural economy is mainly through the creation of a 
favourable environment. It must act as a guide and help all those 
who want to consolidate their markets or to develop new ones.
<P>
	Let us hope that Bill C-86 is only the beginning and, as the 
member of this House for the riding of Champlain, where 
agriculture is very important to our economy, I must support 
such initiatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened attentively to the hon. member's representations, and, I 
must say, it sounded to me like a rerun of all of the debates which 
have taken place in this past year, or even in the past 30 years. 
They always come back to how our federalist system has 
mistreated Quebec.
<P>
	But, recently, the debate shifted to how Quebec can retain the 
benefits of a federalist system even after declaring its 
independence. For almost a year now, they have been discussing 
how Quebec could keep the same currency as Canada, the same 
passport and citizenship, and how it could remain a member of 
all of the trade agreements.
<P>
	I will ask my question now because I would like to give them 
ample time to answer. How can they dare say to Quebecers 
today, in this House, that if Quebec were to separate, they would 
guarantee them-? Under the federal system, dairy producers 
get 47 per cent of overall production. We heard the Reform 
member say-
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12695"> 12695 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	How happy the rest of Canada would be, if Quebec ever 
decided to separate, to take up the slack in milk production in the 
rest of Canada. They would be happy. He stated that they did not 
want the separation of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, I am going to ask my hon. colleague how he can 
dare, first, to tell Quebecers today that they will be a signing 
party not only with the rest of Canada, but that they will also 
remain part of NAFTA, GATT and other trade agreements? But, 
more importantly, how does he intend to guarantee that the 
production quotas of dairy producers will remain at their current 
levels?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to my 
colleague opposite, the member for Vaudreuil. We can see how 
consistent the Liberals are in their approach. They continuously 
resort to the same scare tactics against Quebecers. What I want 
to say to the member for Veaudreuil is that we, on this side, have 
guts, we have courage, we are willing and able to trade with any 
country, and we want to maintain provincial agreements. I 
believe it will be in the best interests of everybody in Ontario 
and in the western provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
party's position on Bill C-86 is very clear. We support this bill, 
which enables milk producers to meet the requirements 
contained in the international trade agreements signed by 
Canada. This bill provides for the creation of a national pooling 
system of market returns which will help support the export of 
milk products.
<P>
	Among the interesting proposals, we notice that, from now 
on, the Canadian Dairy Commission will manage a common 
fund made up of returns from the sale of dairy products. 
Previously, the commission deducted levies from producers' 
pay cheques. With this bill, the commission will ensure that the 
provinces fund exports proportionally to their milk quotas. For 
instance, Quebec which exports more dairy products than the 
other provinces, will be assured that producers will share 
equally in the risks and in the costs of the system, as was the case 
under the old levy system.
<P>
	On April 4, I mentioned in this House that six provinces had 
signed a memorandum of agreement aimed at merging their 
milk supply systems. This bill is being tabled while Quebec, 
Ontario, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick have signed a memorandum of agreement providing 
for the common marketing of industrial milk and fluid milk in 
these six provinces. Even if the provinces keep their present 
quotas, there will be only one class of milk and one price and no 
more distinction between industrial and fluid milk.
<P>
	Quebec has played a major role in the signing of this 
agreement, I want to make that clear. I want to mention it 
because, even with the upcoming referendum on Quebec's 
future, the other provinces recognize the importance of an 
economic union with Quebec. Federalists say that, if Quebec 
separates, it will lose its present part of the quotas. I say this is 
false.
<P>
	Come on. Quebec will keep the supply management process, 
mainly because it is in the interests of milk producers in other 
provinces. If the federalist threat were true, Quebec products 
would create a very harsh competition for dairy farmers from 
the rest of Canada and there could even be a shortage of these 
products on the Canadian market.
<P>
	The fearmongering campaign of the federalists caught on 
rapidly in Quebec. One of their key arguments is the threat that a 
sovereign Quebec will lose half of its industrial milk quotas and 
that thousands of dairy farms will be out of business in Quebec. 
Roger B. Buckland, a vice-principal at McGill University, 
suggested in the Opinion rurale column of the March 2nd issue 
of the magazine La Terre de chez-nous that the United States 
would drive many dairy farms to the brink of bankruptcy.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	According to him, the United States would refuse to maintain 
the tariffs agreed to under GATT in an agreement which would 
make an independent Quebec part of NAFTA. He argues that 
sovereignty would have a negative impact on Quebec dairy 
farmers since, within Confederation, they supply 48 per cent of 
the industrial milk sold on the Canadian market when Quebec 
has only 25 per cent of the population.
<P>
	Fortunately, the same publication also ran a reply from a 
sociologist, Stéphane Paré, in its issue of March 30 to April 5. 
Here are some excerpts from this reply:
<P>
	``Will Americans swallow us? Will they take advantage of the 
situation to make NAFTA prevail over GATT? Will Canadians 
produce more milk and will Quebecers have to reduce their 
production? Quebec, even if it separates, will remain a signatory 
to GATT, at least that is the way we interpret international law. It 
is called ``state succession'', and it means that the successor 
state abides by the laws and obligations of the country it was part 
of previously.
<P>
	Mr. Buckland, I can just see you rushing in to argue that the 
rule of successor states does not necessarily apply. You are right. 
In fact, this is one of the reasons why I believe that Canada 
would be interested in siding with us against Uncle Sam. 
Canadians know very well that, without Quebec, they would be 
an easy prey for the Americans. Therefore, they would see the 
advantages of sitting down with Quebec to negotiate. If there is a 
possibility that Chile could join NAFTA, I fail to see why the 
signatories would be harder on Quebec. We must keep in mind 
that, for the U.S., Quebec is a more important economic partner 
than France is, for example.  As for the fate of dairy producers in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12696"> 12696 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec, you should know that they do not need Quebec's 
independence to disappear. All they have to do is to let Mr. 
Martin do his thing''.
<P>
	Rational arguments always prevail over fear, and Quebecers 
will not be fooled on the day of the referendum. Why claim that 
a sovereign Quebec would not be allowed to trade with the rest 
of Canada, when we know that Canada's dairy production is an 
economic reality? Trade between Quebec and Canada exceeds 
$80 billion.
<P>
	Do you think that it would be in Canada's interest to cut all 
ties to an independent Quebec? If Quebec loses, how can Canada 
expect to gain? The need to maintain a Quebec-Canada 
economic zone is obvious.
<P>
	The agreement in principle reached between the six provinces 
that we referred to earlier is an increasingly relevant case in 
point. Dairy producers in the other provinces know that Canada 
will maintain economic ties with a sovereign Quebec. Economic 
reality will prevail over feelings of emotion and vengeance. 
Furthermore, the Quebec government is committed to 
maintaining a quota system, which it sees as essential to both 
producers and processors.
<P>
	We know that scrapping this system would not be in the best 
interest of any dairy industry in Quebec and Canada. As the Bloc 
Quebecois demonstrated during the official opposition day on 
agriculture, excluding Quebec from the quota system would 
expose dairy producers in the other provinces to the fierce 
competition of their Quebec counterparts, in addition to creating 
a shortage of dairy products in those provinces.
<P>
	GATT rules virtually preclude the imposition, by Canada, of 
restrictive measures to prevent Quebec dairy products from 
getting in. These rules seem to be open to a legal challenge. So, 
we will leave it to the lawyers.
<P>
	Maintaining a common economic zone within the dairy 
industry will make it possible to resist pressure from the United 
States. Quebec and Canada will have to join forces if they want 
to counter constant American opposition to custom tariffs on our 
dairy products. The bill before the House, Bill C-86, will 
probably be challenged by the Americans.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	It should not come as a surprise to us to hear that the U.S. are 
accusing Canada of dumping by reason of the fact that Canada 
intends to promote low prices for milk in dairy products for the 
export market. However, it will be up to our neighbours to the 
South to prove that Canadian exports have an injurious effect on 
their market. This will not be an easy task, for our products are 
exported in small amounts and generally processed.
<P>
	At any rate, we know that all European GATT members 
subsidize their dairy exports. Canada is not there yet. Therefore, 
there is no reason to worry too much. However, if Canada were 
to act on the federalists' threat to break off any ties with an 
independent Quebec, the American ogre would be sitting pretty. 
The federalists also threatened Quebec dairy producers with the 
loss of tariffs negotiated with the U.S. under NAFTA if and 
when Quebec became sovereign. Come on.
<P>
	The U.S. appetite for international trade is well known and I 
am convinced that they will not change their ways with a 
sovereign Quebec. Naturally, they will try to get more than they 
already have and to renegotiate the agreement with an 
independent Quebec. But the fact of the matter is that this is 
already going on now with Canada. Like Canada, Quebec will 
reply that customs tariffs are protected by GATT.
<P>
	The Americans are putting the pressure on and will continue 
to do so, whether Quebec becomes sovereign or not. However, 
they do understand that money talks. With exports of $14 billion 
and imports of $27 billion to and from Quebec, it is not the 
economic considerations involving Quebec's dairy industry that 
would keep Americans from signing a new free trade agreement 
with us.
<P>
	There is currently very limited trade between Quebec and the 
U.S. involving the dairy industry, because of high tariffs. It is 
easy to see that we would have a new free trade agreement 
without having to make concessions on agricultural tariffs. So, 
where is the catastrophe for the Quebec dairy industry in a 
sovereign Quebec?
<P>
	Where is the catastrophe, if it is wrong to claim that a 
sovereign Quebec would lose half of its industrial milk quota, 
which would result, if we are to believe the fearmongers, in the 
closure of thousands of dairy farms in the province? Where is 
the catastrophe, if it is wrong to claim that sovereignty would 
adversely affect Quebec producers, because they provide 48 per 
cent of Canada's industrial milk production, while accounting 
for only 25 per cent of the country's population? Where is the 
catastrope, if it is wrong to claim that Quebec dairy producers 
will lose the benefit of the existing tariffs with the U.S., under 
NAFTA. Where then is the real threat?
<P>
	The real threat was tabled by this government not long ago. 
The real threat for Quebec's dairy industry is the last federal 
budget, as I said a few moments ago, when I quoted a Quebec 
sociologist. Because of that budget, the federal subsidy for 
industrial milk is reduced by 30 per cent over a two year period.
<P>
	We mentioned earlier that Quebec accounts for 48 per cent of 
Canada's industrial milk production. So, who do you think will 
bear the brunt of these cuts? It is pretty easy to figure out. These 
cuts amount to a loss of income of $3,775 for an average size 
dairy farm producing about 2,500 hectolitres of milk. This 
means a 15 per cent loss of income for a producer with a net 
income of $25,000. And this is not taking into account the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12697"> 12697 </A></B>
<P>
increased feed  costs, following the elimination of transport 
subsidies for grain and feed. Quebec farmers have been left high 
and dry. The finance minister's budget does not provide any 
compensation for them, even though they are the most affected 
by it.
<P>
	This bill will allow producers to adjust to the requirements of 
international trade agreements signed by Canada. As we said, 
this is why the official opposition supports Bill C-86. However, 
the problem confronting our daiary producers is certainly not 
solved, given the obstacles set in their way by the finance 
minister's budget.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	What gives me hope however is the agreement in principle 
signed by Quebec, Ontario and the four other provinces to pool 
their milk supply system. This shows that a sovereign Quebec 
would not be isolated for mere emotional reasons, when it is 
economic considerations that really count.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the remarks of my colleague with great 
interest.
<P>
	I come from a rural Ontario riding that has an excellent dairy 
industry. Speaking on behalf of the farmers, the dairy producers 
in the immediate area where I live, I am perplexed by the 
remarks that separation would not hurt Quebec producers.
<P>
	The dairy farmers in my area feel very strongly that Quebec 
dairy farmers are enjoying a singular advantage right now and 
would look forward to an opportunity to compete face to face 
with Quebec as would be the case in the event of separation. 
There are farmers in my riding who are very expert in the dairy 
industry.
<P>
	Does my colleague feel in the event of Quebec's separation 
that Ontario dairy producers would lose or gain? Would they 
produce more milk and get more money?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to answer this 
question because, in reality, our colleagues from Ontario, our 
neighbour, have nothing to worry about. They know very well 
that they have a good thing going with Quebec, and Quebec 
knows it too.
<P>
	I do not believe that the day after Quebec's separation, should 
that day come, Ontario would say: ``From this day on, we are 
going to ignore you, ignore your businesses, your dairy 
businesses, your imports and exports''. I do not believe it 
because my colleague opposite knows very well that two 
provinces, two good provinces, Quebec and Ontario, which have 
always had good trade relations, are not going to erect walls at 
their borders, even when it comes to agriculture, I might add.
<P>
	My colleague also knows very well that, as things stand now, 
such a move would cause Ontario to lose thousands of jobs and 
millions and millions in revenue. Therefore, I think that a 
married couple can always make some kind of alliance and come 
to some kind of agreement. I would like to add that we are all 
sensible people, whether we are from Quebec or from another 
place in Canada. We are all very reasonable and very talented. 
Should Quebec separate from the rest of Canada, I would be 
worried in the least. We will continue to have very good trade 
relations. I assure you. I thank my colleague for raising this 
excellent question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
marriage is not on the agenda in the current political situation in 
Quebec. Divorce is. And I never knew people to be better off 
after a divorce than they were before. Never. They keep talking 
about threats and scare tactics when we disagree with them. The 
real scare tactics started when the budget was brought down in 
Quebec. Although six or as many as eight provinces brought 
down a balanced budget, the Quebec minister of finance opted 
for genuine scaremongering. Vote no or vote yes, depending on 
the question, otherwise we raise taxes.
<P>
	The hon. member also said everything would be just fine after 
separation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They are dreaming in Technicolor. They stand in the House 
day after day and state everything will be rosy after separation. I 
challenge them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Question. Question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> The hon. member for Frontenac might as well 
know this is a time for more than questions, this is a time for 
questions and comments. He never had the intestinal fortitude to 
tell the House how Quebec and its farmers would be better off in 
an independent Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member also said that, in an independent Quebec, 
Quebecers would have the assurance that their new country 
would be a party to all trade agreements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He says again that it is in the interest of Ontario and all other 
provinces to continue a lateral trade relationship with Quebec.
<P>
	We are talking about a divorce; we are talking about the 
destruction of a country. They cannot stand in the House day 
after day and pretend that in a separate Quebec people would be 
able to keep the monetary policy, the Canadian dollar, and to 
have dual citizenship. Imagine people in Quebec being able to 
vote in the rest of Canada because they have dual citizenship and 
people from the rest of Canada not being able to vote in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12698"> 12698 </A></B>
<P>
	There is never a campaign of fear mongering in this party. We 
will reach a decision diplomatically and democratically. I would 
like them once and for all to stand and say there may be a risk but 
they do not. They continually tell Quebecers that it will be 
business as usual.
<P>
	How can they guarantee that? They have said they want to 
take the good things Canada has to offer. They want the same 
dollar, the same passport, the same everything. Pretty soon they 
will be telling us: ``We will keep Canada; find your own 
Quebec''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Madam Speaker, it will be a pleasure to respond 
to the hon. member for Vaudreuil. I wish the hon. member would 
remember what I said. When I referred to marriage, I meant an 
economic marriage, and I would like to point out that today, as 
many as 60 per cent of businesses in Quebec and Ontario are 
involved in joint ventures, and that Ontario has a $3.8 billion 
trade surplus with Quebec.
<P>
	Just a minute, Madam Speaker, just a minute, please. Will 
Ontario ignore us overnight? Will Ontario and the other 
provinces in Canada turn down economic ties overnight? Hardly 
likely. Globalization is the order of the day. But let us continue.
<P>
	Just because we are talking about agriculture, we do not need 
more fences. There will be no fences tomorrow. These are the 
figures I wanted to mention in the House when I spoke earlier, 
and I repeat, this is an economic marriage regardless of the 
outcome for Quebec. With respect to agriculture, which was 
supposed to be my topic today, there are no borders, no fences. 
And I may add that yes, this will be a good economic marriage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as someone from British Columbia I am sick and tired 
of talk about some kind of economic merger.
<P>
	A lot of dairy products come from Quebec into British 
Columbia. Why does the member think British Columbia would 
accept product from a country that just separated from Canada? 
What motivation is there for people from British Columbia to 
take the product when we can produce it ourselves?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Madam Speaker, I think our western colleague 
overlooked the fact that Quebec buys $800 million worth of 
beef.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Annually.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Annually. Eight hundred million dollars worth.

	<B>An hon. member:</B> And Western wheat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> We could say plenty about Western wheat, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
	I will say this, if the Reform Party does not want an economic 
marriage, it can refrain, but as a politician, I say that we are 
going to have a real marriage, a marriage that is economically 
and politically sound.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to join my colleagues in the debate on Bill C-86, an act to 
amend the Canadian Dairy Commission Act and to add my 
support to this important initiative.
<P>
	Dairy farmers of Canada as well as producers in my home 
province of Prince Edward Island are very anxious to see the bill 
passed prior to the end of June so that the legislative 
requirements laid out in the act are in place prior to August 1.
<P>
	The P.E.I. milk marketing board held a number of public 
meetings on the proposals outlined in the act and had strong 
producer support. However I underline the important point that 
producers in my province do not want to see this as the first step 
in moving toward a national quota exchange. It is important to 
have the quota distributed throughout the country and not drawn 
basically into Quebec and Ontario through quota pricing 
practices. I underline that as a concern.
<P>
	The bill provides Canada's dairy sector with the ways and 
means to successfully face demanding new market realities. As 
well the amendments are very much in line with the 
government's fiscal goal of getting the deficit under control.
<P>
	The new milk pricing and pooling system will not require any 
additional resources from government reserves. It will not entail 
any contingent liability on the part of the federal government or 
involve any reallocations from within the Canadian Dairy 
Commission's current operating funds.
<P>
	As my colleagues before me have noted, the principal 
amendments to the act provide the commission with the legal 
administrative authority to work co-operatively with provincial 
milk marketing authorities to calculate the average national 
price level for the milk classes whose returns will be pooled, to 
obtain the returns from sale to processors through the provinces 
and then to redistribute the returns to producers through 
provincial authorities on an equitable basis under the terms of a 
formal federal-provincial agreement.
<P>
	The other amendments contained in Bill C-86 are even less 
complicated. They are necessary to add clarity to the act to 
ensure compatibility and consistency with provincial 
authorities and legislation, to enable proper and efficient 
banking procedures and administration of producer money, and 
to strengthen the enforcement provisions of the act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12699"> 12699 </A></B>
<P>
	Through Bill C-86 a provincial milk marketing board is 
specifically defined to add clarity to the act and to ensure 
consistency with similar provisions contained in the dairy 
products marketing regulations. The new industry pooling 
system for milk marketing returns will be carried out through 
arrangements agreed upon by the Canadian dairy commission 
and the provincial milk marketing authorities.
<P>
	An amendment has also been included for clarity to ensure 
that there is no misinterpretation of the fact that the regulations 
made under the CDC act do not take precedence in terms of the 
authorities provided to the commission under the act.
<P>
	The provisions contained in any legislated act always take 
precedence over any regulations made pursuant to the act. That 
is an important point. Other amendments provided by Bill C-86 
enable the commission to recover pool administration costs 
from the pool, to establish a special bank account to deal solely 
with the producer moneys entering and leaving the pool through 
the provincial authorities, and to permit the CDC to establish a 
line of credit to ensure continuity of producer payments. These 
are important principles to ensure that we meet our GATT 
obligations and that we are not using government moneys to 
fulfil these procedures.
<P>
	Under pooling arrangements the Canadian dairy commission 
will simply be administering a pool of producer moneys on 
behalf of producers. If necessary, any borrowing costs would be 
undertaken on a short term basis only to ensure timeliness of 
payments as moneys enter and leave the pool. Any such 
borrowings would be subject to prior approval by the Minister of 
Finance and be totally funded by producers.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-86 also enables the CDC to continue its long standing 
practice of returning any excess fees or levy funds rightfully 
owed back to producers. The amount of in quota production per 
producer can only be estimated at the beginning of each dairy 
year. The amount of actual production is not known until the end 
of the year.
<P>
	While no penalties are charged for under producing milk, 
under the supply management system over quota production is 
exported and levies are charged on these amounts to cover 
export costs and other related CDC program costs. The same 
type of situation may well occur under the pooling system as 
average national prices will be calculated at the beginning of a 
certain period and may differ when the marketing costs are 
finally determined. Again, no additional government funds are 
involved.
<P>
	The last amendment contained in Bill C-86 strengthens the 
enforcement provisions of the CDC act. Given the attorney 
general conducts all litigation for the commission and has the 
power to seek injunctive relief in its own name the new 
provision will ensure the same relief is available if litigation is 
commenced by or against the commission in the name of the 
CDC.
<P>
	Again I urge my fellow members to fully support Bill C-86. 
Such approval will demonstrate clear recognition of the 
importance of Canada's dairy sector and the continuation of the 
supply management system and its benefits to not only 
producers but to all Canadians. This is a model we should be 
encouraging other countries to adopt and these amendment will 
go a long way in terms of making it compatible with GATT 
agreements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my distinguished colleague and member for Malpèque is an 
expert in dairy production, and I have considerable respect for 
him.
<P>
	The Federation of Dairy Producers of Canada decided to 
comply with the provisions of NAFTA-and NAFTA is the 
reason we are here debating Bill C-86 this afternoon-because 
the $3 levy per hectolitre of milk could have been reduced by 15 
per cent a year. However, GATT determined that, as of August 1, 
1995, this $3 deduction from the income of industrial milk 
producers would be illegal under the NAFTA agreement, 
because it would be considered a direct export subsidy.
<P>
	This is debatable, but since it seems we do not want to overly 
upset the Americans, we bowed to their demands. We still do not 
know which takes precedence-GATT or NAFTA-so we 
comply with the requirements of NAFTA.
<P>
	Under this agreement, we obtained an extension in order to 
become legal. As the member for Malpèque pointed out, the 
quota may be negotiated between provinces. The hon. member 
for Malpèque could buy part of Quebec's quota to expand his 
farm. Better yet, if he wants to swell his coffers, he could sell his 
quota to Quebecers, who could take his quota from Prince 
Edward Island and bring it to Quebec.
<P>
	I think this is a very good point in Bill C-86, given that, in the 
agreement signed by the farm producers of the six provinces, if, 
for example, Prince Edward Island sees its milk quota vanish 
like snow in springtime after the 1 per cent sale, it can 
temporarily withdraw from the agreement it signed with the 
other five provinces.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	What I want to find out from my colleague for Malpeque, who 
is very familiar with agriculture across Canada, is: what is going 
to happen to the three recalcitrant provinces? I will not go so far 
as calling them separatist, but I would like to know what we can 
give these three western provinces to get them to sign the 
agreement with the six other provinces, since they produce 
barely 18 per cent of Canada's milk.
<P>

<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that Bill C-86 is only talking 
about the legislative authority to implement a national pooling 
system of market returns from the different classes of milk. It 
will not establish a national quota exchange. To be very clear, it 
will set up a national pooling system of market returns and 
would give that authority within the context of 
federal-provincial agreements on pooling mainly through 
delegated functions. I raised quota exchange because it is a 
concern of producers in Prince Edward Island that this 
legislation not been seen as the first step toward moving in that 
direction.
<P>
	This requirement is really as a result of the GATT. In terms of 
the point he raised with respect to GATT and NAFTA, we in 
Canada know which tariff reduction regime has priority. We 
know it is the GATT negotiation and not NAFTA. The 
Americans may differ in their opinion but certainly we are 
firmly behind the stand that the GATT tariff reduction rules 
apply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the debate to this point has been quite 
insightful. It tells us a bit about Canada and some of the 
problems we face. It is interesting that the debate is over 
something as simple as milking cows. The previous Liberal 
speaker has been actively involved in the dairy industry. I 
cannot say the same although I have milked cows.
<P>
	It is very interesting to see a debate in the House, an argument, 
a scrap might be the correct word, between the Liberals and the 
Bloc over milking cows. It was at the point at which they were 
talking about marriages and divorces over milking cows. We 
have to wonder, in the marriage or the divorce who is the cow 
and who is the bull. Maybe we have two bulls, in which case 
where is the milk?
<P>
	If we have this kind of debate over milking cows, can we 
imagine a fight over the future of Canada as to whether we 
remain a united country? We can imagine how the scrap will 
intensify. We will not be talking about milking cows, we will be 
talking about the St. Lawrence seaway, the division of assets, 
federal buildings across the river in Hull, federal buildings in 
Montreal and all across Quebec, apportioning the federal debt. 
We can only imagine the difficulty.
<P>
	The problem is we have two parties in the House talking about 
marriage and divorce. It is time to change the parameters of the 
debate and start talking about life and death. With the parties 
involved in the debate all I see is the potential of death. They 
will scrap until someone is killed.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	We may be talking about some new life in this issue. When I 
think about new life I think about Reform because Reform talks 
about a constructive new way of looking at things. Perhaps both 
parties need to lay aside their instruments of war and listen to 
Reformers who talk about a new Canada, the birth of new ideas, 
a new Confederation with 10 equal provinces working together 
because they have responsibilities appropriated to each level of 
government in a manner that will allow us to work 
co-operatively and lay aside some of these foolish and silly 
debates like the debate over how we milk our cows.
<P>
	I farm and I have milked cows, mostly as a young lad. I do not 
claim to be an expert but I recognize the importance of the 
industry. Therefore it is a privilege for me to speak this 
afternoon on Bill C-86 which provides for the replacement of 
levies with a pooling system of market returns from different 
classes of milk use, which system maintains producer equity and 
is consistent with Canada's international trade agreement.
<P>
	I rise in the House today to talk about an issue that should 
have been addressed many months ago. While I congratulate the 
government for finally addressing the issue of supply 
management, I have many doubts whether the government has 
the resolve to develop a policy that addresses farmers' concerns 
for the long term.
<P>
	Canada's supply management system has provided stability to 
the dairy industry. In the system farmers are given a reliable 
means of marketing their product with a consistent price. 
Consumers are guaranteed in receiving a product of high 
quality. However, this has come with a hefty price tag for 
consumers with goods in some cases double what the same 
product would cost in the United States.
<P>
	As long as our dollar is relatively low, below 80 cents U.S., it 
does not create too much of a problem. However, when we see 
our dollar increase above the 80 cent mark certainly we have 
cross-border shopping. Any Canadian who goes across the 
border to shop in the United States will put in their hamper large 
quantities of dairy products such as cheese, milk and the like. 
That indicates perhaps there are some fundamental problems 
and pitfalls ahead with regard to not only the dairy industry but 
all supply managed areas we need to openly discuss in the House 
and in the industry.
<P>
	Recent developments in world trade have signalled the 
inevitable end of Canada's supply managed systems as we know 
them. The status quo will go, just as it will go with regard to the 
squabble between separatists and federalists. The status quo in 
the supply managed system will have to pass away as well.
<P>
	As of August 1, 1995 under the Uruguay round of GATT all 
import quotas must be converted to tariffs. While tariffs may 
protect supply managed commodities in the short term, it is 
doubtful they will be a fixture in the long term. Canada will try 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12701"> 12701 </A></B>
<P>
to maintain the 85 per cent  tariff level until the year 2001 but it 
is likely the United States will challenge it. Even the 
parliamentary secretary to the federal minister of agriculture 
has said publicly this is inevitable.
<P>
	I quote the MP for Prince Edward-Hastings:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What will likely happen is that the Americans will ask for a NAFTA panel in the 
very near future. The panel of industry experts is made up of two Americans and a 
fifth person who is chosen by `a flip of a coin'. The system is somewhat biased, 
depending on which country `wins the toss of the coin'. That's the way the system 
works.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government is confident it can win an American 
challenge against tariff levels. However, what plan of action has 
the government developed if the Americans win the challenge? 
It reminds me that the Liberals said they were sure Canada 
would win the debate over article XI in the GATT negotiations.
<P>
	Everyone knows the Liberals were wrong. We have found out 
the Liberals are wrong a lot of time. We are concerned that they 
do not always accurately communicate the conditions not only 
of the dairy industry, but those that many sectors of our economy 
may face in the future. The Liberals are not being 
straightforward with the results of the ongoing deficit and 
increasing debt.
<P>
	It is about time we started to deal realistically with the issues 
before us and address in a very direct form the concerns of the 
dairy industry. For instance, a ruling in favour of the Americans 
would put the current system in jeopardy. We are reminded that 
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The Reform 
Party supports the tariff levels which were agreed to under 
GATT.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAELECTIONSACT">CANADA ELECTIONS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-319, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act 
(reimbursement of election expenses) be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, this is a very straightforward bill. It 
intends to put one more very small hurdle in the path of 
registered political parties before they are eligible for 
reimbursement from the public purse. It would be a hurdle 
similar to the one that is in the path of individual candidates. 
When individual candidates run in a particular riding, the 
candidate is required to have 15 per cent of the total votes cast in 
that constituency before the candidate is eligible for 
reimbursement from the public purse.
<P>
	Reams and volumes of books have been published over the 
years on election financing in Canada. The stack is quite high. It 
all has to do with financing elections in Canada and ensuring 
that financing is straightforward and transparent. It ensures that 
candidates who are able to run in elections come forward to 
represent their constituencies without having to be 
independently well off.
<P>
	The election financing rules are intended to ensure that 
candidates are not bought by individuals. That is why there are 
limits on campaign expenditures. That is why there is full 
disclosure on funding of individual and national campaigns.
<P>
	The bill speaks only to the national campaigns. It was 
motivated during the last election when I found myself, as 
everyone in the House did, in the situation where there was a 
cacophony of candidates representing quite a wide variety of 
platforms.
<P>
	Perhaps the most outrageous was the platform of the yogic 
flyers. While the debates were going on I wondered what yogic 
flying had to do with running our country and what yogic flying 
could do to get our country out of debt and make our country 
work better. At first I am sure many people thought it was a joke. 
We certainly do not want to dissuade anyone from running and 
getting involved in politics. And perhaps yogic flyers do have 
the answer to Canada's problems.
<P>
	I wish to inform the Chair that it is my intention to share my 
time with my colleague from Okanagan Centre.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, here we were in the 
middle of the election campaign surrounded by yogic flyers.
<P>
	That would have been great, except that when the election was 
over I checked into it. They received a grand total of 84,000 
votes in the last election, .6 per cent of the total votes cast. They 
also received $717,000 from the taxpayers of Canada in 
reimbursement for their national campaign expenditures. It 
worked out that the taxpayers of Canada reimbursed them $8.41 
for every vote cast. They spent $37.38 for every vote they 
received, which is their business. It did not make sense to me 
that the taxpayers of Canada should be subsidizing what really is 
not a political party.
<P>
	The intention of having the national campaign party 
reimbursement was to ensure that national or regional political 
parties had some income between elections. It was intended to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12702"> 12702 </A></B>
<P>
keep them going. National or regional political parties are 
necessary for the lifeblood of the country.
<P>
	In looking at the campaign expenditures, we thought about 
how we would make sure the hurdle was low enough, so small 
that parties could get started yet high enough to be real. We came 
up with the figure of 2 per cent. Federal parties would have to 
have spent 10 per cent of their total allowable limit and also 
have garnered 2 per cent of the total votes cast. In the last 
election that would be something like 270,000 votes across the 
country.
<P>
	Some with whom I have discussed this bill have suggested it 
might be appropriate to have a lower threshold. If that is the 
case, I would be quite happy to consider amending this bill to 
have a lower threshold, perhaps 1 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Why not higher?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> That would still be 130,000 votes across the 
country. As an hon. member opposite mentioned, why not 
higher? If it is the will of this House either in committee or in 
debate that it should be higher, that could be considered. In my 
view, 2 per cent was high enough that it was a hurdle but low 
enough that it was possible to achieve.
<P>
	I wish to reiterate the intent is not to prevent new parties from 
getting going. The intent is in keeping with the spirit of the 
Electoral Reform Commission to ensure hurdles are in place to 
protect the public purse, to ensure that genuine political parties 
are able to benefit from the very wise intentions of those that 
preceded us in this House.
<P>
	I ask hon. members opposite to give this bill their 
consideration and support. It may save us somewhere in the 
region of $1 million, which for most Canadians is quite a lot of 
money. For the federal budget, it is not that large an amount. 
However, it is not just the amount, but the principle we are 
talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased and happy today to be able to support my 
colleague from Edmonton Southwest and his bill to amend the 
Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	Canadians are a people with a profound respect for 
democracy. Look around at the make-up of the House. We know 
by the change that took place from the last election to this one 
how democracy is respected in our country.
<P>
	We understand representation very well. We respect it even 
when we do not necessarily agree with everything our 
representatives say. One of the things that brings this home most 
clearly is the structure of our electoral system.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	We conduct open, free and fair elections in Canada. We give 
political parties tools to raise funds and to run candidates. We 
place limits and restrictions on their activities during and 
between writs to ensure fairness, even in dealing with each other 
and with the public. We have disclosure rules to make the system 
transparent. But our system also has some flaws. The bill put 
forward by my hon. colleague is all about addressing one of 
those flaws.
<P>
	Bill C-319 seeks to limit the reimbursement of election 
expenses to those parties that have spent more than 10 per cent 
of their allotted expense amount as described in section 46 of the 
Canada Elections Act if and only if they receive more than 2 per 
cent of the vote nationally. What this would do is limit expense 
reimbursement to only those parties that have received a 
significant number of votes in the election, those parties that 
have a reasonable level of public support among Canadian 
voters.
<P>
	In the most recent election, Elections Canada reports that 
there were 19,906,796 registered voters. This means that with 
this bill a party would have to have received 398,136 votes 
nationally to be eligible for reimbursement of election 
expenses. I do not think it is unreasonable for Canadians to 
expect a party to give a reasonable showing in an election before 
hard earned tax dollars are handed over to help it pay its bills.
<P>
	What this bill seeks to prevent is the situation that arose in the 
last election. During that election certain parties were either 
well financed or had policies that were way out of touch with 
reality but were still well financed. These parties managed to 
field a large number of candidates and spent considerable sums 
on their campaigns. The taxpayer reimbursed them for a 
sizeable chunk of those expenses, even though they received 
only a very tiny portion of the overall national vote.
<P>
	It does not sit well with me nor with many other Canadians 
that we are reimbursing expenses to parties that do not get more 
than a handful of the overall votes. I am not advocating the 
restriction of the electoral system here, far from it. I am only 
suggesting that it is about time we started to apply some fiscal 
restraint to our electoral system just as we are to the rest of the 
functions of government.
<P>
	Parties should in no way be limited from forming or running 
as many candidates as they can muster. Parties should be 
allowed to spend as they see fit within the current rules set out 
by Elections Canada. Parties that do not command a significant 
share of the vote should not expect the Canadian taxpayer to 
cough up money to pay their bills.
<P>
	I need to correct myself. We want 2 per cent of the total votes 
cast which in the last election would have worked out to 270,000 
votes or thereabouts. The earlier figure I used was a theoretical 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12703"> 12703 </A></B>
<P>
number based on the actual number of people who could have 
cast a ballot.
<P>
	The reimbursement of election expenses should be a privilege 
enjoyed by those parties that have demonstrated they have the 
support of a significant proportion of Canadians. It is that 
simple.
<P>
	What Bill C-319 seeks to introduce is fairness and fiscal 
restraint in the electoral system. We all know that fiscal restraint 
is absolutely essential in Canada today. We want political 
parties to demonstrate that they are deserving of any benefits 
they might derive from the taxpayer. We want them to show that 
they have support at the ballot box before they get the support 
from tax dollars. It is really all about fairness.
<P>
	If a party deserves to be reimbursed because it has support 
among the people, it will be. If, however, a party is using the 
electoral system in this country as a soapbox for personal or 
questionable exposure and the people ignore it, then it should 
pay its own bills.
<P>
	Again, I am not suggesting that we limit participation in any 
way. It is just that parties that do not command a certain level of 
support from the voters should not expect those same voters to 
bail them out with tax dollars. It is about being fair, responsible 
and accountable to the taxpayer for the dollar spent.
<P>
	I am pleased to offer my support to my colleague from 
Edmonton-Southwest in this Bill C-319.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am highly interested in the bill introduced today by 
the member for Edmonton Southwest. I congratulate him on the 
fact that his bill was chosen. I hope that today, or at a later date, 
the House will adopt the bill at second reading so that it can be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs which will study it, and maybe recommend a few 
amendments before sending it back to the House for 
concurrence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill purports to put a minimum in place for contributions 
from the federal treasury for parties participating in elections. 
The hon. member has proposed a political party must receive at 
least 2 per cent of the votes cast in order to be eligible for the 
22.5 per cent reimbursement allowed under section 322 of the 
Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	The hon. member will be aware there is a fairly significant 
history in relation to this issue which might be of interest to him 
and other hon. members wishing to participate in the debate 
today. The Lortie commission, the report of the royal 
commission on electoral reform and party financing, 
recommended registered parties that receive at least 1 per cent 
of all the ballots cast be reimbursed at a rate of 60 cents for each 
vote received provided that no party would be reimbursed at an 
amount greater than 50 per cent of its electoral expenses.
<P>
	This increase proposed by the Lortie commission rewarded 
parties that received a large number of votes in proportion to the 
number of votes they received and also increased the rate for the 
major parties so they would get more money because there was a 
recognition that at the national level Canada's national parties 
are generally short of cash, particularly those not forming the 
government.
<P>
	There was a recognition by the royal commission that the 
governing party had an easier time raising funds than parties in 
opposition to the government. In part to offset that the 
commission recommended this rather generous reimbursement 
procedure but based on votes so that only a party that was fairly 
successful in the polls would receive a substantial chunk of 
money.
<P>
	The hon. member will know there were extensive discussions 
between the parties about the Lortie recommendations. In the 
last Parliament I had the honour to be a member of the special 
committee on electoral reform which dealt with the Lortie 
proposals in some detail and came up with a series of reports 
tabled in the House. One of the reports resulted in the adoption 
of Bill C-114, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act, in the 
last Parliament. The other major report from the committee was 
never acted on by the government prior to the dissolution of 
Parliament and accordingly this issue, as were some others, was 
left untouched.
<P>
	The committee, composed with representatives of the three 
recognized parties then in the House, the NDP, the Progressive 
Conservative Party and the Liberal Party-the Progressive 
Conservatives of course had a majority on the committee-was 
unable to agree on the Lortie commission proposal.
<P>
	While it was something that would have been palatable with 
our party, the New Democratic Party in particular found it 
offensive because it would have received far less money than 
under the current legal arrangements. The Progressive 
Conservative Party, looking at the polls, was very nervous it 
might also be disastrous for it and so it was not very keen on it.
<P>
	I say with some pride the Liberal Party has always done well 
in the polls, whether in opposition or in government. Hon. 
members opposite laugh but it has been a fact for really all of 
this century that we would have come out reasonably well on any 
scenario with this arrangement. Other parties were more 
apprehensive and based on the election results in 1993, I can 
understand their apprehension. We all know the New 
Democratic Party took a terrible whipping, although well 
deserved, and the Progressive Conservative Party similarly was 
thrashed, and very properly so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12704"> 12704 </A></B>
<P>
	They would have felt this rule in a very harsh way had they 
adopted it before the election, which this party would not and 
had not in any election. With all the elections it has lost in this 
century it still would have done all right under a rule of this kind.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	I now want to turn to what the committee did. The committee 
came up with another way of enriching the parties a little, and 
that was to increase the reimbursement from 22.5 per cent to 25 
per cent and simply leave the rules as they were. That was the 
only deal we could make which every party agreed on and it was 
part of a package which included other changes to the financing 
of political parties. Of course none of it was enacted.
<P>
	I do not mind telling hon. members opposite one of the points 
the government was very anxious to include in the bill was a 
restriction on the minimum number of votes one had to receive 
in order to qualify. The government was very anxious to put in 
place a figure which I think was around 5 per cent. That would 
have put at risk various other parties that were more regionally 
based. When I say that I look at the two parties in opposition 
because both of those parties come from a fairly regional base. I 
think the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest would concede 
the Reform Party is not strong in Quebec or in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	We resisted that at the time because we felt if we were to have 
a regional basis to the parties it was unfair to stack the deck 
against the establishment of new parties and we were naturally 
somewhat concerned about that. Therefore we resisted and I 
think I can safely say from the point of view of hon. members 
opposite it is probably just as well we did.
<P>
	However, that is history and certainly from a theoretical point 
of view there was no objection on our part to putting some 
minimum number of votes obtained in place. Therefore, to have 
this bill before us today and allow the committee to study it is 
very important. I support the hon. member in that objective.
<P>
	However, I cannot let the opportunity pass without 
commenting on the 2 per cent figure. It strikes me as being 
rather low. In South Africa and in Germany where there is a 
system of proportional representation, in order to qualify to get 
any seats in the legislature they have to have at least 5 per cent of 
the votes. That is my recollection. That is to get seats, let alone 
reimbursement.
<P>
	In our country we can win seats in Parliament in one or two 
places, as we had with the Reform Party which had one member 
in the last Parliament, the hon. member for Beaver River, who 
was here throughout that Parliament. With a modest number of 
votes in a general election a party can still have seats in the 
House. We have two areas in which there is reimbursement, at 
the national party level and at the constituency level. If one is 
successful at the constituency level, money is paid to the  
successful candidates and to the other candidates who run well.
<P>
	In looking at the 2 per cent figure I cannot help but look at the 
results of the 34th general election, the 1988 election. Eight 
parties ran in that election which would not have qualified using 
the rule of the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest. They all 
had less than 1 per cent of the vote. However, the one party over 
2 per cent was the Reform Party. That party received 2.09 per 
cent of the vote in 1988. It is an extraordinary coincidence that 2 
per cent is the figure which the hon. member chose because of 
course it saved the Reform Party based on the 1988 results. I am 
sure he did not look at the results to come up with the figure, but 
perhaps a researcher did.
<P>
	While it has initial appeal, I think a little higher figure might 
not be inappropriate. I would have hated to see the Reform Party 
cut out of the financial jackpot if we had put it too high in the last 
election. I cannot remember if that party broke 5 per cent. I 
would want to look at a higher figure in committee. I served 
notice to that effect and I certainly look forward to hearing the 
witnesses the committee is able to call on this bill, should the 
House in its wisdom decide to give the bill approval in principle 
at second reading.
<P>
	There are lots of ways to skin a cat, as they say, and I think 
there are many ways we could seek to improve Canada's 
electoral law with respect to the reimbursement of political 
parties. I am glad to see the Reform Party by this bill is adopting 
the principle that the state does have an important role to play 
with respect to the reimbursement of political parties because 
that is certainly something we have regarded as fundamental for 
some time and on which occasionally I have heard statements. I 
cannot say I have read the little blue book, but I have heard 
statements that make me wonder if the Reform Party really is 
committed to this principle.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I assume this bill put forward by the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest has some approval from the powers that be 
in his party, including the member for Calgary Southwest who I 
gather has some say in these matters, that this is okay and this 
principle therefore is satisfactory.
<P>
	I am glad to support the principle. I hope we can work out a 
series of rules that will be fair not just to the parties currently in 
the House but to other parties formed in Canada and also to the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	The problem with the current system is it encourages parties 
that are registered and fielding the requisite number of 
candidates to spend as much money as they can. As long as they 
spend 10 per cent of their limit, I believe, they become entitled 
to a reimbursement of 22.5 per cent of their expenses no matter 
how 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12705"> 12705 </A></B>
<P>
many votes they get. I agree that is wrong. There should not be 
an incentive to spend.
<P>
	In my view, the money paid should be based on some other 
principle, whether it is on the number of votes received or on a 
minimal number of votes one must get in order to qualify for the 
expense. Something needs to go into the law.
<P>
	I quite agree with the hon. member in bringing this forward. I 
would be glad to support the bill at second reading in order that 
the standing committee may do a detailed study on the proposal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to represent the 
official opposition in this debate on Bill C-319. Before I start, I 
would like to salute and thank the members who are constantly 
striving, through their work and reflection, to improve the 
elections act and the way our tax money is managed, with a view 
to reaching a very significant goal, namely the representation of 
the people.
<P>
	On behalf of the official opposition, I would like to give a 
point of view based solely on democratic principles in action. 
The purpose of this bill is to allow only those registered parties 
that have received 2 per cent of the total number of votes cast in 
a national election to receive a 22.5 per cent reimbursement of 
their election expenses.
<P>
	We believe that this new provision of the Canada Elections 
Act will result in making it more difficult-and I especially 
stress more difficult-the emergence and survival of a variety of 
political formations which often reflect political diversity and a 
rich and vibrant democratic life.
<P>
	I do understand the underlying principle of the bill, which is 
to avoid reimbursing part of the election expenses of groups or 
factions formed to campaign in favour of a political idea shared 
by a tiny minority. I believe that this bill is aimed at the Natural 
Law Party, for example. We have no intention of launching into 
an endless debate, even if I am opposed to the principle of the 
bill. Again, I understand the bill's objectives. It could, however, 
set a dangerous trend for democracy in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Since a political party is already required to nominate at least 
50 candidates to be registered, which I feel is enough to confirm 
how serious a political formation is, why should it also be 
required to receive at least 2 per cent of the total number of votes 
cast in an election to be eligible for a 22.5 per cent 
reimbursement of its expenses? Preventing the wasteful use of 
public funds to promote silly ideas during an election campaign 
is one reason, but it is not enough to convince me that this bill is 
justified.
<P>
	In my opinion, this bill is strangely reminiscent of Bill C-229 
tabled by the Reform Party, which would require a political 
party to nominate candidates in at least seven provinces in order 
to be registered. I think that both these bills are similar to the 
extent that they both seek to limit the expression of democracy 
in Canada.
<P>
	Make no mistake. This is a discussion about principles, a 
discussion that could lead us in this House to debate the 
relevance of the multiparty system at the so-called ``national'' 
level.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-229, which required a political party to nominate 
candidates in at least seven provinces that have, in the 
aggregate, at least 50 per cent of the population of all the 
provinces, was nothing short of undemocratic. We regarded it as 
an insult to democracy, because it denied Quebec's right, as a 
distinct society, to have its own representatives in the federal 
legislature.
<P>
	In Canada, the multiparty system is also a matter of regional 
representation, and that is what the bill denied. In the past, 
several political parties have been active on the Canadian scene 
while based only in one province. As early as 1920, members 
from other parties started to be elected to the House of 
Commons in relatively large numbers and with enough support 
and credibility to influence the democratic system. In the 1930s, 
the Social Credit and the Commonwealth Cooperative 
Federation, for example, represented very special interests, and 
their demands and aspirations were in no way national in nature; 
these were movements created by Western farmers to protest the 
excessive taxation powers of a highly centralizing federal 
government.
<P>
	So, why limit access for the political representation of 
minority views and amend the Canada Elections Act if not to 
prevent Quebec in particular from voicing its rejection of the old 
national parties, the people commonly referred to as the Grits 
and the Tories?
<P>
	Let us be clear. The introduction of such restrictions on the 
exercise of a democratic right in the Canada Elections Act 
would mean the end of the multiparty concept in the Canadian 
electoral system. We feel that the provision requiring that a 
party gets 2 per cent of the votes to have part of its expenses 
repaid is a restrictive measure.
<P>
	Such bills promote the emergence of a one-way political life, 
of a biparty system essentially dominated by two parties taking 
turns to defend the same interests and the same vision of a very 
centralized Canada.
<P>
	The biparty system does not reflect the geographical reality of 
Canada. Our country is part of a continent. Each region of that 
continent is a country in itself, with its language, its character 
and its cultures. In that context, we feel that the Canadian 
culture is a myth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12706"> 12706 </A></B>
<P>
	The two party system can no longer reflect reality across the 
continent; the rout of the Conservative Party of Canada in the 
last general election is proof of that, even though the hon. 
member for Sherbrooke is trying like the very devil to resurrect 
his party.
<P>
	Mr. Ostrogorsky, one of the fathers of modern political 
analysis, condemned-and this democratic approach is 
important-what he called the ``perverse effects of a 
mechanical democracy''. He was referring to the two party or 
one party political regimes under which the democratic life 
looks somewhat mechanical and loses all its meaning. ``The 
ongoing nature of parties is the basis for the development of the 
machine and disturbs the workings of democracy'', he wrote. 
Therefore, the appropriate solution to the problem of parties 
appears obvious. He felt that we have to get rid of the use of rigid 
and permanent parties, whose only goal is to gain central power. 
Where I come from, we say that it does not make the slightest 
difference whether the Tories or the Grits are in power.
<P>
	We should go back to the true nature of political parties, that 
of groups of citizens formed to promote certain policies. The 
author describes political parties as forums where all those who 
are trying to solve a given problem or reach a given goal have a 
role to play and an opinion to voice on each and every issue. 
They are a kind of comprehensive and regional association.
<P>
	He writes: ``In countries with a bipartisan system like the 
United States, Great Britain-and Canada, I should 
add-political debate all but disappears. When the discussion 
revolves around the vision of the Tories or the Grits, we end up 
nowhere. Real debates on social issues take place outside the 
political parties''.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	So, he makes the basic and implicit assumption that there is 
no universality in the differences of opinion within our society 
and that our conflicts and differences cannot be resolved by a 
single entity.
<P>
	The last general election proved that the two major parties, 
the Conservative and the Liberal parties, the Tories and the 
Grits, are no longer alone in the Canadian political arena, which 
is being redesigned according to regional considerations that 
have nothing to do with the concept of a Canadian nation. To us, 
any measure aimed at limiting the expression of political 
differences at the continental level is inconceivable.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, is 
against this bill and wants to point out during this debate that we 
are now faced with a new democratic approach which recognizes 
the fact that, since the last election, there is no longer a truly 
national party in Canada. We have well-represented regions, 
which clearly indicates the goals we have to reach.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am glad to be here today to debate this private member's bill.
<P>
	Private Members' Business gets far too short a shrift in this 
Parliament as it did in other Parliaments. It is a time for private 
members who do not get to set the legislative agenda of the 
government, both on the government side and indeed in the 
opposition, to come forward with pieces of legislation that they 
believe will fix things that are wrong.
<P>
	Some of Private Members' Business is inherently partisan, 
which is fine; that is the nature of the beast in this place. Some 
seeks to try to get some consensus and camaraderie around the 
Chamber with respect to principles, goals and ideas.
<P>
	I do not support the bill in its entirety but I do understand the 
direction the hon. member is trying to set. Having run in two 
elections and having run election campaigns in a number of 
elections prior to that, I know it is extremely difficult as a 
candidate or as a campaign manager when one gets individuals 
or indeed parties that form for a very frivolous reason the 
intention to go out and paint everybody else who has a legitimate 
political belief as somehow ripping off the system.
<P>
	We have seen that all the time. The Rhinoceros Party and 
some other regional parties form for the sole intention of trying 
to make some fun out of the very serious business of politics. It 
is difficult as a candidate when that happens. However, one has 
to be extremely careful when one starts introducing pieces of 
legislation whose impact may be to limit entry of legitimate 
political thought in our system. It begs the question of what is 
legitimate political thought. That is really in the ear or eye of the 
beholder.
<P>
	One of the major problems I have with the bill and one of the 
reasons I could not support it in its current form, although I 
would support it's going to committee so that we can at least 
have some non-partisan debate not structured by our parties 
with respect to this issue, deals with the percentages. The reason 
I had difficulty with the percentages, and the hon. member will 
be interested in hearing this, is not so much that I am opposed to 
setting a benchmark below which a party is not deemed to be 
worthy of support by the taxpayers of Canada. I am worried for 
two reasons. One is that I firmly believe we have to do 
everything humanly possible to ensure genuine political debate 
is fostered, that it does not become the purview of the rich and 
the famous and those who can bankroll on their own.
<P>
	The second thing we have to be very careful of is the 
minimums when one starts establishing in law certain 
parameters within which political debate and thought must be 
con-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12707"> 12707 </A></B>
<P>
ducted. Otherwise one will not be able to get the type of funding 
necessary, which in turn will thwart the fostering of new 
political thought, new political ideologies.
<P>
	I did some quick math. In Atlantic Canada we have 32 
constituencies. One thing that strikes an individual after getting 
elected, be they from Alberta, Nova Scotia, northern Ontario or 
Quebec, is the vastness of this nation. This is a wonderful piece 
of God's earth. Although from time to time we just deal with our 
troubles, it really behoves us to think about the enormity of the 
resource we have.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	It is a regional country, like it or not. I am a regionalist. I 
believe the country is made up of a number of regions. We may 
have provincial boundaries that fit inside those regions, but 
most of all it is a country of regions.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada many times we have voted differently than 
the rest of the country has. I remember back in 1984 when the 
Conservative Party first came into power there was a sweep 
across the country. The sweep was not nearly as complete in 
Atlantic Canada. In 1988, while the Tories enjoyed a second 
electoral victory, in Atlantic Canada the tides turned. Atlantic 
Canadians moved away from that governing party in a larger 
percentage than any other region of the country.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We are awfully smart.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> We are awfully smart and perhaps that is it.
<P>
	Different regions may find different political ideologies 
appealing for whatever reason. In Atlantic Canada we have 32 
seats. We are a vital part of the nation. We have the great 
province of Newfoundland. We have Prince Edward Island, the 
birthplace of Confederation. We have the bluenosers from Nova 
Scotia and the herring chokers from New Brunswick. We have 
32 wonderful constituencies and four tremendous provinces as 
part of this great country.
<P>
	The Tories did not do terribly well in the last election, as we 
know, right across the country. In Atlantic Canada they did not 
do terribly well either. The message of the Reform Party was so 
objectionable to the people in Atlantic Canada that people who 
could not see their way to vote for the Liberal Party stayed with 
the Tory Party, knowing their vote would be lost, that the Tories 
would not get another term in office. They could not go with the 
third option, the Reform Party. They will never go with the 
Reform Party. That will never be an option down there.
<P>
	The Tories did exceedingly well with respect to how they did 
in other parts of the country. They got wiped out as well there, 
with the exception of the member for Saint John, the former 
mayor, who perhaps most days wishes she had not been so lucky 
to win that night.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada the rough math tells me that the Tories in 
32 seats polled about 290,000 votes. That is pretty close to the 
two per cent limit set out in the bill. I do not have them all 
marked, but I will run through the percentages of votes cast that 
Tories received in all of the ridings in Nova Scotia: 20 per cent, 
8, 22, 11, 32, 36, 23, 20, 23, and 32.
<P>
	I do not throw those numbers out to say the Tories are a viable 
alternative now or in the future. I throw them out to show they 
did still garner a significant vote because the Reform Party's 
message was not saleable in Atlantic Canada in the last election. 
It probably never will be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> You wait, you'll see.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> The hon. member for Delta knows of which 
I speak.
<P>
	There are 32 ridings in Atlantic Canada. The Tories scored 
fairly well, better than they should have and better than they did 
on the national average. Yet if that were a regional party in 
Atlantic Canada it would have garnered only about two per cent 
of the vote nationally. I have a problem with the percentage. Two 
per cent is probably too high, and perhaps the percentage should 
be lowered to about one per cent.
<P>
	Another concern is with respect to the establishment of 
minimums. When we establish minimums, many times they 
become maximums. Perhaps down the road, if this bill is 
fortunate enough to gain the consent of the House, people might 
say there is a precedent that there have to be certain criteria 
before you are deemed to be a legitimate political party in 
Canada. It may also be that at some point you must win seats in 
more than one province or more than one region before you get a 
political rebate.
<P>
	I know that is not covered in the member's bill. I worry that at 
some point, unless a bill like this is crystal clear and the the 
debate is crystal clear leading up to the adoption of such a bill, 
somebody would try to use it as a precedent to do those certain 
things.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not support our colleagues in the House who represent the 
Bloc Quebecois. I believe that deep down they are good 
individuals but they are terribly misguided with respect to their 
desire 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12708"> 12708 </A></B>
<P>
to take the great province of Quebec, la belle province, out of the 
great Canadian Confederation.
<P>
	However, they have a legitimate right as a political party to 
voice their concerns, to go out and seek support in a general 
election through the democratic process. I would not want to see 
at some future point even separatists in the province of Quebec 
somehow trying to use a restrictive bill like this which seeks to 
put parameters on legitimate political parties for the purposes of 
rebate to stifle political thought they found to be objectionable.
<P>
	I commend the hon. member for putting thought into this bill 
and I hope it does go to committee so it can get some fuller 
debate at committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Edmonton Southwest on 
Bill C-319. It is very obvious the debate has started members 
thinking about a very important issue.
<P>
	I will approach it in a slightly different way. One of the issues 
it raises which is so important in our electoral process is 
appearances. I remember my own election campaign, which was 
a first experience for me since I had never run for election 
before, going to all candidates meetings in which there were the 
five major parties represented as well as another four candidates 
from very minor parties.
<P>
	I do not reject the right of groups to try to run as national 
parties; I think it is fine. However, we have to draw the line 
somewhere. At these candidates meetings I found myself with 
the candidates from the other major parties speaking on issues, 
then having to waste my turn while these very minor parties 
spoke. In the case of the Natural Law Party-its members will 
forgive me for saying this-their platform which had to do with 
levitation did not really seem to fit seriously into the issues of 
the day.
<P>
	While I agree they had the right to speak and the right to run as 
parties in the election, they did dilute the debate when we had 
our candidates meetings. They also diluted the debates when 
they appeared in the media. It has a responsibility to provide 
equal space to all candidates in an election. Perhaps the debate 
was not as good or as serious as it could have been. I agree we 
can do nothing about that.
<P>
	On the other hand, I find myself supporting the member's bill 
on this point. If the public were to perceive, as it does, that 
anyone is eligible for compensation in running for election 
regardless of any limit in the number of votes they garner, it 
trivializes for them the exercise of candidacy, the exercise of 
running in a national election.
<P>
	If the Natural Law Party wants to run for election, that is fine. 
If it wants to field candidates, that is fine. If it wants to use an 
election as a platform for promoting its particular agenda of 
metaphysicalism or whatever it is, that is fine too. It becomes a 
problem when the public perceives it is funding that type of 
group. This is the difficulty.
<P>
	It is the same with all the other parties as well. If the public 
perceives a group is out promoting itself in a national election 
and does not have much support or has trivial support, and the 
government funds its election expenses because it can afford to 
put the money out there, then we erode our political system and 
the faith people have in the process.
<P>
	I do support the principle of Bill C-319. We have to draw the 
line somewhere. Whether it should be 1 per cent, 2 per cent or 5 
per cent, I cannot say. I actually rather like 2 per cent. Nine of 
the 14 parties that ran in the last election had less than 2 per cent 
of the vote.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	It is interesting to run down the percentages of those nine. 
Beginning with the Abolitionist Party of Canada at 0.1 per cent, 
the next was 0.2 per cent, 0.1 per cent, 0.1 per cent, 0.2 per cent, 
0.1 per cent, .01 per cent for the Marxist-Leninist Party of 
Canada. It is not doing well. Then we go on to 0.6 per cent and 
1.4 per cent, which was the National Party of Canada which I 
happen to agree had a message.
<P>
	I agree with the intention of Bill C-319. The line has to be 
drawn somewhere. I do not know if this bill is the answer. As the 
member for Dartmouth and others mentioned, we should bring 
this to committee for further debate. In the final analysis I do not 
think it will affect regional parties. We will still be able to go 
forward with certain amendments to the bill which will make the 
process more efficient.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WORLDBANKANDINTERNATIONALMONETARYFUND">WORLD BANK AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
on May 8 I asked the hon. Minister of the Environment and 
Deputy Prime Minister whether the G-7 leaders at the June 
meeting in Halifax will discuss the important issue of making 
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund 
environmentally sustainable institutions.
<P>
	At present, the lending programs of international financial 
institutions, including the World Bank and the International 
Monetary fund, provide mostly developing countries with over 
$30 billion a year in the form of loans. Too often these loans fail 
to take into account environmental and social considerations as 
in the case of dam construction.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	Closing the gap between the rich developed nations and poor 
developing countries must remain the principal goal of the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. We all agree 
with that. However, these institutions and their initiatives in 
developing countries must aim at alleviating poverty while 
protecting the environment. That is where the point needs to be 
made.
<P>
	In the case of the International Monetary Fund, we feel that 
instead of relying predominately on economic considerations, 
economic and environmental goals should be integrated.
<P>
	As to the World Bank, while it has made some progress toward 
greater accountability, it still has a long way to go to fully 
incorporate sustainable development principles into the 
decision-making process. Furthermore, at every opportunity the 
World Bank should ensure that the principles of international 
environmental agreements such as the convention on climate 
change and the one on biodiversity, to mention two, are upheld 
and reinforced by its decisions.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the Prime Minister intends to 
discuss the role of international financial institutions at the next 
meeting of the G-7 in June in Halifax. Therefore, in that context 
I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary whether he can 
inform us whether the urgency of incorporating the principles of 
sustainable development into the activities of the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund will be discussed there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, first let me say that the meeting hosted in 
Hamilton by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of the 
Environment for the G-7 environment ministers reached 
substantive recommendations and conclusions.
<P>
	With respect to the question of international institutions, the 
ministers looked at two different aspects. First, they discussed 
the roles and responsibilities of the primary international 
institutions that address the environment and sustainable 
development. The ministers agreed that the United Nations 
environment program should be reinforced in its efforts to be the 
global environmental voice, while the United Nations 
commission on sustainable development, created just over two 
years ago in the aftermath of Rio, should continue to evolve as a 
key political and policy forum to promote sustainable 
development principles and practices worldwide.
<P>
	With respect to international financial institutions, the 
ministers agreed that the World Bank should place sustainable 
development at the top of its list of priorities and that it should 
operate on a much more open and transparent basis. Plans for 
projects funded by the World Bank should demonstrate how the 
principles of sustainable development will be promoted and how 
local participation will be a basic part of the process.
<P>
	The ministers also called on the International Monetary Fund 
to take environmental considerations into account in its 
structural adjustment programs. They also called for continued 
work from the new global environmental facility, the GEF, on 
providing funding for global environment priorities and noted 
the important role that private capital flows will play into the 
future. They also indicated their intention to work with the new 
World Trade Organization to make sure the environment is a 
fundamental part of its work. In this regard, let me signal the 
initiatives recently taken by UNCTAD and UNEP in focusing on 
the environment and the economy.
<P>
	The important outcomes of the Hamilton meeting of 
environment ministers are being provided to the preliminary 
process for the Halifax summit. I am certain that any 
consideration of financial institutions that might take place in 
the context of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12710"> 12710 </A></B>
<P>
Halifax summit will be well informed by the views of the 
Hamilton meeting, which will flow into the Halifax summit.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNALTRADE">INTERNAL TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, during a previous question period, when addressing 
comments regarding Bill C-88 to the Minister of Industry, I 
suggested that Bill C-88 contained provisions which go far 
beyond the agreement on interprovincial trade, which gives each 
party recourse to retaliatory measures.
<P>
	Bill C-88 appropriates powers to the federal government 
which were never discussed during the negotiations leading up 
to the signing of the agreement on interprovincial trade last 
summer and is also indicative of, we feel strongly, the federal 
Liberal government's extremely strong will to centralize trade 
relations with its partners. The current trend in international 
trade is to give regions more political autonomy and to establish 
economic unions, not to create big federations with rigid 
centralizing constitutions, like the Canadian federation, which 
is given an inordinate amount of power to take retaliatory 
measures.
<P>
	The primary goal of the bill is to implement the Agreement on 
Internal Trade, not to permit the federal government to implant 
itself as the supreme power on interprovincial trade. Do not 
forget that the Bloc Quebecois has always been in favour of 
liberalizing trade in this way, which, at any rate, is the 
framework within which all modern states must develop. 
Therefore, we do agree with the agreement in principle.
<P>
	The way we understand the provisions of this agreement is 
that, if the federal government is the slighted party in a trade 
deal covered by the agreement, it has the means to take 
retaliatory measures. By the way, so can any other party to this 
agreement. However, that is not what is written in Bill C-88.
<P>
	Why not? Because clause 9 of the bill goes over and above the 
intent of the agreement. This is quite straightforward. Clause 9 
reads as follows: ``For the purpose of suspending benefits or 
imposing retaliatory measures of equivalent effect against a 
province pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement, the 
Governor in Council may, by order-but the other parties may 
not-''
<P>
	The bill refers to orders, which cannot be taken lightly. None 
of the other parties have this authority. Orders are used by 
totalitarian governments to subdue the other parties. It says in 
this bill that the Liberal government wants to govern by order 
under this agreement on interprovincial trade. Are we looking at 
a dictatorship? That is the question.
<P>
	In this context, according to the wording of Clause 9, when 
one of the parties is found to be at fault pursuant to Article 1710 
of the Agreement, the federal government-and it alone, among 
all the parties-whether or not it is a party to the dispute, 
assumes the right to impose retaliatory measures on all the 
provinces, without exception.
<P>
	In this bill, the federal government demonstrates its 
determination to act as judge and jury in the area of 
interprovincial trade, to introduce its exclusive authority to act 
by order in council and to extend the application of any federal 
law to the provinces-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the questions raised by some 
members on Bill C-88 last week stem from an inability or an 
unwillingness to understand the plain meaning of the text of the 
bill.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry was quite clear in responding to 
questions in the House on May 5. Perhaps repetition at this time 
will help the hon. member.
<P>
	Only in rare cases would the federal government be a 
complainant in the dispute under the agreement on internal 
trade. If a dispute were resolved in favour of the federal 
government and if the province involved refused to comply with 
the impartial panel findings, then the federal government could 
withdraw benefits of equivalent effect. Such retaliation would 
have to be in the same sector as the original violation or in 
another sector covered by the agreement. Retaliation could not 
involve transfer payments or social programs because those 
things are not covered by the agreement. Anyone who takes the 
time to read the head notes to section 9 of Bill C-88 and article 
1710 of the agreement on internal trade can verify the accuracy 
of what I have just outlined.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Remarks by Quebec premier Parizeau and Quebec industry 
minister Paillé on May 9 and May 10 suggest they had not 
bothered to do so before speaking on the issue. The repeated 
expressions of concern in this question by BQ and PQ 
representatives suggest they are unable or unwilling to 
understand plain and clear language.
<P>
	Bill C-88 deals only with what the federal government must 
do to live up to its obligations under the internal trade agreement 
and nothing else.
<P>
	At the April 12 meeting of the committee of ministers on 
internal trade, the Minister of Industry advised his provincial 
colleagues of the steps the government intended to take and that 
legislation would shortly be brought before Parliament.
<P>
	Premier Parizeau has unequivocally supported the agreement 
and stressed the importance of free trade within Canada. He 
reaffirmed on May 9:
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12711"> 12711 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``The change in government in Quebec City has changed 
nothing. We believe in free trade''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure all Canadians look forward to seeing what those 
governments that claim to support internal free trade actually do 
in concrete terms.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GASOLINEPRICES">GASOLINE PRICES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in late April gas stations across Canada raised prices as 
much as 10 cents a litre. It was the sixth price increase of gas in 
11 months.
<P>
	These increases excluding tax increases represent a 20 per 
cent increase in the price of gas to consumers. What is even 
more startling is that oil companies have seen a 40 per cent 
increase in their revenues once taxes are factored out in the same 
period.
<P>
	There has been no reasonable justification by the oil 
companies for these repeated increases. Each year since 1991 
the average daily price of crude has declined. Crude prices today 
are virtually the same as they were a year ago with the 11 months 
in between seeing lower prices.
<P>
	The profits of the major oil companies including Imperial Oil, 
Shell and Petro-Canada have increased each year over the past 
three years. In 1994 Imperial Oil profits went up 29 per cent; 
Shell went up 43 per cent and Petro-Canada went up 62 per cent.
<P>
	When gas prices have risen they have risen uniformly from 
company to company in each region within hours of each other. 
Consumers are outraged and believe strongly that they are again 
the victims of price gouging at the pumps and price fixing by the 
oil companies.
<P>
	This latest series of price increases is nothing more than a 
cash grab by the major oil companies that monopolize the 
industry.
<P>
	In a recent court case in Ottawa a gasoline retailer, Mr. Gas, 
admitted communications between gasoline retailers are 
common in the industry when setting prices. What this means is 
if smaller chains set prices, certainly the majors do.
<P>
	This latest increase in gas prices represents an extreme 
polarization of power and wealth into one sector, multinational 
oil companies. This increase is also extremely bad timing for 
farmers who are seeding their crops.
<P>
	The increase is injuring Canada's economic recovery and 
must be addressed. Every two-cent increase costs Canadian 
$750 million a year. These recent increases of six cents will take 
over $2 billion out of the Canadian economy in one year.
<P>
	The federal government must intervene in arbitrarily rolling 
back gas prices until a full energy price review can take place to 
ensure these increases are fair and justified.
<P>
	In my question to the Minister of Industry on April 28 and on 
May 3, the minister commented: ``When the prices are the same, 
it is consistent with both competition and price fixing. 
Therefore how do you know which it is?'' I suggest that if one 
does not know the difference that in itself demonstrates the need 
to conduct an investigation.
<P>
	The House of Commons is elected to ensure Canadians are not 
victims of the marketplace and to ensure the interests of Canada 
are protected. A gas price review would send a clear message to 
the oil companies and to Canadians that in a key economic 
sector such as energy fairness must prevail and significant price 
increases must be justified.
<P>
	The setting of energy prices is no different than the regulation 
of communication services. When Rogers cable or Bell Canada 
want to increase prices, the CRTC reviews their request to 
ensure they are fair and justified. Having the oil industry justify 
its increases is no different. Gas prices are viewed by the public 
as being set unfairly and unjustifiably and must be reviewed and 
regulated.
<P>
	The government has the power to question industry on its 
pricing practices and to create new laws that would demand gas 
price increases be made only after justification.
<P>
	Why do the Liberals refuse to act in the best interest of 
Canadians? The federal Liberal Party receives substantial 
donations from the oil companies. Husky Oil donated $14,000; 
Amoco, $27,000; Imperial Oil, $47,000. Is this the reason the 
government will not conduct an investigation into gas pricing? 
Is the Liberal Party concerned it will offend its top party donors? 
He who pays the piper calls the tune. The government-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the time has 
expired. The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to 
respond to the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden on his 
question concerning the uniformity of gasoline price increases 
across Canada.
<P>
	As the matter involving an Ottawa gasoline retailer is 
presently before the court, it would not be appropriate to 
comment further on that case.
<P>
	No federal government agency has the authority to regulate 
gasoline prices. It is within the jurisdiction of the provinces. In 
1994 the Minister of Industry asked the director of investigation 
and research at the Bureau of Competition Policy to review the 
provisions of the Competition Act. His report stated the 
Competition Act is adequate to address concerns about 
anti-competitive behaviour and that amendments were not 
required at this  time. The report is public and I encourage 
concerned members to read it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12712"> 12712 </A></B>
<P>
	At the suggestion of the hon. member for Ottawa Centre we 
are presently studying the implications of introducing whistle 
blower legislation to protect industry insiders who provide 
information about anti-competitive behaviour in the petroleum 
industry. The act empowers the director to investigate 
allegations that prices have been set as a result of 
anti-competitive behaviour. Where evidence exists of a 
criminal offence the case is referred to the attorney general for 
prosecution.
<P>
	It is important to realize this is criminal law and offences 
must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In the petroleum 
products sector uniform price increases may be the result of 
normal market forces; the visibility of posted prices and the 
homogeneity of gasoline tend to result in identical prices in a 
given market. It is very easy to immediately respond to a 
competitor's price movements up or down.
<P>
	Gasoline prices should be set by competitive market 
disciplines. When there is evidence of anti-competitive 
behaviour the Competition Act authorities will take appropriate 
action. People with information about anti-competitive acts 
should bring the information to the attention of the director.
<P>
