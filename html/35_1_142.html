	The House resumed, from December 9, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-56, an act to amend the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are now at third reading of Bill C-56, which would amend the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act in three important 
ways. I want to say from the outset that the Bloc Quebecois will 
vote against this bill.
<P>
	It is indeed impossible for us to support a bill to amend the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, an act that we 
disagree with in the first place. We consider that this act is an 
unacceptable federal assault on a field of jurisdiction that is 
already occupied forcefully and effectively by certain 
provinces. Quebec, for instance, has its own environmental 
assessment process, which has proven itself.
<P>
	Before going any further, I would like to take a moment to say 
a few words on the political strategy used by the Minister of the 
Environment, who is bent on associating the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act with our leader. We know that 
he is the one who originally initiated Bill C-78 in 1990, but a lot 
of water has passed under the bridge since then. The early bill 
has changed considerably, with the hundreds of amendments 
made by a legislative committee.
<P>
	Many provisions and clauses have been deleted, rewritten or 
added. The flexibility our leader was looking for in Bill C-78, 
that became Bill C-13 in 1991, has disappeared and been 
replaced with rigidity in the legislative intent. Moreover, among 
the changes made, the statement to the effect that the federal 
government promotes sustainable development is a clear 
indication that it considers itself the sole authority for  the 
renewal of resources, even though resources fall under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In light of all these changes, it is clear that the current 
centralizing vision of the Liberals is not in keeping with the 
original bill proposed by Mr. Bouchard. In an article that 
appeared in the April 1, 1992 edition of <I>Le Devoir</I>, Michel 
Yergeau, a well-known lawyer specializing in environmental 
law, reminded those who tried to justify federal intrusions in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction by invoking the fact that the first 
version of the reform was overseen by Mr. Bouchard, that Mr. 
Bouchard was well aware of the constitutional realities imposed 
by the nature of environmental problems.
<P>
	Mr. Yergeau even repeated something that Mr. Bouchard said 
in one of his speeches: ``In grey areas where the Constitution 
does not set out clearly the role of each government, 
co-operation must prevail''. As we come to realize that the 
environmental debate and the fight for life itself must take place 
all over the globe as well as in every area of activity, our fellow 
citizens would not understand, much less tolerate wrestling 
matches between federal and provincial politicians.
<P>
	Last Monday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
the Environment told us that the federal government had already 
participated in many environmental assessments in Quebec. I 
must remind him that these assessments were carried out under 
the federal guidelines order providing for flexibility and 
co-operation between the two levels of government, something 
which Bill C-13 no longer allows.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Let me remind you of the Oldman River Dam case on which 
the Supreme Court ruled on January 23, 1992. The spirit of this 
ruling was one of respect for provincial jurisdiction. The 
Supreme Court ruled that the assessment process outlined in the 
guidelines order applies only to projects for which the 
Government of Canada has an ``affirmative regulatory duty'' 
pursuant to an act of Parliament.
<P>
	Mr. Justice LaForest said, ``It cannot have been intended that 
the guidelines order would be invoked every time there is some 
potential environmental effect on a matter of federal 
jurisdiction''. He went on to say that the federal minister or the 
panel could not use the guidelines order as an excuse to 
invade-repeat, invade-areas of provincial jurisdiction 
unrelated to the area of federal jurisdiction involved.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8908"> 8908 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act promulgated 
on October 6 is far removed from the Guidelines Order of June 
1984 and Bill C-78. There used to be some flexibility and 
respect for provincial jurisdiction, but the new federal 
legislative and regulatory framework is more forceful and 
extends tentacles in every direction.
<P>
	The CEEA has a major impact on the application in Quebec of 
Quebec's environmental assessment procedure. Clearly, there is 
a risk that this Quebec law and surely other provinces' 
environmental legislation will be constantly duplicated, 
challenged or subordinated to the federal process. Nevertheless, 
Quebec's procedure has been well established for ten years 
already, is well known to the public and developers and has 
proven itself.
<P>
	In light of all the above, it is very clear that the minister's 
always associating our leader with Bill C-13 has no serious 
basis and may be due to some unadmitted desire to cast herself 
in the image of our leader when he was environment minister. 
But I think that the minister, as is her wont, is playing petty 
politics and using the only weapons she has, demagogy and 
partisanship.
<P>
	To convince you of these unfortunate inclinations of the 
minister, I will show you that despite her praise and flattering 
remarks about our leader for his initial bill, Bill C-78, the 
minister voted against reinstating this bill on May 29, 1991 in 
this House.
<P>
	Has the minister forgotten her vote against reinstating Bill 
C-78, which died on the Order Paper on May 12, 1991? All her 
Liberal colleagues also voted against reinstating it.
<P>
	On May 29, 1991, the minister said that Bill C-78 should be 
thrown out. Today, she praises our leader for this same bill. I call 
that double talk. The minister is being flagrantly inconsistent. 
As always, she confuses the environment with partisan politics.
<P>
	The minister's approach and behaviour are starting to give 
environmental groups and some provinces serious concerns. 
There is growing doubt about the Deputy Prime Minister's 
ability to run this important Department of the Environment 
well. Many people have told us that the minister does not know 
her issues and that her intransigent attitude is not at all 
appreciated. This situation is very disturbing and does not 
inspire confidence in the community.
<P>
	A specific incident showing the minister's ignorance 
occurred on November 10 when she was in Charlottetown. The 
minister, who was there to meet the people and reassure them 
about the raising of the <I>Irving Whale</I>, took the opportunity to say 
that she was very poor in science in school. This incident was 
reported in <I>Le Radar</I>, a Magdalen Islands newspaper, for the 
week of November 18 to 24, 1994.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Here is an excerpt from this article signed by Achille Hubert: 
``In fact, the minister showed her abysmal ignorance when she 
was interviewed by Lyne Danis, a Radio-Canada journalist. 
When asked how the refloating operation was going to be 
conducted, the environment minister floundered. She thought 
the booms would be at the bottom of the water. As for the ship 
which will support the barge once it reaches the surface, she also 
thought that it would be at the bottom''.
<P>
	After listening to the option chosen to refloat that barge, I say 
that the minister has no idea of what is involved: She does not 
even have any sense of what this delicate operation entails. She 
showed her total ignorance of science, and I hope that the 
environment will not suffer more from her incompetence. 
Otherwise, it would not look very reassuring for the future.
<P>
	I urge the minister to take a very close look at the issues which 
are under her responsibility, and to stop justifying her own 
inability by claiming that her predecessors were passive.
<P>
	I want to go back for a moment to Bill C-78, which preceded 
Bill C-13, and remind you of what some members of this Liberal 
government were saying then, when they formed the opposition. 
At the time, the current Liberal member for Winnipeg North 
Centre said: ``We want to make sure that the powers involved are 
sufficiently explicit to allow for the establishment of 
environmental rules capable of sustaining the pressure exerted 
by the provinces. With this legislation, the government does not 
succeed in at least protecting Canadians against the ambition of 
the federal and provincial governments. We have let people 
down in so many ways that if we were to do it once again, this 
would be the most infamous action ever taken by Parliament''.
<P>
	This is what the Liberal member for Winnipeg North Centre 
thought of that bill. It was not good yesterday, but it is just fine 
today.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Eglinton-Lawrence, who is still 
here today, said this on October 22, 1990, and I quote: ``This is 
legislation without teeth. It is, in fact, legislation without teeth. 
The key word was `redraft' and not make amendments that are 
going to provide acceptable frills to this bill, but to alter 
completely the dimension of this bill. One of those items refers 
to the fact that the compliance component of the bill certainly is 
way lacking. There is absolute indifference to the concept of 
making various jurisdictions of government comply, 
particularly when they set up their own review mechanism''.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Egmont, in Prince Edward Island, 
said and I quote: ``Bill C-78 does not satisfy the legislative 
requirements necessary to protect our environment. In view of 
the importance and the urgency of environmental impact 
legislation, we cannot be satisfied with an imprecise, toothless 
piece of legislation such as the bill presently before us. This bill 
does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8909"> 8909 </A></B>
<P>
not  meet the expectations of the people of Canada. It does not 
measure up to the expectations of its own appointed 
environment and economy committee. It is so seriously flawed 
that it should be withdrawn and redrafted''.
<P>
	As for the Liberal member for Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso, he said: ``We should reconsider many basic 
aspects of this measure. I think that to be fair, it is somewhat 
short of perfection''.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Nepean added the following: 
``Unfortunately, the weakness of the legislation before us makes 
for a skeptical public and questions the motives of us as 
legislators and the seriousness of the government's intent in 
enacting this resolution''.
<P>
	The present Secretary of State for Latin America and Liberal 
member for Northumberland mentioned: ``Mr. Mulroney's 
government's latest environmental legislation is fundamentally 
flawed. Canada will return to the dark ages of environmental law 
if Bill C-78 passes in its present form''.
<P>
	Other Liberal members, who are now heavyweights in the 
Liberal government, also spoke against Bill C-78 at the time. 
The present Minister of Industry said in the House: ``The 
heritage of Canadians is too important to be left only to the 
provinces. Yet I do not see even a wish on the part of the federal 
government to acknowledge that it has the power to intervene in 
development projects which are going to be environmentally 
harmful. In many regards, this bill is not an appropriate answer 
to the numerous events happening in Canada''.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	This very enlightening statement by the minister shows the 
vision of the provinces the people opposite have. With this 
vision as a basis, no need to look very far to see why Liberals so 
cheerfully promote a centralizing kind of federalism that tends 
to crush and dominate the provinces.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry, a fervent supporter of centralizing 
federalism, was not the only one to attack Bill C-78 at that time. 
His Cabinet colleague, the minister of social program 
reductions, mentioned that his colleagues and his party had 
brilliantly pointed out the flaws of this bill. The legislation was 
no good, he said. At the time, the minister of unemployment cuts 
said that he hoped we would one day have a government that 
would know how to negotiate a new agreement so that federal 
and provincial authorities would share responsibilities for such 
projects.
<P>
	The minister of cuts then said that we should use our 
imagination to find a way to share the responsibility for 
environmental assessments. What a nice wish for the minister to 
express! Unfortunately, his wish did not come true, since his 
Minister of Environment, in her bill and her regulations, 
decided not to share this responsibility with the provinces and 
respect what the provincial governments are already doing, but 
rather to intrude by imposing her own assessment process.
<P>
	I also find it rather funny to see that, back then, the minister of 
education cuts wanted to share responsibilities with the 
provinces, given his action today, his reform proposal and the 
negative reactions he has got so far from the provinces.
<P>
	Finally, the prize for best decrying goes to our dear Minister 
of Finance, the minister of fake Canada-wide consultations. On 
May 29, 1991, he said in this House and I quote: ``Bill C-78 is so 
flawed it will in fact undermine our existing standards for 
environmental assessment''. He added: ``My feeling is that if we 
have to go with Bill C-78 or none, go with none''.
<P>
	Here we have yet another minister who wanted to scrap Bill 
C-78. When you read all the speech he made on May 29, 1991, it 
becomes crystal-clear that the minister of consultation wanted 
more powers for Ottawa. Besides, nowhere in his speech did he 
mention the provinces and their jurisdiction. This speaks 
volumes about the domineering intentions of people across the 
floor.
<P>
	This is what some Liberal members were saying when they 
were on this side of the House. What is so inconsistent and 
indecent in the Liberal position on Bill C-78 is that at the time 
they criticized the bill and the minister, our leader, who 
introduced it but today they commend him for having initiated 
the process.
<P>
	The Liberals, headed by the Minister of Environment, now 
shower praise on our leader but then they hurled the pot at him. 
You are opportunists who change their minds with the weather. 
This opportunistic change of opinion unequivocally confirms 
that Bill C-78 has been so deeply amended that it has nothing to 
do any more with the purpose it was intended to fill at the time. 
Liberals themselves make this abundantly clear. If Liberals, in 
their minds, consider today's Bill C-13 as the equivalent of the 
then Bill C-78, the latter has to have been significantly changed 
to be approved today by the Liberals.
<P>
	This confirms our claims that the act the minister proclaimed 
on October 6, 1994, is totally different from the one that was 
initiated at the time. The bill she has introduced today and the 
act it amends are unacceptable. The minister is predicting a new 
so-called era of co-operation but this is only to impress 
everyone. Far from bearing the stamp of co-operation, this new 
era will be one of centralization and domination by the Liberals.
<P>
	The Canadian government forces this process upon us without 
looking at what is already being done in the provinces and it 
justifies the whole thing with a single bilateral agreement with 
Alberta. This is sufficient for the minister. This single 
agreement gives her the green light to impose her way on all 
other provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8910"> 8910 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, the Canadian government is laying down the law coast 
to coast. Canada is homogeneous, so, for the Liberals, what is 
signed or accepted by one province is good for all the others. 
What bad, simplistic reasoning.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois do not accept that kind of 
standardization from sea to sea. We oppose Bill C-56 and the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and we are not the 
only ones. The federal assessment process infringes on 
provincial jurisdiction and powers. Not only will it create 
duplication and disputes, but it will also subordinate provincial 
processes already in place.
<P>
	Quebec opposes and has always opposed that federal 
assessment process. Since 1990, Quebec has regularly made 
representations on this to the federal government. Before, it was 
through Pierre Paradis, the former Minister of the Environment, 
a federalist Liberal, like the people opposite, and now, it is 
through Jacques Brassard, a member of the separatist Parti 
Quebecois, the present Minister of the Environment. Despite 
their conflicting political positions, those two men denounced 
federal interference in environmental assessment.
<P>
	Pierre Paradis, the former minister and a true hard-line 
federalist, said that the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act was no exception to that dominating and totalitarian 
federalism. Coming from a federalist, that says a lot. He said 
that he saw Bill C-13 as dangerous interference in Quebec's 
affairs by the federal government. He added that Ottawa would 
then be in a position to impose its assessment on any Quebec 
project having an environmental impact. This hard core 
federalist said, and I quote: ``With Bill C-13, the federal 
government is seeking to use all available means to subject the 
largest possible number of projects to the federal assessment 
process and even to control every aspect of the assessment when 
it is carried out by other authorities. The federal process will 
interfere constantly with the provincial process''.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment should understand these comments by his former 
provincial colleague. Moreover, as former Minister of the 
Environment in the National Assembly, the parliamentary 
secretary should pass on Quebec's message to his minister. Was 
he or was he not a member of the same government as Mr. 
Paradis?
<P>
	On November 22, 1991, Mr. Paradis wrote to the minister, 
Jean Charest, who was luckier than his Conservative colleagues 
since he is still with us today. The letter said: ``Far from 
clarifying the situation, Bill C-13 in its present form allows the 
federal assessment process to unnecessarily interfere with 
decisions which are exclusively Quebec's responsibility. This 
will create unproductive duplication of assessment procedures 
and will inevitably lead to numerous disputes''.
<P>
	Quebec's federalist minister said that he wished Ottawa 
would recognize and respect the assessment process put in place 
by the provinces. It seems to me that the message is clear. Mr. 
Paradis told the federal government to mind its own business.
<P>
	All the letters, dozens of them, sent by this hard core 
federalist to the federal minister since 1990 contained the same 
messages. Let me read you a few of them. The minister was 
concerned that the bill would create ``major constitutional 
problems and numerous difficulties in terms of 
implementation''. On another occasion he said ``that the federal 
government was not justified in using the protection of the 
environment as an excuse to interfere in areas under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction''. He also said that, to Quebec, this 
legislation meant that every environmental project would be 
subject to a federal assessment. He was concerned that adding 
the federal process to the provincial process would only create 
costly duplication and delays.
<P>
	Finally, here is what Mr. Paradis was quoted as saying in the 
<I>Journal de Montréal</I> on March 17, 1994: ``We have to 
harmonize the federal and provincial legislation so as to 
establish a single window in the area of environmental 
assessment, Quebec having priority over Ottawa''. And he 
added that: ``Quebec maintains its objective of having its 
jurisdictions protected, of being in charge''. The current Liberal 
minister was there, on March 17, 1994. Why did she not hear and 
take into consideration the claims made by a federalist Quebec 
minister who had been strongly opposed to that legislation since 
1990?
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The new Quebec environment minister, Jacques Brassard, 
reacted scathingly to the promulgation of the Canadian act. Mr. 
Brassard recalled the Quebec representatives from the 
federal-provincial talks and did not show up himself at the 
environment ministers' conference in Bathurst, in early 
November. He said that discussions between the two levels of 
government on harmonizing environmental measures following 
the promulgation of the federal act were a farce, and said: ``We 
are tired of being laughed at''.
<P>
	For Quebec, this legislation means being under trusteeship. 
Mr. Brassard put it even more bluntly: ``This is utterly 
unacceptable to Quebec. This is provocation, a demonstration of 
arrogance and disregard for Quebec''. With this federal 
legislation, developers in Quebec and in other provinces will be 
faced with two assessment processes with different 
requirements. In Quebec, businesses object to this dual 
assessment which will have a disastrous impact on the economy. 
Obviously, businesses will be reluctant to submit their projects, 
because they will not know what to expect from the 
environmental assessments.
<P>
	Why do federal Liberals intrude with such arrogance in this 
area of provincial jurisdiction? They are federalists who, deep 
down, believe in a strong central government.  They think that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8911"> 8911 </A></B>
<P>
Ottawa is where it is at and that the federal government should 
have an overriding role. What else could we expect from them?
<P>
	These people take the ``think globally'' approach in order to 
justify their excessive centralization. Members opposite hold 
the mistaken position that, because water and air know no 
boundaries, their preservation should be the responsibility of a 
big national machine. Who knows, with that kind of thinking, 
they may one day submit to a larger organization or even a world 
organization. Why not?
<P>
	Again I quote Michel Yergeau, from <I>Le Devoir</I> of April 1, 
1992: ``The fact that Ottawa has found something called a 
`global' approach that ignores boundaries is not reason enough 
to shrug off the Constitution. By passing Bill-13, the federal 
government makes an autocratic argument and unilaterally 
settles the dispute, necessarily in its favour''.
<P>
	That environmental law specialist had more sound remarks 
which graphically illustrate the problems the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act will bring. Here is what he says: 
``In order to justify that brutal approach, the federal government 
cloaks itself in the urgent necessity to preserve the environment 
in its own jurisdiction. The net results of that unilateral exercise 
are not good, nor can they be. It should be reconsidered and 
refined. As it now stands, Bill C-13 is a rough draft which will 
have to be refined by the courts on a case by case basis and which 
will only be a source of dissatisfaction for everybody. 
Ultimately, the process will take more time than if we had 
negotiated this issue. On second thought, the federal 
government has just set a time bomb in Canadian legislation. It 
is also a further threat to the constitutional reconciliation so dear 
to the federal government. And it is of no benefit for the 
environment either.'' End of this very enlightening quotation.
<P>
	Please note Mr. Yergeau's last sentence. ``And it is of no 
benefit for the environment either''. You see, Mr. Speaker, the 
environment is an issue which must be dealt with in the field, at 
the community level. But we all know that federal centralism is 
not attuned to what happens at the community level.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Centralized structures are generally and often quite far from 
concrete problems and day to day situations. The environment 
needs efficiency: quick analyses, prompt actions and decisions 
as well as good relations between developers, decision makers 
and the community.
<P>
	However, the minister's proposal is the complete opposite. 
Her process is slow, complicated, cumbersome and creates 
duplication. The environmental and economic repercussions 
will be very important, according to many experts.
<P>
	In the first federal assessments, we will see how developers 
react and what effect the federal process will have on their 
decisions to submit projects. I am sure that they will not like 
being subjected to two environmental assessment processes. 
The federal government's interference in environmental 
assessment will create uncertainty and hesitation. It is 
deplorable that the minister does not seem to pay any attention 
at all to the impact her law will have on projects.
<P>
	In December 1993, Quebec's aluminium industry association 
submitted the following statement to the Quebec minister of the 
environment and wildlife: ``Section 5(1) of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act sets conditions for the 
environmental assessment procedures even though these 
projects could already have been covered by a provincial 
process. . . We fear that duplication. . .will make the process 
more cumbersome without protecting the environment any 
better. This duplication will entail more costs and delays. . 
.developers will pay for this duplication and could very well 
decide to abandon economically beneficial projects''.
<P>
	Is that message not clear enough for the federal minister? The 
environment and the economy will be affected by the federal 
process.
<P>
	Also, last January, the Centre patronal de l'environnement 
wrote to the federal government and said they believed it would 
be very difficult for the federal government to justify the 
implementation of a law that would unduly overlap provincial 
jurisdiction. With all the budgetary restraints, the federal 
government would be better off working in close co-operation 
with the provinces and sharing the fiscal burden, especially for 
this type of assessment where the costs and resources allocated 
will be considerable.
<P>
	The Canadian Electrical Association expressed the same 
opinion in a brief submitted to the subcommittee which recently 
reviewed Bill C-56. I would like to quote three very revealing 
parts of that brief.
<P>
	The first says:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The CEAA, the Canadian Environment Assessment Act, 
contains serious shortcomings which are not addressed by Bill 
C-56. The bill before the subcommittee deals with red book 
commitments but does not look at issues such as jurisdiction and 
proponents' rights. We see the CEAA as an unwitting and 
unnecessary federal intrusion into jurisdictional controversy 
and as leading to more, not less, duplication. Harmonization 
agreements with the provinces will not resolve these 
fundamental flaws''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8912"> 8912 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second one is, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Canadian Electrical Association's objective is to ensure that 
the CEAA operates effectively and efficiently while providing 
the degree of certainty required for project proponents and 
operators. The act, even as amended by Bill C-56, and guided by 
the regulations published recently in the Canada <I>Gazette</I>, Part 
II, does not indicate that the environmental assessment process 
that will emerge will be workable''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And the last one is as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The intent of the act is not to ensure that economic activity 
in resource sectors stops, but that the environmental 
acceptability of projects be examined in a timely and 
appropriate manner to determine if they should proceed. The 
consequence of not having a workable process is that 
investments in projects will dry up. The Fisheries Act requires 
special attention because including this act as a trigger under 
CEAA could create uncertainty for already licensed operating 
facilities''.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Despite its rhetoric on the federation being so efficient, the 
federal government is itself increasing the overlap and 
duplication which add to the administrative costs for 
governments and developers. In the name of federalism and a 
global approach, the government forces its way by imposing its 
process on us, which will create problems and lead to 
unacceptable costs. In the long run, clearly it will not be good 
for the environment and it will hurt the economy.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the federal government is once again 
acting unilaterally and treating the provinces, the developers, 
taxpayers and, of course, the environment with such disrespect.
<P>
	We are all in favour of environmental assessment, but we are 
also in favour of showing respect for the processes already in 
place in the provinces. It is absolutely false to pretend that the 
federal government must make its presence felt for the sake of 
the environment. Quebec was a forerunner in the area of 
environmental assessments in Canada and has shown exemplary 
consistency and thoroughness.
<P>
	The federal approach is even more unacceptable when you 
think that the Quebec process is recognized as one of the best of 
its kind. It is credible, well established and has proven its 
effectiveness. Since 1980, 745 projects have been submitted. 
Two hundred and ninety projects are presently at different stages 
in the process and some 25 major projects are completed every 
year.
<P>
	What more do you want? Why is the federal government 
getting involved in this? Why do they want to duplicate the 
whole process that already exists in Quebec and elsewhere?
<P>
	The federal minister believes that these problems, whether 
current or anticipated, will be settled by signing bilateral 
agreements with the provinces. Fine, but what will happen in the 
case of provinces with which she will not be able to strike a 
bilateral agreement? Has the minister considered this? Does she 
have an alternative for provinces which will not tolerate this 
intrusion by the federal government? The minister is speechless 
on this issue and has no answer. What matters for her is that the 
federal government makes the move, regardless of what the 
provinces want.
<P>
	Since the beginning of my speech, I have often referred to the 
duplication of the assessment process due to federal 
interference in that field. Yet, the Liberals have been telling us 
since October 25, 1993 that they want to eliminate this 
unnecessary and costly duplication. The people opposite are 
quite far from delivering on their fine promises. Their actions 
and decisions are totally contrary to what they say.
<P>
	But, besides duplicating what is already being done in the 
provinces, the Liberals cannot even clean up their own 
backyard. Let us take a serious look at clause 1 of Bill C-56. In 
its first version, that clause said: ``to ensure that responsible 
authorities carry out their responsibilities in a co-ordinated and 
efficient manner with a view to eliminating unnecessary 
duplication in the environmental assessment process''. Hence, 
we could think that the federal government, even though it is 
duplicating provincial processes, wanted to avoid any 
duplication deep down.
<P>
	However, a motion put by the Liberals in sub-committee 
changed that clause. That motion included the words ``to the 
extent possible'' in the clause. The new clause reads as follows: 
``to ensure that responsible authorities carry out their 
responsibilities in a coordinated and efficient manner with a 
view to eliminate, to the extent possible, unnecessary 
duplication in the environmental assessment process''; To the 
extent possible, what nonsense and how ironic. Not only does 
the federal government duplicate provincial processes, but it 
also opens the door to duplication in its own operations.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that, eventually, the taxpayers will 
once again pay the price for that bad decision made by the 
federal government. They will pay twice because their 
environment, as well as the economy, will be affected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	What a mess the federal Liberals are making. How far will 
they go to satisfy their thirst for centralized power in Ottawa?
<P>
	We will vote against this bill.

<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently to the speech by the hon. member for Laurentides. I 
noticed that in her speech she took a shot at our present Minister 
of the Environment on her handling of the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	This is a very peculiar criticism because the present minister 
is the only minister in over two decades who has taken any 
action at all on the Irving Whale. She met with the fishermen and 
residents of Prince Edward Island and Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
.She met with scientists and found the money to remove the 
hazard from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Yet she is under criticism 
because she is actually doing something about this 
environmental hazard.
<P>
	I am curious to know what the hon. member would do. Would 
she remove the <I>Irving Whale</I>? Would she pump it out? Would 
she leave it there? What would she do? She seems to have 
become involved in this project only after the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine got some publicity on it. 
If the minister is not doing a good job on this particular issue, I 
am curious to know what the member would do in her position.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Egmont may not have 
been aware of the fact that at this stage of debate on the bill the 
first three speakers may speak for 40 minutes without question 
or comment afterward. The Chair is therefore obliged to take the 
member for Egmont's question and comment as an intervention 
and not as a question or comment.
<P>
	Does the member for Egmont wish to split his time with the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McGuire:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was listening as usual to my colleague from 
Laurentides who was speaking as usual about duplication and 
overlapping. I do not know what she would do if these words 
were not in her vocabulary.
<P>
	During her speech, she asked quite a surprising question when 
she wanted to know what the federal government was doing in 
this. I wonder, at times, if we are living on the same planet. She 
also talked about centralizing federalism. In the most 
decentralized federal state in the world, perhaps she should have 
a little talk with the German minister of the environment or with 
the director of the American EPA and learn about how things are 
done in federal states.
<P>
	In fact, as I said the other day, perhaps we will have to remind 
her once again that the Supreme Court said that the federal 
government not only has the right to intervene in the 
environment and in environmental assessments, but also has a 
strict duty to do so for all Canadians. I will remind her once 
again that the federal government is responsible for navigable 
waters, for all navigable waters whether they are in Quebec, 
New Brunswick or British Columbia.
<P>
	It is responsible for fisheries throughout the territory and for 
all coastal areas, whether in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, British 
Columbia or the Arctic. All federal lands and all federal 
buildings in Canada are under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	The federal government also has a fiduciary responsibility for 
native peoples and thus for all the lands where native people live 
and have rights. It is responsible for the national harbours and 
ports, airports, the St. Lawrence Seaway, interprovincial and 
international trade and international agreements.
<P>
	What is so unusual for a government with national 
responsibilities to pass a law on environmental assessments for 
whatever comes under its jurisdiction?
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	In fact, this law was written when the opposition leader was 
Minister of the Environment and now, people will try anything 
to demonstrate that it is different. But basically the law is 
exactly the same as it was initially.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to what 
the hon. member for Laurentides had to say. I would ask her to at 
least have the courtesy to remain silent for the time being and let 
me speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> It is untrue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> It is untrue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> In any case, the principle of this bill is identical 
to that of the previous bill introduced by the Leader of the 
Opposition.
<P>
	In fact, in September 1994, only two months ago, in an 
interview with the <I>Gazette</I>, the Leader of the Opposition 
referred to this legislation as ``his baby''. During the 1993 
election campaign, he made a reference to the legislation in an 
interview on <I>Le Point</I>, when he said: ``We must support this 
legislation''. I remember several instances during his previous 
and present mandate when he supported the principle of this bill.
<P>
	One can use quotes to prove anything, but perhaps we should 
also quote what was said by the people of the Quebec centre of 
environmental law who say this legislation is entirely legiti-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8914"> 8914 </A></B>
<P>
mate. Perhaps we should also quote lawyers Michel Bélanger 
and Franklin Gurter, and see what they have to say. Lawyers do 
not all think alike.
<P>
	But the crucial point is that today, yesterday and the day 
before, there have been assessments in areas of joint 
jurisdiction. I explained this to the hon. member for Laurentides 
the other day. I mentioned several cases: the Port of Cacouna, 
the Lachine Canal, the Sainte-Marguerite River. Today, she 
stressed this would be impossible under the present legislation. 
Prove it! In fact, the legislation has an active provision that 
allows for administrative agreements with all the provinces, 
individual agreements under which this kind of joint assessment 
can be done in an entirely normal and active way. So there is 
nothing in this legislation to discourage the kind of joint 
assessment that was done in the past.
<P>
	The government has no intention of interfering with 
provincial environmental assessments. She talks about the 
BAPE as though the BAPE in Quebec were going to disappear. 
She talked about Quebec's environmental assessment process as 
though it would cease to exist. Of course it will continue, as will 
everything else, the same way as in the past. Except that today, 
in accordance with a formal commitment we made during the 
election campaign, in the red book, we decided to proclaim this 
legislation which was initially introduced several years ago and 
then put on the back burner for a number of years, for no good 
reason. So at least we had the courage to proclaim it. From now 
on, all environmental assessments will have to be done on a 
co-operative basis.
<P>
	I think the minister made that quite clear. She got in touch 
with her counterparts, both Mr. Paradis and Mr. Brassard, to 
explain that the federal government did not intend to encroach 
on the provincial government's exclusive jurisdiction, but 
nevertheless, it has certain rights and duties, as ruled by the 
Supreme Court, that must be respected and that include doing 
environmental assessments where necessary. I do not see that as 
an encroachment by centralist federalism and all those big 
words the hon. member for Laurentides mentioned with such 
resentment.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> I see this bothers the members of the Bloc. We 
show them the courtesy of listening to what they have to say, but 
they never show us the slightest courtesy. All they can do is 
shout.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	That did not prevent me from saying what I think, that is that 
there are two sides to a coin. You, of course, would like Canada 
to break up. How could the Bloc Quebecois, the members of the 
Bloc, possibly accept a federal piece of legislation? Surely it is 
unthinkable. Indeed, the member for Laurentides showed her 
bitterness by saying how abysmally ignorant the current 
minister was on the issue. Speaking about the <I>Irwing Whale</I>, she 
invited the minister ``to take a very close look at the matter.'' 
What nerve.
<P>
	In fact, as my colleague said, the current Minister of the 
Environment was the first one-I think there were six before 
her, including the Leader of the Opposition who was responsible 
for the matter for two years and did nothing despite all the mail 
he received-to take action less than three months after she got 
the environment portfolio. Now the member for Laurentides 
who is new to these matters has the nerve to say that the minister 
is abysmally ignorant.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The parliamentary 
secretary's time is up. There are five minutes left for questions 
and comments. The member for Laurentides.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see 
that the truth is hard to take. The member made a speech and did 
not even explain his bill. He simply attacked us while I 
described specific problems that Bill C-56 would create with 
the provinces. And he is perfectly aware of them.
<P>
	Also, the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, having 
himself been a provincial minister of the environment, knows 
all about the BAPE. He knows perfectly well how it works and 
should have advised the minister since he knew that the BAPE 
was managing perfectly well in Quebec. We did not need this 
federal overlap on environmental reviews. To me the member 
has just proven that he is totally blinded by his own partisanship 
and his centralizing idea of federalism.
<P>
	As for the <I>Irving Whale</I>, I was quoting a newspaper when I 
spoke about it a moment ago. I did not make this up. It was 
written by journalists who felt very badly served by the Minister 
of the Environment who did not know the facts at all. So if 
members opposite will not take some criticism and go back and 
do their homework, this government has a problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem with this government 
is that it is taking measures that the hon. member's leader did 
not take for two years with respect to the <I>Irving Whale</I>. Ask your 
leader, when he comes back, what he did about the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	I am not talking about Mr. Bouchard as an individual but as 
the Leader of the Opposition. I would like to ask the hon. 
member who is criticizing the minister if the Leader of the 
Opposition, while he was Minister of the Environment and after 
receiving numerous letters, did anything about the <I>Irving Whale 
</I>when he was responsible for the matter? And you have the gall to 
criticize the minister who, after only three months, did 
something about it!
<P>
	As for the BAPE, I ask the hon. member to prove to the House 
that the BAPE will disappear, that its operations will change 
from what they are now. Indeed, I am in a good position to know 
the BAPE because I established the Lacoste Committee on the 
BAPE in Quebec. I know the BAPE inside out. You will have to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8915"> 8915 </A></B>
<P>
show me how the BAPE will differ from what it is today and why 
it will make fewer evaluations.
<P>
	The BAPE will continue to operate in exactly the same way. 
What we want to do with the act is to maintain what is already 
provided for in the federal guidelines. Nothing will change 
except that there will be an act instead of guidelines. That is all. 
The federal government has very clear jurisdiction, as I 
explained, and that is why we are doing this.
<P>
	How could the PQ and Bloc members, who want to destroy 
this country, agree with a federal piece of legislation? Of course 
you will not support a federal law! Name one other province, 
only one that refuses Bill C-13 today. Name only one. If you 
can, I will support you.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would like to ask members to direct 
their observations to the Chair for reasons which have been 
explained at least a hundred times before. There is about a 
minute left, and we will use it for questions or comments. I 
recognize the hon. member for Frontenac and I ask him to be 
brief.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Of course, Mr. 
Speaker. There is a potential ecological problem which goes 
back almost 25 years. I would like to remind the former Quebec 
minister, who had the environment portfolio at the time, that 
when the <I>Irving Whale </I>sank, she was in so-called international 
waters. The Liberal Party, under Mr. Trudeau, extended our 
jurisdiction to 100 nautical miles and thereby assumed 
responsibility for the wreck.
<P>
	True, the minister reacted positively three months after she 
took over as Minister of the Environment. However, what the 
hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis does not say is that 
from 1970 to 1994, except for nine years of Conservative 
government and nine months under former Prime Minister Joe 
Clark, the environment portfolio was continuously held by the 
Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think that deserves an 
answer. I believe that the actions of the minister speak for 
themselves. She is the first to take concrete measures and the 
first to have the courage to act on this. The actions speak for 
themselves, we do not need any other kind of answer.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. I recognize the hon. 
member for Terrebonne. According to my list, the hon. member 
for Terrebonne should be the next to speak, but if he is not here, 
we could go on to the next speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I might be able to 
explain why the hon. member for Terrebonne is late. I also just 
got in. I had to take Boulevard Métropolitain in Montreal, and 
you know how it is. This morning there was a stalled bus, a bit 
further on a large semi-trailer. All in all, it took me an hour and a 
half longer than usual to reach the Hill.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Here he comes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think that, with unanimous consent, 
we can give the floor to the hon. member who just came in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
excuse my being out of breath, but as my colleague pointed out, 
there are times when one is even more in a rush than normally. I 
want to thank you for having the patience to wait for me. I really 
wanted to speak on Bill C-56. That is why I asked my colleagues 
to give me a hand and let you know that I was coming.
<P>
	However, before I start talking about Bill C-56, in this festive 
season, I would like to say a few words to the people in the 
beautiful riding of Terrebonne. As previously mentioned in this 
House, the riding of Terrebonne is the most beautiful one after 
your own, dear colleagues. I would like to wish my constituents 
a very happy holiday season. I also would like to wish all the 
members of the great Bloc Quebecois family in the riding of 
Terrebonne a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year. I 
want to tell them that, in the coming year, we will have to work 
very hard, and that I look forward to working with them.
<P>
	I now want to address Bill C-56, an act to amend the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act. It should first be pointed out 
that the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment 
meets regularly to harmonize, as much as possible, the various 
environment acts which cause problems between the federal 
government and the provinces.
<P>
	While the provincial ministers are trying to agree on how to 
improve federal-provincial relations on the environment, the 
federal minister tells them: ``You may pursue your useless talks 
on the harmonizing the environmental assessment process, but 
as for me, I will proclaim the CEEA which will immediately be 
amended by Bill C-56 and, in so doing, I will agree to federal 
interference in this area, which will be legitimized as soon as the 
bill is passed''.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	But the minister tells them: ``Go on, continue your 
discussions between provinces, while I put forward the 
so-called flexible federalism''. The subject of flexible 
federalism was raised last Thursday, and my colleague from 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie gave us a definition of flexible 
federalism: it is a federal system in which the federal 
government encroaches on the provinces and the provinces give 
in. Bill C-56 is a case in point.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8916"> 8916 </A></B>
<P>
	This short bill is designed to amend Bill C-13 with just four 
clauses, but these clauses show the federal government's 
intention to interfere in environmental assessment.
<P>
	Logically, the federal government should limit itself to 
environmental assessments of projects for which it is the main 
developer, projects carried out on crown lands or Indian lands 
that require its specific authorization or to which it contributes 
so much that the very project depends on it. That is not the case 
with Bill C-56.
<P>
	With Bill C-13 as amended by Bill C-56, the federal 
government is moving in the opposite direction. It gives itself 
the authority to make assessments in just about any 
circumstance, based on the various criteria prescribed in the 
legislation. This bill, if adopted, that is if Bill C-56 is allowed to 
amend Bill C-13, will result in legal controversy, 
federal-provincial conflict, again, immeasurable cost due to 
overlap, endless delays for the proponents. For developers, it 
will mean loss of contracts, loss of projects, loss of economic 
benefits.
<P>
	Finally, the most deplorable effect this bill will have is 
inadequate environmental protection, because of the 
stubbornness of governments-need I remind you-as it is the 
duty of each to protect its own jurisdiction. Imposing federal 
jurisdiction on the provinces like that is not the way to go. The 
biggest loser in all this will be the environment, the very thing 
we were supposed to be protecting. The primary objective of the 
legislation is nullified by this legislation, this amended 
legislation. How great.
<P>
	I am certainly not saying that it would be easy to determine 
which level of government should have jurisdiction on the 
environment. The constitutional division of environmental 
law-making powers is complex; the Constitution allocates 
certain responsibilities to the provinces and others to the federal 
government.
<P>
	The Canadian Constitution does not give jurisdiction over the 
environment to the federal government or the provinces. When 
legislative powers were divided in 1867, the people and 
Parliament knew very little about the problems of pollution and 
environmental degradation. We must understand that the 
Fathers of Confederation could not include in the Constitution 
matters which were not then of public interest. That is partly 
why this sector is not among the various responsibilities 
assigned to the two levels of government under sections 91 and 
92 of the 1867 Constitution Act.
<P>
	While provincial environment ministers are trying to come to 
an agreement because the Constitution is far from clear on who 
is responsible for what in this area, the minister jumps into the 
fray saying, ``Get out of my way. I am the boss in this matter''.
<P>
	Unfortunately for her, the official opposition is standing 
guard and will not remain silent on a bill like C-56, which will 
undermine the environmental assessment powers of Quebec and 
the other provinces by complementing C-13. It must be pointed 
out that Quebec has its own environmental assessment law, the 
Environment Quality Act. This law was even called one of the 
best in the world and one of the best assessment procedures.
<P>
	With over 20 years of experience in environmental 
assessment, Quebec is way ahead. Why set this aside? Why 
reject this out of hand? Bill C-56 calls into question expertise 
that was acquired two decades ago.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	On many occasions, the federal government has shown its 
interest in the environment. It has put forward principles like 
sustainable development, the fact that the environment knows 
no boundaries, and the national interest. On environmental 
issues, we have also been told about peace, order and good 
government, which are found in section 91. In short, a whole 
slew of arguments that we consider indefensible a priori. We 
have evidence to the contrary.
<P>
	Bill C-13, as amended by Bill C-56, is a real legal hornets' 
nest. As you know, the great majority of legal challenges in this 
field end up in the Supreme Court, which means long delays, and 
except for lawyers, no one wins in these sterile conflicts. Here 
we might recall the dilemma opposing Hydro Québec and the 
Canadian government. I think it is worth giving an example to 
show that it is not easy to meddle so obviously in another's 
environmental jurisdiction.
<P>
	Yes, the dispute arises from the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act and not Bill C-13, but the example could very 
well apply to Bill C-13. The second part concerning toxics is at 
issue but I am sure that the ruling enlightens us on the wrong 
direction taken in Bill C-56. Let me quote you part of the 
sentence handed down by the Quebec Court and upheld by the 
Quebec Superior Court:
<P>
	``Giving the federal government jurisdiction over the 
environment would allow it to infringe on provincial fields of 
jurisdiction. I repeat here those listed by the applicant: Section 
92, subsection 5, public lands belonging to the province; section 
92, subsection 8, municipal institutions; subsection 10, local 
works and undertakings; subsection 13, property and civil 
rights; and, finally, subsection 16, matters of a merely local 
nature''.
<P>
	These are some of the provisions which made these two 
authorities come to the following conclusion: ``I have already 
said that, in my opinion, this section cannot fall under the 
general power of the federal Parliament to make laws for peace, 
order and good government. I am also of the opinion that this 
section cannot fall under the power to legislate criminal law. I 
therefore declare this section-of the Canadian Environmental

Protection  Act-to be ultra vires''. That section of the act 
relating to PCBs and deemed to be ultra vires can have a bearing 
on the whole underlying philosophy of the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	The government, which is not even waiting for the impending 
conclusion of this judgment, now wants to impose an 
amendment which will also be challenged. Who is the 
government trying to please, if not lawyers? We wonder.
<P>
	A court has doubts about the federal authority. The 
government ignores the decision and continues to interfere even 
more, probably in the hope of having its other environmental act 
challenged all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada and see 
that tribunal conclude that it is <I>ultra vires</I>.
<P>
	Why is the government so stubborn? It cannot even fulfill its 
current commitments, yet it keeps asking for more. As you 
know, in spite of the conventions and treaties signed, the Great 
Lakes and the St. Lawrence River are more polluted than ever 
before. In spite of the billions of dollars spent, as mentioned in 
the newspapers last week, acid rain keeps poisoning our forests 
and lakes. In spite of the treaty signed in Rio, Canada has not 
reached its objective of reducing greenhouse gases. And the 
federal government still wants to interfere in a field which falls 
under provincial jurisdiction. We must wonder why the federal 
government wants to interfere in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction when it cannot even adequately carry out its own 
obligations. Tell me why.
<P>
	After all, Canadians and Quebecers will have to foot the bill 
for this. Some would argue that the environment knows no 
boundary, and it is true. We are reminded of that so often that we 
have to wonder why broader international treaties are not 
signed. Yes, we agree that the government has the right to sign 
such agreements, but when it does, it cannot even honour them.
<P>
	In 1992, the federal government became involved in 
promoting sustainable development, but did not meet its 
objectives. This example and all the others I have already given 
show why, with our expertise is Quebec, with a bill like Bill 26 
passed by the Ontario legislature to protect its environmental 
rights, with the environmental agreements reached with Alberta 
and with all the various agreements, we just have to reject Bill 
C-56 that would amend Bill C-13 and create grey areas in 
interpreting the law. Before passing any laws that would raise 
doubts, we must determine who has jurisdiction in this area. I 
think the minister should listen to what the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment has to say.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I urge the House to examine, reconsider and reject Bill C-56.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I only 
want to say that this third reading debate is perhaps the last and 
only opportunity we will have to speak on Bill C-56. The 
Committee on Environment, is touring the country and we 
realized that the bill raises great concerns. Business people and 
provinces are worried and provincial environment departments 
are not sure how this legislation works. All they see is overlap 
and duplication.
<P>
	The message here to Quebec and the other provinces, which 
will have the same problem, is that it will cost an arm and a leg 
to administer. We have to save everywhere, I think, not only in 
the budgets and things like that. All departments must do their 
part to save and reduce the current deficit, and the Department 
of the Environment is no exception.
<P>
	The Department of the Environment should perhaps better 
administer its budget and avoid overlap and duplication of 
services that already exist in other jurisdictions, namely the 
provinces. This bill will not work. It will cause economic and 
legal problems. It will be awful for Canada's and especially 
Quebec's economic development.
<P>
	These are the simple comments I wanted to make.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to thank 
my colleague for her very pertinent remarks concerning Bill 
C-56. As she said in her speech and as I said in mine, the House 
is now aware of the reasons why we do not support this bill. I 
think that the arguments she so eloquently put forward and the 
ones I tried to present to the House myself explain why we have 
to oppose this bill.
<P>
	We agree that the federal government used to be able to 
intervene and conduct an environmental assessment on 
federally owned land in an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
For example, right now, in my riding, the Department of 
National Defence is clearing an army mine field. It laid the 
mines in the first place. In this instance, we cannot ask Quebec 
to allocate funds to clean up a mess for which the Department of 
National Defence is responsible.
<P>
	We are asking the federal government to honour its 
commitments on federally owned land. But we are being told in 
this bill that the federal government will be able to assess 
projects if it made any kind of investment, issued a licence, or 
had anything at all to do with them. In other words, the federal 
government will be able to subject any projects proposed by a 
province to an environmental assessment. We believe that this 
bill will lead to countless legal disputes and that is why we 
cannot support it.
<P>
	I thank the member for Laurentides for her comments which 
are in total agreement with what I said earlier.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
despite his late arrival, I congratulate my colleague, the member 
for Terrebonne, on his speech. As we say on the Beaupré coast, 
he landed on his feet.
<P>
	I quote from an article under the heading ``Oil covered young 
hooded seal found alive in Madgalen Islands'', published 
Thursday, December 8 in <I>Le Soleil</I> from Quebec City, because a 
few minutes ago, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
the Environment bragged that his government acted quickly to 
refloat the <I>Irving Whale</I>. I quote <I>Le Soleil</I>: ``Olivier, the 
veterinarian, mentioned the barge <I>Irving Whale</I> whose vents 
leak oil and which the federal Minister of the Environment 
refused to plug, saying that the leaks did not have much impact 
on the environment''. I would like to know what my colleague 
from Terrebonne thinks of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans. I tried to land on my feet, 
but I am not in total agreement with him. Granted, the 
environment minister did decide quickly that something had to 
be done. Except that her decision was that something should be 
done in five, ten or fifteen years-we shall see.
<P>
	She was quick to say something should be done, but she will 
not move as quickly to get things done. We should be able to 
agree on that. Is the <I>Irving Whale</I> involved in all this? Yes, 
obviously. In other words, the only thing the minister has done 
so far is to acknowledge that there is a problem with the <I>Irving 
Whale</I>. We could congratulate her on that, but I think just about 
anybody could recognize that problem.
<P>
	She told us she will probably refloat the barge, and that she 
will probably do it very soon. In Liberal terminology, ``very 
soon'' means we will have to wait for quite a while. Are we 
justified in asking questions about the refloating of the <I>Irving 
Whale</I>? Yes. At this very moment, as my colleague from 
Laurentides told us, there are oil leaks in that area.
<P>
	Recently, dead ducks have been reported in that area. They 
have been killed by oil leaking from the <I>Irving Whale</I>. There is 
also the seal issue which my colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans just mentioned, and many 
more environmental problems that have a terrible impact. Every 
day that goes by has catastrophic consequences in that area, and 
if one decision should be made quickly, it is to solve the problem 
immediately.

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

<P>
	As you may have been briefed, I discussed with my hon. 
critics from both the Bloc and the Reform Party in seeking 
unanimous consent this morning at report stage to introduce an 
amendment on clause 20 which would have the effect on those 
individuals who are currently in federal penitentiaries who 
would be deportable at the end of their term, that they not be 
given consideration for either day parole or unescorted 
temporary absences. It would seem illogical that individuals 
who upon completion of their term were to be deported should 
be moved back into the Canadian community.
<P>
	I seek unanimous consent so that that may be added to the list 
of clauses that will be debated at report stage.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, my understanding is that 
this motion was ruled to be beyond the terms of the bill. As

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill C-44 to amend the Immigration 
Act and the Citizenship Act and to make a consequential 
amendment to the Customs Act went through first reading in the 
House of Commons on June 17, 1994. It was passed at second 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8920"> 8920 </A></B>
<P>
reading on September  27 with our support, because we 
supported the principle of this bill, and was then referred to the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	The committee tabled its report on December 8, after hearing 
several organizations concerned with this bill. It is a very 
complex and highly technical bill. We moved several 
amendments and the Speaker grouped them into five main 
motions for debate.
<P>
	The first debate deals with the issue of the powers of senior 
immigration officers, or SIO, as they are called in the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration. The main clauses 
relating to the powers of the senior immigration officer are 
clauses 4 and 19 of Bill C-44. These already very wide powers 
are being considerably increased with respect to the exclusion of 
refugee status claimants at Canadian borders or entry points.
<P>
	Another clause relating to powers has been included in Bill 
C-44 and would give the senior immigration officer the 
authority to issue a warrant for the arrest of people who do not 
show up for an examination or inquiry.
<P>
	Clause 19 of Bill C-44 says that a warrant for the arrest of any 
person may be issued where a decision is to be made pursuant to 
subsection 27(4), that is administrative removal.
<P>
	Section 103(<I>i</I>) of the Immigration Act states that a warrant for 
the arrest and detention may be issued against any person where 
an examination or inquiry is to be held and where there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that the person poses a danger to 
the public or would not appear for the examination or inquiry.
<P>
	Clause 19 of Bill C-44 amends section 103 of the 
Immigration Act so that a warrant for arrest may be issued 
against any person where a decision is to be made by the senior 
immigration officer. That warrant for arrest may be served by 
the police so that the person is forced to appear.
<P>
	My amendment would ensure that a notification to appear or 
to attend would be sent before any warrant for arrest is issued. I 
believe that we must add this notification as a prerequisite in the 
bill.
<P>
	The bill gives too much authority to the senior immigration 
officer who already has enough. We must prevent unnecessary 
and arbitrary arrests, particularly since this arrest warrant is not 
issued by a judge, as it normally is in all democratic societies, 
but by a civil servant.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Often, people cannot appear because they changed address 
and did not get the notification. Sometimes the civil servant's 
computer did not take in the person's new address. Those are my 
comments on the power to issue warrants for arrest.
<P>
	Let us now briefly analyze the additional power given to the 
senior immigration officer, who would have the authority to 
exclude some persons at the border or point of entry. As things 
now stand, the senior immigration officer has a specific and very 
wide jurisdiction. He may make an exclusion order for anyone 
arriving at the Canadian border. At the present time, if the senior 
immigration officer receives a person who does not come under 
his jurisdiction, he must order an inquiry and refer the case to an 
adjudicator.
<P>
	With Bill C-44, the minister wants to change that and 
significantly increase the powers of the senior immigration 
officer. He wants to allow this person to make exclusion orders, 
even outside his jurisdiction, and this is unacceptable. This 
means that the senior immigration officer can, if he is convinced 
that the case does not warrant an inquiry, refuse entry, at the 
border, to someone who might need Canada's protection.
<P>
	We totally disagree with clause 4 of Bill C-44, for various 
reasons. The bill is not consistent. On the one hand, it says that 
some cases do not come under the jurisdiction of senior 
immigration officers, but on the other, it allows these same 
officers to make exclusion orders without inquiry, and this is 
serious.
<P>
	If the government wants fair and consistent legislation, it 
should say that when a case is processed by a senior immigration 
officer who does not have jurisdiction, it must be referred to the 
adjudicator for an inquiry. The adjudicator is a civil servant who 
is supposed to be impartial. Senior immigration officers have 
less expertise and less understanding of the laws and regulations 
than adjudicators.
<P>
	Ever since the 1985 Supreme Court decision in the Singh case, 
every person in Canada, not only Canadian citizens or landed 
immigrants, is protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
In order to have a fair and just system, there must be an inquiry 
whenever the situation is not clear, in particular in those cases 
which do not come under the jurisdiction of the senior officer.
<P>
	The Supreme Court also said that the possible costs of such an 
inquiry on certain refugees do not constitute a reasonable 
justification to limit this right. According to the Supreme Court, 
the fact that the government deems an inquiry to be too 
expensive is not a good enough reason to deprive someone of the 
right to have one.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Other clauses of the bill give considerably more power to 
public officials and I will get back to that later. For instance, 
customs officers will be allowed to search international mail, 
examine documents, and in some cases, immigration officers 
will be able to seize those documents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8921"> 8921 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, for all these reasons, we are opposed to this 
considerable increase in the authority of senior immigration 
officers. Under the circumstances, we believe that the status 
quo is fairer and more just. This is why we presented our motion 
to amend Bill C-44.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be brief. The motions being offered in amendment by my 
hon. colleague from the Bloc would thoroughly gut this bill.
<P>
	We oppose the amendments, not because we support the bill. 
While the bill is unenforceable and poorly thought out, its intent 
is acceptable. These amendments would have the effect of 
removing even the good intent of the bill.
<P>
	Specifically the amendments remove the authority of senior 
immigration officers dealing with removals and deportations. 
They take away authority from the minister and deputy minister 
to apply removal law to visitors in Canada.
<P>
	In short, my colleagues in the Bloc want the status quo in 
immigration or less than status quo. They do not want to see a 
change in refugee policy but I believe the Bloc does not speak 
for Canadians in this area. They do not think that Canada's 
immigration law needs to be toughened up. Needless to say, we 
disagree. Therefore we oppose these amendments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I speak to the 
amendments tabled under group one, I would like to thank the 
Bloc as well as the Reform Party for permitting the House to add 
to the list of motions the amendment that I will be speaking to 
later with respect to day parole and release.
<P>
	Of the amendments in group one, the principal one is Motion 
No. 3. All others in group one are a consequence of MotionNo. 3.
<P>
	The current situation is that when a person contravenes the 
Immigration Act on more than one ground, a senior immigration 
officer cannot issue a removal order and must go to an inquiry. 
We are not trying to seek more power for the immigration officer 
for the sake of power or we are not trying to seek to block the 
entry of legitimate immigrants or legitimate refugee claimants.
<P>
	On the contrary, we are trying to apply some common sense 
and some efficiency to the system. For example, if an individual 
comes to the border and has an inappropriate visa or an 
inappropriate passport that individual is blocked from coming 
into the country. Or if an individual in the country has 
overstayed his or her visit, the immigration officer is permitted 
to ask that individual to be removed from Canada.
<P>
	The complications under the current legislation come into 
play if the individual who has the wrong passport or the wrong 
visa also has a serious violation against the  Immigration Act, let 
us say a conviction of some sort. Then the immigration officer, 
because of the serious allegation, cannot move out the 
individual based on the lesser one of the two violations. We are 
trying to correct this area in the legislation which, quite frankly, 
does not make sense.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	If the person has two violations, one minor and one more 
serious, why can the immigration officer not move out the 
individual based on the lesser of the two offences? He could do 
so if the individual only had one minor charge.
<P>
	Presently the senior immigration officer cannot move out the 
individual because of the serious charge. A serious charge 
requires an inquiry. We are attempting to clarify and render the 
system more efficient.
<P>
	If there is a lesser contravention and a more serious 
contravention of the act we do not push an inquiry needlessly 
because, if the legislation would permit it, it would allow an 
officer to remove the individual on the lesser of two charges. 
Ultimately the serious charge would probably render the person 
removable anyway.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Are his remarks being directed at the 
motion that by unanimous consent is to be voted on later? Do I 
misunderstand? If he is speaking to that issue, it will be dealt 
with later.
<P>
	We are now dealing with the issues presented by the hon. 
member for Bourassa. I would ask the minister to direct his 
comments if he would only at the matters before the House now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due respect that is exactly 
what I am doing. I am speaking to the first group of 
amendments. I am not talking about the day parole or the 
unattended escort. That I know will be debated at the very end. I 
am debating the motion put forward by the Bloc which would 
not allow the senior immigration officer to remove an individual 
with two contraventions but would have to move the person 
through an inquiry.
<P>
	We should try to make the system more efficient. Yes, an 
individual must be given full rights under the law but where 
there has been a contravention of the act I do not think an 
individual should be permitted to stay just because there are two 
contraventions. If there was one minor contravention that 
individual would have been removed. I do not see the logic of 
the current legislation. That is why I oppose the series of 
amendments in group one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to talk about the motions introduced by my colleague 
for Bourassa. Of course I will not list them all. I would simply 
like to say that the motions which are being debated seek to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8922"> 8922 </A></B>
<P>
amend Bill C-44, and in particular clause 3(2) and (4.01) and, of 
course, the corresponding references.
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the general 
scope of those motions, particularly with respect to subsection 
(4.01), which confers a wider jurisdiction to the senior 
immigration officer at the expense of the adjudicator and this 
transfer of authority seems unjustified to us.
<P>
	Indeed senior immigration officers who are in fact officials of 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration would be given 
greater powers at the expense of the fair treatment provided for 
by the quasi-judicial mechanism, that is, the power of the 
adjudicator.
<P>
	Subsection (4.01) confers and re-inforces what was already 
provided for in the act, namely the concept of expeditious 
justice without any procedural guarantees and without the 
presence of a lawyer or a counsellor.
<P>
	Besides being authorized to make exclusion orders against 
certain persons already referred to in section 19 of the act, under 
Bill C-44, the senior immigration officer will be allowed to 
make an exclusion order against all classes of inadmissible 
persons, to order an inquiry and to allow such persons to leave 
Canada forthwith.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Obviously, in our opinion, the government is slowly 
dismantling the arbitration structure for the benefit of its 
officials. We should be concerned about that and reject the 
measures proposed to that end. This is the precise purpose of the 
motions that the hon. member for Bourassa explained so well.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 13</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-44, in Clause 12, be amended by replacing line 21, on page 11, with 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 14</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-44, in Clause 12, be amended by adding after line 23, on page 11, 
the following new section:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``12.1 The Act is amended by adding the following after subsection 53(1):</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(1.1) Paragraphs (1)(<I>a</I>) to (<I>d</I>) do not apply to a person</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) who was admitted to permanent residence in Canada before attaining the age of 
ten years where it is demonstrated that the person has no emotional or other ties to the 
country to which it is proposed the person be removed, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) who has been admitted to permanent residence in Canada and has resided in 
Canada for ten years or more since being admitted.''.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the second group of motions being 
debated concerns the deportation of permanent residents who 
have been convicted of an offence for which a term of 
imprisonment of ten years or more may be imposed. Clause 12 
of Bill C-44 describes the circumstances under which 
convention refugees may be removed.
<P>
	The bill provides that any person who has been convicted of 
an offence under any act of Parliament for which a term of 
imprisonment of 10 years or more may be imposed may be sent 
back to his or her country of origin. Maximum terms of ten years 
or more are handed out for offences, many of which are listed in 
the Criminal Code, such as use of a forged passport, theft 
exceeding $1,000, unauthorized use of a computer, 
counterfeiting stamps, and so on.
<P>
	Clause 12 does not differentiate between serious or major 
crimes and minor crimes that have no serious consequences for 
Canadian society. In other words, the bill does not take into 
account the actual duration of the sentence imposed on an 
individual for a given offence. This amendment will prevent 
potential injustices that would result from the application of this 
provision.
<P>
	Our amendment will prevent individuals who committed 
minor offences from being sent back to their country of origin. It 
ensures that the bill recognizes the seriousness of the offences in 
question and the actual duration of the sentence imposed on 
permanent residents convicted of offences considered serious.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8923"> 8923 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	We think that the maximum sentence should be reduced from 
ten years to two and that only the actual duration instead of the 
maximum sentence should count.
<P>
	Our second amendment to this clause is to prevent the 
deportation of permanent residents who have resided in Canada 
for a long time.
<P>
	As it stands, the bill does not provide any protection to 
permanent residents established in Canada for a long time who, 
therefore, have little or no emotional ties to their country of 
origin. This is presently the case of many people in Canada.
<P>
	Let us not forget that there are many people in Canada who 
have been living here for many years without having acquired 
Canadian citizenship. Some residents do not want to lose their 
original citizenship while others are not even aware that they are 
not Canadian citizens because they were admitted to Canada 
when very young.
<P>
	Our amendments will protect these people's most 
fundamental rights. As a result, those admitted to permanent 
residence in Canada before attaining the age of 10 years and 
those who have resided in Canada for 10 years or more are 
exempted from this section.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Liberal majority on the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration did not take into 
consideration the numerous contributions and recommendations 
proposed by the organizations and individuals who appeared 
before the committee. They were very concerned about this 
situation, and we deplore the fact that although this majority on 
the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration invited 
organizations and individuals from across Canada, the 
committee and the Liberal majority did not take into 
consideration their very worthwhile contributions to the 
committee's discussions.
<P>
	Many of the briefs, particularly the one from the Quebec 
immigration lawyers' association, suggest creating a 
non-deportable class. Our amendments, in this motion, reflect 
this concern which we share entirely.
<P>
	We also tabled this amendment because of family 
considerations. You may have heard of the European 
Convention on Human Rights. There is a European Commission 
of Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights has 
ruled that deportation orders interfere with the law and with 
respect for family life under section 8 of the convention, arguing 
that it must be demonstrated that government decisions likely to 
restrict family rights are necessary in a democratic society, that 
is, justified by a very sound social need, and that these 
restrictions must be proportional to the legitimate objective 
sought.
<P>
	We think that this provision of Bill C-44 goes against all the 
precedents established by the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Canada contracted obligations that are largely similar to the 
European Convention on Human Rights when it ratified the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Canada 
has always maintained that sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian 
Charter protect the rights of families.
<P>
	In April 1994, we received a report from Waldman and Davis 
called ``The Quality of Mercy''. This bill in general and 
especially the provisions concerning individuals punishable by 
a jail term of ten years or more are not at all in keeping with this 
quality of mercy or with the legal precedents established in 
other countries. On the contrary, it violates existing provisions 
that have been accepted in other democratic societies. I do not 
think that the bill reflects the quality of mercy suggested in the 
report by Waldman and Davis.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my intervention will be very brief.
<P>
	In speaking to Motions Nos. 13 and 14 concerning the 
conditions of expulsion I believe members of the Bloc 
Quebecois Party fail to understand what the Canadian people 
have been saying. Canadians have been putting pressure upon 
not only the government but upon representatives to Parliament 
like myself.
<P>
	As the member representing the Bloc speaks, it would seem 
we are talking about dealing with people who broke regulations 
and failed to understand the seriousness of what may have 
happened and their situation in Canada.
<P>
	As we look at the bill these are matters of serious intent. The 
bill is attempting to deal with excluding people from Canada 
who have committed serious offences. These motions in 
amendment would erode the intent of the bill. Members of the 
Reform Party are in favour of much of the bill, but we have great 
difficulty with the inability of enforcement. For that reason we 
will be opposing the bill as a whole but we have no intention of 
weakening the content. We are therefore opposing these two 
motions.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suppose during third 
reading we will be able to debate the whole question of the 
position of the Reform Party. It is supporting the intent of the 
bill in many clauses but voting against it because there is an 
assumption or preposition that somehow the intent will not be 
realized. That is probably better suited for third reading debate.
<P>
	I will address the two motions under the second group. They 
would seek to change clause 12 of Bill C-44. It is unfair to 
suggest, as the Bloc critic has done, that the committee was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8924"> 8924 </A></B>
<P>
blind or deaf to a number of the representations made with 
respect to clause 12. There was introduced at committee stage an 
amendment that  would seek to clarify the intent and the purpose 
of Bill C-44.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Clause 12 suggests the following: When there are execution 
or removal orders against certain residents who have committed 
certain crimes, we are trying to suggest that individuals who 
have committed the crime may be punishable by 10 years or 
more as well as having received a certificate from the minister 
or his or her designate based on the seriousness of the crime.
<P>
	When you get a certificate essentially there are four 
categories to that crime, either the violence of the crime, crimes 
related to sexual assault, crimes related to weapons charges and 
crimes related to drug peddling and the importation of drugs. 
When a certificate is given to an individual for those serious 
crimes that are punishable by 10 years or more we are 
suggesting not only that we have the ability to remove an 
individual but to also remove the humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds from the IAB and move that over to the 
department.
<P>
	The Bloc amendment would amend that thinking to 
individuals who have been sentenced to a period of 
imprisonment of two years or more. The effect of that 
amendment would restrict the government's ability to remove 
those individuals and would push more of the emphasis to our 
courts. I think it has to be stated quite openly that many 
individuals who have committed a crime punishable by 10 years 
or more in the end receive much less than the two years which is 
the threshold being suggested by my hon. friend in the Bloc.
<P>
	I think we should try to keep the focus on immigration as 
opposed to moving it squarely over to the court system. A 
number of decisions for a variety of reasons such as plea 
bargaining or keeping the person in a provincial prison would 
assume less than two years rather than two years or more 
because that is the threshold at which time the person would be 
in a federal penitentiary, are reasons why the judge may say less 
than two years so that the person may be kept at a provincial 
penitentiary for a variety of reasons. There are other concerns 
that the court system may recognize that do not account for 
immigration concerns.
<P>
	The amendment would not only lessen the threshold to a very 
low threshold, which I think is unfair if the person has 
committed a serious crime and has been certificated as being a 
danger to the public based on those four categories, but it would 
also shift the onus of these individuals on to the court system 
which I think would be a mistake and which would render 
immigration arguments certainly secondary to other arguments 
that the judge may feel quite legitimate nonetheless. I believe 
that it would be a mistake on our part if we were to support 
Motion No. 13.
<P>
	The second amendment would try to amend the same clause 
and try to define in law who may be deported or who may not. 
The Bloc has suggested that permanent residents before the age 
of 10 and who have no ties to their country of origin not be 
subject to deportation. They also say that anyone who has been a 
permanent resident for over 10 years, regardless of the crime, 
may not be deported.
<P>
	I have difficulty with this on two fronts. First, when the Bloc 
suggests a person before the age 10, why 10? What if the person 
were nine or eleven or twelve? It is arbitrary. To put arbitrarily 
arrived at figures in law I would suggest is very restrictive. I do 
not think it would be the appropriate thing to do. I do not know 
how the Bloc arrived at the age of 10, but I do not think we 
should have laws that restrict our ability to remove individuals 
who face serious crimes based on an arbitrary figure or 
individuals who have been here more than 10 years.
<P>
	The Bloc is saying if you are here more than 10 years you are 
considered perhaps to be more of a citizen. What if an individual 
clocks in at nine years in this country?
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Is the Bloc therefore agreeing that regardless of the crime the 
person who spent nine years is not worthy of that compassionate 
consideration, but someone who stayed here an extra 12 months 
would be? I think that is the area that is going to constitute many 
problems if we put those arbitrary figures into legislation.
<P>
	I think it would be more appropriate that those kinds of 
considerations be dealt with under humanitarian and 
compassionate reasoning where there is the flexibility to 
concern ourselves with rather than writing it into law.
<P>
	Second, and fundamentally flawed, is the thinking that 
somehow the years of residence in one's country at all times, if 
we accept this amendment, outweighs the seriousness of the 
crime. I do not think we should accept that kind of reasoning. 
What I think Canadians are saying is that we are trying to seek an 
equitable balance.
<P>
	We are not saying that immigration equals criminality, for 
goodness sake. We are not saying that. We are saying that there 
are the few who make it difficult for the many, and that we have 
to zero in on the few so that we can protect the many, and zero in 
on the few so that we can protect the integrity of the system.
<P>
	If we accept the amendments of the Bloc, then we are saying 
that according to the arbitrary figure of 10, that supersedes any 
criminal activity in this country. Instead, I believe it is the 
reverse. There are certain crimes that are absolutely repugnant. 
If the landed resident was here 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, it 
still does not give that person the right to simply dismiss a 
serious crime against young children, or murder, or an 
aggravated sexual assault that turns people's stomachs. We 
should not simply rest on the case that just because the person 
has been here 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8925"> 8925 </A></B>
<P>
for 10 years that the crime is all of a sudden forgotten. We have 
to stand up for certain values and send certain signals.
<P>
	That is where I think putting the arbitrary figure of 10 into law 
creates more problems than it solves. I believe that those 
considerations should be under humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds and not the letter of the law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in spite 
of the explanations provided by the minister, I think it is 
important to reiterate the objectives of the motions to which the 
hon. member for Bourassa referred earlier.
<P>
	The purpose of Motions Nos. 13 and 14 tabled by the Bloc 
Quebecois to amend Bill C-44 is twofold. Motion No. 14 would 
add two categories of individuals to the list of those who cannot 
be deported for criminal behaviour. Motion No. 13 would amend 
Bill C-44 to take into account the seriousness of the crimes 
committed and the sentences actually handed down to 
permanent residents.
<P>
	Let us first look at Motion No. 14. Paragraph (<I>a</I>) seeks to 
exclude from the deportation process persons who were 
admitted to permanent residence in Canada before attaining the 
age of ten years, where it is demonstrated that the persons have 
no emotional, family or other ties to their country of origin.
<P>
	Some permanent residents arrived in Canada as children. For 
all sorts of reasons, these people never sought to obtain 
Canadian citizenship. Now, they are adults and work here; they 
also have a family here, but no longer in their country of origin. 
These people are, in essence, Canadians or Quebecers. We think 
that sending them back to their country of origin makes no sense 
and is inhumane.
<P>
	These people grew up in Canada and developed their talents, 
as well as their flaws, here. They are a product of Canadian 
society. It would be too easy to get rid of criminals by sending 
them back to their country of origin, which they left as young 
children. Moreover, deportation could be too harsh a sentence 
for the offence committed. Not only would these people have to 
serve a sentence for their crime or crimes, but they would also 
have to keep living abroad afterwards, far from their family and 
friends, in a country which is often foreign to them.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Second, the Bloc Quebecois is proposing an amendment to 
paragraph (<I>b</I>) so that permanent residents who have resided in 
Canada for ten years or more cannot be removed from Canada. 
This addition is similar to the other amendments and would 
make Bill C-44 more compassionate for people who have been 
in Canada for a long time.
<P>
	By adopting this amendment from the Bloc Quebecois, 
Canada would not be the first country to act this way. For 
example, Australia which is often compared to Canada because 
of its British tradition and liberal immigration policies, already 
has legislation in this area. Hence, children who settled in 
Australia before they were  ten years old cannot be sent back to 
their country of origin.
<P>
	France's immigration policy is reputed to be much more 
restrictive than ours. However, it has passed legislation to 
prevent immigrants who have been permanent residents for 
more than ten years from being expelled.
<P>
	The government must go beyond partisanship and go along 
with the Bloc. For compassionate and humanitarian 
considerations, we must amend Bill C-44 and pass Motion No. 
14.
<P>
	We must also amend the bill by adopting Motion No. 13. To 
determine the seriousness of the crime, the actual sentence must 
be taken into consideration, and not only the maximum penalty 
for a particular type of offence.
<P>
	In its current form, Bill C-44 only takes into account the 
nominal sentence, that is the maximum penalty for the type of 
offence committed, and not the sentence imposed by the judge. 
Indeed, even though under the Criminal Code a term of 
imprisonment of ten years may be imposed for a particular 
offence, the principles of sentencing are applied by the courts in 
determining the sentence.
<P>
	For example, a person convicted of breaking into a private 
residence can receive a life sentence. Offences such as aiding 
and abetting the issuance of fraudulent credit cards are 
punishable by a ten-year sentence and could justify the 
deportation of the accused.
<P>
	In our legal system, sentences are generally much less severe 
than the maximum sentence. In some cases, it may not be a term 
of imprisonment or a fine, but only a suspended sentence, 
probation or community work. A person could therefore receive 
a very light sentence and still be forced to leave the country.
<P>
	Moreover, if our amendment is not adopted, this provision of 
Bill C-44 could violate the Geneva Convention. The manual of 
High Commissioner for Refugees says, and I quote: ``With 
regard to the nature of the crime presumed to have been 
committed, all relevant factors, including extenuating 
circumstances, must be considered''.
<P>
	Bill C-44 must reflect these remarks. We must adopt the 
amendment before us to avoid legal complications. The 
Canadian government cannot refuse to take into account the 
actual sentence imposed, which is indicative of the seriousness 
of the crime.
<P>
	As for the sentence of two years less one day, everybody 
knows that it is the cut-off point for sentences served in a 
provincial penitentiary and those served in a federal institution. 
In Canada, the courts consider the nature of the crime before 
imposing a term of imprisonment of two years or more. In our 
legal system, there is a clear difference between a sentence of 
two years or more and a sentence of less than two years in terms 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8926"> 8926 </A></B>
<P>
of the seriousness of the crime. Our amendment reflects this 
legal reality.
<P>
	I encourage all members to vote in favour of Motions No. 13 
and 14 for simple common sense reasons. As we have just seen, 
the purpose of Motion No. 13 is to take into account the actual 
sentence imposed by the judge and not only the maximum 
sentence of ten years for certain types of crimes. As for Motion 
No. 14, it is designed to prevent the deportation of de facto 
Canadians.

	She said: Mr. Speaker, just a few days after his appointment as 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, the present minister 
said in an interview with <I>La Presse</I> that he wanted a system with 
as little political intervention as possible. He added that in the 
judicial system, for instance, there was no political intervention. 
Once a judgment was made, that was it. He also said that he 
wanted to reduce political intervention and felt that a stronger 
appeal mechanism would be the answer.
<P>
	However, a year later, we have Bill C-44, which in our 
opinion does the exact opposite of what the minister said he 
wanted to do, in November 1993. This bill puts excessively 
centralized powers in the hands of the minister and his officials.
<P>
	During the hearings of the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration, we heard this confirmed by many 
agencies. Bloc Quebecois amendments for deleting clauses 13 
and 25 of Bill C-44 were supported by the Canadian bar 
association, the Canadian council for refugees, the Quebec 
immigration lawyers' association and the refugee lawyers 
association, for instance.
<P>
	The present legislation allows permanent residents convicted 
of an offence for which a term of imprisonment of 10 years or 
more may be imposed to appeal to the Immigration Appeal 
Division. This appeal may be invoked to quash a deportation 
order or to stay execution of such an order on compassionate 
grounds.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Maintaining clauses 13 and 15 which reinforce the minister's 
powers of political intervention means that the minister and 
members of this House will be constantly asked to review 
immigration cases on compassionate grounds.
<P>
	We are well aware of the pressures on elected representatives 
and especially on the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
Public opinion, exacerbated and conditioned by a few 
sensational cases and the media's coverage of then, and, of 
course, political pressure from countries we do not want to 
offend for commercial or economic reasons are just a few 
examples.
<P>
	Because of these pressures, it is easy to imagine what kind of 
decisions will be made: decisions based on a set of subjective, 
unpredictable factors that will vary from case to case, despite 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8927"> 8927 </A></B>
<P>
their similarities. Are we prepared to take that risk? Certainly 
not. The system already lacks credibility. Why make it worse?
<P>
	We can expect another problem if the new legislation is not 
amended. As we know, immigration officials no longer meet 
clients in their offices and no longer answer telephone calls 
directly. Unfortunately, all processing of immigration files has 
been centralized, and regional offices are now an empty shell. 
To politicize the process will deprive immigrants and their 
relatives of the opportunity to talk with the officers in charge of 
making decisions which will be critical for them.
<P>
	Moreover, as was pointed out in the Auditor General's report 
in 1990, the Davis-Waldman report and by many public 
servants, there is an obvious lack of training among immigration 
officers. This may seriously jeopardize the fairness of the 
process.
<P>
	We cannot endorse this desire to centralize and politicize the 
immigration decision-making process .Decisions will be made 
behind closed doors. Generalists lacking the necessary training 
would make the decisions now made by specialists. There is no 
guarantee that, under these conditions, in similar cases, 
decisions will not be different and therefore inconsistent. Why 
trivialize these decisions by turning them into administrative 
decisions whereas, at the present time, they are quasi-judicial 
and based on case law with a proven track record?
<P>
	Moreover, Bill C-44 proposes that the immigration minister 
become a new court and replace the IRB when it comes to the 
evaluation of risks. Thus the minister would become party to 
every case before the appeal division. Is it because he recently 
lost certain cases that the minister now wants to give himself 
new powers?
<P>
	Moreover, under clause 14 of Bill C-44, the government 
wants to give the minister the right to appeal to the appeal 
division any decision made by an adjudicator. The current act 
provides for the minister to appeal only in two specific cases, 
when a person was found admissible or not deportable. None of 
the arguments presented by the government as to why the act 
should be amended to allow the minister to interfere with the 
decisions made by the adjudicator has convinced us.
<P>
	The government is interfering with the whole process. There 
does not seem to be any more limit on the type of appeal the 
minister may launch against a decision made by an adjudicator. 
This is another blatant example of the minister interfering with 
and taking over the appeal division operations.
<P>
	Let us make sure that the wishes expressed last year by the 
minister, and with which we totally agree, are respected. Let us 
minimize political interference in the immigration process. It is 
in the spirit and for that purpose that the official opposition has 
moved these amendments. Let the IRB Appeal Division do its 
job and keep the minister and bureaucrats out of this 
quasi-judicial process, which still needs to be improved.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	For all these reasons, clause 13 and 15 should be eliminated 
and replaced by sections 70 and 77 of Bill C-86, now in force.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again very briefly, we oppose these amendments.
<P>
	As I said before this bill is unenforceable. The specifics of 
this bill have been roundly criticized by all witnesses before the 
standing committee, albeit from different philosophical points 
of view. The direction the bill takes, that is to toughen up 
immigration law to protect Canadians and to make the 
department of immigration more accountable is acceptable to 
my party. In fact my party has pushed for changes in this 
direction. However, this bill as written will not result in real 
change. It will only result in an increased backlog with no 
additional enforcement staff. The intent is there but the means 
are lacking.
<P>
	The Bloc amendment would remove the intent of the bill. That 
we cannot support.
<P>
	My party is opposed to these amendments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two motions are trying to do 
two different things. I will take them one at a time.
<P>
	The toughest decision with respect to Bill C-44 was to try to 
respond as best we could as a government to public concern. In 
trying to size it up correctly the public is very much in favour of 
newcomers coming to this country and joining in the building of 
this very exciting place called Canada. That has been part of our 
country's history and should remain part of the nation building 
exercise for many years to come.
<P>
	The public has concern when there is no sense of balance. An 
overwhelming number of people come here as immigrants and 
refugees and play things by the book. They contribute. They 
sacrifice. They bleed just like anybody else. Then there are the 
few who come to Canada with very different intentions. They 
break the law in a serious way and then flaunt it through the 
system. That is what irks Canadians.
<P>
	As the minister and a member of Parliament and as a 
Canadian, what I heard the public request was to try to have a 
proper context and balance. In that way we could address those 
who seriously and flagrantly abuse the system and make it worse 
for those who come to this country and respect the law. 
Regrettably because perceptions cut very deeply sometimes 
everyone is unfairly put in the same boat.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8928"> 8928 </A></B>
<P>
	We try to zero in on the problem. It is difficult for any law 
to try to distinguish that. The bill deals with those individuals 
who have committed a crime punishable by 10 years or more 
and who also, I underline the word also, receive a certificate 
that they are deemed to be a public danger according to the four 
general categories of serious violence, sexual assault, weapons 
charges, and drugs. Those individuals and not others will not 
be given the opportunity of appealing their deportation to the 
immigration appeal division on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds. It was the decision that those 
individuals, that narrow class, not be given the opportunity of 
going to the immigration appeal division but instead to make 
a written request for a written decision by officials in my 
department.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I hear what the Bloc and other members have said. When an 
immigration appeal division makes a decision on one of these 
individuals to stay the deportation or simply to overrule the 
deportation and it causes some consternation among the public, 
I wear the problem. If I were to tell the immigration appeal 
division what to do, members on the opposite side would be 
screaming for my resignation as they did for weeks on end 
respecting the CRTC. They have suggested that there needs to be 
an arm's length independence from our quasi-judicial boards. I 
concur with that.
<P>
	In the end we are caught in the middle as public policy 
makers. We are blamed for decisions we did not take and we 
would be blamed if we sought to interfere in decisions.
<P>
	The government and I chose to signal that category of 
individuals. They would no longer have the right on 
humanitarian and compassionate grounds before the 
immigration appeal division but would have the opportunity on 
a written decision with the department. They may appeal it to the 
Federal Court as in all cases.
<P>
	Some people are suggesting that I will not only be wearing it 
but will be owning the problem. As a public policy maker and 
given the public feeling there was a need for greater consistency 
in decision making and a greater sense of accountability for 
decision making. I am prepared to take the risk of being seen to 
be owning the problem if it renders a more efficient system, 
there is a check and balance, the legislation is pinpointed to 
those who seriously commit criminal acts in the country, and 
there is a fair balance between the compassion and the 
generosity of Canada to invite newcomers to have a second lease 
on life.
<P>
	There are those who seriously undermine our laws and are not 
citizens of the country of Canada. This country and this 
government do not preclude people from becoming citizens. We 
are a progressive country. After three years an individual can 
become a member of the most prestigious club the world over. It 
is called the Canadian family. For the narrow category that have  
tipped the scales there needs to be a price and a cost. That is what 
we are doing in clause 13 of Bill C-44.
<P>
	The second motion that the Bloc suggests is that the 
government should not be able to appeal a decision of an 
immigration appeal division to turn a deportation order into a 
departure notice.
<P>
	Let me explain why I believe the government should be able 
to appeal. It is not to politically intervene as my friend in the 
Bloc suggested. In a number of cases where the department has 
sought to deport a serious criminal the immigration appeal 
division has changed it from a deportation to a departure notice. 
There is a big difference between the two. Under a departure 
notice individuals would have to leave the country but are 
entitled to return. Under a deportation order persons are 
deported and cannot come into the country unless they have 
prior written consent from the minister.
<P>
	Bill C-44 would allow a senior immigration officer, if a 
person was deported and returns without written permission, 
rather than going through an inquiry that can sometimes be 
lengthy-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Like Mendoza.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Correct. The bill would allow the senior 
immigration officer to turn that person around at the border 
without an inquiry. It is common sense. If we accept that 
someone cannot return unless they have permission after 
deportation and they come to the border without permission, 
why should we have an inquiry? Clearly it has already been 
determined. This would make it more efficient.
<P>
	If an immigration appeal division disagrees and moves it from 
a deportation to a departure, why should a minister or the crown 
not say they respect the decision or it is right to make that 
decision but because of the seriousness of the crime perpetrated 
they would like to appeal the removal notice from a departure to 
a deportation? Deportation gives Canada the right to protect 
itself from such individuals.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not with the view of trying to be politically involved or 
intervening. It would simply be a right of any country to protect 
itself from those it deems to be a danger to the public and a 
notice may be switched from deportation to departure based on 
some consideration that is outweighed by the nature of the 
offence. That is the reason it is balanced, fair and measured.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
question was discussed at length in the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration, and practically all the 
organizations voiced their opposition to politicizing the refugee 
status determination process and transferring the IRB's 
jurisdiction, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8929"> 8929 </A></B>
<P>
and more particularly that of its appeal division, to a politician, 
a minister.
<P>
	There was unanimity among the lawyers who appeared before 
the committee to oppose the transfer of jurisdiction from a 
quasi-judicial organization to the executive, the political 
authority. I would like to mention some the organizations who 
came before the committee: the Canadian council of refugees, 
the refugees lawyers association, the Canadian bar association, 
the Immigration and Refugee Board. They were all against this 
transfer of jurisdiction from the IRB to the minister. I should 
also mention Amnesty International, the Quebec association of 
immigration lawyers, the Canadian labour congress, the 
Canadian ethnocultural council, the national action committee 
on the status of women, and the interchurch committee for 
refugees.
<P>
	We proposed this motion mostly because we are against the 
cancellation by Bill C-44 of the right to appeal for equity 
reasons. The right to appeal in immigration matters dates back 
only to 1952. The Immigration Act of 1952 established a limited 
judicial appeal system managed by the Immigration Appeal 
Board.
<P>
	In 1967, a piece of legislation formally instituted the 
Immigration Appeal Board as an independent tribunal in charge 
of hearing appeals filed on grounds involving questions of law 
or fact or mixed law and fact, by individuals under an expulsion 
order. In 1973, the right of appeal was restricted to permanent 
residents, visa holders and individuals claiming refugee status 
or Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	Since 1989, refugee status determination is under the 
jurisdiction of the IRB, an independent quasi-judicial body. The 
Appeal Division of the IRB replaced the Immigration Appeal 
Board. We can see that, since 1952, immigration ministers and 
officials of that department have tended more and more to leave 
such matters to an increasingly quasi-judicial body.
<P>
	However, Bill C-44, and particularly clause 4, goes against 
that legislative trend which started in 1952. A court of appeal 
must be able to rule on issues of law, fact, or both and equity, and 
I emphasize equity, towards refugees, visa holders, permanent 
residents and sponsors.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Clause 13 of Bill C-44 amends section 70 of the Immigration 
Act and deprives the appeal division of the IRB of the power to 
stay, for reasons of fairness, the execution of a deportation 
order, or to quash that decision in the case of crimes punishable 
by a term of imprisonment of ten years or more.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to tell the minister why we wanted to 
exclude permanent residents who have lived in Canada for at 
least ten years. It is because such a provision also exists in 
Australia and in France. Therefore, we would not be the first 
country to do so.
<P>
	The deportation decisions made by immigration officers, as 
opposed to an independent tribunal, may be technically flawed. 
For example, they may be flawed because of procedural 
technicalities, insufficient evidence, inconsistency or lack of 
accountability. Right now, the Appeal Division of the IRB is an 
appropriate and fair tool to dispose of an appeal on a deportation 
order, or to deny a sponsorship application.
<P>
	I share the views expressed on page five of the excellent 
submission presented to the Standing Committee on Citizenship 
and Immigration by the National Immigration Law Section of 
the Canadian Bar Association, where it says: ``The appeal 
division looks at errors in law and at all the circumstances of a 
case to determine if there exist reasons based on fairness. A 
mere examination to look for any error in law is not sufficient. 
The appellant and the minister are both represented. Oral as well 
as documentary evidence is presented before a public forum and 
is subject to cross-examination. The decision is then made by an 
independent tribunal and subject to judicial control. With the 
changes proposed in Bill C-44, it is the minister or an 
immigration officer who will make a discretionary and 
subjective examination. It will not be possible to review any 
factual error''.
<P>
	I would prefer to have the decision to send a person back to his 
or her country of origin, thus putting his or her life in danger, 
made by a tribunal after due process: presentation of evidence, 
cross-examination and oral arguments. Very often, we are 
confronted with complex questions of fact or law. Immigration 
officers responsible for the application of the legislation often 
do not have the resources, the training or the mandate to 
determine whether or not the expulsion of a permanent resident 
is justified.
<P>
	Further on, the national section on immigration law of the 
Canadian Bar Association says: ``One of the main advantages of 
an independent tribunal is that it guarantees that difficult 
decisions in expulsion matters are not made by politicians. What 
the minister is proposing in his statement is a unit, responsible 
to his office, which would review expulsion measures. Political 
decisions are unpredictable, inconsistent and dangerous. For all 
interested parties, access to the minister or his representative 
can become a major and unfair factor''.
<P>
	For these reasons, I support Motions Nos. 15, 16 and 17.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 20</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-44 be amended by deleting Clause 18.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois involves 
deleting clause 18 from Bill C-44. Without this clause, section 
24 of the Customs Act would not be amended.
<P>
	Section 24 authorizes mail, documents or anything that may 
serve to establish the identity of a person to be intercepted. It is 
proposed to give immigration officers the power to seize and 
search parcels and documents suspected of being used 
fraudulently. We think that such provisions probably contravene 
the Canadian Charter of Human Rights. The Bloc Quebecois 
amendment is to prevent the government from being taken to 
court over this.
<P>
	We also question another aspect of this clause in Bill C-44, 
and that is the introduction of reverse onus. In our judicial 
system, the accused is initially presumed innocent, at least that 
is how it has been so far. But the mail seizure provisions reverse 
the burden of proof. Also, there is no indication of the basis on 
which seizure will be decided and the nature of the mail 
determined.
<P>
	How will customs officers determine the contents of packages 
before they are opened? What will tell them that a given mailing 
is highly likely to contain illegal documents? We think that such 
procedures will be impossible to justify legally.
<P>
	Therefore, clause 18 may pave the way for abuse. Opening 
mail without the consent of the recipients goes against the most 
elementary of fundamental rights. In a society that recognizes 
the rule of law, you do not tamper with mail, to the best of my 
knowledge. Moreover, Bill C-44 is not overly transparent, by 
not mentioning the circumstances under which the mail, parcels 
or documents will be opened.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Regardless of our concerns, Mr. Speaker, clause 18 will be 
difficult to enforce.
<P>
	Customs officers who testified on Bill C-44 before the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration told us 
that, over the past decade, 259 federal mail inspection centres 
had been eliminated. There are only six remaining to do this 
kind of work. Efforts to increase the powers and workload of 
employees who are already unable to meet the demand are 
probably wasted. The government should make sure that 
existing provisions are enforced and allocate adequate resources 
to this end.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8931"> 8931 </A></B>
<P>
	For the sake of compliance with the charter of rights, respect 
for fundamental rights and practical reasons as well, I 
encourage hon. members to vote for Motion No. 5 put forward 
by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this bill attempts to give customs officers more legal power to 
seize fraudulent documents. We applaud that intent. However, 
customs has informed us that this measure is totally 
unenforceable and therefore without greater enforcement ability 
the intent of the bill is moot.
<P>
	That is why we oppose the bill. It would give Canadians a 
false sense of security. However, this amendment by the Bloc 
would gut even the good intent of the bill. The Bloc and Reform 
view immigration law from an entirely different philosophical 
perspective. Its amendment reflects its philosophy. Our 
opposition to the amendment reflects ours.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, clause 18 of Bill C-44 would 
make it a punishable offence for individuals in this country 
either to import or export fraudulent documentation.
<P>
	If members recall, some months back there was an article in 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that pointed to a decision by the Department 
of Justice. The decision suggested that the immigration and 
customs officials who were opening mail to confiscate 
fraudulent documents and also to try to stop the rings that 
smuggled documents did not have authority under the law to do 
so.
<P>
	This clause in the bill gives legitimacy under the full weight 
of the law to our customs and immigration officers to confiscate 
mail that is carrying fraudulent documentation such as drivers 
licences, visa applications and passports. Many have been 
intercepted, particularly in Toronto and Montreal.
<P>
	We are suggesting in this clause that it be a punishable 
offence. Currently the offence would carry a penalty of two 
years and/or a fine of $5,000. We feel this should be a deterrent 
to making those fraudulent documents available.
<P>
	Fraudulent documentation is a problem not only in Canada 
but worldwide. It is almost scary to see the kind of high 
technological reproduction of our documents, so we should be 
sending the right message.
<P>
	Reform Party members keep having this debate. They support 
the intent of the bill but do not believe it is enforceable. It is like 
saying that you do not accept amendments to the Criminal Code 
because you do not think the police can enforce them.
<P>
	The police, of which my hon. friend was a member, have too 
few police officers in all the major cities. Does it mean that if we 
bring in a Criminal Code amendment that is good in intent and 
shows sound judgment, that this party and this ex-police officer 
will turn it down because while the intent is good it is somehow  
unenforceable, whether by police officers, customs, or 
immigration? Does this allow the Reform Party to say ``we are 
opposed?'' What kind of a silly argument is that for an ex-police 
officer to make?
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	If the intent is good, then we have to make sure of the 
enforceability of the legislation. Anyone in this country that 
tries to circumvent the Immigration Act through the fraudulent 
production or importation of documents should be punished.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, under 
clause 18 of Bill C-44, customs officers may search 
international parcels to look for documents and pass on these 
documents to an immigration officer for examination.
<P>
	Immigration officers may destroy documents when they have 
sufficient reason to believe that such a measure is necessary, if 
these documents were obtained or used irregularly and if such a 
measure is necessary to prevent irregular or fraudulent use. The 
officer may give the documents back to the legitimate owners, 
keep the documents until they are sent back or destroy them.
<P>
	According to these amendments, refugee claimants trying to 
obtain identification papers from relatives or authorities abroad 
may have their documents seized or perhaps destroyed.
<P>
	Furthermore, the official is not required to notify the owner 
that these documents have been seized. This situation is very 
disturbing. Mail is sacred and inviolable in almost all countries.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The member will have a little time left after

We do not need the minister's platitudes nor his citing of 
statistics to tell us we have a problem of domestic violence in 
this country.
<P>
	What specific plan does this government have to get at the 
root causes of violence against women? Until gender roles are 
eliminated, until the family no longer serves as that convenient 
arena for male violence, until wife beating is no longer a logical 
extension of male domination and until our justice system 
demonstrates its capacity for justice, we do not have a blueprint 
for change.
<P>

Violence against women exists. We have endured enough.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
necessity of continuing to educate Canadians, especially our 
youth, on environmental issues is crucial, not only for Canada's 
future but for the future of the entire planet. Together we must 
continue to think globally but act locally to address the many 
challenges we face in preserving the delicate balance of our 
environment.
<P>
	At Cole Harbour High School in my riding of Dartmouth I 
recently had the privilege of unveiling along with the Minister 
of the Environment a new environmental information system 
established on the Internet by this government. It is called the 
Green Lane on the Information Highway and makes Canada's 
wealth of information on the environment available not only to 
Canadians but indeed to the entire world.
<P>
	I ask this House to join with me in commending the Minister 
of the Environment and her department for taking the important 
step of establishing this green lane on the information highway. 
I look forward to the new ideas and creativity in dealing with 
environmental issues that will no doubt result from this global

	The Prime Minister could have spoken out at the summit

refuted by the medals won by Canadian competitors as well as 
by the fact that Canadian police officers use these short

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

that he felt present tax revenues could be improved without 
raising taxes.
<P>

collecting taxes owed instead of inventing new taxes?

<P>
	Perhaps I may also say to the hon. member that I am sure he 
has no objection to making our tax system much fairer than it is 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Certainly, Mr. 
Speaker. May I remind the Minister of Finance that the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe has for some time reminded him of 
the need for injecting more fairness into the tax system? 
Unfortunately the Minister of Finance has always turned a deaf 
ear, so I am delighted to hear what he said just now.
<P>
	My supplementary question for the Minister of Finance is 
this: Would he agree that a tax increase for all taxpayers, as 
recommended by his colleagues on the finance committee, 
would merely accelerate the growth of the underground 
economy, in addition to being a complete reversal of the 
commitments made by the Prime Minister during the last 
election campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the finance 
committee suggested that, considering the lag between spending 
cuts and their actual impact on the deficit, if necessary we might 
consider other taxes. The committee told us that the tax hike 
they were concerned about most was an increase in interest 
rates. And I must say I think they are right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Minister of Finance agree that the best way to get rid of the 
underground economy would be to stop taxing the middle class 
to the hilt, eliminate tax inequities-something we have been 
talking about for the past year-and introduce a more effective 
tax collection system, so that all taxpayers will pay their fair 
share and, in fact, pay what they owe the government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the absolute 
necessity of building greater fairness and equity into our tax 
system and making sure that all Canadians are confident that the 
burden is being shared fairly is something this government has 
not only spoken about, but was also installed in the last budget 
more than in any other previous budget.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	We filled in more loopholes in the last budget. We attacked 
the tax system in a way that will make it fairer. In fact the results 
are already being seen. Our corporate revenues are up higher 
than they have been in a long time.
<P>
	This party takes a back seat to no one in its desire to build 
fairness and equity into the system. What I fail to understand is 
why the opposition consistently refuses to join us in that effort.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in addition to recommending an eventual tax increase 
for all taxpayers, the Liberal members are proposing new taxes 
which would directly hit the middle class. For example, they 
suggest imposing a new annual tax of $500 million on gas, while 
also leaving open the possibility of taxing group insurance 
benefits, RRSPs and retirement pensions.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance pledge to reject the 
recommendations made by the Liberal members of the finance 
committee to impose a new tax on gasoline and to eventually tax 
RRSPs and group insurance benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I find it very hard 
to understand the position of the Bloc Quebecois and its finance 
critic, since they had the opportunity to submit a constructive 
report and to make suggestions, not just nice speeches, but 
suggestions to really help us get rid of this plague called the 
deficit.
<P>
	Instead of rising in the House to tell us about their own report 
and make suggestions, Bloc Quebecois members can only attack 
the government and, I must say, they do a poor job of that too.
<P>
	We will solve the problem, but I invite the hon. member to 
participate in a joint effort. Deficit reduction should not be 
subject to partisan attacks: it should be a common goal for 
everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I realize that the Minister of Finance does not always 
read the documents he receives. We have been making 
recommendations to him for a year now and, just recently, when 
he appeared before the finance committee, we made ten 
recommendations which have the advantage of not targeting the 
middle class or the poor. That is why he will not implement 
them.
<P>
	Canadians and Quebecers will soon have to decide whether to 
invest in RRSPs. This is a serious issue involving billions of 
dollars.
<P>
	For that reason, I ask the Minister of Finance to be clear and 
serious and to rule out, once and for all, taxing RRSPs. As I said, 
there are billions of dollars involved and this is a very serious 
matter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have said time 
and again that these questions would be answered when I table 
the budget. This is not really the time to preclude consultation. I 
want to ask the hon. member, like I did on Friday, if he supports 
the suggestion made at his first press conference by the 
economic

effect that, to eliminate the deficit, we should shut down VIA 
Rail and make cuts in old age pensions. That is the suggestion 
made by the great economic thinker for the separatist 
movement.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
little over a month ago the minister of immigration did the 
honourable thing and called a judicial inquiry into the activities 
of Michael Schelew, the vice-chair of the Immigration and 
Refugee Board.
<P>
	Serious accusations of intimidation and artificially inflating 
refugee acceptance rates had been levelled at Schelew. The 
minister said an inquiry would dispel any notion that his 
department wanted to cover the matter up. On the day the 
inquiry was to begin it was abruptly cancelled. We learned that 
Mr. Schelew was given $100,000 in exchange for his 
resignation.
<P>
	Mr. Schelew may be gone but the problems with the IRB 
remain. Will the minister order an immediate public review of 
the entire Immigration and Refugee Board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is absurd to suggest that the 
government has anything to cover up or hide.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Looking back at the process, I received a number of 
complaints. I gave those complaints to the chairperson of the 
board. The board recommended a course of action, namely an 
inquiry. The government, after thoughtful consideration of both 
the chairperson's and Mr. Schelew's response, suggested an 
inquiry which was started. Subsequent to the calling of that 
inquiry, Mr. Schelew tendered his resignation. It was the 
opinion of the Federal Court judge that the inquiry was moot and 
I accept his recommendation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians should be appalled at the way this government does 
business.
<P>
	The minister appoints a good friend to the IRB who is then the 
subject of some very serious allegations. The minister orders a 
judicial inquiry into his friend's actions, citing concerns about 
the integrity of the IRB and the public's perception of a cover 
up. Suddenly the minister's headache disappears, at a cost to the 
taxpayer of $100,000.
<P>
	Does the minister not think that the whole Schelew affair has 
seriously damaged the credibility of the IRB? Did he know 
beforehand about the $100,000 given to Schelew upon his 
dismissal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very unfair to 
characterize Mr. Schelew or anybody else as a crony of the 
government. That is simply not the case. The whole question of 
the inquiry was simply to the alleged conduct of one individual.
<P>
	I have said to this Chamber and publicly that there is the 
agency review, which is the review of government-wide 
commissions and agencies. Reforms will be reported early in the 
new year. Also, the IRB will be responding to the Hathaway 
report which it commissioned. I will be meeting with the 
chairperson of the board this week to discuss a number of issues 
and to consider any other possible measures.
<P>
	In so far as the settlement is concerned, I was never personally 
involved with settlements, nor should any ministers concern 
themselves about settlements. The settlement was done by the 
appropriate officials. I am told it was in line with settlements for 
other public servants. The settlement package is less than one 
year's salary for Mr. Schelew. That was not conducted by me. I 
was involved with the inquiry and the inquiry exclusively.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary certainly knew all about the settlement.
<P>
	Mr. Schelew did not operate in a vacuum. He could not have 
caused such an increase in refugee acceptance rates without the 
assistance of other Immigration and Refugee Board members. 
The Canadian acceptance rate for refugee claimants is now at an 
astronomical 70 per cent. One man could not have created this 
wave them through attitude all by himself.
<P>
	I ask again, will the minister in the interests of preserving the 
integrity and legitimacy of the Canadian refugee determination 
system hold a public review of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with reference to the first 
part of the question, I only found out the details of the settlement 
on Friday of last week. That was the day the judge suggested the 
inquiry should not proceed.
<P>
	With respect to the IRB, I do not believe the party across the 
way is concerned about building up this institution, but we are 
on this side of the House. It would be grossly unfair for the hon. 
member and his party to suggest that because of the alleged 
conduct of one individual the entire institution should be 
undercut or undermined. I said that reforms to the institution 
will be coming in the early part of next year as part of the agency 
and program review which is being conducted by the 
government.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	It would appear that, after refusing for three weeks, the 
minister has finally decided to act upon the request made by the 
mayor of Saint-Jean, and send officials to negotiate with the 
Quebec government and municipal authorities on the basis of 
the mayor's proposal. This proposal allows for a gradual and 
more civilized closure of the college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that he has agreed to send officials 
to Saint-Jean to negotiate, this week, a binding agreement with 
Quebec on the basis of Mayor Smereka's proposal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I myself met with the mayor of Saint-Jean to 
discuss this issue. My office has been in contact with him on 
several occasions. It is true that, on Saturday, we came to the 
conclusion that it would be useful to resume negotiations, since 
the chances were very good to finally conclude the negotiations 
on item 6 of the July 19 agreement, in order to make it possible 
for the college in Saint-Jean to keep operating as a civilian 
university.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I learned just a few hours ago that, during a 
press conference, the Quebec minister, Ms. Beaudoin, who 
presumably was apprised of the letter faxed to her on Friday and 
of my press release, chose to misrepresent quite a few things.
<P>
	In view of Ms. Beaudoin's position, I am no longer so sure 
that we can reach an agreement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, how 
can the minister justify having procrastinated for so long, and 
how can he justify procrastinating in following through with the 
proposal made by the mayor of Saint-Jean, while faculty 
members and their families have been living with a great deal of 
uncertainty for the last few months and must make a decision in 
the coming days on their transfer to Kingston?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, in the last few months, I put great effort into trying 
to reach an agreement that would keep the college in Saint-Jean 
open and allow the community to benefit economically from its 
operation.
<P>
	On July 19, we reached an agreement that would have done 
just that. The Quebec government consistently refused to 
implement it. At last, thanks to the co-operation of the mayor of 
Saint-Jean, we finally succeeded in putting together a series of 
proposals which will or could lead to an agreement that would 
keep the Collège de Saint-Jean open as a civilian university.
<P>
	But once again, Minister Beaudoin's bad faith has jeopardized 
the agreement we could have reached.

Schelew affair: the matter has been closed. We have no answers 
and it has cost us another $100,000.
<P>
	The facts of the matter are clear. To avoid any sense of 
avoiding the issue to have been brought before this cancelled 
inquiry there needs to be a full explanation by the minister.
<P>
	Will the minister clear up any misunderstanding or lack of 
transparency in the matter by implementing a full public inquiry 
and including a full examination of the IRB and its executive?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members 
would not recognize facts if they tripped over them.
<P>
	The facts are very clear. An inquiry was called pursuant to 
section 63 of the Immigration Act with a reference to look into 
the alleged conduct of an individual. The board continues to 
work and discharges a very important mandate. It was the 
recommendation of the judge leading the inquiry, not the 
government, that the inquiry be stopped.
<P>
	That does not mean to say the status quo of any board, 
commission or institution should be static and stay unchanged. I 
say again that reforms to institutions have already been part of 
the agency review for months. That review will be reporting 
early next year. The Hathaway commission has ushered in 
changes.

doing a laudable job.

transparency and about accountability. They are all things we

system to work as well as it can, and I applaud this.

	But will the minister put his money where his mouth is and 
change the refugee determination system so it is truly 
accountable and truly transparent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in terms of trying to build up 
an institution and trying to make the system work, we have not 
had one constructive recommendation in over a year from that 
party.
<P>
	All it is interested in is trying to exploit a situation that, 
granted, was not easy for the IRB. Again I say it would have 
been completely unfair to tarnish every member of the IRB and 
tarnish the entire institution with the same wide brush.
<P>
	I have said we are interested in reforming the institution and it 
will be done. I invite and welcome any constructive advice or 
recommendation that may flow from that side rather than simply 
trying to cloak all the discussion in inquiries or royal

my question is for the Minister of National Defence. The 
Department of National Defence proposes to invest over $68.5 
million to build new facilities at the base in Goose Bay so that 
the number of low level flights can increase from the current 
8,000 to over 18,000. Yet, there is no new firm contract with 
participating NATO countries to justify such an investment.
<P>
	How can the minister be planning to authorize such additional 
spending to increase the number of flights when he knows full 
well that the U.S. withdrew from this Canadian agreement in 
1991 and that Germany signed an agreement for such flights 
with New Mexico last May?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

is subject to environmental assessment panel hearings that have 
been ongoing. It should bring down its conclusions shortly.
<P>
	Once we receive the recommendations of that panel the 
Department of National Defence will know whether or not it will 
be able to continue with agreements with our allies for low level

be added.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

algae, on fauna and on individuals.

<P>

term that will sustain and improve post-secondary education.
<P>
	For example, in the case of Ontario we know full well that 
over the next decade an additional billion dollars will be 
transferred to the province of Ontario through increased tax

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, does the minister recognize that the strategic plan 
which the Canada Council will adopt following these phony 
consultations will have little credibility at best, since several 
organizations have simply boycotted this whole process they

they consider absolutely illegitimate and botched?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, perhaps our colleague is also criticizing the 
Canada Council for having no school.
<P>
	The council is doing what it can to get some co-operation. I 
hope it will get some, since it cannot develop a good business

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a question for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs.
<P>
	In my riding personnel at Royal Roads military college have 
received their termination notices. At St. Jean, Quebec, the 
government offered a deal to postpone closure of CMR, are 
committed to making it a post-secondary institution.
<P>
	Why is the government giving preferential treatment to 
CMR? Will the government give the same deal to postpone 
closure of Royal Roads as it has just given CMR?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, since the beginning we have offered exactly the 
same deal to Royal Roads as we have offered to the Collège 
militaire royal. We have made it a point to be absolutely fair in 
the agreements that we were negotiating; in fact, most of the 
clauses in the Royal Roads proposal are exactly the same as in 
the Quebec proposal.
<P>
	The arrangement with Mayor Smereka, if it ever leads to a full 
implementation of the deal, is merely a process of 
implementation and in that process whatever is offered to 
Quebec will be offered to Royal Roads.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, fairness and equality are what this deal is about but are 
not occurring at Royal Roads.
<P>
	If this is an example of regional fairness let us talk about it. 
The government is now making acceptance of a settlement 
package of the military base in Masset as a condition of its 
settlement of Royal Roads. They have nothing to do with each 
other.
<P>
	Why is acceptance of the compensation package for Masset 
linked to the resolution of Royal Roads when no such example 
exists with CMR.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in both cases the military colleges are being closed 
and in both cases there have been economic activity 
consequences as a result of the closures of bases. In the two 
cases the amount that is offered over five years is $25 million, of 
which $5 million is taken from the Department of National 
Defence in order to compensate for decreased military activity.
<P>
	This has been a part of the Quebec deal. This is a part of the 
British Columbia deal. It is exactly the same deal on the same 
basis.

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Welcome home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> This cannot be the House of Commons, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister or the person talking for 
the Prime Minister today. It concerns a statement made by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development in reaction to the 
protests of his colleague from Ontario on the issue of the cuts 
being proposed for post-secondary education.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is quoted as 
indicating that his anger in reaction to the position taken by the 
Government of Ontario could influence his thinking on changes 
to the Canada assistance plan.
<P>
	What does one have to do with the other? Since when can a 
minister of the crown take it upon himself to wreak vengeance 
on a government because of a position it is taking on behalf of 
the people in a quite different file?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is too bad the member for 
Sherbrooke uses the rare occasion when he rises to his feet to 
repeat an allegation which has absolutely no substance.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, (NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development 
who has introduced proposals to change funding to 
post-secondary education. He recently said, and I quote: 
``These wild allegations about closing universities and huge 
increases in tuition are simply scare mongering''. However, in a 
submission to the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8944"> 8944 </A></B>
<P>
the Association of Universities and Colleges predicted that 
tuition fees would double under these proposals.
<P>
	I ask the minister to come clean with Canadians. Will he in his 
proposals and in his view increase tuition fees or not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to 
the hon. member as I said in a response to an earlier question that 
the federal transfer accounts today for over 50 per cent of the 
cost of higher education in this country. The province of Ontario 
over the next 10 years will gain well over $1 billion in additional 
revenue as a result of federal transfer payments. If one looks 
down the road, the actual amount going to Ontario in terms of 
those additional revenues exceeds what presently goes in the 
combination of tax transfers and direct transfers.
<P>
	Therefore the real question is: Is the Government of Ontario 
prepared to fully transfer and turn over to higher education the 
full benefit of those federal transfers or does it have another 
reason and another agenda?

two points of order I want to bring to your attention.
<P>
	The first point of order I wish to raise while the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is still around. It concerns his 
comments about my presence in the House of Commons, a very 
well known rule that I think you would want to have respected.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I of course will refer to the blues to be 
absolutely certain. However, it was my recollection that there 
was no mention about the hon. member being in the House. I 
believe the statement was that the hon. member was not on his 
feet, which has nothing to do with his being in the House. 
However, I will review the blues.
<P>
	I take it this is the second point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it would be wise on our part 
to check the blues because I can assure you that my 
understanding of the exchange was quite clear.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the other point of order I want to raise concerns 
the functioning of question period itself and the fact that I was 
not allowed to ask a supplementary question.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure all hon. members will understand that 
there are times when the Chair, if you can say in its wisdom, for 
the better functioning of question period has single questions 
rather than double questions. This was one of those days.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATIONACT">IMMIGRATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-44, an act to 
amend the Immigration Act and the Cityzenship Act and to make 
a consequential amendment to the Customs Act, as reported 
(with amendment) from the committee; and of Motion No. 20.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
before the Question Period, I was about to talk about the power 
given immigration officers to seize international mail.
<P>
	I must add that Bill C-44 contains no provision that would 
allow someone to dispute the legality of any irregularly 
conducted seizure of goods. This section has been denounced by 
almost all organisations and persons who appeared before the 
committee.
<P>
	On the other hand, clause 18 of Bill C-44 would permit the 
assumption that someone is guilty of intending to violate the law 
or regulations. It proposes a reverse burden of proof. In other 
words, evidence that someone has imported or exported 
documents that could serve some fraudulent purpose would be 
sufficient to prove the intent to violate the law and regulations, 
except if shown otherwise. Therefore, this clause goes clearly 
against the principle of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
which guarantees that any person charged with an offence has 
the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
<P>
	The legality of this clause must be questioned. Ultimately the 
Supreme Court will have to rule on the constitutionality of this 
disputed provision. This drastic clause paves the way to abuse. 
Opening the mail without the consent of the addressee is a 
violation of the most fundamental rights.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We must not forget that some refugees come to Canada with 
false papers. After all, these refugees are fleeing an unfair, 
dictatorial or cruel political system. If this clause came into 
effect, these refugees would be found guilty even before being 
admitted into the country. Moreover, we wonder if the minister 
has thought about the effectiveness of this provision, 
considering that, for instance, 259 mail inspection centres have 
been closed and the number of inspectors has been drastically 
reduced.
<P>
	If the minister realized that he has only six inspection centres 
left for the whole of Canada, he would know that his proposal is 
ineffective. It seems to us that the minister would probably have 
been more hesitant to introduce this bill, and particularly this 
clause, if he had consulted  with the organizations involved, 
namely Customs and Excise. Considering the lack of prelimi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8947"> 8947 </A></B>
<P>
nary consultations, which was the case with Bill C-44, the 
minister could have got some information about the real and 
unfortunate situation mentioned by some witnesses from 
Customs and Excise, who came before the committee and 
complained about the lack of resources in that organization.
<P>
	What we see instead is a clause reflecting an attitude which 
prevails throughout this bill, a bill that was written without any 
consultation and is only a response to political pressure. For all 
these reasons, I support Motion No. 20.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
continue with the amendments to Bill C-44 proposed by the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The changes proposed to clause 19 of Bill C-44 by the official 
opposition have two objects. First, Motion No. 21 would add the 
words, and I quote: ``On being satisfied that a notice of 
appearance or a summons has been served on any person''-
<P>
	This addition is necessary if we want to make sure that a 
notice of appearance or a summons has been served before an 
arrest warrant is issued against an immigrant. The government 
must make sure that the person summoned knows that he or she 
will have to answer questions, appear or give evidence, before 
issuing an arrest warrant.
<P>
	The amendment would require proof that a notice of 
appearance has been served before proceeding with the arrest. 
This might seem a bit hypothetical, but without it we might be 
faced with regrettable situations. For example, a permanent 
resident could be summoned for questioning as part of an 
investigation. There could be several reasons for not answering 
the summons: change of address, difficulties communicating 
with the people with whom he or she lives, or simply oversight 
by spouse or children.
<P>
	Can we issue an arrest warrant for reasons that trivial? Did we 
think of all the possible consequences of an arrest which might 
not be warranted? Why not avoid all these unfortunate situations 
by amending the bill to make sure that the person summoned or 
asked to appear has indeed been notified to do so.
<P>
	I believe that the other amendment to clause 19 of Bill C-44 
will be unanimously approved by the members of this House. 
Basically, it seeks to align the French and the English versions 
of the bill.
<P>
	Clause 19 of the French version does not mention the reasons 
why a person may not appear as a witness or for an inquiry or an 
examination. When comparing the French version with the 
English one, it becomes obvious that clause 19 is not subdivided 
the same way, since in English there are two subsections, (<I>a</I>) and 
(<I>b</I>), and none in French.
<P>
	Moreover, words equivalent to ``or proceeding in relation to 
the decision'' do not appear in the French version. Our 
amendment seeks to specify the reason for the appearance. It 
would be very unfortunate indeed if these amendments were not 
adopted. It is important that the laws be the same for 
francophones and anglophones alike, and that they be as precise 
and well understood as possible, in both official languages.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, once again my intervention will be very brief. I believe 
that the intention of Motion No. 21 is to further reduce the intent 
of Bill C-44. The Reform Party members will oppose that 
intention.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 22, I have never quite figured out 
what this is about. I will leave that to those who are going to 
square the French and the English on this translation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to respond 
first to Motion No. 21 which seeks to modify clause 19 of Bill 
C-44.
<P>
	Clause 19 essentially authorizes the issuance of a warrant for 
the arrest of individuals who do not appear for determination 
before a senior immigration official.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc motion before us today would require that the 
person be served a summons to appear prior to the event. I would 
be opposed to it because the amendment would greatly restrict 
the ability to issue warrants for the arrest of persons who would 
constitute a danger to the public or perhaps a feeling, for good 
reason, among officials of my department that the individuals 
will not appear for a removal inquiry. Currently warrants are 
issued on the basis of objective criteria reviewable by the 
Federal Court. Indeed there is a check and balance within the 
system.
<P>
	With the requirement in this clause we are trying to seek the 
assistance of other enforcement agencies, namely the police, 
through the issuance of a warrant. If we were to go along with 
the amendment proposed by the Bloc, it would mean that 
warrants could not be issued for individuals who might be 
dangerous to the country or may not appear as required under the 
law. If we cannot find the individual who may have gone 
underground, I cannot see logically how we could serve the 
individual with a proper summons anyway.
<P>
	The clause is being amended to permit the warrant to be 
issued. We are not suggesting anything more than simply 
through the processing of a warrant seeking the assistance of 
other enforcement agencies and thereby helping Immigration 
Canada to have the individual who was to appear before the 
immigration official do so at once.
<P>
	On the second amendment my comments are very similar to 
the member who spoke just a moment ago. I am not sure there is 
a difference between the French and the English text. If there is 
upon reflection by my officials, I certainly would not stand in 
the way of making sure that what the bill says in English is 
clearly congruent with what it says in our other official 
language, namely French.
<P>
	I am afraid I do not have that information before me. There 
was confusion when the Bloc put forward its Motion No. 22 
respecting the meaning of the amendment. Perhaps we will have 
an opportunity before we vote in the House at report stage to 
seek clarification of its second motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to take part in this debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member 
already took part in the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Not on this motion. It was on the previous 
motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Then I recognize the 
hon. member for Bourassa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
be brief. I do not understand why the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, who is a a man of law, opposes that motion.
<P>
	In any country, in any society, arrest warrants must be used 
with great caution. People's freedom is at stake. We want to 
make sure that certain basic precautions are taken before the 
execution of an arrest warrant, namely, we want the individual 
concerned to be advised in advance and him or her to receive a 
notice to appear before a warrant is issued.
<P>
	As we all know, in every democratic society, a judge normally 
has the power to issue warrants for arrest when there is 
sufficiently convincing evidence or reasonable grounds to 
believe that a person has committed a crime. In the case of an 
obvious crime, a police officer is empowered to arrest a person, 
but this it is not the case here. We must be careful. We cannot 
give arbitrary powers to a government official who might abuse 
them.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	As for the second motion, we checked the English and French 
versions of the text, and our research staff did too, and we found 
that there is a difference between the English and the French 
versions of this clause.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would remind the hon. 
member for Bourassa that, as the mover of the motion, he should 
have spoken first. I would ask that, from now on, those hon. 
members who move motions make their speech first.

	He said: Madam Speaker, once again let me repeat my 
appreciation to both the Bloc and the Reform for having given 
unanimous consent to allow the government to offer this motion 
at report stage.
<P>
	I will give a bit of background and explanation. The 
amendment is in reference to individuals serving time in our 
federal penitentiaries who are deportable, removable from our 
country upon completion of their time in prison.
<P>
	Currently for whatever reason the individuals are considered 
for day parole or unescorted temporary absences. It was my 
feeling and that of my officials that somehow it lacks a great 
deal of common sense. If we think about the situation of 
individuals who will be deported upon completion of their 
sentences, why would we want to try to reintegrate them into 
Canadian society if they will be deported?
<P>
	The reason I introduced it as an amendment at report stage is 
that when we came up with the proposal I obviously had to get 
approval from the departments of justice and solicitor general. 
While I was doing that Bill C-44 was introduced. Subsequent to 
my seeking approval both the Minister of Justice and the 
Solicitor General concurred that the amendment would make a 
great deal of sense. It is something I hope members on all sides 
can concur in.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Essentially we are speaking to individuals who will be 
deported because of the seriousness of their crime upon 
completion of their time in prison. Therefore this amendment 
would not permit such individuals to be considered for either 
day parole or unescorted temporary absences.
<P>
	Not only does that speak to the fact that there is not going to be 
a need for integration into the Canadian community because of 
their deportations. It also limits the possibilities that upon day 
parole or unescorted release into the community even for a few 
hours those individuals may go underground or escape our 
authorities or officials of the Department of the Solicitor 
General. Consequently because of their past criminal acts they 
may be a danger to the general public.
<P>
	Perhaps this bridges the gap between the Immigration Act, the 
Criminal Code and Solicitor General regulations. It is well 
intentioned and speaks to our regulations having the common 
sense they ought to have. I look forward to having the support of 
members of the House.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for Minister of Indian Affairs and

respecting an agreement between Her Majesty in right of 
Canada and the Pictou Landing Indian Band, be read the second

<P>
	<I>[Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.]</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I rise to address the House on Bill C-60, the 
Pictou Landing Indian Band Agreement Act. The legislation is 
being introduced at this time to fulfil the commitments the 
Government of Canada has made to the Pictou Landing Micmac 
of Nova Scotia. This legislation will further reduce the potential 
for any new legal action related to the Boat Harbour issue 
against the Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Hon. members have seen for themselves that this is not a 
lengthy or a complex bill. Nevertheless Bill C-60 is important 
to more than 400 Pictou Landing Micmac and it deserves the 
consideration and support of hon. members on both sides of the 
House.
<P>
	By way of background I would like to briefly outline the 
history behind the Pictou Landing settlement agreement so that 
my hon. colleagues can make an informed and responsible 
decision on Bill C-60.
<P>
	In the mid-1960s the province of Nova Scotia entered into an 
agreement with Scott Maritimes Limited to open a pulp and 
paper mill at Abercrombie Point in Pictou Harbour. As part of 
that arrangement the province accepted responsibility for 
treating and disposing of the effluent generated by the mill.
<P>
	The nearby Boat Harbour tidal estuary was chosen as the most 
economical site for the effluent treatment facility. All the land 
around Boat Harbour was expropriated by the Government of 
Nova Scotia with the exception of reserve lands belonging to the 
Pictou Landing Micmac.
<P>
	Rather than expropriate these reserve lands, the provincial 
government acquired the First Nation's riparian rights through 
negotiations with the First Nation. It is worth noting that the 
First Nation was not enthusiastic about the project and the use of 
Boat Harbour as a holding pond and conduit for pulp mill 
effluent. It agreed only after intense lobbying by Nova Scotia 
officials.
<P>
	After acquiring the First Nation's riparian rights, the province 
blocked the entrance of the estuary to create a 162-hectare 
lagoon. This included some 12 hectares of reserve lands that 
were flooded and lost to the First Nation.
<P>
	At that time the province paid the Pictou Landing Micmac 
$60,000 to compensate for the permanent loss of fishing and 
hunting revenue and other benefits derived from the First 
Nations' use of Boat Harbour.
<P>
	Unfortunately, environmental problems began to arise almost 
immediately after the treatment facility opened. Despite 
repeated requests by the First Nation, action taken by the 
province did not effectively correct the problems.
<P>
	In 1982 the Pictou Landing Micmac submitted a specific 
claim to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. Four years later due to limited progress in 
negotiating the claim the First Nation filed suit against the 
Government of Canada for breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>
	The government pursued an out of court settlement with the 
Pictou Landing Micmac. Through extensive consultation and 
co-operation, a fair and equitable settlement was reached. In a 
community wide referendum in July 1993, members of the First 
Nation voted 141 to 25 in favour of the agreement.
<P>
	This agreement is a $35 million settlement which includes a 
$20 million compensation package. It breaks down as follows: 
$8 million were earmarked to be distributed among the members 
of the First Nation for individual compensation. Much of this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8951"> 8951 </A></B>
<P>
money has already been paid out; $9.725 million were placed in 
a  continuing compensation fund to address special claims by 
members of the First Nation related to the Boat Harbour 
environmental problems; $2.275 million were allocated to 
support projects that will benefit the First Nation, including the 
building of a multi-purpose recreational centre and the 
establishment of a Pictou Landing economic development 
promotional package. These moneys are intended to compensate 
the members of the First Nation for general impacts associated 
with the Boat Harbour facility.
<P>
	The remaining $15 million in the settlement has been directed 
into a community development trust fund that will enable 
members of the First Nation to relocate if necessary. This fund is 
being administered by the First Nation itself and will ensure that 
the First Nation and its members will be able to protect 
themselves from any future health effects from Boat Harbour.
<P>
	The agreement also provides for programs to monitor the 
environmental and health effects of the Boat Harbour system. 
The First Nation is one of the main participants in the 
establishment and the ongoing implementation of these 
monitoring programs. In addition, although not a condition of 
the settlement, the federal government undertook to explore 
ways which might yield a solution to the environmental problem 
with respect to Boat Harbour.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Hon. members should be aware that this settlement agreement 
is self-implementing. In other words it does not require 
legislation to come into force.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House that implementation of the 
agreement has been proceeding well. Most of the settlement 
funds have been transferred to the First Nation, giving it the 
means to develop and administer programs to improve 
conditions on reserve.
<P>
	Although this agreement is self-implementing, at the request 
of the Pictou Landing Micmac, the government made a 
commitment to confirm two of the agreement's provisions 
through legislation. That is the purpose of Bill C-60.
<P>
	Specifically, legislation is required to confirm that the 
settlement agreement is the sole source of compensation for 
claims related to Boat Harbour. This legislation ensures that any 
claims of members of the First Nation beyond those already 
settled by the payments to individuals can only be made against 
the $9.725 million continuing compensation fund. This is very 
important because it ensures that the settlement amount of $35 
million is the full amount the federal government will pay 
related to the Boat Harbour claim.
<P>
	In addition to releasing the Government of Canada from 
further claims by members of the First Nation, Bill C-60 also 
protects the First Nation against such claims by specifying that 
any such claims are to be directed to the compensation fund.
<P>
	The second thing Bill C-60 will do is ensure that settlement 
funds are not Indian moneys as defined by the Indian Act. This 
again is important because it confirms that the First Nation and 
not the federal government has control of and responsibility for 
the moneys once they have been transferred. Trust funds 
managed by the Pictou Landing Micmac are currently holding 
those compensation dollars that have not been paid to 
individuals.
<P>
	This provision of Bill C-60 actually accomplishes two goals. 
First, it meets the government's commitment to give the First 
Nation complete control over the settlement moneys as intended 
by the settlement agreement. At the same time it reduces the 
administrative responsibilities of the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	I want to assure hon. members that this legislation imposes no 
new responsibilities on the Government of Canada. It simply 
confirms and formalizes some elements of an agreement signed 
in July of 1993 that is already being implemented.
<P>
	I also want to assure the House that Bill C-60 will have no 
impact with respect to the correction of environmental problems 
at Boat Harbour. The federal government continues to work 
actively with other parties and in particular the province of Nova 
Scotia and the First Nation to facilitate a solution to these 
problems.
<P>
	As hon. members are no doubt aware the government is 
currently participating in discussions with Scott Maritimes 
Limited, the province of Nova Scotia, the Pictou Landing 
Micmac and other interested parties to identify possible 
solutions to the environmental problems at Boat Harbour. I am 
optimistic that this will lead to the development of an effective 
rehabilitation strategy.
<P>
	Bill C-60 is essentially an administrative bill that fulfils two 
specific commitments requested by the First Nation and agreed 
to by the Government of Canada in the Pictou Landing 
settlement agreement of July 1993. As I mentioned at the outset 
it is not a complex or far reaching act. Nevertheless, hon. 
members should recognize that failure to proceed with the bill 
could impose obligations on the government down the road.
<P>
	For example, without Bill C-60, the Government of Canada 
might be open to claims over and above the $35 million 
settlement figure. There will be no legally certain basis to 
prevent members of the First Nation from seeking additional 
compensation in the future.
<P>
	Our failure to proceed with Bill C-60 might also mean that the 
First Nation could be liable for payments beyond the amounts it 
has received in the settlement. This would impose an 
unnecessary and perhaps unmanageable hardship on it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8952"> 8952 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, if Bill C-60 does not become law, the government 
could ultimately become responsible for managing the 
settlement funds on behalf of the Pictou Landing Micmac. This 
would create a needless administrative burden and could lead 
to additional legal problems. It would also likely sour relations 
with the Pictou Landing Micmac as it would go against the 
spirit of the Boat Harbour final agreement and their desire to 
manage their own affairs.
<P>
	For these reasons alone I urge my hon. colleagues to join me 
in supporting Bill C-60. I would remind them of the 
fundamental need for government to fulfil its outstanding 
commitments to First Nations, including the commitment to 
legislate these provisions of the Boat Harbour final agreement.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Hon. members are well aware of the government's intention 
to build a new partnership with aboriginal peoples based on 
trust, mutual respect and participation in decision making 
processes. Living up to our commitments is critical to the 
process of building a new relationship with aboriginal people 
that will take us into the next century. The House can contribute 
to that process by supporting this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this bill on behalf of my party. I will tell 
you at the outset, however, that I am not about to congratulate 
the government. As far as advance notice of this bill is 
concerned, although I was told last Friday that the bill would not 
come before the House this session, I learned this morning on 
returning from my riding that it is on today's Order Paper.
<P>
	I deplored this practice before when the Yukon bills were 
considered. I was very surprised to find a one foot thick pile of 
documents on my desk the day before second reading. I had to 
spend the whole night reading all these documents to try to 
prepare something acceptable for the next day.
<P>
	As for advance notice, although this is the end of the session, 
the government should show some understanding, especially 
since these are far-reaching bills which we are often unable to 
discuss and criticize for lack of time. As I was saying earlier, I 
am not about to congratulate the government on the subject of 
advance notice.
<P>
	I have no congratulations to offer either on the fact that this 
bill, like other bills affecting Natives, constantly refers to an 
agreement. The bill before us today is quite simple, as it 
contains only four clauses. There are short definitions and a 
significant clause 4, which is the heart of the bill. Naturally, 
clause 4 refers to an agreement that is not provided to us.
<P>
	Again, our ability to comment is rather limited. It is difficult 
to make positive and constructive comments on an agreement 
that you have never seen. When we realized that the four clauses 
of this bill referred to a specific agreement, we had to move 
heaven and earth to put our hands on it. We finally got a copy of 
the agreement on Friday afternoon.
<P>
	Having been told that Bill C-60 was not on the legislative 
menu, we did not set out to examine it immediately. So, we all 
had to scramble this morning. Again, I tell you, it is quite 
difficult to come up with constructive criticism when you have 
had just a few hours to go through an agreement 20 or so pages 
long and weigh the merits of it all.
<P>
	I will nevertheless give you an overview of the historical 
development of the agreement underlying this bill. In 1986, the 
Pictou Landing band was on the verge of taking legal action 
against the federal crown. This action was predicated on the fact 
that, in 1965, an effluent treatment system had been built in Boat 
Harbour, Nova Scotia. Of course, it had been built on Indian land 
and authorities had simply forgotten to advise the Indians that 
there was going to be some building on their land. That is pretty 
well how things were done back in those days. As you can see, 
the native issues were far back in the government's priorities.
<P>
	So, after repeated attempts to negotiate made over several 
years, the Indians finally said: ``Negotiations are required. If the 
government refuses to negotiate, we will take legal action'', 
which they did in 1986.
<P>
	In 1992, the government was facing prosecution. It figured it 
would give negotiations a try. It then instructed its negotiators to 
meet with the band to consider the possibility of an out of court 
settlement. This settlement was reached out of court. To have it 
adopted democratically, it was put to a referendum in July 1993: 
141 of 260 voted on the agreement, so they had a participation 
rate of roughly 60 per cent on the decision concerning the 
agreement as such. Of the 166 members who voted, 141 were in 
favour and 25 against.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Those opposed were motivated mainly by the high level of 
pollution on their reserve. I will come back to that shortly 
because we think that is the problem and it is the type of project 
which we can agree to refer to the Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs, but there will certainly be many questions raised in that 
committee because I think that the environmental aspect gets 
very short shrift. We will have to see, with the First Nations, 
exactly what the settlement means, especially for the 
environment.
<P>
	Of course, the agreement was signed following the 
referendum on July 20, 1993. Basically, the agreement relieves 
the Canadian government of any liability for past, present and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8953"> 8953 </A></B>
<P>
future effects of the treatment system. The government says that 
it will escape any liability by paying them $35 million.
<P>
	My colleague just mentioned that these $35 million would not 
be subject to the Indian Act. So the native people, the Pictou 
Landing Indian Band, will be able to control the $35 million 
themselves. I think it is important to specify that this amount 
will be divided roughly in two. There is a $20-million 
compensation account for the band and the members, 
recognizing that their environment was damaged. The 
remaining $15 million will go into a compensation account if 
the band ever decides to move.
<P>
	We are at the point where we say: We know that your 
environment is very polluted, so polluted in fact that we are 
putting $15 million at your disposal to move. Moving might be a 
solution, but what will happen to the costs and also to the 
environment which was polluted for years and which will 
probably remain in that state?
<P>
	As I just mentioned, the government offered the possibility of 
avoiding future effects and risks. The amount of $15 million will 
be used to move people to adjacent lands and let the company, 
Scott, continue what it has been doing for nearly 30 years, that is 
to pollute the environment.
<P>
	Issues of employment and pollution are also involved, to 
which I will come back later. When you read the bill, and 
particularly the agreement, it is obvious that the government 
wants to discharge itself of any responsibility. In fact, this is the 
basis of the agreement and of this bill designed to solve the 
problem for good, at least according to the government's vision 
and definitions.
<P>
	In chapters 8 and 9 of the agreement, Canada agrees to look at 
ways to find solutions to environmental problems. What does 
that mean? It means that the government is committed to 
looking at solutions. The government is not saying that it will 
solve the issue, only that it will look at solutions. The federal 
government also pledges to take any reasonable action to fight 
harmful effects, but it does not have any future responsibility. 
This sounds wishful thinking, while the danger to the 
environment remains ever present.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the agreement also includes waivers. 
These illustrate the contradictions of the legislation before us. 
Indeed, we are told that this issue which concerns a First Nation 
is settled by handing out money, but the government does not 
care about what happens to the environment. This is significant 
when you read the following excerpt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Pictou Landing Micmac and members of the Pictou Landing Micmac 
who receive amounts from the proceeds of the settlement, including amounts 
arising from the trust fund, hereby waive any present or future cause of action 
against Canada based on flooding, breaches of property rights or nuisances 
arising from activities including the construction, operating, repairing, 
maintenance or cleaning of the Boat Harbour effluent treatment system or on 
any failure to meet related fiduciary, legal or other obligations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	There is a particular risk involved, and I am referring to this 
release from fiduciary responsibility. It may create a precedent, 
because the government must realize in certain cases in Canada, 
it has a fiduciary relationship with the First Nations. So if the 
First Nations are involved in litigation, they can say to the 
federal government: you are our fiduciary, so you have to defend 
us.
<P>
	Though the government does not say so in so many words, it 
may be very tempting to consider that although there are major 
problems in a number of first nations and it has a fiduciary 
responsibility, that does not matter because in a few years, in 
this case 30 years, the federal government or the Crown will deal 
with that by giving substantial amounts of money, and the rest 
will be history.
<P>
	This is not the first time we have seen this happen. It was also 
apparent in the case of Split Lake. Is this the way to deal with the 
Crown's fiduciary responsibility to aboriginal peoples; to say 
we will pay later? We should try to deal with the problems up 
front and not wait 20 or 30 years and then finally decide to give 
$10, $15 or $20 million more to settle the matter. We are 
concerned about this release from fiduciary responsibility.
<P>
	Now, regarding transfer. The band transfers to Canada any 
cause for present or future legal actions against the Scott Paper 
Company, which is the polluter with respect to the agreement, 
Scott Maritime Ltd., its executives, managers, employees, 
respective representatives, Nova Scotia, and any other party 
whose actions caused or contributed to flooding, breaches of 
property rights or nuisances in any way resulting from building, 
operating, repairing, maintaining or cleaning the effluent 
treatment system in Boat Harbour.
<P>
	Here again, we see very clearly that the native people, who 
had reasons to sue, are giving up and the government is taking 
over. It is not sure that the government, for its part, will sue the 
company to have it clean up the damage done to the 
environment.
<P>
	But furthermore the agreement covers the future. I say that the 
band will waive any cause for legal action based on flooding, 
breaches of property rights or nuisances in any way resulting 
from any future building activities. This is quite 
straightforward. It means that should the company decide to 
expand and pollute even more, the government says that the 
native people have no right to sue, since it is now its 
responsibility. We really wonder about the government's 
environmental responsabilities in this issue.
<P>
	Furthermore, this agreement is littered with expressions such 
as ``reasonably established''. I will give you a few examples. In 
our view, this agreement is full of holes and allows the 
government to escape all its responsibilities. Expressions like 
``reason-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8954"> 8954 </A></B>
<P>
ably established'', ``reasonable'', ``if at all possible'', ``reasonable 
measures'' lead us to conclude that the gov ernment will have 
the upper hand in everything. This  agreement gives it all the 
opportunities it wants to avoid doing anything to protect the 
environment.
<P>
	On the other hand, I understand the government's position on 
jobs. Indeed, this company employs people in Nova Scotia, and I 
know that the unemployment rate in that province is well above 
the Canadian average. There are huge unemployment problems 
there and the government is afraid to close down this company 
for polluting the environment. At the present time, we must 
assume that the government is more concerned about preserving 
jobs; one must wonder how much it will cost to clean up these 
rivers. We are told that 86,000 gallons a day are being dumped in 
the river.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	We can speculate on the final cost of all this environmental 
mis-management. We are very critical of the way the bill and 
the agreement approach the environmental issue and the 
aboriginal issue.
<P>
	The government is not very convincing. It promises to 
consider ways to solve the environmental problem and to take 
reasonable steps to counter any harmful effects.
<P>
	The implementation of programs reasonably 
necessary-again, we consider that all this reasonable stuff is a 
smokescreen behind which the government is hiding to escape 
its environmental responsibilities. To escape its 
responsibilities, the government is hiding behind a bill and an 
agreement.
<P>
	A committee will be set up. Canada will appoint a 
six-member committee to oversee the implementation of a 
control program. There again, this six-member committee is 
simply an advisory committee. Aboriginal people will be 
represented on the committee, but the legislation gives it 
absolutely no power to say things like: Here are the control 
measures to put in place. Here is the way we want to solve the 
environmental question. No, there is nothing like that in the 
agreement. It is an advisory committee which will recommend 
some procedures to the government but, in the end, the 
government can simply forget to implement its 
recommendations.
<P>
	The committee does not have any power and although the 
First Nations will be represented, we have no guarantee that they 
will always have 50 per cent of the members. Nonetheless 
pollution has crossed their land for more than 30 years. For 30 
years, the government refused to see the problem and now they 
give almost no control to aboriginal people. It gives them only 
the opportunity to move out, without dealing with the basic 
pollution problem.
<P>
	Coming back to the bill, it has, as I said, only four clauses, the 
first two being the short title and a definition of the agreement 
and who it applies to. But the main problem rests with clause 4, 
because it refers to a specific chapter of the agreement, as I 
mentioned earlier. We were not provided with this agreement 
and just recently received a copy. We took a look at its scope 
and, like in any agreement, one section refers to another and you 
end up having to examine three or four sections all relating to 
the relevance of clause 4.
<P>
	In addition, on examination, a summary one I must say, as I 
indicated earlier, we found that 10 per cent of those concerned 
did not give up their lawsuits, for the simple reason that they 
could not be reached.
<P>
	The bill before us today concerns the entire community. 
Ninety per cent of the community abandoned any potential 
claim, but there is this 10 per cent of uncertainty. What will this 
10 per cent do? Will these people decide to opt out of the 
agreement and legislation and say: ``Look, we never withdrew 
our cases. We want to sue Scott. We are totally against 
entrusting Canada with taking action on our behalf, with the risk 
of being unsatisfied with the ensuing settlement?''
<P>
	These are the kinds of questions we are asking ourselves at 
this point. The Department of Indian Affairs will certainly be 
questioned on this bill when it is considered by the standing 
committee.
<P>
	Therefore, our position is a little shaky. Of course, the 
Natives, the Micmacs of Pictou Landing went ahead and held a 
referendum. We have to respect that. They held a referendum 
and there was an 85 per cent vote for the agreement, even though 
the participation rate was 60 per cent. We still have very serious 
questions, not on the amounts at stake- because we know deep 
down that these people will be able to manage the money-, but 
on the future of that nation if they decide to stay there. And if 
they decide to move, what will the government's environmental 
commitments be?
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Will the province of Nova Scotia take over and address the 
environmental issue? We simply do not know, as there is nothing 
specific in the agreement itself. So we finally decided to support 
the bill for reference to the committee on aboriginal affairs, 
although we will certainly be back here at third reading after 
asking many questions at the committee stage. We will support 
the bill for now but with all the reservations called for.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure and I must say a bit of a habit to 
rise today to participate in a legislative debate on a bill that is a 
fait accompli.
<P>
	Bill C-60, the Pictou Landing Indian band agreement, is 
another instance where statutory authority is being sought after 
an agreement has been signed and where the majority of 
compensation has already been paid out.
<P>
	This debate will remind members of Bills C-33 and C-34 as 
well as Bill C-55. These were the Yukon agreements. Alas, we 
are getting good at passing legislation on behalf of the former 
Indian affairs minister and his department.
<P>
	The circumstances behind Bill C-60 would suggest that this is 
a final step in the settlement of a specific claim brought by the 
Pictou Landing Indian band. In recent years there has been a 
great many such deals. In fact, information provided by the 
department indicates that by 1994, 632 such claims were 
received, 203 of the claims were settled and the rest are either in 
the process of settlement or have been rejected. About 20 of 
these claims have led to litigation of which the Pictou claim 
appears to be one.
<P>
	Up to the end of 1992 the federal government had contributed 
$169 million and the provinces $39 million to specific claims, 
not including treaty land entitlement settlements which are a 
particular and separate type of settlement claim.
<P>
	Specific claims arise from the alleged non-fulfilment by 
government of existing treaty or other obligations or claims 
arising from the alleged improper administration of reserve 
lands by the department. Bill C-60 would appear to address this 
latter category in that the Pictou band claimed breach of 
fiduciary duty because the department failed to obtain the 
band's informed consent before transferring riparian rights to 
the province of Nova Scotia on the Boat Harbour tidal estuary, 
which I presume is adjacent to the Pictou band reserve.
<P>
	This transfer permitted the province of Nova Scotia to use 
Boat Harbour as a facility to treat effluent from the kraft paper 
mill owned by Scott Maritimes Limited.
<P>
	The Pictou band commenced a lawsuit against the department 
of Indian affairs but a negotiated settlement gave rise to an out 
of court agreement to settle. This agreement was signed by the 
parties on July 20 of last year. The agreement provides for $35 
million in compensation. As of April of this year, some $28 
million of those moneys have been paid out and the remaining 
$7 million will be paid out by April of 1995. Twenty million of 
this money is to go into a trust fund to pay out claims to the 
Pictou band and to band members individually. The remaining 
$15 million of the total is to pay for band members to relocate 
``should it become necessary''.
<P>
	Allow me to look at these payouts more specifically. The cash 
settlements will be divided for purposes of compensation and 
mitigation as follows: $2,275,000 for band compensation and 
developments; $15 million for community development; $8 
million for individual compensation, and $9.725 million for 
continuing compensation for a total of $35 million. As I stated 
earlier, $28 million of this total has already been paid out. There 
are two terms of the agreement that require parliamentary 
approval. The first is to provide that any claims coming forward 
from band members beyond those settled by the settlement 
payments to individuals can only be made from the $9.725 
million portion which is part of the $20 million individual 
compensation and development fund.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The second requirement requiring parliamentary approval is 
to make certain that the settlement moneys are not Indian 
moneys within the meaning of the Indian Act. One might ask 
why this legislation was not tabled earlier to authorize moneys 
paid already not to be Indian moneys under the Indian Act.
<P>
	I note from the agreement that the eligible use of moneys from 
the band compensation and development account are intended to 
provide and improve individual family and community 
self-reliance and include the following: resource rehabilitation 
and development to support increased viability of traditional 
and commercial resource pursuits and other resource 
harvesting; cultural and social support and development 
initiatives; business, economic and employment development 
initiatives; community infrastructure and housing development 
and reasonable, technical, legal and management activities in 
respect of the pursuit of band goals and objectives, including the 
implementation of this agreement.
<P>
	Only time will tell how effectively these resources are used 
and if again $20 million of taxpayers money will help deliver the 
Pictou band to self-sufficiency. I understand there are currently 
425 band members, 304 of whom live on reserve.
<P>
	The individual compensation account breaks down as 
follows: $3 million has been distributed to all members of the 
band including those resident or non-resident before the 
effluent treatment system began which was away back, I believe 
in the 1960s. Another $5 million will be distributed among 
individual band members who were residents of the reserve for 
any period of time since Boat Harbour started to be used for 
treatment of effluent. This would suggest that in the latter case, 
the individual band member settlement amount would be 
approximately $16,500 per individual.
<P>
	I wonder if this will improve the self-sufficiency of these 
individual Pictou band members. I sincerely hope it has had a 
positive impact and creates a new level of existence for these 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8956"> 8956 </A></B>
<P>
	This agreement has been a fait accompli for a year and a half, 
as I said before. The bill before us asks us to ratify two specific 
aspects of the deal which I would suggest is a couple of hundred 
pages long and excludes at least 10 other sections of the 
agreement. There are some basic questions to be asked that beg 
better understanding.
<P>
	There is no way for parliamentarians to know whether the 
department officials succeeded in negotiating a deal in the best 
interests of Canada or not. It is an act of faith on our part to 
believe that this is the best possible deal for Canada. As I said, it 
is a done deal. It is a specific claim, meaning that it is specific to 
the particular circumstances of the case, unlike a comprehensive 
claim that may set a precedent for other situations. It is a one 
time deal with strict compensatory parameters.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a series of questions that arise as a consequence of 
this agreement and subsequently Bill C-60. One issue that 
comes immediately to mind is why we are here at all today. 
Usually specific claims do not require special legislation. Why 
is this agreement different?
<P>
	In the agreement it states that the department failed to obtain 
informed consent in the 1960s before proceeding with this 
project. Did the department just move unilaterally or did it at 
least get some kind of consent? It seems rather draconian to just 
move ahead on such a clearly obvious breach of rights.
<P>
	Turning to the terms of the lawsuit I cannot help but ask how 
much the band asked for and felt it was entitled to. With this 
concern comes the obvious question of why the lawsuit did not 
go to trial.
<P>
	The province of Nova Scotia and Scott Maritimes Limited 
obviously benefited and continue to benefit from using Boat 
Harbour. Perhaps these two parties should pay part of the 
compensation awarded to the band. Why should they walk away 
and have the Canadian taxpayer pay the full shot?
<P>
	This brings me full circle to my concern regarding the best 
possible deal. It has always intrigued me how we come up with 
these compensatory figures. I look forward to our review of Bill 
C-60 at committee stage. Perhaps some of my questions could 
have been answered in a briefing which the department kindly 
offered. Unfortunately, schedules and time precluded this much 
valued courtesy last week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to address the House on Bill C-60, the Pictou Landing 
Indian Band Agreement Act. I am pleased today to join my 
colleague, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, in urging hon. members to give this bill quick 
passage through the House.
<P>
	Boat Harbour has been a black eye on the face of Nova Scotia 
for a long time. The effluent from the Scott Maritimes pulp and 
paper mill at Pictou has created a  situation where there is 
chlorine, furans and dioxins in Boat Harbour to an incredible 
extent.
<P>
	This legislation is not about solving the dispute here. It is 
about fulfilling the government's commitments which it made 
in agreeing to settle the claim. My hon. friend from the Reform 
Party has asked why it did not go to trial. The fact of the matter is 
the vast majority of lawsuits in this country do not go to trial. 
They are settled before trial because the parties set out their 
claims, look at the facts, negotiate back and forth and try to 
avoid the tremendous cost which could have occurred in 
addition to the cost of settling, the tremendous cost of years of 
litigation.
<P>
	It seems that when the government had an opportunity to 
settle the matter it was wise to do so. In that situation when we 
are hiring legal counsel to represent us in a case, we seek their 
advice on what the amounts might be that the party suing might 
be able to achieve or receive in a court case and follow that 
advice.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes the provisions of Bill C-60 have 
already been accepted and are being implemented. However, the 
government undertook that it would introduce legislation in this 
House to fulfil certain commitments requested by the Pictou 
Landing Micmac Band and which were agreed to by the 
Government of Canada in the Pictou Landing settlement 
agreement.
<P>
	This does not mean this bill is not important. In fact, it is 
extremely important for three reasons. First, it will ensure the 
claims by members of the First Nations in that area related to the 
effluent treatment system at Boat Harbour are to be directed to a 
fund established for that purpose under the agreement. As a 
result, it will protect both the Government of Canada and the 
Pictou Landing Indian band from further claims by individuals, 
a very important point.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, Bill C-60 will ensure the Pictou Landing Micmac 
band is responsible for managing the settlement moneys that 
have been and will be paid out by the federal government.
<P>
	Third, this bill will confirm that the Government of Canada 
intends to live up to its commitments to aboriginal people, 
including those commitments made by previous governments. 
That is a very important point. We as a government have to live 
up to those kinds of commitments. We have to re-establish trust 
between the Government of Canada and native peoples across 
this country.
<P>
	As the minister has indicated Boat Harbour is an industrial 
effluent treatment facility operated by the province of Nova 
Scotia. It serves the nearby Scott Maritimes kraft paper mill. 
Boat Harbour is adjacent to Pictou Harbour as members from 
Nova Scotia would know and it is about 115 kilometres 
northeast of Halifax. It is much closer to Charlottetown than it is 
to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8957"> 8957 </A></B>
<P>
Halifax; it is about 30 to 40 kilometres away from Charlottetown 
across the Northumberland Strait.
<P>
	The Boat Harbour holding pond was created by blocking the 
entrance of a former tidal estuary to Northumberland Strait. 
Boat Harbour is currently surrounded by provincial crown land 
and by the Micmac band reserve.
<P>
	It is important to point out that in 1966 when the idea came up 
of creating this effluent area at Boat Harbour the local First 
Nation was not at all happy about the idea. It was only after 
intense lobbying by the province of Nova Scotia, only after it 
was assured the effect of this effluent treatment system would be 
minimal that the band agreed to its being put there.
<P>
	The point is that it was not minimal. The impact of this is 
tremendous. The pollution in Boat Harbour is unbelievable and 
certainly is far beyond what anyone would call minimal. The 
aboriginal people at Pictou Landing were definitely misled in 
this situation and are therefore entitled to redress which they 
have received through the settlement agreement.
<P>
	The damming of Boat Harbour permanently raised the level of 
the harbour and flooded approximately 12 hectares of reserve 
land. That was a bit of a surprise. The harbour itself became 
devoid of oxygen almost immediately after the treatment 
facility commenced operations.
<P>
	Over the ensuing 12 years the First Nation in that area made a 
number of representations to the Government of Nova Scotia 
seeking compensation for damage to its lands and for the 
flooding. Although the province made improvements to the 
treatment facility at that time, it stopped negotiating with the 
First Nation in 1982 and refused to recognize its claim.
<P>
	The Pictou Landing Micmac Band then entered the federal 
government's specific claims process. In 1986 the First Nation 
filed suit against the federal government alleging breach of 
fiduciary duty.
<P>
	It appeared they certainly had some grounds for making those 
allegations and for launching that suit. That of course is why the 
last government eventually settled, but it would seem to me that 
it had good reason to settle. An out of court settlement was 
finalized in the summer of 1993.
<P>
	In addition to setting up programs to monitor the 
environmental and health impacts of the effluent treatment 
system, the government agreed to pay the Pictou Landing 
Micmac Band and its members $20 million in compensation. 
Out of this amount $3 million was to be distributed to all 
members of the First Nation regardless of whether they lived on 
or off the reserve. An additional $5 million was to be distributed 
among members of the First Nation who have lived on the 
reserve during the period of time the Boat Harbour facility has 
operated.
<P>
	Also under this agreement a continuing compensation fund 
has been established to take care of special loss claims by 
members of the First Nation which would have arisen from the 
Boat Harbour problems. A total of $9.725 million has been 
allocated to this fund.
<P>
	A further amount of $2.275 million was designated to 
compensate the First Nation for general impacts associated with 
Boat Harbour and to support worthy projects for the benefit of 
the First Nation.
<P>
	In addition to the $20 million compensation, a $15 million 
community development trust fund has been set up and is now 
being administered by the Pictou Landing Micmac Band. These 
funds are available should members of the First Nation need to 
relocate in future in order to protect themselves from any 
possible future health hazards. I can imagine that if I were living 
next to a huge pond filled with chlorine, dioxins and furans, I 
might well consider moving and relocating too.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	At a future date if Canada and the First Nation agree the 
moneys in the community development trust fund are no longer 
needed for that purpose the funds will be applied for other First 
Nation purposes. Both sides have to agree first.
<P>
	In signing this agreement the Pictou Landing Micmac Band 
released Canada from responsibility and liability for past, 
present and future effects related to the Boat Harbour effluent 
treatment system.
<P>
	The First Nation is also giving over to Canada all of its rights 
for possible legal action against Nova Scotia or Scott Maritimes 
related to Boat Harbour. This agreement does not mean that 
there will never be any claims made against the province or 
against Scott Maritimes. In fact we have been working with the 
province of Nova Scotia. Along with our urging and working 
with the province it is now spending $17 million to solve the 
problem, to improve the situation in terms of pollution impact at 
Boat Harbour which I think is a major accomplishment.
<P>
	The settlement agreement was signed in July last year. Since 
then implementation has been proceeding well. Nevertheless 
this government still has work to do to fulfil its commitments 
under this agreement. That is why we are debating this bill 
today.
<P>
	Specifically at the request of the First Nation the government 
agreed to introduce legislation to this House to fulfil certain 
commitments and provisions of the Pictou Landing Indian Band 
agreement. We are meeting this commitment through Bill C-60. 
Now it is up to hon. members to ensure that the honour of the 
crown is upheld by supporting this legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8958"> 8958 </A></B>
<P>
	In the Pictou Landing settlement agreement it was agreed that 
Canada would propose legislation to ensure two things: first, 
that the settlement funds will be the sole source of 
compensation for claims by members of the First Nation related 
to the Boat Harbour treatment system; second, that the 
settlement moneys are not to be considered Indian moneys 
under the meaning of the Indian Act.
<P>
	These objectives will be achieved through Bill C-60 which is 
an administrative bill that imposes no additional obligations on 
the Government of Canada. This legislation ensures that any 
claims by members of the First Nation beyond those already 
settled by payments to individuals can only be made against the 
$9.725 million continuing compensation fund. This in turn will 
ensure that the settlement amount of $35 million is the full and 
final amount that the Government of Canada will pay with 
respect to this settlement.
<P>
	Bill C-60 will also protect the First Nation against similar 
types of claims by limiting the claims of the members of the 
First Nation to the continuing compensation fund.
<P>
	The provision that settlement moneys will not be considered 
Indian moneys as defined by the Indian Act is also important. 
First and foremost it will ensure that the intent of the agreement 
is met with respect to the Pictou Landing Micmac Band having 
complete control over the settlement moneys. Moreover the 
federal government will have no further liability or 
responsibility regarding these funds, which funds at the First 
Nation's request have been placed within a trust established 
pursuant to the settlement agreement.
<P>
	The settlement agreement separates the resolution of the First 
Nation's lawsuit from any decisions regarding the future of the 
Boat Harbour treatment facility. Nevertheless the settlement 
agreement does require Canada to explore ways which might 
yield a solution to the environmental problem. That is very 
important.
<P>
	Toward this end several federal departments are facilitating 
and working with the Pictou Landing Micmac Band and other 
concerned parties to achieve the rehabilitation of Boat Harbour. 
In fact the Department of the Environment is monitoring the 
Boat Harbour effluent system very carefully under the pulp and 
paper effluent regulations. The Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans is also involved in monitoring the system there for its 
effects on the local fishing habitat.
<P>
	I want to advise hon. members that the federal government is 
committed to ensuring the cleanup of Boat Harbour meets 
Canada's high environmental standards. This legislation will 
have no impact on this process. It will not get in the way.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	As a party to the final agreement, the Pictou Landing Micmac 
Band has clearly indicated it wants and expects this legislation 
to be enacted.
<P>
	To ensure that Bill C-60 meets with its understanding of a 
settlement agreement, the First Nation was consulted during the 
drafting of the legislation. Members of the First Nation are now 
awaiting Parliament's decision. They have seen the bill. They 
like it and want to see it completed. It makes sense and fulfils the 
terms of the agreement as the government sees it and as the band 
sees it.
<P>
	In making our decision on this bill, I would ask my hon. 
colleagues to keep the crown's honour in mind. I would ask them 
to remember that the legislation in this case is the product of a 
clear and genuine commitment which was made at the request of 
the Pictou Landing Micmac Band more than a year ago.
<P>
	I would also remind hon. members that the government's 
word was accepted by the First Nation in good faith despite the 
problems it has endured over the past 25 years. I would not 
blame them for not taking the government's word after what 
they have gone through in this country. We have an obligation to 
ensure that this First Nation's trust in government is 
well-founded. We must demonstrate to all First Nations across 
Canada that the federal government will indeed live up to its 
commitments to aboriginal people.
<P>
	There is no reason to delay action on this legislation. The 
intent of this legislation is reasonable and honourable. It is time 
to put this legislation into effect so that members of the Pictou 
Landing Micmac Band can concentrate on building a healthy 
future for their children and their communities. With that in 
mind, I urge my hon. colleagues to give their unqualified 
support to Bill C-60.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member seems to have a lot of 
knowledge about this agreement. My questions relate to the 
situation at the reserve and adjacent to Boat Harbour itself.
<P>
	Are the conditions such that the member would anticipate a 
significant number of members from the reserve would actually 
choose to relocate? If they do choose to relocate is there a 
provision within the agreement that specifies a time frame by 
which they must exercise that option? In other words, is there a 
window that closes within I believe it is the $9.725 million 
allocated amount?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Madam Speaker, I certainly do not feel it is fair to 
say that I am an expert by any means. It is kind of the hon. 
member to say that I seem to have a lot of knowledge about this 
agreement but I think that is perhaps overstated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8959"> 8959 </A></B>
<P>
	However, it is fair to say that if I were living next to Boat 
Harbour which is filled with chlorines, dioxins and furans that 
I would certainly be considering moving or relocating, 
particularly if the problem were not solved quickly. One of the 
key things is what the province and other parties are doing 
which is working on solving the problem that is occurring.
<P>
	With respect to the $9.725 million fund for relocation, as I 
understand it if there comes a point where there is a feeling that 
it is not going to be used, then the federal government and the 
band can come agree to change its use, but only in the case where 
both parties agree. Therefore, there is not a date per se but there 
is a provision that agreement is required from both parties in 
order to make that change.
<P>
	I hope that answers the hon. member's questions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Prior to calling the 
question it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform 
the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Drummond-Blood supply system; the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans-MIL Davie Shipyard; the 
hon. member for Davenport-Nuclear weapons; the hon.

	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> That is an excellent suggestion, Madam Speaker.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask the parliamentary secretary, as I did the 
minister last week, whether he can assure us that Canada will 
vote for a socially and environmentally responsible resolution 
that is going to come before the United Nations General 
Assembly.
<P>
	The background to this resolution is as follows. It is a 
resolution that is asking the international court of justice for an 
opinion on whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons is ever 
justified.
<P>
	When the vote came up in the first committee, as I understand 
it, Canada abstained. Tonight I want to tell the parliamentary 
secretary that I am ashamed of the fact that Canada decided to 
abstain from the vote, considering its fine, long and historical 
record particularly highlighted and developed over time by 
Prime Minister Pearson and followed in his footsteps by Prime 
Minister Trudeau. We have a tremendous reputation in the 
international community and we cannot abstain on such an 
important vote.
<P>
	Let me also inform the House that in Canada there are about 
100 national and regional groups supporting the resolution, 
including professional organizations such as Physicians for 
Global Survival, Lawyers for Social Responsibility, Project 
Ploughshares and the like.
<P>
	In addition, city councils such as those in St. John's, Toronto, 
Vancouver and Victoria have passed motions in support of the 
resolution. This resolution was put forward at the United 
Nations by Indonesia on behalf of a large group of non-aligned 
nations. For the life of me I cannot understand why Canada 
cannot identify itself with non-aligned nations on a method that 
is related to nuclear arms and support this resolution to go to the 
International Court of Justice.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Surely our record is such that it should remove any doubt, any 
uncertainty and move us away from abstaining and vote in 
favour of this motion.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am looking forward to the reply of the 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs I respond to my colleague from Davenport.
<P>
	At the United Nations on November 18, 1994 countries voted 
on a resolution which was presented before the UN disarmament 
committee. The resolution called for the International Court of 
Justice to rule on the question of the legality of the threat of use 
of nuclear weapons.
<P>
	Canada abstained on the resolution and gave an explanation 
for its vote which made clear that while Canada endorses in 
principle the objective of the resolution, that is the eventual 
elimination of nuclear weapons, it did not agree that this was the 
most effective means of achieving that goal.
<P>
	The government has and continues to attach particular 
importance to international arms control and disarmament. We 
are working actively in international fora on such issues as 
START I and START II, the ongoing reduction talks, the 
extension of the non-proliferation treaty and and the negotiation 
of a comprehensive test ban treaty.
<P>
	Canada also vigorously supports international negotiations to 
prevent the transfer of nuclear weapons technology and 
materials, to reduce and eventually eliminate existing stocks 
and to ban the production of fissile materials.
<P>
	Canada is concerned that some states may use the reference to 
the International Court of Justice as a means to prevent or delay 
decisions on these international initiatives on the basis that the 
larger issue of the legality of nuclear weapons was being dealt 
with in another forum.
<P>
	We believe that the negotiation of and adherence to binding 
multilateral treaties is a more effective approach to the ultimate 
elimination of nuclear weapons than an advisory opinion of the 
International Court of Justice.
<P>
	In addition, Canada was concerned that this resolution could 
place the International Court of Justice in a difficult situation. It 
is possible that the credibility of the court could be harmed if it 
were to rule that nuclear weapons were illegal and the 
permanent members of the UN Security Council who currently 
possess such weapons were forced to ignore it.
<P>
	Finally the International Court of Justice already has before it 
the similar proposition following a reference to the court by the 
World Health Assembly. A second reference does not appear to 
be necessary.
<P>
	The decision of the government to abstain on this matter in the 
company of only Norway among NATO countries, is an 
indication that we are prepared to accept different approaches to 
meeting the challenges at hand.
<P>
	The resolution will be before the United Nations plenary on 
December 15, 1994 and Canada will abstain for the same 
reasons.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 37(3) I rise to get a 
more in-depth answer to questions I posed to the Prime Minister 
on December 8.
<P>
	At that time I asked the Prime Minister, now that Canadians 
had been released, if the government would align with France's 
position and use this opportunity to withdraw our troops.
<P>
	I further asked the Prime Minister if the government wished 
to reassure Canadians now that the hostages were free by 
withdrawing our troops.
<P>
	As we all know, this is a very serious situation. The answers 
we have been getting from the government have praised the 
work the Canadian troops have been doing in the former 
Yugoslavia. I concur with those statements. I agree that they are 
the best trained troops in the world. They were put in a very 
difficult situation and they have done a superb job under the 
conditions.
<P>
	Looking at the events over the past few days it would do us all 
well to review exactly what has been happening in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	UN forces have had to put up with being shot at, humiliated 
and harassed to support the UNPROFOR mission. We are 
rapidly approaching the point where because of the danger, 
humiliation and harassment, the UN forces can no longer 
accomplish their mandate.
<P>
	A UN spokesman, Michael Williams, said that the events last 
week point to an ``extremely disturbing pattern'' of Serbs 
directly targeting UN forces. He cited a series of incidents. First, 
two Spanish soldiers were injured near Mostar when they came 
under Bosnian Serb shelling. Second, three days in a row 
unarmed Ukrainian and British UN military observers patrolling 
on foot were shot at in the eastern Muslim enclave of Gorazde 
which is encircled by the Serbs. Third, a Norwegian observation 
post near near Tuzla in northeast Bosnia was fired on with 
mortar rounds last Wednesday and earlier in the day a nearby 
Norwegian observation post was destroyed by Serb shelling.
<P>
	The UN spokesman Michael Williams went on to say: ``This 
sort of outrageous behaviour clearly will affect the sort of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8961"> 8961 </A></B>
<P>
reappraisal and reassessment of UNPROFOR, which is 
obviously going on in many nation capitals. I think there is a 
limit to what peacekeeping troops can be subjected to and forced 
to endure''.
<P>
	Over the past weekend, on Saturday, a Danish convoy of fuel 
tankers was hijacked reportedly by Bosnian Serbs and a French 
fuel convoy was turned back outside Sarajevo after it was 
refused entry. Two Dutch communication vehicles were 
hijacked along with their satellite equipment. The Serbs refused 
permission for the plane carrying the UN commander in Bosnia, 
British Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, to land at the 
Sarajevo airport. That was just yesterday.
<P>
	The Serbs have even said quite straightforwardly that they 
would no longer allow UN armoured personnel carriers to escort 
aid convoys through the 70 per cent of the country they control. 
Aid workers said that they could not work without UN 
protection.
<P>
	All of this leads us down the road to ask the serious question: 
What are the UNPROFOR troops doing in Bosnia? The UN 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali said last week in 
Montreal that a decision to withdraw peacekeepers would have 
to be made by countries that sent them. In other words, Canada, 
France, Britain and Ukraine would have to decide themselves 
whether they would give up their sovereign right to protect their 
citizens who are sent to these war torn areas and that decision 
should not be made by someone else. Indeed, it has to be made 
by the country.
<P>
	There are a couple of red herrings that I want to get out of the 
way because we have heard them several times. The first is the 
lifting of the arms embargo. What would that mean to the 
UNPROFOR mission? We have witnessed on television that 
heavy arms are throughout Bosnia at this point in time. In fact, 
newspaper reports are saying that 40 per cent of Bosnia is now 
covered with surface to air missiles. We have also seen that the 
troops are unable to move.
<P>
	Regarding this arms embargo, the Prime Minister said that if 
the arms embargo is lifted, our troops will come out. It is indeed 
a fact that there are arms getting into Bosnia now. How effective 
then is the arms embargo? I would say that it is not effective at 
all at this point, with the exception of what is happening on the 
Adriatic Sea. Certainly there are arms getting into the Sarajevo 
airport and being distributed to the belligerent forces.
<P>
	I have come to the end of my time. I would like to hear from 
the parliamentary secretary maybe a little more on the question 
that I asked the Prime Minister regarding aligning with France's 
position and also some comments that would reassure the 
Canadian public that we are indeed moving to-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to tell you this is a very serious subject 
as Christmas approaches and our peacekeepers are in a foreign 
land doing peace operations. I certainly respect the viewpoint of 
the hon. member.
<P>
	I have to tell you, Madam Speaker and I am sure the hon. 
member would not mind sharing this with me that he along with 
the hon. member for Perth-Wellington-Waterloo spent some 
time in ex-Yugoslavia.
<P>
	We have some feeling for what we are all talking about. It may 
differ on all sides of the House. I will not get political about this. 
The hon. member talked about the peacekeepers and the arms 
embargo. I have a son who is in the arms embargo business. He is 
a combat systems engineer at HMCS <I>Toronto</I>. As the hon. 
member knows, he and I worked at Halifax on the <I>Preserver</I>. He 
wants to come home for Christmas. He understands why he is 
there.
<P>
	I will say to the hon. member we met other people. I will not 
mention my constituents because that could be misconstrued. I 
will mention classmates of my son: Andrew Napper, Rob 
Stoney, Colin Blais, and Stephen Brown who met us at the 
aircraft that took us from Zagreb to Sarajevo. It was an 
interesting flight. We were not sure if we were going to make it. 
They understand why they are there.
<P>
	I want to set the record straight. The hon. member on 
September 21 talked about the committee that we both served 
on, and I may say to his constituents he served honourably and 
well. I want to remind the hon. member of what he said. I am 
sure my hon. colleague will remember this. He said: ``What 
makes this defence committee report so important? The 
committee spent months hearing testimony by Canadians from 
all walks of life. Hundreds of testimonies have been heard in the 
presentation''.
<P>
	This is what the hon. member signed his name to. As a 
committee we have stated clearly our conviction that Canada's 
interest and responsibilities extend beyond our borders. These 
are true matters in defence and security as in the economics 
sphere.
<P>
	I do not want to throw this at the member. I know that he 
comes from a serious motivation. He did quote what France did. 
I am now quoting what he said as a member of a Canadian 
organization which was the first time in 60 years that Canadians 
have had their politicians go and ask the question of Canadians: 
``What do you want to do in defence?''
<P>
	He would have to agree with me that they said: ``You should 
continue to do what you are doing''. We may have to change at 
some time but at this particular point in time our Prime Minister 
has said: ``We believe that we should stay''.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member, as most of our colleagues, would 
respect that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
